    concept of IoT caught attention in 1999, by means of Auto-ID center at MIT and
    its relevant market investigation publications. Basically, IoT is an integration
    of multiple devices which communicate, sense and interact with their internal
    and external states through the embedded technology that IoT contain [1]. IoT
    has become the megatrend for next generation technologies which can impact the
    whole business spectrum with extended benefits which are advanced connectivity
    of end devices, system and services. IoT offers appropriate solutions for multiple
    applications such as smart health care, smart cities, security, retail, traffic
    congestion industrial control and agriculture [3]. A significant amount of work
    has been done regarding IoT technology in agricultural area to develop smart farming
    solutions [4]. IoT has brought a great revolution in agriculture environment by
    examining multiple complications and challenges in farming [5]. Now a days, with
    the advancement of technology it has been expected that by using IoT agriculturalists
    and technologists are finding out the solution of those problems which farmer
    are facing such as shortages of water, cost management and productivity issues
    [6], [7]. State-of-the-art IoT technologies have detected all these issues and
    provide solutions to increase productivity while lowering the cost. Efforts made
    on wireless sensors networks enable us to collect data from sensing devices and
    send it to the main servers [8]. Data collected through sensors gives information
    about different environmental condition to monitor the whole system properly.
    Monitoring the environmental conditions or crop productivity is not only the factor
    for the evaluation of crop but there are many other factors which effect the crops’
    productivity, e.g. field management, soil and crop monitoring, movement of an
    unwanted object, attacks of wild animals, and thefts etc. [9], [10]. Moreover,
    IoT provides a well-organized scheduling of restricted resources which makes sure
    that the best use of IoT enhances the productivity. Figure 1 shows a schematic
    diagram showing the agricultural trends which provide easy and cost effective
    interactions through a secure and unblemished connectivity across individual Greenhouse,
    Livestock, Farmer, and Field monitoring. Whereby, the IoT agricultural networks
    using the wireless devices enable real time crop and animal monitoring. The figure
    shows that two sensor kits (Libelium Smart Agriculture Xtreme IoT Vertical Kit
    and Crop/Plant Monitoring Sensor Kit) have been implemented which monitor the
    soil moisture, leaf wetness, temperature, humidity, productivity, and air flow.
    While, MooMonitor sensor monitors the animal health, fertility, feeding, ruminating
    and resting. The agricultural servers, gateways, and agriculture database play
    an important role to store agriculture records and provide on demand agricultural
    services to authorized users. FIGURE 1. Agricultural trends. Show All As a whole,
    in agriculture field there are multiple applications, protocols and prototypes.
    IoT agriculture research trends include network platform, network architecture,
    applications, security, and challenges among others [28]–[30]. Moreover, in many
    countries and organizations over globe different IoT policies and guidelines have
    been implemented in agriculture field. However in IoT agricultural environment
    a reasonable amount of work has been done and there is a need of thorough study
    on IoT in agriculture context to understand the current research status. To transform
    agriculture technologies via IoT innovation this paper analyzes various issues
    and trends in IoT smart farming. In this research as a contribution following
    IoT agricultural techniques have been added from literature: Present major components
    of IoT based smart farming along with relevant technologies in Section II. Section
    III presents a rigorous discussion on network architecture of IoT that involves
    network architecture and layers, network topologies used; and devices and protocols
    used in agriculture IoT. Different application domains and relevant smart phone
    and sensor based applications have been discussed in Section IV. The security
    and privacy issues in IoT based agriculture have been discussed in Section V.
    The industrial trends have been discussed in Section VI that provides the details
    related to top technology industries investing in this area. The IoT agricultural
    policies made by different countries for the standardization of IoT based agriculture
    have been discussed in Section VII. This section also presents few success stories
    in this area. Lastly, the open issues and challenges to improve IoT based agricultural
    technologies from many aspects have been presented in Section VIII. SECTION II.
    Major Components and Relevant Technologies for IoT Based Smart Farming A. Major
    Components of IoT Based Smart Farming IoT based smart farming consist of four
    major components as shown in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Major components of IoT based
    smart farming. Show All These four major components are physical structure, data
    acquisition, data processing, and data analytics. The physical structure is the
    most important factor for precision agriculture to avoid any unwanted happening.
    Whole system is designed in such a way which controls the sensors, actuators,
    and devices. A sensor performs multiple tasks like soil sensing, temperature sensing,
    weather sensing, light sensing, and moisture sensing. Similarly devices perform
    many control functions like, node discovery, device identification and naming
    services etc. All these functions are performed by any device or sensor which
    is controlled through a microcontroller. This controlling operation is performed
    by any remote device or a computer which is connected through the Internet. Data
    Acquisition is further divided into two sub components namely: IoT data acquisition
    and standard data acquisition. Whereby, the IoT data acquisition component consists
    of seven protocols that are Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Websocket,
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Node, Constrained Application Protocol
    (CoAP), Data Distribution Service (DDS), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Depending on the requirements and condition more protocols can be used for the
    implementation of smart farming. Whereas, in the standard data acquisition ZigBee,
    WIFI, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoraWan), SigFox and ISOBUS protocols have
    been used. Data processing consists of multiple features that are image or video
    processing, data loading, decision support system, and data mining as shown in
    Figure 2. According to the system requirements any feature may be added that may
    work in parallel to provide other services. Data analytics consists of two main
    features that are monitoring and controlling. Monitoring involves three main application
    in smart agriculture that are Live Stock Monitoring, Field Monitoring, and Green
    house Monitoring. IoT enables farmers to monitor livestock via multiple sensors
    which are used to monitor different animal’s diseases like temperature, heart
    rate, and digestion etc [11]. Whereas field monitoring applications intend to
    report different conditions of field like soil richness, temperature, humidity,
    gas, pressure (air pressure and water pressure), and crop disease monitoring [12],
    [13]. A smart greenhouse design eliminates the manual intervention and measures
    different climate parameters by intelligent IoT devices and sensors according
    to plants requirements [14]–[16]. B. Iotagricultural Relevant Technologies A Large
    number of technologies are being used in IoT agricultural solutions due to which
    it is hard to make an explicit of all those due to which our discussion focused
    on several core technologies which have played a vital role to modernize the IoT
    agricultural services. 1) Cloud and Edge Computing Collaboration of IoT and cloud
    computing in agriculture provides pervasive access to shared resources. To meet
    various agricultural needs upon request over network and execute operations cloud
    computing plays vital role [17]. Cloud based software architecture has been proposed
    which process and retrieve information and agricultural tasks in a more accurate
    way [18], [19]. In the field of IoT edge computing is considered as a solution
    to facilitate data processing at the source of data generation which are sensors,
    actuators and many other embedded devices. Edge computing or fog computing are
    measured as the backbone of cloud computing. This technology is deployed according
    to the features and requirements of smart farming [20]. 2) Big Data Analytics
    and Machine Learning Big data consist of a large amount of essential which are
    generated by agricultural sensors. Big data analysis provides different and efficient
    crop monitoring methods at different stages [21]. A good systematic review on
    big data analysis in agriculture has been presented [22]. Neural networks are
    very famous because they provide optimal solutions at a very high speed. Intrusion
    detection has been realized by using advance principles and technology of neural
    network. On the other hand most important feature of neural network is that they
    provide detection module and data training [23]. By using deep neural networks
    an IoT based hydroponic system has been developed [24]. 3) Communication Networks
    and Protocols IoT agricultural network consist of different kinds of long ranges
    and short ranges networks for communications. Several IoT networks technologies
    help to design a crop or field monitoring sensors and devices [25]. Communication
    protocols are the backbone of IoT agricultural network system and applications
    [26]. They are used to exchange all agricultural data or information over the
    network. 4) Robotics Multiple Agribots have been developed for the purpose of
    smart farming which are minimizing the amount of farmers by increasing the speed
    of work through advance techniques. Agribots performs elementary functions like
    weeding, spraying and sowing etc. All these robots are controlled by using IoT
    to increase the crop productivity and efficient resource utilization. A multi
    sensor robotics approach has been proposed for characterization and ground mapping
    [27]. SECTION III. IoT Agricultural Networks IoT agricultural network or IoT network
    for agriculture is one of the vital elements of IoT in agriculture. It helps to
    monitor agriculture data and facilitate the transmission and reception of agriculture
    data. As shown in Figure 3, the framework consists of IoT agricultural network
    architecture, IoT agricultural network platform and IoT agricultural network topologies
    and protocols. FIGURE 3. IoT agricultural network. Show All A. IoT Agricultural
    Neworkt Architecture The IoT agricultural network is the main factor of IoT in
    agriculture field [31]. IoT Agricultural network architecture suggests an outline
    for the specification of an IoT agricultural network physical elements as well
    as their working principles, and techniques. Most of the IoT applications usually
    follow the four layer architecture (Network Layer, Application layer, Physical
    and Mac Layer and Transport Layer) due to the popularity and interoperability
    of IP as suggested by Naik [32]. After reviewing these four layers protocol we
    have also survey two more approaches that are IPv6 and 6LoWPAN as shown in Figure
    4. This layer is the final level of abstraction which allows the development of
    multiple user applications. At this layer deployed communication protocols monitor
    different agricultural parameters such as weather information, soil moisture values,
    irrigation monitoring etc. FIGURE 4. Layer structure of the 6LoWPAN. Show All
    1) Application Layer Due to the energy constraints and stringent computation involved
    by the IoT devices there are many lightweight protocols on application layer such
    as CoAP, MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP. These protocols can be increased or decreased according
    to the system requirement. CoAP protocol runs on UDP and works on the principle
    of request or response architecture [33]. AMQP protocol runs over the TCP protocol
    by following publish/subscribe architecture asynchronously and use TSL/SSL for
    security assurance. MQTT is a bandwidth-efficient protocol which uses little battery
    power and designed for receiving and transmitting sensor information [34]. HTTP
    is a well known web messaging protocol which based on the request/response architecture
    [35]. Runs over TCP and does not define any QoS, uses TSL/SSL for security purpose.
    2) Transport Layer This layer is also called host to host transport layer, and
    is directly transferred from IP to IoT domain. The main task of network layer
    is to collect and encapsulate the agricultural information which is obtained through
    sensor layer. There are two protocols that are transmission control protocol (TCP)
    and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP is a connection oriented protocol which
    ensures the reliability of delivered data. TCP data transmission speed is low
    as compare to UDP. UDP is a connection less protocol which does not ensure reliability
    of data. Its data transmission speed is high as compared to TCP. Both of these
    protocols are used in different applications because their choices depend upon
    the requirements of application. 3) Network Layer This layer is an indispensable
    technology for precision farming and responsible to transmit agricultural information
    at application layer. IP is the major choice with the existing two versions that
    are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 came into existence due to increasing the large number
    of addressable devices. Whereas, invention of IPv6 was expected which gradually
    establish on all networking devices. Routing protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) is considered as the main protocol while applying routing on 6LoWPAN
    [36]. RPL consist of distance vector routing protocol which uses Destination Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG) to specify routes. To support different flows
    of traffic RPL modify itself according to network speed and acknowledge routing
    metrics such as status of the battery used in device, link quality, and higher
    computational cost exchange. 4) Adaptation Layer Adaptation Layer (AL) aim is
    to ensure the interoperability, and implement fragmentation, compression and reassembly
    mechanism. Although AL attained many advances but still there is a complexity
    for IPv6 supporting because its direct use on IoT devices is not considered reasonable.
    Usually clashes were seen with constraints which are associated with IoT devices.
    That’s why, 6LoWPAN made a big effort in order to decrease the limitations of
    IPv6 and make it suitable for IoT devices. Sensors and devices use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN
    to transmit data over IEEE 802.15.4 protocol in IoT agricultural network. 5) Physical
    and Mac Layers This is the bottom most layer in agriculture network archichture
    which is responsible to sense and actuate different agricultural parametrs. Within
    physical and MAC layer IEEE 802.15.4 is one of the most popular standard which
    was designed for low cost, low consumption and low complexity [37]. This standard
    was adopted by many protocols like Wireless HART, ZigBee and ISA100. IEEE802.15.4
    mainly operates in ISM band of 2.4 GHz. Furthermore, it also operate 915 MHz (in
    United Nations of American) 868 MHz (in European countries) and supports up to
    250 kbps data rates. However literature shows some significant limitation of later
    approaches, which are regarding to mobility and network formation [38]. EPC-Global
    (designed for RFID technologies) [39] and Z-wave (particularly designed for domotics)
    [40] have also been used as alternative of IEEE 802.15.4 to exchange information
    directly from internt protocol (IP). B. IoT Agricultural Network Platform IoT
    agricultural network platform refers to both the big data analytics model and
    cloud model. 1) Big Data Analytics Big data analysis applied to find out the required
    and meaningful information from the large amount of data from different data formates.
    The crop disease control and crop growth models build on the basis of farm data.
    Big data analysis also provides decision support services to farmers for crop
    productivity and optimal cost analysis. Figure 5 shows IoT agricultural network
    platform based on big data analytics. The proposed network platform consists of
    six components namely: i) Farmer/User experience, ii) Big Data analysis, iii)
    Sensing and monitoring, iv) Storage services, v) Communication protocols, and
    vi) Physical implementations. This platform provides access to the IoT backbone,
    and helps collecting information about soil fertility, weather conditioning, moisturization,
    and online crop monitoring etc. FIGURE 5. IoT agricultural network platform based
    on big data analysis. Show All a: Farmer Experience Farmer experience layer is
    designed to help the farmers to monitor crop productivity in multiple ways such
    as, for effective growth of crops farmers are awared by identifying the appropriateness
    of fertile selection. Climate conditions, crops growth conditions, soil quality,
    or cattle health monitoring helps the farmers to track the state of their business
    and mitigate the lower production risks. b: Predictive Analysis This analysis
    makes the whole environment smarter by the combination of smart farming market
    intelligence and IoT technology. The major task of predictive analysis is to analyze,
    explore and process the agricultural information for digital awareness. Predictive
    analysis is made to check the probabilistic chance of crop productivity up to
    the next season. Here different detecting devices are applied to check the, Crop
    disease, weather conditions, and estimate the profit/loss on the basis of crop
    productivity. Predictive analysis facilitates the farm to understand the optimal
    time for planting & harvesting and various farm management techniques. c: Multicultural
    Analysis Elaborates the multiple forms of agriculture. In this analysis big data
    analysis minimize the risk of crop destruction according to scientific ways. To
    enhance the growth rate of water featured Botanic Aquaculture layer is equipped
    with big data. Other multicultural techniques like Citriculture, Horticulture
    and Floriculture avail direct benefits when enabled with big data analysis. It
    is helpful for decision making related to crop or plants seasonal growth, and
    pest control. Vermiculture is used for the cultivation of earthworms. Arboriculture
    is basically used for the cultivation of woody plants. Olericulture is an application
    which is used for the prediction and measure the growth rate of different vegetables.
    d: Sensing and Monitoring Sensing and monitoring analysis is made by applying
    different sensing and monitoring devices. Sensors sense data and store the crop
    disease information. Data which is processed through multiple resources is automatically
    achieved by sensing layer. Ststistical analysis has been made on data received
    from sensors in order to actuate the disease. Farmers obtain necessary information
    such as ph value, temperature, soil moisture and humidity through web and message
    service. Real time image and video monitoring on data helps the farmer to gat
    timely and accurate information. e: Communication Protocols Communication protocols
    collect and encapsulate agricultural data. To process and transmit data by using
    these protocols have been considered as the nerve center of IoT in agriculture.
    These protocols consist of internet related technologies like WIFI, LoraWan and
    Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technologies. ZigBee is considered as the
    main enabler for communication over long distances when third party service providers
    such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), CDMA or Global System for Mobile (GSM) are
    not available. f: Storage Services Farmers’ store crop related information to
    make better analysis in future and use stored information in multiple seasons
    for more productivity. g: Physical Implementations Multiple sensors, different
    types of actuators and microcontrollers are implemented physically to monitore
    different agricultural applications. Many other network equipments also implemented
    at physical layer like switches, routers and gateways are included. At this layer
    whole environmental conditions are sensed and then actuate according to a predefined
    instructions. Microcontroller plays the supervisor role and performs networking
    related operations and some other functionality which are done by sensors and
    actuators. An IoT based functional frame work is shown in figure 6. The functional
    framework shows that how agriculturists and farmers can access multiple databases
    with the assistance of support layer from application layer. Business layer contains
    all necessary operation which are important for any IoT farm. Data acquisition
    layer provides connection with session layer through IoT protocols like MQTT,
    AMQP and COAP etc. FIGURE 6. Functional framework for an agricultural information
    service model. Show All 2) Cloud Infrastructure Cloud provides a large amount
    of storage through large virtualized servers which are connected together to perform
    necessary action. A cloud based IoT design has been presented in [41] for precision
    farming. In which IoT techniques are applied to analyze and manage data from farms
    through sensors and devices to generate information for decision making. Design
    recommendations for IoT agricultural network on the basis of Cloud is shown in
    Figure 7. FIGURE 7. IoT agricultural network platform based on cloud. Show All
    Platform has been proposed on the basis of four layers which are Cloud Storage,
    Gateway, Fog Computing and hardware modules. Cloud storage layer centerlized the
    all agricultural related data such as weather related, soil, fertilization, crop
    and agricultural marketing in the cloud and provides on demand resources through
    networked infrastructure. Analyics resources and web services are also installed
    on cloud or internet which are accessible by cloud services. Most of the devices
    or sensors are not designed in such a way which can connect with internet for
    the purpose of data sharing. To resolve this data sharing problem local gateways
    are designed which act as bridge between all hardware devices and sensors for
    connectivity, security and controllability. Implementation of gateway in greenhouse
    or field improves the ability of automation and control the real time greenhouse
    monitoring system. Hardware modules and cloud services are distributed whereas
    resources are integrated through fog computing. Fog computing reduces the computational
    load of cloud and ensures the real time processing. Basic purpose of fog computing
    in this proposed network platform is to leverage the on demand scalability of
    cloud computing resources by taking the advantage of both cloud and edge computing.
    In hardware modules multiple actuators, sensors, microcontrollers and central
    processing unit have been implemented to monitor and sense various agricultural
    variables. Hardware modules are distributed in global or local networks and used
    to create services or processes. For the implementation of smart farming fast
    response time and capability to exchange information is necessary. Both of these
    requirements (fast response time and capability to exchange information) are fulfilled
    by two protocols that are Representational State Transfer (REST) and Message Queuing
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Instead of using big data center distributed system
    is more effective for smart farming because it breaks up large computation into
    easy and smaller tasks like: Crop, Temperature, nutrients, energy, climate, moisture
    of soil etc. C. IoT Agricultural Network Topology and Protocols IoT agricultural
    network topology shows the arrangement of multiple elements of an IoT Agricultural
    network and represents an ideal scenario for smart farming. Figure 8 described
    how heterogeneous computing grid collects necessary sensor data by using multiple
    sensing devices such as moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor,
    gas sensor, ph sensor, ultra violet sensor etc and forms an IoT agricultural network
    topology. FIGURE 8. Conceptual illustration of IoT-based ubiquitous agricultural
    solutions. Show All This ubiquitous Agricultural solution transforms the storage
    capacity of multiple electronic devices like Smartphone, Laptops, and agricultural
    terminals into hybrid computing grids. Figure 9 visualize a scenario in which
    multiple crop parameters are monitored by implementing agricultural devices and
    sensors in all over the field. FIGURE 9. Farm remote monitoring in agriculture.
    Show All Sensed data is then analyzed and stored, and stored data from multiple
    sensors and devices becomes useful for aggregation. On the basis of aggregation
    and analysis agriculturists/farmer can monitor the different crop variables in
    all over the field from anywhere. Moreover, topology consists of a proper network
    configuration for the streaming of agricultural videos. For example figure 9 support
    the streaming of pests via an interconnected network with an internet protocol
    (IP), GSM, WiMAX and access service network gateway. 1) Low Power WSN Topology
    Figure 10 shows a topology in which low power wireless sensor network has been
    designed to monitor and control the various farming factors. In this topology
    ZigBee is being used for data transmission which consists of multiple end devices
    and router to propagate the information on larger distances. End devices which
    are scattered in the field consist of different kind of sensors such as temperature,
    gas, humidity, soil, Motion detector, PH, UV, PIR sensors and a microcontroller.
    FIGURE 10. Low power WSN topology. Show All End devices are directly connected
    to the router and controller, where controller communicates with base station
    by using serial port to analyze the received information. According to software
    monitoring perspective each end device is properly initialized and attached sensors
    are activated in an appropriate way. Once the sensors are activated then each
    device follows the router to connect in the same way according to which they have
    been designed. After confirmation end device may connect to the WSN by using identical
    key. Data which is collected through sensors is send to the base station which
    takes analysis on received data. When the sensors attached with end devices are
    being read then data is transmitted via ZigBee to the Controller or router. Major
    advantage of this net topology is its bi-directional communication by using ZigBee.
    2) IoT Protocols for Agriculture There are many IoT communication protocols which
    are widely used in agriculture for the purpose of smart farming. By using these
    protocols farmers can communicate in a more convenient way and make more efficient
    decisions for smart farming to enhance and monitor the growth of crop. Most common
    wireless protocols which are being used named: IEEE 802.11 WIFI, 2G/3G/4 G-Mobile
    Communications Standards, LoraWan, WiMax, Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks,
    Bluetooth, RFID, and ZigBee. Comparison of all these wireless protocols is given
    in Table 1. TABLE 1 Comparison of Existing Wireless Protocols a: IEEE 802.11 WiFi
    IEEE 802.11 is a compilation of communication standards Wireless Local Area Network
    that is 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11n and 802.11ac. All these standards operate
    in different bandwidths that are 5 GHz, 2.2GHz, 2.4/5 GHz, 60 GHz and 5 GHz. Data
    transfer range of these standards is from 1Mb/s to 7 Gb/s. Its communication range
    is from 20 m to 100 m [42]. A wifi based wireless sensor network in IoT has been
    discussed for smart agriculture [43]. b: LoraWan LoraWan is a long range communication
    protocol which is developed by an open and non-profit association namely Lora
    TM Alliance. The main purpose of this LoraWan protocol is to assure the interoperability
    between multiple operators [44]. To improve agricultural productivity and anticipate
    the problems a framework has been presented in [45] whose component based on Lora
    and ARIMA technology. c: WiMax Data transfer range of Worldwide Interoperability
    for microwave access is from 1.5 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s. But now a days with the advancement
    of technology data transfer rate has been changed [46]. WiMax provides broadband
    multi access connectivity that includes fixed, portable, nomadic and mobile communication
    through wired or wireless connectivity. Both WiFi and WiMax technologies have
    been deployed in Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Ghana (MOFA) which enables
    user to connect either WiMax networks or building Wifi [47]. d: 2G/3G/4G-Mobile
    Communications Standards There are multiple generations of Mobile Communication
    Standards consist of Second Generation, Third Generation, and Fourth Generation.
    IoT devices Communicate by using these standards over cellular networks. Through
    the use of mobile communication farmer can detect temporal variability across
    their fiels and monitor crop yield, soil and climate conditions [48]. e: LR-WPAN
    Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks figure out the specification of high
    level communication standards like ZigBee. Data transfer rate of LR-WPAN consist
    of 40 Kb/s-250 Kb/s. The major property of this standard is that it provides low
    speed and low cost communication services [49]. LR-WPAN is mostly used for indoor
    agriculture such as home garden or in small farms. f: RFID RFID works on the principal
    by assigning a unique number individually to each object in order to record information.
    RFID consists of readers, host and tags where tags receive and transmit radio
    waves due to which it is also known as responder. RFI tags consist of active tags
    and passive tags which are available in different sizes and shapes. Passive tag
    is more advantageous as compare to active tag because it is cheap than active
    tags. Tags have unique ID number and environmental information such as moisture
    level, temperature condition, and humidity etc. These tags are embedded and attached
    in multiple objects to identify that object. g: ZigBee ZigBee is on the top of
    IEEE 802 standards created by ZigBee Alliance. It is a set of specifications for
    device to device network having low power data rates. With the advancement of
    technology and increasing the demand of throughput there is a need of faster and
    low power consumption technology. These requirements are fulfilled by more established
    technologies which provides faster data transfer. In agriculture environment IoT
    sensors sense the data and transfer it towards remote server. After sensing, collected
    data is analyzd for decisions making [50]. h: MQTT MQTT is a messaging protocol
    in IoT which is mainly designed for remote connections. It’s a bandwidth efficient
    protocol and uses little battery power. MQTT is used for continuous analysis and
    deploy a smart system for agriculture sector. A low cost web based IoT solution
    has been presented by using MQTT for monitoring, tracking and analyzing agricultural
    data and collect knowledge from field ambience and improve environmental conditions
    [51]. By using MQTT a low cost irrigation system has been proposed for receiving
    and transmitting sensor information [52]. i: SigFox It’s a low data rate and an
    ultra narrowband wireless cellular network which is appropriate for IoT and machine
    type communications [53]. To construct a geo location system SigFox network was
    used which localize animals pasture of the whole summer [54]. System proposed
    in [55] helps the farmers to locate their cattle’s position and increase their
    productivity. j: Bluetooth Bluetooth is a low power and low range Personal Area
    Network which is best for short range mobile communication. There are many IoT
    agricultural devices which are bluetooth enabled such as Farmnote Air gateway
    and color sensor work with bluetooth enabled sensors. Bluetooth has ubiquitous
    nature due to which it is considered as an appropriate technology for multi-tier
    agricultural applications [56]. SECTION IV. IoT Agriculture Applications IoT agriculture
    system applied as an array of wide variety of fields such as, Precision farming,
    livestock monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring. Agriculture applications have
    been categorized into three sections: IoT agricultural applications, Smartphone
    based applications and sensor based applications. IoT and sensor based applications
    categorization has been illustrated in figure 11 which is framed by reviewing
    the today’s available IoT solutions in agriculture. FIGURE 11. IoT structure in
    agriculture. Show All A. IoT Agricultural Application Domains There are number
    of IoT agriculture applications which are being used to create more efficient
    resources for agriculture productivity. Main domains of IoT agriculture applications
    are precision farming, livestock monitoring, greenhouse monitoring and agricultural
    drones. The following subsection consists of various types of agricultural applications.
    1) Precision Farming Precision farming helps the farmers to improve, automate
    and optimize all feasible directions in order to enhance the agricultural productivity
    and make cropping system smart [57]. Different IoT sensors are deployed to measure
    soil quality, weather conditions, moisture level, and effectively plan to optimize
    harvesting techniques. To enhance the crop production a correlation analysis between
    agricultural environment information and crop statistical analysis has been developed
    to collect crop data [28]. In [58] an IoT based platforms has been developed for
    precision agriculture and ecological monitoring. IoT based weather forecasts helps
    to optimize productivity and take anticipatory analysis to prevent the crop from
    damage. Multiple monitoring devices/sensors are used to predict pest behavior,
    plant or crop growth and address any pending pest issue before they damage crop.
    Ranchers use IoT based irrigation solutions to manage and analyze crop irrigation
    requirements. In [59] a remote agricultural monitoring platform has been presented
    on the basis of monitored data. A conceptual architecture based on cyber systems
    and software defined setworks has been presented in [60] for precision farming.
    IoT base Precision farming consist of multiple monitroing and controling applications
    such as climate conditions monitoring, soil patterns monitoring, pest and crop
    disease monitoring, irrigation, determine optimal time to plant and harvest and
    tracking/tracing. a: Climate Conditions Monitoring In agriculture it is the most
    important to monitor weather conditions continuously so that future activities
    can be planed accordingly. Weather stations are the most popular gadgets in the
    field of agriculture which are used to monitor different climte conditions. Weather
    parameters which are being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction,
    and air pressure etc. Located across the field, weather stations collect the environmental
    data and send it to the cloud server. Collected data is used for weather analysis
    to map climate conditions, and provide new insights to take required actions to
    improve agricultural productivity. US Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    has been defined a weather related approach called Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA)
    which helps the user to transform agriculture system by identifying climate conditions
    [61]. A wireless sensor network has been deployed by using IoT technology to monitor
    weather changes by integrating the sensors and devices [62]. b: Soil Patterns
    Soil monitoring has become one of the most demanding practices in agriculture
    field for both industries and farmers. In soil monitoring there are many environmental
    issues which affects on crop production. If hese kinds of issues are identified
    data accurately then the farming patterns and processes can be understand easily.
    Soil patterns which are being monitored consists of Soil Humidity, moisture, fertilization
    and temperature. Soil humidity and moisture sensors are deployed to monitor the
    moisture content in soil [63]. An adequate amount of fertilization in the field
    also increase crop yield [64]. Soil monitoring test report increase crop productivity
    and recommends an appropriate fertilization solutions to farmer [65]. Moreover,
    identification of contaminated soil by using IoT technologies protect the field
    from over fertilization and crop loss. c: Pest and Crop Disease Monitoring Root
    causes of revenue and production losses are crop diseases. Due to the boom of
    IoT agricultural system has been changed into digital system which helps the farmer
    to make informed decisions. Prediction of crop diseases at early stages helps
    the farmers to generate more revenue by saving crop from pest attacks. IoT protect
    crop in multiple ways by detecting different diseases and prevent crop from animal
    attacks. An IoT based monitoring system has been presented in [66] to monitor
    the wheat diseases, pest and weeds. Crop raiding is the biggest issue due to contraction
    of cultivated land into different wildlife haunts. In [67] a monitoring and repelling
    system for the protection of crop against wild animals attack has been presented.
    Detection of crop disease at early stages is very challenging in the field of
    agriculture. Because to detect crop or leaf disease a team of experts is called,
    which is expensive and time taking process. Whereas, automatic detection of diseases
    is very beneficial, accurate and cheaper for farmer as compared to manual observation
    by experts. Image processing technique also plays a vital role for the earlier
    detection of plant disease [68]. A crop disease detection scenario has been shown
    in figure 12. FIGURE 12. Disease detection scenario. Show All Sensed raw data
    via sensing devices is converted into usable format via remote server and then
    stored into database which is displayed through a user interface. After getting
    data multiple data mining models are applied for disease (bacterial, fungal, viral
    etc) analysis. d: Irrigation Monitoring System IoT improve the current irrigation
    system in a more innovative way. A farmer can optimize irrigation system in multiple
    ways by monitoring weather conditions and soil conditions. IoT technology monitor
    irrigation system in four ways like weather forecasting data, control and monitor
    whole field from anywhere, Ethernet connection and WIFI. This modern irrigation
    system facilitates the farmers by installing multiple sensors, reducing farmers
    monthly irrigation cost, and limit water resources [69]. In [70] an intelligent
    irrigation management system has been presented by using Maching learning and
    open source technologies which sense different soil and weather parametrs. An
    IoT based Low cost irrigation system has been designed in [71] which uses HTTP
    and MQTT protocols to inform the user. Water quality is monitored by sensor nodes
    which are empowered with wireless communication. IoT technology measure both physical
    and chemical constraints of ph, dissolved, temperature, conductivity and oxygen
    [72]. Gathered data about water management system is viewed on internet by using
    cloud computing services. Recently multiple IoT irrigation platforms have been
    developed to control the water consumption in the field. In [73] a simple irrigation
    system has been developed by using WSN. In more advance system users can control
    the process of irrigation through cellular technologies. Likewise, system is proposed
    in [75] in which user transfer sensors data via cellular technologies to a database
    system. e: Determine the Optimal Time to Plant and Harvest IoT increase operational
    efficiency and enhance the crop productivity by determining the best possible
    time to harvest and plant. IoT amalgamate multiple existing technologies like
    cloud computing applications, end user applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN’s) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to determine the accurate time
    of weeding and seeding [76]. f: Tracking and Tracing IoT provides informative
    data to agricultural companies for better decisions making such as planning, managing
    and connect with business partners intelligently by saving money and time. In
    growing environment soil, air, water, fertilizers, and pesticides conditions are
    monitored by RFID and Global Positioning System (GPS). GPS system is used to find
    the exact location of agriculture field and monitor various agricultural parameters
    by using wireless communication networks. In [77] an architecture has been develop
    which remotely monitor the soil condition and soil structure as per requirement
    of crops culture. In this structure ZigBee is connected with other devices like
    content management system (CMS), Global System for Mobile (GSM) and General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS) by using Wireless sensor networks to monitor and realize
    real time data checking. GPS provides interface to interact with ARM (an intelligent
    monitoring system to achieve functions like SMS/MMS) and gives an alarm to farm
    manager when an unwanted changes occur and helps the farmers to take corrective
    action. Although it’s operational and maintenance cost is high but it is widely
    used in agriculture due to its exact location monitoring and tracking property.
    g: Farm Management System The adoption of smart farming is correspondingly increasing
    the amount of productivity by reducing the environmental impact but this smart
    farming technique can be possible via Farm Management System (FMS). FMS is a key
    element for processing, planning, and decision making for the purpose of smart
    farming [78]. An integrated FMS allows the farmers to monitor the entire where
    whole data is collected via WSN, GSM modules and microcontroller. An identifier
    is used on the sensors and devices in all over the farm which gives the proper
    knowledge of fertilization, weather data, automatic buffer zone width monitoring,
    and automatic detail record is generated according to per day activities of farm.
    This whole information is stored in the computer in standard format and can be
    accessible via cell phone or internet for further processing. To optimize the
    use of water resources an automated irrigation and monitoring system is used [73].
    Apart from irrigation system farm is also protected from pest and animal intrusion
    [66], [67]. h: Agricultural Drones Drones are defined as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
    (UAVs) which are being utilized in agriculture to improve various practices of
    farming. These flying devices are controlled remotely by remote control or autonomously
    programmed. Agricultural processes which are performed by drones are crop health
    assessment, spraying, screening, planting, scouting reports, measurement of nitrogen
    in wheat and analysis of soil conditions. Drones facilitate the farmers via integration
    with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping, and crop health imaging. Drones
    are mostly deployed in large farms where issues related to bacteria fungus are
    difficult to handle and require regular monitoring. In the area of agriculture
    pesticides and fertilizers are very important for crop yield [65], [66]. Agricultural
    drones are carrying out this job efficiently because of its high speed and effectiveness
    in the spraying operation. In addition they also deployed to monitor forests,
    livestock and aquaculture. An organization Precision Hawk is using drones for
    valuable data gathering through sensors for surveying mapping, and imaging of
    agricultural land. They perform in-flight monitoring, farmers enters the detail
    about which field to survey and select a ground resolution. An IoT based Farm
    management information system approch has been developed to meet the bussiness
    objectives [29]. Agricultural drones are integrated with GPS devices cameras and
    sensors to monitor crop health, like planting, crop spraying, screening and analysis
    of soil. There are many other advantages of drone’s utilization like crop health
    imaging, plant counting, amount of nitrogen in wheat, plant height, drainage mapping,
    and weed pressure etc. 2) Greenhouse Monitoring In greenhouse plants are grown
    under controlled environment. This glasshouse technology provides benefits to
    growing plants anytime anywhere by monitoring appropriate environmental conditions.
    Cultivation of greenhouse is more intense, therefore in terms of controlling and
    monitoring it requires high precision. To monitor environmental or weather conditions
    there have been several studies on the applications of WSN’s in greenhouse. Recent
    studies shows that how IoT can be implemented in greenhouse to minimize the human
    resources, accumulate energy and provides direct link of greenhouse from ranchers
    to customers. Most of the studies have focused only on remote monitoring and localized
    [14]–[16]. In addition, for the purpose of high precision there have been a lot
    of studies which integrates meta-processing structure with data to transfer it
    on remote infrastructures through internet. By applying well evaluated crop models,
    assessment of the crop status helps the ranchers to take better decisions [80].
    In Figure 13 a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) has been implemented to monitor the
    greenhouse environment. Whole network is divided into multi parts which processes
    the data and gives feedback. FIGURE 13. WSN for monitoring greenhouse environment.
    Show All Data can be obtained by corresponding sensors and detectors and then
    transferred to the main server for processing. In physical implementation the
    major components are the sensors and network for accurate data transmission. Growers
    setup the different monitoring devices and sensors according to the specific requirements
    and track or record the required information. Agriculturists make better decisions
    by analyzing the received information and achieve specific goals by obtaining
    optimal data. There are many IoT based greenhouse applications such as water management,
    plant monitoring, and climate monitoring etc. a: Water Management To measure the
    exact amount of required water in greenhouses is a key problem. Smart sensors
    are implemented which are controlled by applying multiple IoT techniques to avoid
    from excessive use of water. In greenhouses water management is carried out by
    using automatic drip irrigation which works by following soil mositure threshhold
    that is set accordingly [81]. b: Plant Monitoring IoT sensors and cameras creates
    ideal environment for plants by monitoring the state of plants regularly and generates
    an alert if any problem is recognizable. On the other side, cloud based IoT solutions
    store the sensed data and view it periodically which is helpful for growers to
    ensure that all plants obtains ideal attention in the greenhouse [82]. c: Climate
    Monitoring There are many parameters which are combined to maintain and create
    an ideal environment for plants within strict limits such as, the maintenance
    of ventilation, temperature, carbon dioxide, and oxygen level. This can be made
    possible by deploying IoT enabled greenhouse where smart devices and sensors share
    their information for strong decision making [81]. 3) Livestock Monitoring Optimal
    environment or weather circumstances which absorbs excessive amount of climate
    conditions leaves negative impact on the productivity of animals that is a serious
    issue for many researchers [83]. Whereas, due to increasing the demand of high
    quality dairy products precision livestock also considered as the major concern.
    Each year ranchers lose a large amount of profit because of animals illness. But
    IoT based livestock management solutions helps the farmers to improve the farming
    principles, livestock conditions and dairy products [11]. Just like crop monitoring
    sensors, different livestock monitoring sensors are also attached to the animals
    to monitor their log performance. Livestock monitoring factors varies on the categories
    of animals under consideration such as conductivity of milk, pest attack, humidity,
    and water quality. By tagging RFID to individual animal allow farmers to track
    their location, thereby preventing animal from theft. Connected sensors and wearables
    in the livestock allow the farmer to monitor overall animals’ activities and data
    streamed to the cloud directly helps the farmers to identify the issues. Cowlar
    and SCR by Allflex are using smart agriculture sensors to monitor animals health,
    activity, temperature, nutrition and collect information on each individual as
    well as about the herd [84], [85]. In the field of livestock several studies have
    been realized. Wireless Sensor have been used which are most advantageous for
    large farm as well as for hazardous gas monitoring. An IoT based livestock scenario
    is shown in Figure 14. FIGURE 14. IoT based livestock scenario. Show All In the
    field different IoT sensing devices have been deployed to monitor the weather
    conditions via weather station and sense other activities in the field by all
    other data sources which have been implemented in the whole farm. Sensed data
    is stored on the cloud server, which user can use for decision making. User can
    interact remotely by using multiple smart devices (Laptops, Tablets, and Mobile
    etc.). Some IoT base applications of livestock monitoring have discussed below:
    a: Animal Temperature Monitoring Identification of disease symptoms and prevention
    is the major function for animal health monitoring. Normal body temperature of
    dogs is 38.3°C-39.2°C and cow’s is 38.5°C-39.5°C. When the body temperature is
    increased or decreased from the normal body temperature then it indicates that
    animal is suffering from any disease [86]. b: Heat Stress Level Heat stress decreases
    the cow’s milk productivity with same dietary input, due to which farmers face
    the cost production issues. In summer season moisture content becomes low due
    to which stress level in animals increased, because of this animal can also die.
    c: Physical Gesture Recognition Gesture analysis can be made by using IoT animal
    monitoring devices. Animal’s gesture behavior is classified into different groups
    such as in cattle, this behavior is consisting of two classes that are traveling
    and stationary. Traveling behavior consists of animal’s walking, running and grazing
    whereas stationary behavior is animal’s sitting, sleeping and standing. d: Rumination
    Rumination monitor the digested food by animal and it is detected by mounting
    a monitoring device in the animal’s (cows) nose. In this way farmer can get accurate
    indication about animal’s health. e: Heart Rate Measurement of heart rate is an
    indirect method which impacts due to the agitation and stress that cow have. Normal
    heart rate of cow is 43 to 84 bpm whereas calf’s normal heart rate is 100 to 140
    bpm. By using IoT devices and sensors heart rate can be monitored constantly.
    f: GPS Based Monitoring GPS system is used to obtain the specification of farm
    and sends the monitored parameters to central monitoring station by using wireless
    sensor network. To prevent animals from theft, wild attacks or weather conditions
    a repelling system has been provided by using wireless technologies like Zigbee,
    WIFI, and LoWPAN [88]. B. Agricultural Solutions by Using Smart Phones From the
    last few years it has been observed that integration of electronic devices with
    smartphones innovate the technology world and smartphones are taken as a driver
    of IoT. To make smart phones versatile in agriculture field various hardware and
    software have been designed. A good (but not complete) survey of smart phone apps
    providing agricultural solutions has been presented [98]. Figure 15 showing a
    classification illustration of smart phone apps for smart farming. Morever, there
    is a number of recent apps which are serving similar functionalties. All smart
    phone apps which are elaborated in figure 15 discussed in tabular form with a
    small description of each. These smart phone apps are not limited; developers
    from all over the world have developed many e-Farming apps therefore, this paper
    highlighted some selected apps which have been discussed according to their popularity.
    FIGURE 15. Smartphone applications for agriculture. Show All C. IoT Devices and
    Sensors in Agriculture In today’s modern world everything needs to be automatic
    with less man power by consuming less time. Sensor is such a device which can
    fulfill this requirement by detecting same input from the existing physical environment
    and responds back. User set some setting over sensing devices to perform their
    task without the involvement of human. There are some major IoT sensors like:
    Motion Detector, PIR, Soil Moisture, Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure,
    Ultra Violet, PH, and gas sensor. In Table 3 various sensor based agricultural
    applications, their operations and IoT association have been discussed but table
    2 pay attention only on smart phone agricultural apps. TABLE 2 Smartphone Agricultural
    Applications Description TABLE 3 IoT Sensor Based Applications in Agriculture
    SECTION V. IoT Agricultural Security In the coming years agricultural sector is
    expected to witness the extensive acceptance of IoT and grow through the new e-farming
    IoT applications and devices. These agricultural applications and devices are
    expected to deal with a large amount of sensitive data. Due to the distributed
    nature of IoT a single security protocol is not sufficient therefore, leakage
    of information is a major security concern [107]. If we adopt IoT fully in the
    field of agriculture then it will be more critical to analyze and identify the
    distinctive features of privacy and security like different security requirements
    and threat models in the perspective of Agriculture. On the basis of literature
    some security issues has been presented in Figure 16. FIGURE 16. IoT security
    issues in agriculture. Show All A. Security Requirements IoT based smart farming
    security requirements are similar to standard security scenario. Therefore, to
    achieve a secure farming solution we have need to pay attention on the following
    security requirements: Confidentiality: Agricultural information or personal data
    relevant to it should be accessible only by authorized users. Integrity: Here
    integrity means received and stored data or content is not changed. Authentication:
    Authentication means peer devices should have an identity to which it is communicating.
    Data Freshness: It consists of key freshness and data freshness because IoT agricultural
    networks sometime provides varying measurements, therefore it is necessary to
    ensure that every message is fresh. Non Repudiation: Its means a node can never
    deny to send a message that sent earlier. Authorization: Here authorization means
    for network or any other resources only authorized devices are allowed. Self Healing:
    If any device in an IoT based agricultural network fail or out of energy then
    other devices in the network should be able to provide security to some extent.
    B. Security Challenges Security of IoT based smart farming mainly consists of
    three basic requirements that are Authentication, access control and confidentiality
    of the stakeholders. Whereas, at the perception layer network must be secured
    from external attacks and in the network layer aggregation of the data should
    be secured. Authorize specific entities ensures that only authorized user can
    access data from application layer [28]. The most common issue of security in
    the perception layer is physical security that is the security of hardware and
    information acquisition security [108]. Here physical security is very important
    because all the devices are deployed in an open field. That’s why a single security
    protocol is not enough because IoT devices may be implemented in a diverse environment.
    Another major security issue is leakage of information, this information consist
    of location and sensitive data. Security countermeasures consist of data encryption,
    jamming, blocker tags use, modification in tag frequency, and tag destruction
    strategy. There is a difference between sensor nodes and RFID tags that’s’ why
    while implementing encryption algorithm, intrusion detection policies, key distribution
    and routing policies, hardware restrictions should keep in mind [109]. In IoT
    concept data flows from an end device towards gateway, during this process data
    also uploaded to other platform such as cloud infrastructure. There are multiple
    security policies exist for sensor nodes like identity authentication, data filtering,
    cryptographic algorithm, data flow control mechanisms etc. Cheating, wiretapping,
    replay attacks and tampering are also security threats. Due to which, confidentiality,
    authentication and integrity should be must employed while data acquisitions phase
    [17]. C. Stack Challenges Middleware layer also plays a vital role in IoT to increase
    security. Middleware stands in between application layer and network layer which
    is responsible to process data and provide interface for communication between
    these layers. Middleware layer requires secure and confidential data storage.
    Secure transmission via wireless medium is very challenging in IoT deployment
    due to which IoT based architecture is at risk like vulnerability, denial of services,
    illegal access, and many virus injects. In this way data integrity and confidentiality
    is affected by such attacks. According to IoT vision application layer is one
    of the top most layers and closely related to the cloud due to its computation
    resources and storage nature. Security issue at application layer and cloud are
    very similar such as data security, backup, recovery and privacy. Therefore, access
    rights of the data, information and ownership for physical users, machines and
    organizations should manage and administered by a control mechanisms. D. Threat
    Model Both IoT agricultural devices and networks are at risk because of increasing
    attack surface. IoT agricultural threat model consist of three scenarios. First
    one is cloud networks, second is native networks expansion and third is cloud
    services. Threat may be generates from internal or external network. If an attack
    is arise from an agriculture device then it will be considered as one of the more
    severe attack. Because it is very difficult to detect the malicious device within
    the network. In addition an adversary may attack on an agriculture device and
    network and use power device like mobile, laptop or tablet or may be same kind
    of IoT devices to penetrate the network. E. Attack Taxonomy There are many types
    of attacks in IoT paradigm due to which an attacker may attack by adopting a method
    on future or existing IoT agriculture devices and networks. In IoT agricultural
    field threat may be tangible, predictable or unpredictable. In this paper existing
    and possible threats are classified on the basis of three key factors: which are
    Information Disruption, Host, and networks. 1) Attacks on the Basis of Information
    Disruptions Stored agricultural data may be analyzed or manipulated by a hacker
    to provide wrong information. Such attacks consist of Interruption (denial of
    services), Interception (threaten data privacy and confidentiality), Modification
    (unauthorized access to the agricultural data), Fabrication and replay. 2) Attacks
    on the Basis of Host Properties Host properties attacks occure in two forms namely:
    hardware compromise (attacker may attact on device program code data or keys and
    reprogram the devices with malicious code) and software compromise (attacker may
    take the advantage of software vulnerabilities and glitches like operating system,
    applications software and system software). 3) Attacks on the Basis of Networks
    Properties Two types of attacks can be arised on basis of networks properties.
    Namely: standard protocol compromise (to threat service availability like integrity
    and authenticity where attacker deviates from standard protocols) and network
    protocol stack (consist of different types of vulnerabilities). F. Reference Security
    Model for IoT Based Agriculture IoT agricultural paradigms are not yet strong
    but continued to build up due to which currently it is difficult to discover all
    possible threats and vulnerabilities in IoT agricultural field. However, when
    experts find the security solution to solve the apparent security threats at that
    point they should have the ability to mitigate the hidden security issues. To
    accomplish a security solution, security checks should be deployed with dynamic
    properties. Consider a framework in which security mechanism consist of different
    systems which can detect and prevent IoT agricultural system from attacks. Now
    consider, that an attacker generate a new type of attack on agricultural applications
    devices and networks to steal agricultural information integrity. In such conditions
    existing security techniques should indentify this new attack by using dynamic
    algorithm. A security model presented in Figure 17 has been discussed to resolve
    these issue. The model is illustrated with its three security systems: protection
    system is designed to mitigate the attack while, dignosing system collects activity
    data from agricultural applications, networks, nodes and analyzes detected agricultural
    data. Reaction system is designed to help the agricultural entities survive all
    types of attacks. FIGURE 17. An intelligent collaborative security model for smart
    farming. Show All FIGURE 18. Selected IoT agricultural products. Show All Whole
    system has been designed by following dynamic algorithms. To prevent from present,
    probable and hidden attacks this system has strong collaboration. Upon intrusion
    detection system issues an operation command and store in reaction system after
    that share their anomaly diagnosing experience with protection system to prevent
    from further attacks. Operation command receive response from identification service,
    reaction system remove the system failure risks and after that pass out its experience
    with other two systems that are protection and diagnosing systems. In this way
    a complete inter collaboration system is accomplished. SECTION VI. IoT Agricultural
    Industry Trends and Practices The IoT in agriculture field has experienced a burst
    of creativity, activity, venture capital firms and exciting entrepreneurs. The
    space becomes visible as an active group of large firms and new start ups that
    are willing to become the part of what may be a giant market and technologies.
    In this section an extensive record of some products and technologies has been
    provided for a good understanding of IoT position in agriculture field. 3D Crop
    Sensor Array with PAR Addon can be mounted on any location, to monitor temperature,
    humidity and carbon dioxide in the farm [110]. EC-1 Controller monitors the environmental
    conditions and then programs them to control the environment by turning off and
    on devices [111]. Arable Mark is the first device which links the global weather
    data within the field observations developed by Arable. With the unprecedented
    ground truth accuracy device makes informed decisions and deliveres real time
    monitoring information to the palm of user’s hand [112]. Growlink designed Growlink

    real time air temperature and sun radiations by using this device [115]. MeteoHelix
    weather station designed by allmeteo which provides reliable, stable and open
    meteorological solutions according to weather requirements. This weather station
    provides multiple features like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, dew
    point, sun radiations, and solar radiations measurement [116]. Leaf Wetness sensor
    is developed by Smart Element which determine the wetness of leaf by electrical
    resistance on the surface of sensor. It is used to measure wet and dry time on
    the leaf surface [117]. Swip Track Micro locates any moving object in all over
    the field that may be any farming machine, vehicle or engines [118]. Waspmote
    Plug & Sense! Smart Agriculture Xtreme is a sensor node which provides more reliable
    and accurate information about weather. This sensor measures the wind and rainfall
    condition via optical technology. The presence of fertilizers and soil morphology
    can be analyzed through this sensor by measuring the oxygen level, water content,
    and soil water potential [119]. SKY – Lora Weather Station can easily communicate
    to nearby master sensor through LoRa [120]. This is suitable for those locations
    where there is nearby connectivity. This weather station can send data up to 600
    meter away to a master sensor which has WIFI connection. Pycno has been developed
    a Pulse IoT automation sensor which comes in a self-sustained package powered
    by a tiny solar panel [121]. Sensor is WIFI and LoRa enabled device which has
    multiprotocol port in the bottom. In future Pulse Automation Sensor and Pycno
    soil sensor will be integrated to actuate devices and talk with each other in
    the field. CropX Starter Kit – Soil Temperature 24/7 is a real-time soil-temperature
    monitoring Sensor. This sensor has direct cellular connection and better accuracy
    which provides advance sensing capabilities [122]. Some top technologies firm’s
    trends and directions are highlighted in Table 4. TABLE 4 IoT Agricultural Trends
    and Directions of Some Well Known Technology Industries SECTION VII. IoT Smart
    Farming Policies and Success Stories A. Policies Many countries have understood
    the importance of IoT and facilitating through its advance monitoring techniques.
    Government of different countries is seizing the IoT opportunity and investing
    maximum to boost up the crop productivity. Adaptation of IoT technology in different
    countries has been discussed in this section. 1) Australia Government of Australia
    has invested AU$ 134 million to boost up farming. Due to this large investment
    a center was created by a private company in Sidney to implement IoT technologies
    for Smart farming [150]. In 2014 an Innovative Network for Precision Agriculture
    System was established for the purpose of a collaborative frame work to create
    a national agenda in Australian agriculture. In terms of privacy and security,
    in 2015 an American farm Bureau took the lead in establishing a privacy and security
    set for farm data [151]. 2) Ireland Irish Farmer’s Association (IFA) Launched
    a program for agriculturists to reduce the cost, to improve the soil quality and
    guides the farmer how to save water and energy by adopting new technologies [8].
    When the farmers follow these instructions the results were very positive and
    encouraging. Companies saved almost 8700 euro, 10% reduction in green house gas
    emission, 21% savings in pasture management and 47% saving was achieved by Soil
    Fertility. In 2016 a nationwide SigFox network was launched by VT-Networks Ireland
    which provides solution for tracking security sensors and farm assets [153]. 3)
    France Ministry of Agriculture in France has become the partner of the Agriculture
    Innovation Project 2025. The basic aim of this project is to increase the strengthen
    of agricultural land, monitor the climate conditions and create incubators to
    improve agriculture field in France. Ministry of agriculture also share the collected
    data with farmer’s to propose new solution in the field of Agriculture [154].
    French agriculture is administrated by European Union (EU) rules and supported
    through a policy called Common Agriculture Policy (CAP). A new CAP framework was
    defined in 2015 at EU level for next five years which is beneficial for different
    agro ecology projects for farming. 4) China In 2016 china launched its 13th five
    years plan to integrate IoT in the field of agriculture to enhance profitability
    [156]. Project has been started in different eight provinces, with multiple products,
    technologies and 426 applications. Data was collected from multiple provincial
    and national level data centers. Moreover, NB-IoT App by Huawei company in china
    transforming the agriculture in a more efficient and an innovative way. NB-IoT
    provides low cost agriculture solutions as compare to cellular network where gateway
    implementation is not necessary. Huawei NB-IoT has large number of connections
    and wide coverage due to which it can resolve issue of scattered agricultural
    data [157]. 5) Malaysia Agricultural policy in Malaysia was established in two
    periods of time policy before and after independence 1948–1957 and 1957–2020 [158].
    The purpose of the policy was to enhance the growth of crop and decrease the poverty.
    Multiple solutions have been created by Malaysian Institute of Microelectronic
    System (MIMOS) which are best for agriculture development. A sensor named Mi-MSCANT
    PH has been developed by MIMOS to gather environmental data. An agricultural framework
    has been developed by MIMOS to integrate IoT technologies which create a bonding
    between suppliers, traders, and agricultural producers mutually in unified manners.
    This framework utilizes technologies named Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS)
    and WSN which automatically collect environmental data [159]. 6) USA USA has funded
    million Dollars to generate new agricultural technologies to fulfill the necessary
    requirements of energy and food. National Institute of Food and Agriculture worked
    on a project that is Internet-of-Ag-Things and develop sensing technologies for
    smart farming practices. The major purpose of this project is to develop precision
    technologies to enhance the efficiency of agriculture industries and make better
    use of water, fertilizers and organic food [160]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) has started a project to address water management challenges and develop
    new solution for those issues which are affecting agriculture. Technology experts
    are using USDA datasets to improve and design agricultural services [161]. 7)
    Thailand In Thailand National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)
    applying innovative IT technologies for the purpose of smart farming and their
    major focus is on four agricultural products including Rubber, Rice, Sugar and
    Cassava [162]. The major concern of this movement is to increase the agricultural
    productivity and facilitate the farmers in all rural areas of Thailand [163].
    Faculty of Science and Technology at Thammasat University developed an IoT-based
    irrigation control system which helps the grower to preset watering cycle timing
    in advance. A smart farm service provider namely; FarmD Asia was established in
    2015 to boost up the agricultural productivity by its flagship products. FarmD
    Asia has also designed a pesticides aerial drone which covers upto eight acres
    land in single fly. National Science and Technology Development Agency (NSTDA)
    launched Agricultural System Integrator (ASI) program which was primarily designed
    for farmers to start and run smart farm successfully [164]. 8) India Different
    IoT policies have been formulated by Indian government in order to leverage the
    strength of their agricultural field in all over the world. Indians basic purpose
    is to monitor the earth density, soil conditions, temperature and alerts the farmers
    to control pest related issues. In 2015 a policy on IoT in India was released
    by Ministry of Communication and Information Technology to transform digital landscape
    by using IoT [165]. 9) Philippine Philippines have used the remote sensing techniques
    to increase the production of rice. They are also using ground data processing
    and satellite imagery techniques to generate more information on different agricultural
    conditions. University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP) proposed an intelligent
    solution to monitor crop heat stress by using IoT technology with the collaboration
    of Western Mindanao State University (WMSU). In this project research team is
    on the brink with an effective technology counter heat stress which helps the
    farmer to get maximum benefit with the fewest inputs [166]. B. Food and Agriculture
    Organization of United NATIONSNN Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations
    (FAO) is an e-agricultural organization which follows the international efforts
    to fulfill the deficiency of food in all over 130 countries worldwide. FAO predicted
    that there is a most probability that world population will reach 9.8 billion
    by 2050 therefore, it is necessary to increase the food production 70% by 2050
    to fulfils the growing demand of food through the utilization of IoT technology.
    Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Vegetalia, changing Japanese agricultural sector
    by their join forces through AI and IoT. By using tensiometer sensors Tevatronic
    develops an autonomous irrigation system which is placed in the ground near the
    plants for monitoring. From the last 74 years FAO has been changed the agricultural
    world by launching its top ten achievements given in table 5 [167]. TABLE 5 Top
    10 E-Agricultural Strategies of FAO C. IoT Agriculture Success Stories This research
    indicates that there have been several tools and techniques which helps the farmers
    to improve the crop productivity in a more innovative ways. Some IoT agriculture
    relevant technologies have been discussed in section I which provides additional
    tools to the farmers or agriculturists to increase the crop yield. Section III
    describes the different IoT and Smartphone based applications which facilitate
    the farmers to enhance the agriculture productivity by providing extended benefits.
    However over the globe governments are seizing the IoT opportunities in agriculture
    by making large investment. There are many pilot projects which reflects a great
    potential in the future of IoT in agriculture at country level such as china,
    India, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan etc. Therefore, in this research we have also
    discussed the results of some pilot projects conducted and being executed in different
    countries. Table 6 prepresents the success stories of these pilot projects in
    different countries with the main IoT agricultural applications (precision farming,
    greenhouse, and livestock). TABLE 6 IoT Agriculture Success Stories SECTION VIII.
    IoT Agricultural Challenges Many researchers have worked on IoT agriculture system
    and solve multiple technological issues and architectural problems by implementing
    and designing various IoT agricultural solutions. Moreover, according to the research
    point of view in the literature, there are also several open issues and challenges
    which are needed to address successfully [57]. There are many challenges which
    are linkage with IoT smart farming deployment and applications. This research
    has identified some explored and unexplored IoT agricultural issues and challenges.
    A. Hardware Challenges Several challenges arise in IoT agricultural setup. First
    of all the equipments which exists at the perception layer are directly expose
    to harsh environmental experience such as, rain, high level temperature, extreme
    humidity, hard winds, and many other possible dangers which destroy electronic
    circuits. End devices works consistently for a long period by depending on inadequate
    batteries power resources. So, a suitable programming tools and less power potential
    is necessary because in case of any program failure instantly battery replacement
    is complicated especially in a large scale open field [144]. B. Networking Challenges
    These challenges are not only for the hardware implementations, but also exist
    at the network layer. Due to high cost of wiring, wireless communication is most
    important for the deployment of IoT based agriculture. Physical deployment shows
    that accepted transceivers performance is exaggerated by human presence, temperature,
    humidity and many other barriers inside the space where wireless device or node
    wants to communicate. Due to which there should use most reliable and robust technologies
    to transfer data according to the environmental challenges and rural conditions
    [8]. A detailed analysis on IoT agriculture networking challenges and issues is
    given [145]. C. IoT Agricultural Platforms IoT agricultural architecture is more
    complicated as compare to other IoT end devices and requires real time monitoring
    system with additional stringent requirements. For this a tailored computing platform
    is needed with run time libraries. A service oriented approach (SOA) can also
    take to build a suitable platform; such services can be exploited by using different
    API’s. In addition, appropriate frameworks and libraries should be developed so
    that agricultural developers can make resourceful use of available document, classes,
    codes and other useful data. D. Other Technical Issues 1) Interfernce To implement
    smart farming a large number of IoT devices are deployed for agricultural purpose
    that creates hindrance especially for those IoT devices which are using unlicensed
    spectrum like Sogfox, ZigBee, LoRa, and WIFI. These technical issues reduce the
    reliability and loss of data. Moreover, unnecessary interference can be eliminated
    by using IoT devices with licensed spectrum. But, among the IoT devices which
    are using cellular licensed spectrum the reprocess of non-orthogonal multiple
    access method can create hindrance because of restricted pilot assignment in cellular
    band. 2) Reliability In agriculture field mostly the IoT devices are deployed
    in an open environment. Due to which there may occur some inconsiderate environmental
    impacts which may cause the communication failure as well as degradation of deployed
    sensors. Therefore, physical safety of IoT devices and system is necessary to
    secure the expensive gadgets from unauthorized user and severe attacks like weather
    conditions or theft. 3) Scalability Billions of IoT devices have been increased
    gradually, due to which more devices are getting connected. Therefor, large number
    of gateways and protocols are needed to support IoT devices. Moreover, IoT agricultural
    back end databases and network applications should be reliable and scalable because
    with the addition of diverse application related operations becomes more complex.
    Therefore, design a highly scalable security scheme and an intelligent IoT system
    for each end device. 4) Resource Optimization Farmers need optimization of resources
    to measure how many IoT devices, gateways, size of cloud storage, and amount of
    transmitted data is required. Due to different farm sizes and variables like crop
    or livestock monitoring resource optimization has become challenging because there
    is a need of different sensors and devices to perform each function. Therefore,
    this will require complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to determine
    the resource allocation for maximum agriculture productivity. 5) Cost Analysis
    and Lack Knwoledge of Technology In the field of agriculture profit margin is
    very important, there is a need of stability the trade-off between the deployments
    of IoT enabling technologies. When an IoT system is deployed the cost of implementations
    are very high like IoT devices/Sensors, gateways, and base station infrastructure.
    After that maintenance cost also important for the use of central services which
    are necessary for IoT devices management, data collection, and information sharing
    among all other services. Moreover, the major factor of slowing IoT in rural areas
    is basically the lack knowledge of IoT and its applications. This is the main
    problem because majority of ranchers is uneducated and lives in rural areas. Therefor,
    it is most important to overcome these obstacles by educating farmers in order
    to generate more revnue [7]. 6) Deployment of LPWA Technologies There is a large
    number of IoT devices in Agriculture scenario, and such devices should liable
    to be heterogeneous in the context of their transmit, receive, sleep, and deep
    sleep along with others. In the terms of power requirements each communication
    layer confronts a supplementary challenge. For example, to confirm the service
    accessibility at MAC layer to find a low power device discovery protocol is a
    difficult task. 7) Universal Platform Adaptation of IoT in agriculture will shift
    from just specific crop to a standard platform which can support multiple smart
    farming applications for crop productivity. This standard platform creates a system
    which can be easily modified to support multiple agricultural applications ranging
    from monitoring to managing. This kind of platform will be free from any kind
    of geographical limitations work as an enabler in IoT agriculture system. 8) Mobility
    IoT agricultural network should have the capability to hold up and maintain the
    farmers mobility. So, that they can connect their farms from anywhere at any time
    [146]. 9) Quality of Service (QOS) Recent studies on QoS highlight that at each
    layer of IoT architecture QoS is required [147] [148]. The ability to make sure
    that devices which needs to transmit sensitive information will be capable to
    do this by using IoT technology without any barrier is still an open research
    issue. There is a need to do more work by providing a mechanism that guarantees
    QoS throughout IoT network layers. E. The Business Model IoT agricultural business
    approach is not still vigorous because it consists of a set of essential elements
    with the latest requirements like new operational policies and processes to transform
    the organizational structure. F. Organizational Challenges When talk about food
    organizations and agricultural sectors, is mean the exchange of information and
    goods transportation. IoT is renovating this whole business process by providing
    reliable and accurate delivery of all products and materials [1]. At the circumference
    of network to store and process the data cloud computing provides highest quality
    of services like efficient storage, computational resources, and application development
    tools for hardware diagnostic. That’s why cloud computing is an ideal accompaniment
    in the world of IoT technologies. At the end of the network a large amount of
    data is produced which needs high cost to transfer towards cloud in terms of latency
    and money [18]. Due to which it is a serious issue because of workload and optimal
    balancing. On the other hand fog computing also the cloud computing extension
    which expanding cloud technologies like tools, and the application development
    scope [149]. SECTION IX. Conclusion All over the globe researchers are exploring
    technological solutions to enhance the agriculture productivity in a way that
    complements existing services by deploying IoT technology. In this article, we
    have presented a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art for IoT in agriculture.
    To this end, we discuss agricultural network architecture, platform, and topology
    which help to access to IoT backbone and facilitates farmers to enhance the crop
    productivity. In addition, this article provides an extensive overview on current
    and continuing advances in IoT agricultural applications, devices/sensors, communication
    protocols and many innovative technologies. This research considers various IoT
    agricultural challenges and security requirements for the better understanding
    of IoT smart farming security. Furthermore, many important dimensions of IoT based
    agricultural including technologies, industries trends and countries policies
    have been also been presented to facilitate various stake holders. Government
    has started patronizing IoT in agriculture and it is anticipated that soon IoT
    in agriculture will revamp the conventional farming method. It is also clear that
    many big organizations have started investing and developing new techniques for
    farm management system using IoT. Finally, it is expected that this comprehensive
    survey results into a very useful piece of information for researchers, professionals,
    agriculturists and policy makers who are participating and working in IoT field
    and agricultural technologies. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) has been applied in many areas, such
    as smart farming [1], smart home [2], wearables [3], smart city [4], connected
    health [5], connected car [6], connected drones [7], among other areas. The IoT
    allows physical objects to communicate together, share information and coordinate
    decisions. The IoT transforms traditional objects into intelligent objects by
    exploiting its enabling technologies such as communication technologies, Internet
    protocols, application, and sensor networks [8], [9]. The global smart agriculture
    market is expected to reach 15.3billionbytheendof2025comparedto 5 billion in the
    year 2016 [10]. Smart agriculture will become an important IoT application area
    in agri-products exporting countries. Recently, the IoT application has been deployed
    for smart agriculture using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) such as irrigation
    sensor network [11], prediction of frost events [12], precision soil farming [13],
    blind entity identification [14], smart farming [15], and precision agriculture
    [16]. To develop a green IoT-based agriculture solution, there are six main challenges,
    including, hardware, data analytics, maintenance, mobility, infrastructure, data
    security, and privacy [17]. The hardware challenges concern the choice of sensors
    and meters for IoT devices. Therefore, there are various kinds of sensors types
    that can be used in IoT application (e.g., temperature sensor, proximity sensor,
    pressure sensor, water quality sensor, chemical sensor, gas sensor, humidity sensor…etc.).
    The data analytics challenge concern the application of predictive algorithms
    and machine learning (e.g., deep learning approaches) in IoT data to obtain a
    nutritive solution for smart agriculture. The maintenance challenge concerns regular
    sensors checks of all IoT devices since they can be easily damaged in the agriculture
    field. The mobility challenge concerns the type of wireless communication (e.g.,
    4G, 5G, WiFi, 6LowPan, LoRa) that can connect sensors distributed over a large
    area in the agriculture field. The infrastructure challenges concern the installation
    and development of IoT networking architecture using new technologies such as
    fog computing, cloud computing, network virtualization…etc. The main problem in
    the development of green IoT-based agriculture is not located at the physical
    support but mainly in reassuring both security and privacy. With the adaption
    of green IoT-based agriculture, an adversary may find more ways to penetrate into
    the system (e.g., via a false data injection attack), raising new security and
    privacy issues and asking for more secure communications in the smart agriculture
    filed. According to Cha et al. [18], privacy-enhancing technologies in IoT application
    can be classified into seven categories, including, enforcement, control over
    data, personal data protection, anonymization or pseudonymization, partial data
    disclosure, anonymous authorization, and holistic privacy preservation. Therefore,
    security requirements [19] in IoT application can be classified into authentication,
    confidentiality, non-repudiation, integrity, and access control. These security
    and privacy requirements should be achieved by the security protocols for green
    IoT-based agriculture. There are related survey papers [9], [20]–[23] that focused
    on various aspects of IoT-based agriculture, as presented in Tab. I. Brewster
    et al. [20] presented a review on developing IoT-based large-scale pilots in agriculture.
    Ray [21] presented a systematic survey that covers the IoT deployment for improved
    farming. Recently, the surveys [22], [23] discussed the fundamental structures
    of IoT and its impact in the field of green IoT-based agriculture. However, these
    surveys are very limited regarding research challenges on security and privacy.
    In the literature, there are different related surveys that deal with IoT security.
    As shown in Table 2, we classify the IoT security surveys with respect to the
    following criteria: Threat model: It indicates whether the survey considered the
    threats against the IoT network. Security & Privacy: It indicates whether the
    survey focused considered the security and privacy countermeasures to protect
    the IoT network. Blockchain: It indicate whether the survey considered bloackanin-based
    solution for IoT security. Target IoT application: It indicates whether the survey
    focused on specific or general IoT applications. TABLE 1 Related Surveys on Green
    IoT-Based Agriculture TABLE 2 Related Surveys on IoT Security Most of the IoT
    security surveys [24]–[31] describe the required security and privacy countermeasures
    and target without focusing on any particular application. Some of them restrict
    their covered countermeasures to IoT security taxonomy [26], IoT frameworks [27],
    [30], security communication protocols [24], [25], or trust-based solutions [31].
    Some of the surveys describe the threat models that could comprise the security
    of IoT networks [26], [28], [29], [31]–[33]. Recently, blockchain-based solutions
    for IoT security have attracted more attention in [29], [34]–[36]. Kouicem et
    al. [35] present their security solutions and blockchain-based security solutions
    with respect to five IoT applications: Smart Grid, EHealth, Transportation, Smart
    city, and Manufacturing. Other surveys focused on industrial IoT [32], Smart Grid
    [37], or Smart Home [34]. To the best of our knowledge, our survey is the first
    that thoroughly covers threats models, secuirty and privacy countermeasures, blockchain-based
    solutions for IoT security, and focuses only on Green IoT-based agriculture applications.
    Our contributions in this work are: We present a four-tier green IoT-based agriculture
    architecture. We present the threat models against green IoT-based agriculture
    and provide a classification into five categories, including, attacks against
    privacy, authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity properties.
    We review the security and privacy solutions for IoT applications and how they
    will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. We analyze the privacy-oriented
    blockchain-based solutions for IoT applications and how they will be adapted for
    green IoT-based agriculture. We provide the consensus algorithms for blockchain-based
    solutions and how they will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. We emphasize
    the security and privacy challenges solutions for green IoT-based agriculture.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the four-tier
    green IoT-based agriculture architecture. In Section III, we present the threat
    models against green IoT-based agriculture and provide a classification into five
    categories. In Section IV, we provide the new trends of security and privacy solutions
    for green IoT-based agriculture. In Section V, we clearly highlight the pros and
    cons of the existing privacy-oriented blockchain-based solutions. Then, we discuss
    the security and privacy challenges solutions in Section VI. Lastly, Section VII
    presents conclusions. SECTION II. Green IoT-Based Agriculture Smart agriculture
    based on IoT technology has enabled farmers to improve crop yields, optimize irrigation
    efficiency, and reduce farming costs. It is an intelligent agricultural solution
    combining agriculture with modern information technology. The IoT technology has
    contributed to the emergence of the three aspects: Precision agriculture: is a
    technology which uses advanced technology to improve crop yield, among them, Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) is the main driver for the development of it [40]. It effectively
    reduces the potential risks in the production process and helps farmers making
    accurate and controlled farming practices by deploying a large number of low-power,
    multi-function, wireless communication sensors in environments (such as fields
    and open poultry and livestock breeding) and collecting relevant data in agricultural
    production (such as environment data, crop growth data, livestock health data
    [41]–[44]). The main modern information technology used in precision agriculture
    is “3S” technology, including Remote Sensing (RS), Geographic Information System
    (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS). The most remarkable application of
    GPS in precision agriculture is agricultural drones, they are used in the agriculture
    industry to enhance the different farming practices [45]. The ground and aerial
    drones are used for assessment of crop health, crop monitoring, planting, crop
    spraying, and field analysis. Furthermore, with the integration of IoT and “3S”
    technology in open poultry and livestock breeding, it is possible to collection
    information about the location and health of cattle by attaching sensors to them,
    which allows to identify sick cattle and isolated them. The farmers can also reduce
    time and effort needed to locate their animals [46]. Generally, Precision agriculture
    constructs an expert decision system for agriculture production management to
    replace the subjective traditional agricultural production management method,
    thereby, (1) reasonable using of pesticides to reduce environmental pollution;
    (2) improving the efficiency of agricultural irrigation and reducing the waste
    of resources; (3) Planting crops in an environment suitable for their growth,
    improving the land usage; (4) analyzing the growth law of crops and livestock,
    maintaining their best growth state and greatly improving the output and quality
    of agricultural products. Facility agriculture: is an industrialized agricultural
    production mode that aims at good quality and high yield, belongs to a high-input,
    high-output, capital-intensive, technology-intensive and labor-intensive industry
    [47]. It provides a crop production protection facility created by engineering
    technology to achieve the goal that agricultural production is not restricted
    by environmental factors and automatic and efficient; frees traditional agriculture
    from the shackles of nature; breaks the seasonal characteristics of traditional
    agricultural products; meets the multi-level consumption demand derived from social
    development [48]. Facility agriculture can be divided into facility horticulture
    and farming in terms of types, they mainly use biotechnology, engineering, meteorological
    environment, IoT, computer technology and other technologies. Its core lies in
    the prediction model and decision management control system based on the historical
    data collected by IoT sensors. Facility agriculture has become a mainstay industry
    in some developed countries such as America, Netherlands and Japan, the most prominent
    example is the intelligent greenhouse. IoT sensors can be used to automatically
    monitor and control the internal climate parameters of the greenhouse [49]. The
    sensors collect and transmit real-time data to the farmer. If the values of parameters
    deviate from normal condition, some actions like automatic irrigation can be performed
    without, which helps in reducing the labor cost as no human intervention is needed.
    Aquaculture, poultry and livestock farming are similar with it, the difference
    is different environment factors require deployment of different IoT sensors and
    set up specific computer control cultivation schemes. The current development
    goal of facility agriculture is intelligent plant factory, it enables continuous
    and efficient crop production under fully enclosed and intelligent control conditions.
    Moreover, it frees crop growth from geographical constraints, shortens the production
    cycle of agricultural products and improves product quality and yield. It is one
    of the symbols of the combination of agriculture and industry, and also the development
    direction of agriculture in the future. Contract farming: is a new model of agricultural
    production and management. With the advancement of Urbanization in the world,
    the gap between rural and urban development is gradually widening. According to
    the statistics, 80% of the extreme poor and 75% of the moderate poor live in rural
    areas [50]. Relatively backward agricultural infrastructure, hidden dangers in
    the quality and safety of agricultural products and information isolation in agricultural
    products trading are the main reasons. To solve these problems, contract farming
    emerges as the times require. It outsources the production demand of some agricultural
    products to farmers in advance through customers, reduces the planting and breeding
    risks of growers and avoid blind production, is an effective market-oriented production
    and marketing model [51]. Contract farming includes supply chain management of
    agricultural products, traceability of agricultural products safety, agricultural
    products trading system, agricultural products logistics and the like. The IoT
    technology has been used in tracking the food supply chain (i.e., farm-to-fork
    traceability) [52]. For example, it has been employed to provide information about
    the product to the final consumer [53]. An IoT framework is proposed in [] to
    assess the freshness of fruits in e-commerce deliveries. In [54], IoT is used
    to monitor food safety throughout the product life cycle, in order to help consumers
    in making better purchase decisions. In [55], an early-warning system, which monitors
    food safety and warns about deterioration of product quality, is proposed. An
    IoT-based monitoring system is developed in [56] to provide geo-location information
    about food storage and transportation. Fig. 1 illustrates the four-tier green
    IoT-based agriculture architecture, which is based on the following four layers:
    1) Agriculture sensors layer; 2) Fog layer; 3) Core layer; 4) and Cloud layer.
    The layers are discussed as follows: FIGURE 1. Four-tier green IoT-based agriculture
    architecture. Show All A. Agriculture Sensors Layer This layer consists of IoT-enabled
    devices (e.g., sensor nodes, smartphones, …etc.) equipped with Global Positioning
    System for creating different types IoTs for smart agriculture, including, IoTs
    for field agriculture, IoTs for the greenhouse, IoTs for the photovoltaic farm,
    IoTs for the solar insecticidal lamp, and others. Therefore, the integration and
    adaptation of IoT devices into various levels of agriculture aim to provide two
    goals. The first goal is to provide the reliability of manufacture as well as
    the distribution of the nutrient solution. The second goal is to provide better
    control in term of consumption, which gives the costs low and reduces losses in
    term of solution. In addition to the economic impact, the environmental impact
    will be significantly reduced. The farmer in the green IoT-based agriculture uses
    a digital control system (e.g., Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA))
    for process control to meet agriculture control requirements. To integrate IoTs
    for greenhouse, we propose the sensor and meters nodes for each equipment as follows:
    IoT devices for the water pumping system which takes into consideration the surfaces
    to be irrigated, the pressures to be expected, and the flow rates of drippers.
    Water meters for water storage in order to show real-time updates. IoT devices
    adapted for each filtering equipment (e.g., sand filter) which takes into consideration
    the physical properties of water as well as drippers. Fertilizers meters for the
    storage and injectors of fertilizers (e.g., NPK fertilizers) in order to provide
    real-time updates. IoT devices for controlling the pH and electrical conductivity
    to meet the desired value in term of nutrient solution. Small solar panels with
    IoT sensors for controlling moisture levels and temperature. These IoT devices
    and meters communicate via 5G cellular and satellite communication networks with
    the fog computing layer. B. Fog Computing Layer Since some agriculture IoT data
    need to be processed closer to IoT devices and meters, the fog computing layer
    is proposed especially for this task, which can significantly reduce the processing
    time. This layer is also termed as Edge computing layer. The fog nodes receive
    agriculture IoT data via geo-distributed devices that are managed in a distributed
    network, including, access points, gateway, router, and switch. The fog computing
    layer provides several advantages, such as reduces the traffic overhead and reinforcement
    of agriculture IoT data security [57]. Therefore, there are three hierarchical
    architectures [58] that can be used for fog computing layer in the green IoT-based
    agriculture. The first hierarchical architecture is three-tier (including, Tier
    1-Things/End Devices, Tier 2-Fog, Tier 2-Cloud), which is the basic architecture
    of fog computing. The second hierarchical architecture is four-tier combined fog-cloud
    architecture [59]. The last hierarchical architecture is based on Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN) [60]. For example in the IoT use case in greenhouse, the nutrient
    solution can be processed and calculated at the fog computing layer. This nutrient
    solution uses the IoT data (e.g., the composition of water, temperature, and humidity)
    captured from the agriculture sensors layer. C. Core Network Layer The core layer
    is responsible for the transport of data over green IoT-based agriculture from
    fog computing layer to cloud computing layer. This layer is also termed as the
    foundation or backbone network. To ensure that packets are securely routed over
    the network, the core layer includes high-speed cables (e.g., fiber optic cables)
    and high-end switches (e.g., Cisco switches 12000) [61]. In addition, the core
    network layer is responsible for routing by delivering a strategies-based network
    interconnection such as strategy of QoS, strategy of control broadcast and multicast…etc.
    D. Cloud Computing Layer This layer is a centralized system consists of data centers
    and traditional cloud servers, which they have sufficient computing resources
    and sufficient storage. The cloud computing layer is responsible for delivering
    storage, data access, and synchronization [62]. SECTION III. Threat Models Generally,
    the classification of attacks for IoT application is done using the following
    two criteria: 1) Internal or external and 2) Passive or active, as discussed in
    [19]. Therefore, according to the property that the attack trying to compromise
    nodes in green IoT-based agriculture (i.e., IoT devices, Fog nodes, and Cloud
    nodes), we classify the threat models into the following five main categories,
    attacks against privacy, authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity
    properties, as presented in Fig. 2. FIGURE 2. Threat models in green IoT-based
    agriculture. Show All FIGURE 3. The blockchain data structure. Show All FIGURE
    4. An illustration of blockchain working methodology for green IoT-based agriculture
    architecture. Show All FIGURE 5. Blockchain-based solutions for green IoT-based
    agriculture. BPKI: Blockchain-based PKI solution; BML: Blockchain-based machine
    learning solution; BDKM: Blockchain-based distributed key management solution;

    and trust solution; BAI: Blockchain-based authentication and identification solution;
    BSDN: Blockchain-based secure SDN solution. Show All FIGURE 6. The consensus process
    based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) algorithm for blockchain-based
    agri-products distribution. Show All A. Attacks Against Privacy This category
    of attacks is based on learning the precise location and identity of IoT devices
    at agriculture sensors layer to get privacy data and compromise the privacy of
    the system. In green IoT-based agriculture, the IoT data (e.g., the composition
    of water, temperature, and humidity) is collected multiple times per hour by IoT
    devices and smart meters at agriculture sensors layer to obtain fine-grained information
    about the plants status and improve nutrient solution efficiency. The detailed
    analysis of this IoT data may easily reveal farmers’ physical activities and the
    nutrient solution adopted. For example, in pH settings, if the pH rises excessively
    indicates that the farmer will increase the ammonium supply, and if the pH falls
    indicates that the farmer will reduce the ammonium supply. Using this information,
    an adversary can plan physical attacks (e.g., sending a drone) to disrupt pH settings.
    Obviously, this private information (i.e. pH settings) must be protected from
    unauthorized access. B. Attacks Against Authentication This category of attacks
    forges identities to impersonate as authorized nodes (i.e., IoT device, fog node,
    or cloud node) in order to gain access to the green IoT-based agriculture. For
    example, an adversary may lunch the following identity-based attacks for forge
    identities, namely, replay attack, masquerade attack, spoofing attack, and impersonation
    attack. A replay attack takes place in the form of man-in-the-middle attack (MITM).
    Its objectives in the green IoT-based agriculture are to intercepting data packets
    between IoT devices or an IoT device with an access point at agriculture sensors
    layer and then relaying them to their destinations without modification. The authentication
    protocols for securing IoT networks use three techniques against replay attacks,
    namely, pairing-based cryptography, hash functions, and timestamp in the encrypted
    data, as discussed in [19]. A masquerade attack aims to masquerade as a legitimate
    node to log into the server at agriculture sensors layer (i.e., log into the access
    point) or fog computing layer (i.e., log into the fog node). The authentication
    protocols for securing IoT networks use three techniques against masquerade attacks,
    namely, 1) behavioral features-based biometric (e.g., keystroke, signature, gait,
    or voice), 2) human physiological-based biometric (e.g., fingerprint palm, electrocardiogram,
    eyes, or face), 3) hashing functions, 4) Elliptic curve cryptosystem, and 5) pairing-based
    cryptography [63]. C. Attacks Against Confidentiality This category of attacks
    attempts to adversarially eavesdrop the network traffic between IoT devices or
    an IoT device with an access point at agriculture sensors layer so as to mislead
    the green IoT-based agriculture to compromise the confidentiality and make wrong
    decisions/actions. For example, an adversary may lunch the following Eavesdropping-based
    attacks to compromise the confidentiality, including, tracing attack, brute force
    attack, and known-key attack. A tracing attack aims to collect enough privacy
    information from IoT devices at agriculture sensors layer to link data with a
    particular real identity. To resist this attack, security solutions based on random
    numbers in commitments and proofs ought to be developed [64]. A brute force attack
    aims to produce a list of all possible passwords that can be used by IoT devices
    at agriculture sensors layer, then to exhaust them one by one until the correct
    password can be identified [65]. A known-key attack aims to generate new session
    keys based on compromising past session keys. To resist this attack, security
    solutions that integrate random nonce in session key ought to be developed. D.
    Attacks Against Availability This category takes the form of Denial of Service
    (DoS) attacks. Its goals are to make the services in green IoT-based agriculture
    (e.g., authentication for IoT devices) are unavailable either by (1) flooding
    servers with a huge amount of data to make it busy and unable to provide a service
    to IoT devices; (2) updating with false data injection attacks; or (3) attack
    on accurate localization for UAV with a malicious 5G station. E. Attacks Against
    Integrity This category of attacks implies an unauthorized party to accessing
    and modifying private information (e.g. pH settings). Under this category, we
    can find the following attacks: forgery attack, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack,
    biometric template attack, and trojan horse attack. To resist this attack, the
    data aggregation schemes based on homomorphic encryption and hash functions ought
    to be developed. SECTION IV. Security and Privacy Solutions Table 3 summarizes
    research for security and privacy solutions for IoT applications and how they
    will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. TABLE 3 Summary of Security and
    Privacy Solutions for IoT Applications and How They Will be Adapted for Green
    IoT-Based Agriculture A. Privacy-Preserving Solutions 1) Privacy-Preserving Data
    Aggregation During running the aggregation at the network edge in green IoT-based
    agriculture, the fog devices cannot see each green product data. The privacy-preserving
    data aggregation solution is very important to protect each green IoT device’s
    data. To resist against inject false data, Lu et al. [70] proposed a lightweight
    privacy-preserving data aggregation solution, named LDPA, for IoT applications,
    which can be applied in green IoT-based agriculture. The LDPA combines three cryptographic
    techniques, namely, the homomorphic Paillier encryption Chinese Remainder Theorem,
    and one-way hash chain. The Chinese remainder theorem is used by the control center
    for computing the mean and variance after collecting, aggregating, and forwarding
    IoT devices’ data from the network edge to the control center. The homomorphic
    Paillier encryption is used for encryption the report of each sensing data from
    each IoT device. The one-way hash chain technique is used for achieving lightweight
    authentication among IoT devices. Therefore, the LDPA solution can resist against
    the false data injection since the one-way hash chain technique as well as the
    time slot are adapted in authentication phase between the fog device and IoT device.
    In addition, the LDPA solution can achieve differential privacy since some noises
    are added in the aggregated data. Guan et al. [75] introduced an anonymous and
    privacy-preserving data aggregation protocol, named APPA, for IoT application.
    The system model considers Fog-enhanced IoT, which contains three layers, namely,
    the lower layer (smart devices), middle layer (Fog nodes), and Upper layer (Cloud
    Computing). To archives anonymity and unforgeability, the APPA protocol uses two
    cryptographic techniques, namely, signature-of-knowledge and paillier cryptosystem.
    The APPA protocol can resist eavesdropping attack and false data injection attack,
    but the availability is not considered. 2) Location Privacy Location-based services
    (LBS) in green IoT-based agriculture will have a very important area for research
    with the rapid development of smart agriculture. Therefore, an adversary can track
    IoT devices in smart agriculture, which may cause problems of loss of privacy.
    Sun et al. [69] proposed a location privacy algorithm for IoT application, which
    can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. To protect location privacy, the
    study uses a dummy location privacy algorithm, which consists of finding an optimal
    set of dummy locations using a greedy approach. The proposed algorithm can resist
    two attacks categories, namely, inference attacks and colluding attacks, but the
    data integrity and authentication are not considered. 3) Content-Oriented Protection
    The content-oriented protection solution is very important against the violation
    of a farmer’s privacy when different IoT data are collected and combined from
    agriculture sensors layer. Gai et al. [72] proposed a dynamic privacy protection
    model, named DPP, for ensuring mobile device user privacy in IoT application.
    The idea of DPP model is based on the classification of the privacy protection
    levels. Specifically, the DPP model uses three main phases, including, (1) security
    classifications for the definition of the privacy weight; (2) content-oriented
    data pairs identification of content-oriented data pairs based on the security
    classifications; and (3) the input data table. The evaluation performance in term
    of plan generation and timing constraints show that the DPP’s average time consumption
    is 1.2% shorter than other related works. 4) Anonymity One of the important security
    properties in green IoT-based agriculture is strong anonymity, which means that
    except for the fog nodes, the agriculture IoT data identity cannot be revealed.
    The CPAL solution proposed by Lai et al. [66] archives user anonymity in IoT application
    using the hybrid linear combination encryption. The CPAL solution defined the
    privacy-preservation with three levels, including, authorized anonymous user linking,
    anonymity, and authentication. Therefore, the CPAL solution can be adapted for
    green IoT-based agriculture by applying the hybrid linear combination encryption
    between the IoT devices communications at agriculture sensors layer. In addition,
    the CPAL solution is robust against impersonation attack and DoS attack. 5) Privacy-Preserving
    Trust Evaluation Privacy-preserving trust evaluation is an important role to ensures
    trust relationships among green IoT-based agriculture entities. Yan et al. [68]
    proposed two schemes of privacy-preserving trust evaluation that can be adapted
    for green IoT-based agriculture. These two schemes use additive homomorphic encryption
    for providing trust evaluation. The first scheme considers that authorized proxy
    is a fully trusted and collusion does not exist between evaluation party and authorized
    proxy. The second scheme considers that authorized proxy is not fully trusted
    and evaluation party and authorized proxy don’t collude. In both schemes, there
    is a trust evaluation phase, which after receiving the encrypted evidence, a node
    decrypts data and then evaluates the trust of the result using a trust evaluation
    algorithm. 6) Personalized Privacy Personalized privacy consists of providing
    trapdoor indistinguishability and index indistinguishability. The work by Li et
    al. [78] proposed a searchable encryption scheme for personalized privacy in IoT
    application, which can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. The proposed
    scheme considers an IoT network model that includes three entities, i.e., the
    data owner, cloud server, and data user. The cloud server is used to stores and
    retrieves the encrypted file features, which it received the encrypted file features
    from the data owner. Based on the specific keyword, the data user queries the
    encrypted file features. The proposed scheme is proven using two challenge-response
    games that it satisfies trapdoor indistinguishability and index indistinguishability
    under chosen keyword-file feature level pair attack. Therefore, the proposed scheme
    can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture by adapting a searchable encryption
    scheme using the following five functions: 1) Setup for performing the security
    parameters; 2) KeyGen for generating the private and public keys; 3) Store for
    creating the index table and user authorization; 4) Trapdoor for creating the
    trapdoor query; and 5) Search. The Setup and Store functions are run by the fog
    node. The KeyGen function is run by the fog node and the IoT device. The Trapdoor
    function is run by the IoT device. The Search function is performed interactively
    between the IoT device and the cloud server. B. Data Integrity Solutions To protect
    data integrity and authentication for IoT applications, Song et al. [2] proposed
    a privacy-preserving protocol that uses message authentication codes (MAC). The
    MAC solution is added to the original IoT data, which the sender can verify that
    the IoT data has not tampered during communication. This solution can be applied
    in green IoT-based agriculture (i.e., between a group of IoT devices and fog device)
    in order to protect the integrity of the green IoT device’s data. Wang et al.
    [71] proposed a lightweight label-based access control scheme, named LACS, for
    IoT-based 5G network, which can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. The
    LACS scheme uses two parts, including, the prover (caching fog node) and the verifier
    (caching server). The user authentication is achieved using verifying data integrity.
    The label-based authentication is used against two attacks, namely, disturbing
    attack and ignoring attack. The performance evaluation shows that the MD5 is more
    efficient than the SHA-1 in the IoT environment that uses LACS scheme. The work
    by Li et al. [80] can provide content integrity verification for named data networking,
    which can be adapted for communication among agriculture IoT nodes in green IoT-based
    agriculture. Specifically, the authors proposed a lightweight integrity verification
    architecture, named LIVE, for ensuring secure content access. The LIVE architecture
    uses the following three security levels: (1) Non-Cacheable; (2) 1-Cacheable;
    (3) All-Cacheable. To produce tokens for signature generation, the LIVE architecture
    uses a hash tree based signature algorithm (Merkle Hash Tree algorithm). C. Authentication
    Solutions 1) RFID Authentication Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology
    used for capturing and automatically identifying information in electronic tags.
    With the adaptation of RFID technology into green IoT-based agriculture, the crops
    will better be controlled and herd better monitored. Therefore, an unauthorized
    party can manage the RFID-tag, which the smart agriculture system will be compromised.
    Gope et al. [73] proposed an anonymous lightweight RFID authentication solution
    for IoT application. Specifically, the network model considered by the study is
    based on four entities, including, two servers (i.e., an authenticated cloud and
    a backend database), a reader, and an RFID-tag. Based on unlinkable pseudo-identity,
    emergency key, and hash function, the proposed solution can resist against the
    following five attacks: replay attack, forgery attack, cloning attack, DoS attack,
    and location tracking attack. In addition, this solution can achieve five security
    properties, namely, mutual authentication, tag anonymity, availability, and scalability,
    but false data injection attack, as well as DDoS attack, are not considered. 2)
    Delegated Authentication Since agriculture IoT data can be transported via untrusted
    public devices, the security solutions need to provide the delegated authentication.
    The work by Zhang et al. [77] proposed a semi-outsourcing privacy-preserving scheme,
    named SOPP, for the IoT data collection. The SOPP scheme considers three components,
    including, data center, public (untrusted) clouds, and IoT devices. To decreases
    the throughput and achieves a longer battery duration, the SOPP scheme applied
    elliptic curve cryptography as a one-way (non-interactive) authentication between
    untrusted public clouds and IoT devices. To block invalid access, the authentication
    is delegated to public clouds. The data center uses data decryption to provides
    data integrity. D. Access Control Solutions To supporting privacy-preserving in
    green IoT-based agriculture, an efficient access control scheme can be adapted.
    The work by Fan et al. [76] designed an access control protocol for fog-enabled
    IoT. The study considered cloud-fog computing that contains five entities, including,
    a cloud service provider, a group of fog nodes, a group of data owners, a certificate
    authority, and a group of IoT devices. For providing revocation and data confidentiality
    with verifiability, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption is adapted when
    an IoT device with an identifier submits a data access request. The the blockchain
    technology [39] can be used for providing an access control in green IoT-based
    agriculture. Ouaddah et al. [81] proposed an access control framework, named FairAccess,
    for IoT application. The FairAccess framework uses the blockchain technology to
    get, grant, delegate, and revoke access. Zhang et al. [74] consider an IoT system
    with a large number of storage devices, servers, user devices, IoT gateways. Specifically,
    the study proposed an access control framework based on the Ethereum smart contract
    platform. This platform contains five main elements, including, smart contract,
    account/address, blockchain, transaction and message, and mining. To manage the
    policies and implement access control, the proposed framework provides functions
    or application binary interfaces (e.g., add new access control policy, updates
    the policy, returns the access result and penalty…etc.). The evaluation performance
    on two Raspberry Pi 3 Model B shows that the proposed framework may not be able
    to reflect the overhead in real-world IoT system. E. Data Confidentiality Solutions
    Data security in green IoT-based agriculture also includes confidentiality, which
    can be achieved by cipher-text based access control technique. Yao et al. [67]
    proposed a lightweight attribute-based encryption scheme for IoT application,
    which can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. To provide data confidentiality
    with integrity, the proposed scheme uses an elliptic curve integrated encryption
    scheme (ECDH). Specifically, the ECDH scheme is used for generating a sharing
    secret from two groups, including, the MAC key and encryption key. The performance
    evaluation in term of overhead (the total size of the private key, public key,
    and cipher-text) shows that the proposed scheme is much shorter than other related
    cryptographic methods that use decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent. In
    addition, the proposed scheme is robust against chosen plaintext and attribute-set
    attack. SECTION V. Privacy-Preserving Over Blockchain The blockchain technology
    can be effectively applied in almost all domains of IoT, including, green IoT-based
    agriculture [39], [82]–[85]. The application of blockchain technology for IoT
    is applied to provide privacy-preserving. To be specific, the blockchain is used
    for encrypted data sharing. Therefore, the blockchain can be used in green IoT-based
    agriculture as a distributed digital ledger containing all messages. This distributed
    ledger is replicated and stored in different IoT nodes at agriculture sensors
    layer, as presented in Fig. 6. Table 4 summarizes research for privacy-oriented
    blockchain-based solutions for IoT applications and how they will be adapted for
    green IoT-based agriculture. According to the characteristic of each privacy-oriented
    blockchain-based solution, we classify the blockchain-based solutions for green
    IoT-based agriculture into six categories, including, 1) Blockchain-based machine
    learning solution; 2) Blockchain-based distributed key management solution; 3)
    Blockchain-based access control solution; 4) Blockchain-based reputation and trust
    solution; 5) Blockchain-based authentication and identification solution, and
    6) Blockchain-based secure SDN solution, as presented in Fig. 5. TABLE 4 Summary
    of Privacy-Oriented Blockchain-Based Solutions for IoT Applications and How They
    Will be Adapted for Green IoT-Based Agriculture A. Blockchain-Based Solutions
    1) Blockchain-Based PKI Solution Jiang et al. [79] proposed a thin-client Authentication
    scheme, named PTAS, for IoT application. The PTAS scheme is applied in blockchain-based
    public key infrastructure (PKI). The PKI infrastructure is used to secure communication
    between IoT devices, which a certificate authority distribute certificates (a
    public key (PK) and identity (ID)) to IoT devices. To solve the problem of the
    single point of failure, the PTAS scheme is adapted in blockchain-based PKI. Specifically,
    the PTAS scheme uses the method of private information retrieval, which the identity
    of the user can be hidden in k indistinguishable identities. In addition, the
    PTAS scheme is robust against three attacks, namely, Sybil attack, eclipse attack,
    and 51% attack. 2) Blockchain-Based Machine Learning Solution The work by Shen
    et al. [91] proposed a privacy-preserving scheme, named secureSVM, for IoT application.
    The secureSVM scheme considers the data privacy of training support vector machine
    classifier (SVM) using blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. To protect the privacy
    of IoT data, the secureSVM scheme employs a public-key cryptosystem, Paillier,
    which is an additive homomorphic cryptosystem. The secureSVM scheme is robust
    against two threat models, including, known ciphertext model and known background
    model. The secureSVM scheme can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. The
    blockchain-based IoT platform can be installed at the agriculture sensors layer
    and IoT data analysts at fog computing layer. The adaptation is summarized by
    the following steps: Step 1: Agriculture sensor nodes use sensing and transmitting
    valuable data through wireless; Step 2: Each access point collect data from the
    agriculture sensor nodes; Step 3: Each access point encrypts data using partially
    homomorphic encryption; Step 4: Each access point records the encrypted data on
    the blockchain; Step 5: Each access point uses the built-in consensus mechanism
    for validating the data; Step 6: Fog nodes communicate with an access point to
    obtain parameters of the training SVM classifier. 3) Blockchain-Based Distributed
    Key Management Solution The blockchain is used in key management architecture
    for eliminating the drawback of introducing a third party. Ma et al. [92] introduced
    a blockchain-based distributed key management architecture, named BDKMA, for IoT
    application. To achieve hierarchical access control, the BDKMA architecture uses
    security access managers for operating the blockchain. Specifically, the BDKMA
    architecture is based on the idea of authorization assignment mode and group access
    pattern. The BDKMA architecture can be applied to the network model composed of
    a device layer, a fog layer, and a cloud layer. The adaptation of BDKMA architecture
    in green IoT-based agriculture is summarized by the following steps: Step 1: Each
    agriculture sensor nodes selects its private key and generates the public key,
    encryption key, and secret access key; Step 2: Each agriculture sensor nodes packages
    encrypted secret access key and then signs and broadcasts the transaction to access
    point; Step 3: Each access point at agriculture sensors layer collects the transactions
    of the agriculture sensor nodes; Step 4: Each access point uses the built-in consensus
    mechanism for validating the data; Step 5: An agriculture sensor node obtain access
    permission from access point using an access query transaction; Step 6: An agriculture
    sensor node periodically update the access keys and sends a key update transaction
    to the access point; 4) Blockchain-Based Access Control Solution To provide scalable
    access management in IoT application, Novo [87] proposed a distributed access
    control architecture using blockchain technology. The access control policies
    are enforced by the blockchain platform. The adaptation of proposed architecture
    in green IoT-based agriculture can bring the following six advantages to access
    control: transparency, scalability, lightweight, concurrency, accessibility, and
    mobility. The adaptation of proposed architecture is summarized in the following
    steps: Step 1: Fog node deploys the smart contract into the blockchain network
    at fog computing layer; Step 2: To be registered as a manager, each access point
    at agriculture sensors layer request the address of the smart contract; Step 3:
    To transfer the management control of an agriculture sensor device, an access
    point at agriculture sensors layer requests the agriculture sensor device’s address
    and the blockchain address of the smart contract; Step 4: An access point at agriculture
    sensors layer enforces the policy creating a transaction towards the smart contract;
    Step 5: An access point at agriculture sensors layer adds an existing policy.
    Ding et al. [94] proposed a attribute-based access control scheme for IoT application,
    which can be adapted for greenhouse. According to the identity or ability of each
    IoT devices, attribute authorities describe a set of attributes to each IoT devices.
    The blockchain is used to record the distribution of these attributes. The adaptation
    of this attribute-based access control scheme for blockchain-based greenhouse
    is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: Greenhouse miner generates a pair
    of public and secret key for each IoT devices; Step 2: Greenhouse miner sends
    both keys in a secure channel based on identity-based cryptography; Step 3: Each
    IoT devices uses an address along with its ID and then generate a corresponding
    address based on the hash algorithm; Step 4: IoT device inside greenhouse generates
    new block and broadcasts to the other consortium nodes using the practical Byzantine
    fault tolerance; Step 5: When IoT device wants to send to another device, they
    use identity-based authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol. Dorri et al.
    [34] introduced a smart home tier based on the blockchain technology, which can
    be adapted for greenhouse. The network model of the blockchain-based greenhouse
    is composed of the following components: transactions, local blockchain, greenhouse
    miner, and local storage. The adaptation of blockchain-based greenhouse is summarized
    in the following steps: Step 1: Greenhouse miner generates a key with an IoT device;
    Step 2: Greenhouse miner shares the key and stores it in the genesis transaction;
    Step 3: Greenhouse miner defines the policy header and adds it to the first block;
    Step 4: Each IoT device inside greenhouse communicate with another internal device
    using the permission from the miner; Step 5: Each IoT device inside greenhouse
    can store data on the cloud storage using the permission from the miner; Step
    6: When IoT device wants to send to another external device, a Virtual Private
    Network (VPN) connection is used to routes the packets to the shared miner. 5)
    Blockchain-Based Reputation and Trust Solution Dedeoglu et al. [93] proposed a
    reputation and trust mechanism for blockchain-based IoT applications, which can
    be adapted for greenhouse. The proposed model verifying transactions based on
    three key layers, namely the application layer, the blockchain layer, and the
    data layer. The adaptation of blockchain-based greenhouse for trust architecture
    is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: IoT device inside greenhouse generates
    blocks in periodic intervals. The generation is based on the public key and the
    signature of the data source; Step 2: IoT device sends the blocks to greenhouse
    miner at agriculture sensors layer; Step 3: Greenhouse miner validates the blocks
    based on the number of validator node and the reputation of the block generating
    node. To realize reliable storage and sharing of IoT information in green IoT-based
    agriculture, the work by Si et al. [95] is a security mechanism that can be adapted
    for smart agriculture. The proposed mechanism is based on blockchain technology,
    which is applied in three layers, including, the application layer, the transport
    layer, and the sensing layer. The application layer is mainly used by the cloud
    service. The data blockchain part is installed in the fog computing layer. In
    addition, the proposed mechanism uses a double-chain model with tamper-proof of
    data in the data blockchain. Zhou et al. [88] proposed a threshold secure multi-party
    computing protocol, TSMPC, for blockchain-based threshold IoT system. The TSMPC
    protocol extends Shamir’s (t, n)-secret sharing (SSS) [97]. Specifically, the
    TSMPC protocol is applied between a leader and n server, which can be adapted
    for green IoT-based agriculture. The network model is composed of n servers, the
    leader’s device, and a leader. The performance evaluation on the Ethereum blockchain
    shows that a block can record transactions of at most 62,360 bytes. Therefore,
    the adaptation of a threshold secure multi-party computing protocol for green
    IoT-based agriculture is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: A fog computing
    node generates an initialize transaction with a verification key and sends it
    to the blockchain network; Step 2: IoT sensor node at agriculture sensors layer
    verify the transaction’s verification key; Step 3: An access point at agriculture
    sensors layer verifies core shares, which can obtain a reward from the fog computing
    node. 6) Blockchain-Based Authentication and Identification Solution To ensure
    authentication and robust identification of IoT devices in IoT application, Hammi
    et al. [89] proposed an original decentralized system, called bubbles of trust
    , which can be applied for green IoT-based agriculture. Based on the blockchain
    technology, the bubbles of trust system create secure virtual zones (bubbles),
    which can protect the availability and data integrity. The bubbles of trust system
    is resistant against four attacks, namely, Sybil attack, spoofing attack, DoS/DDoS
    attack, and replay attack. Therefore, the adaptation of bubbles of trust system
    for green IoT-based agriculture consists of creating secure virtual zones inside
    the agriculture sensors layer, where devices can communicate securely. Specifically,
    each device at agriculture sensors layer must communicate only with devices of
    its zone. The communications between devices are considered as transactions and
    must be validated by this blockchain network. 7) Blockchain-Based Secure SDN Solution
    To facilitate software and hardware updates for green IoT-based agriculture, software-defined
    networking (SDN) is used, which allows easy control and management in a central
    location. To detect any false injection data, a blockchain-based secure SDN architecture
    is adapted. Derhab et al. [96] proposed two security components, namely, 1) Blockchain-based
    integrity checking system (BICS) 2) Intrusion detection system (IDS). These two
    systems are combined for SDN-architecture, which can be adapted for green IoT-based
    agriculture. The adaptation is summarized in the following steps: Step 1: Integrate
    the SDN controller into the cloud computing layer; Step 2: Integrate a Virtual
    Switch (vSwitch) into the fog computing layer Step 3: Integrate an IDS system
    into the access point at agriculture sensors layer. To detect cyber attacks, the
    IDS system combines two machine learning classifiers, namely, K-Nearest Neighbors
    and random subspace learning; Step 4: The SDN controller creates blocks and shares
    it via the blockchain; Step 5: The Firewall check the rules from vSwitch and blockchain.
    To provides scalability within the current IoT application, the SDN and blockchains
    technology are combined by the work Sharma et al. [86]. Specifically, the work
    proposed a secure SDN architecture, named DistBlockNet, which is based on the
    blockchain technology. The DistBlockNet architecture interconnects a distributed
    blockchain network with the controllers. Each local network includes Shelter modules,
    OrchApp, and Controller. To maintains the updated flow rules table information,
    the distributed blockchain network uses the request/response and controller/verification
    nodes. The performance evaluation shows that DistBlockNet architecture is robust
    against DDoS/DoS attacks and cache poising/ARP spoofing. The adaptation of DistBlockNet
    architecture in green IoT-based agriculture is summarized by the following steps:
    Step 1: Integrate Shelter and OrchApp modules into the cloud computing layer;
    Step 2: Integrate the distributed blockchain network into the fog computing layer;
    Step 3: Interconnect the distributed blockchain network with the controllers at
    fog computing layer; Step 4: IoT sensor node at agriculture sensors layer sends
    data to the controllers. B. Consensus Algorithms for Blockchain-Based Solutions
    A consensus algorithm can be defined as the mechanism by which a Blockchain network
    achieves consensus. The public blockchains (i.e., decentralized) are built as
    distributed systems and, since they do not depend on a central authority, the
    distributed nodes must agree on the validity of transactions using a consensus
    algorithm. Table 5 summarizes consensus algorithms for Blockchain-based solutions
    and how they will be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture. TABLE 5 Summary
    of Consensus Algorithms for Blockchain-Based Solutions and How They Will be Adapted
    for Green IoT-Based Agriculture 1) Proof-of-Work (PoW) The PoW is a consensus
    algorithm introduced by Bitcoin and widely used by other cryptocurrencies. This
    consensus is called “Mining”, which the nodes in the IoT network are called “Miners”
    [98]. Specifically, the PoW algorithm is presented as a response to a mathematical
    problem, which requires considerable work, but is usually easily checked once
    the answer is obtained. A miner node continuously tests a variety of unique values
    (known as nonce) until an appropriate value is produced [123]. The minor node
    that solves the puzzle extracts the succeeding block, then adds it to the blockchain
    network and confirms the transactions, and receives the compensation for the block.
    The PoW can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture,
    which each access point at agriculture sensors layer is selected as miners in
    order to calculate the hash values for validating blocks. This adaptation ensures
    that access points are encouraged to maintain the blockchain network, as they
    are compensated for their efforts. The disadvantage of the PoW algorithm for green
    IoT-based agriculture is that computational resources require a lot of energy
    to validate the blocks. 2) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) The PoS is a distributed consensus
    algorithm (used by Peercoin [99] and Nxt [100]) that requires the user to prove
    that they have a specific quantity of currency to validate any additional blocks
    in the blockchain network and to be awarded the reward. Compared to the PoW algorithm,
    the PoS is not computationally costly for validators, but it is vulnerable to
    nothing-at-stake problem. The PoS can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution
    for green IoT-based agriculture, which all IoT nodes in agriculture sensors layer
    are selected as the validators. 3) Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) The DPoS is
    a consensus algorithm (used by BitShares [101] and Steemit [102]) that restricts
    the number of nodes in a blockchain network to a small number of entities chosen
    by token owners. These delegates are responsible for the following three paid
    tasks: 1) implementing changes to the blockchain network, 2) recording transactions,
    and 3) ensuring the integrity of the registry. The DPoS algorithm can be adapted
    by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each access
    point at agriculture sensors layer is selected as a delegate. This adaptation
    ensures that access points provide an efficient, fast, decentralized consensus
    algorithm. 4) Delayed Proof-of-Work (DPoW) The DPoW is a consensus algorithm designed
    by the Komodo project [103], which is a modified version of the Proof of Work
    consensus algorithm. The DPoW algorithm is based on the idea of notary nodes,
    which are used to record data to the blockchain network (e.g., Bitcoin). The DPoW
    can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture,
    which all fog nodes in fog computing layer are selected as notary nodes and all
    IoT nodes in agriculture sensors layer are selected as as normal nodes. This adaptation
    ensures that it is impossible to reorganize notarized blocks, which makes blockchains
    more secure and resistant to attacks 51%. 5) Proof-of-Activity (PoAC) The PoAC
    algorithm (used by Decred [109]) is an extension of the Bitcoin protocol, which
    is based on combining Proof of Work component with a Proof of Stake type of system.
    The PoAC can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture
    as follows [124]. 1) Each fog node (miner) at fog computing layer uses his hashing
    power to generate an empty block header. 2) The fog node broadcasts her block
    header to IoT devices at agriculture sensors layer. 3) All IoT devices at agriculture
    sensors layer derive N pseudorandom stakeholders using the hash of the block header.
    4) Every stakeholder at agriculture sensors layer checks whether the empty block
    header that the fog node broadcasted is valid. 6) Proof-of-Authority (PoA) The
    PoA is a reputation-based consensus algorithm (used by POA.Network [106] and VeChain
    [107]) for private blockchain networks. The PoA consensus algorithm is based on
    the value of identity, which means that the validators use their own reputation
    to validate the blocks. The PoA can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution
    for green IoT-based agriculture, which all fog nodes in fog computing layer are
    selected as validators. This adaptation ensures a limited number of block validators,
    which provides a highly scalable system. 7) Proof-of-Importance (PoI) The PoI
    is a consensus algorithm proposed by NEM [113]. The PoI can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each IoT devices at agriculture
    sensors layer are assigned an importance score. The IoT devices with high scores
    of importance have a higher chance of harvesting a block. The transaction graph
    topology can be used as an input into the importance of an IoT device. 8) Proof-of-Weight
    (PoWE) The PoWe is proposed by Gilad et al. [110], which is based on the Algorand
    consensus model. The Algorand uses a Byzantine agreement protocol to reach consensus
    on the blockchain network. The users are selected randomly using verifiable random
    functions. Algorand users use a protocol to communicate, which assigns a weight
    to each user according to the tokens they hold. The users’ weights are used to
    chooses committee members randomly among all users. The PoWe can be adapted by
    a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which an Algorand
    protocol assigns a weight to each farmer according to the tokens they hold. This
    adaptation ensures resistance to Sybil attacks and achieves scalability but reducing
    the incentive since it’s very difficult to be rewarded. 9) Proof-of-Burn (PoB)
    The PoB algorithm (used by Slimcoin [111]) is similar to a proof of work algorithm
    but with reduced energy consumption rates. The PoB network block validation process
    does not require the use of powerful computing resources and does not depend on
    powerful extraction equipment. Instead, Coins are deliberately burned and this
    is a way to “invest” resources in the blockchain, so that candidate miners are
    not required to invest physical resources. By burning Coins, users are able to
    demonstrate their engagement with the network, which can obtain the right to mine
    and validate transactions [125]. The PoB can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each fog node at fog computing
    layer sends coins to a burn address. 10) Proof-of-Capacity (PoC) The PoC is very
    similar to the PoW algorithm, which the storage is used instead of computation.
    The PoC (used by Burstcoin [104]) allows the mining nodes to use the free space
    on their hard disk. The PoC can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for
    green IoT-based agriculture, where each fog nodes at fog computing layer are selected
    as miners since they have high storage compared to nodes at agriculture sensors
    layer. To validating the blocs and winning the mining reward, the fog nodes involve
    a two-step process, including, plotting and mining. 11) Proof of Elapsed Time
    (POET) The POET is a consensus algorithm frequently applied on the permissioned
    blockchain networks to decide on mining authorizations. The POET is based on the
    idea of “Elapsed Time”, where each node involved in the system is expected to
    wait for a randomly selected period of time, and the first node to complete the
    designated waiting time wins the new block. The POET can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture, which each IoT device at agriculture
    sensors layer generates a random wait time and sleeps for a fixed period of time.
    For more details about the PoET algorithm, we refer the reader to the Hyperledger
    Sawtooth project [112]. 12) Proof-of-Reputation (PoR) The PoR algorithm (used
    by GoChain [115]) is similar to PoA algorithm, which it is based on the reputations
    of the IoT nodes. An IoT node in the green IoT-based agriculture must have a reputation
    important enough to be voted as an authoritative node. Once an authoritative node
    is voted, he can sign and validate blocks in the blockchain network. 13) Practical
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) The PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
    algorithm is the first to be able to tolerate “Byzantine” faults, which is proposed
    by Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov in 1999 [126]. This algorithm provides reliability
    and robustness properties in a synchronous environment and requires N=3f+1 replicas
    to tolerate simultaneous Byzantine faults. The PBFT algorithm can be effectively
    applied in almost all domains of IoT, including, Internet of Energy [118], Internet
    of Drones [120], Internet of Vehicles [127],…etc. Therefore, the PBFT algorithm
    can be adapted by a Blockchain-based solution for green IoT-based agriculture,
    as presented in Fig. 6. Specifically, when a farmer buyer node wants to buy a
    product from agri-products sellers, they send its request to the fog node. This
    fog node creates a PRE-PREPARE message to propose to the other replicas the scheduling
    of the bloc. The correct replicas respond to the PRE-PREPARE with a PREPARE message,
    which is sent to all replicas (i.e., neighbor nodes). Once the neighbor nodes
    have received 2f PREPARE and the associated PRE-PREPARE, then they agree on the
    order of the farmer buyer node’s request. At the end, the neighbor nodes send
    a VALIDATION message to all replicas. Once a replica has received 2f+1 VALIDATION,
    then it executes the request and responds to both farmer buyer node and agri-products
    seller. If the client does not receive a response after a specified time period,
    he forwards the request to all replicas. When a replica receives a request, it
    starts view-change. Note that there are more variations of PBFT algorithm such
    as Aardvark [128], Zyzzyva [129], HQ [130], Q/U [131], and Abstract [132]. 14)
    Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT) The dBFT algorithm is a consensus method
    (used by Neo [116]) where all users elect nodes, called bookkeepers, who are responsible
    for adding new blocks to the blockchain. This elected node group can be updated
    regularly. The vote is weighted by the amount of cryptocurrency owned. Each bookkeeper
    is randomly selected to propose a block. This node is called a speaker. The bookkeepers
    become speakers in turn by random drawing. The speaker checks the signatures and
    the validity of transactions and then collects them in a block. The speaker proposes
    his block to all the other bookkeepers. Afterward, the bookkeepers verify the
    block and then each one vote in favor or against the block. The consensus is reached
    when at least 66% of bookkeepers vote in favor of the block and it is then added
    to the blockchain. The dBFT algorithm can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture
    by applying a voting system in agriculture sensors layer to choose delegates and
    speaker among IoT devices. 15) Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) The SCP protocol
    (used by Stellar Consensus [114]) is based on federated Byzantine agreement (FBA).
    The nodes exchange a series of votes to confirm and accept a value. For this purpose,
    the SCP protocol determines a minimum quorum. The “quorum” is a set of nodes that
    are sufficient to reach an agreement. Each node chooses one or more quorum slices
    and includes in each slice the nodes in which it has confidence. Each quorum slice
    will then produce interactions with each other. To reach an agreement, the SCP
    protocol uses the idea of quorum intersection. A federated Byzantine agreement
    system enjoys quorum intersection if any two of its quorums share a node. The
    SCP protocol can be adapted for green IoT-based agriculture by applying a voting
    system in agriculture sensors layer to choose quorum and quorum slice among IoT
    devices and then use quorum intersection to guarantee agreement. 16) Other Consensus
    Algorithms There are other consensus algorithms that can be adapted by a Blockchain-based
    solution for green IoT-based agriculture. We cite the following nine consensus
    algorithms: Byteball consensus [133], Mokka consensus [134], SPECTRE consensus
    [135], Block-Lattice consensus [136], Hashgraph consensus [137], Tangle consensus
    [138], Directed Acyclic Graphs (used by Iota [139]), Proof of Believability (used
    by IOST [140]), and RAFT consensus [141]. SECTION VI. Challenges To complete our
    overview, we outline research challenges that could improve the security and privacy
    solutions for IoT-based agriculture, summarized in the following recommendations:
    A. Machine Learning Techniques for Intrusion Detection Systems Intrusion detection
    systems (IDSs) are implemented along with other security systems such as authentication
    and access control techniques using encryption mechanisms to protect systems against
    cyber attacks. Using data mining and machine learning techniques (e.g., Deep learning,
    Random forests, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes,…etc), IDSs can differentiate
    between normal and malicious actions. The implementation of IDSs for IoT-based
    agriculture as a software application will able to identify security incidents.
    Therefore, the question we ask here is: how to choose the right machine learning
    technique among different types (i.e., reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning,
    or supervised learning)? We believe that a comparative study of machine learning
    techniques for cyber security intrusion detection is needed for IoT-based agriculture.
    B. Dataset for Intrusion Detection in IoT-Based Agriculture Scenarios The datasets
    for cyber security are so important in intrusion detection, which are used for
    testing the performance of IDSs. Actually, most and recent IDSs are tested with
    KDD 1999 [142], NSL-KDD [143], CICIDS2017 [144], Bot-IoT [145], and CSE-CIC-IDS2018
    [146]. These datasets are not simulated for IoT-based agriculture scenarios. A
    possible research direction in this topic could be related to developing a new
    dataset to build a network intrusion detector under IoT-based agriculture environment.
    C. Scalability Analysis of Blockchain-Based Solutions To solve security and privacy
    problems (e.g., access control, reputation, trust,…etc), we have seen that a blockchain-based
    solution brings advantages for IoT application. The application of a blockchain-based
    solution for IoT-based agriculture requires a study on the characteristics of
    the implementation. Therefore, there are many characteristics should be taken
    under consideration when a blockchain-based solution is proposed for IoT-based
    agriculture, such as scalability issues when the number of participating nodes
    at agriculture sensors layer is increased. Thus, one of the challenges that should
    receive more attention in the future is to provide a scalability analysis of blockchain-based
    solutions for IoT-based agriculture. D. How to Pick the Best Consensus Algorithm
    The performance of a blockchain-based solution for IoT-based agriculture is related
    to the effectiveness of the consensus algorithm. Therefore, since IoT devices
    at agriculture sensors layer are not always able to satisfy the high computational
    and energy requirements when addressing the validation of blocks and the storage
    of blockchain, consensus-efficient issues arise as follows: If the PoW algorithm
    is used, how to integrate a miner in each greenhouse for processing incoming and
    outgoing transactions? If the stellar consensus algorithm is used, how to design
    a voting system in agriculture sensors layer to choose quorum and quorum slice
    among IoT devices and then use quorum intersection to guarantee agreement? If
    the dBFT algorithm is used, how to design a voting system in agriculture sensors
    layer to choose bookkeepers and speaker among IoT devices? E. Design of Practical
    and Compatible Cryptographic Protocols In some cases of green IoT-based agriculture,
    it is not necessary to use blockchain to solve security and privacy problems (e.g.,
    identity anonymity), which there are many other better solutions such as practical
    and compatible cryptographic solution. Therefore, a new cryptographic solution
    is proposed recently by Yang et al. [147] for the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast,
    which they use the format-preserving encryption (FPE) and lightweight broadcast
    authentication protocol (TESLA) to achieve the identity anonymity. However, resource
    and power-constrained IoT devices at agriculture sensors layer are not always
    capable of meeting the substantial computational and power consumption in the
    processing of new cryptographic solution. Therefore, the design of practical and
    compatible cryptographic protocols is one of the significant research challenges
    in green IoT-based agriculture. F. Resiliency Against Specific Attacks in the
    Context of Low-Resource IoT Devices The threat models discussed in the environment
    of IoT-based agriculture and the key security problem is different in distinct
    smart agriculture applications. Sometimes, the specific problem does not exist
    in an IoT application, and it is meaningless to take combined attacks into consideration.
    The methods to solve attacks can be integrated together to solve problems in an
    application. To propose a scheme against a kind of attack in a smart agriculture
    application, the attack should be specific and defined at the beginning. The most
    important question that may arise is how to develop a new security strategy that
    can resist combined attacks while considering the practicability of deploying
    the solution, particularly in the context of low-resource IoT devices at agriculture
    sensors layer. G. Counter Measures Against 5G Network Slicing Threats 5G networks
    will be facilitators of IoT based agriculture applications, especially in the
    sensors layer (See Figure 1). 5G adopt network slicing as a means of partitioning
    the physical and network resources to optimally group the different traffic, isolate
    from other tenants and configure the network resources. The logical partitioning
    of network slicing divides and separates a single common physical network into
    various virtual, complete E2E networks and offers complete isolation for these
    virtual networks from each other in terms of access, transport, device and core
    network. The main advantage of Network Slicing is that now MNOs can configure
    and apply tailor-made customization of their network resources to accommodate
    different users and different traffic classes, and hence differentiated services.
    Security of Network Slicing plays a significant role for the control and the coordination
    among different slices and for function of the related mechanisms that are responsible
    for the inter-network slices communication and the coordination between user and
    control plane. A security leakage that is related to the inter-slice communication
    functionality can lead to disruption of the inter-slice communication. Moreover,
    authentication for the identification of the privileged users in order to prevent
    impersonation attacks against slices seems to be critical for the proper control
    of the network resources. Furthermore, the provision of differentiated services
    is also related to the provision of different security level of services among
    the slices. However, this must not affect the security level of another slice.
    In addition, DoS attacks focus on the possible exhaustion of network resources
    to lead in unavailability of network provisioned services [148]. These attacks
    must be dealt with a multi layered security framework that includes traditional
    methods, e.g. IDS and field specific solutions, e.g. slice isolation. H. Deploying
    IoT in Agriculture As we mentioned in Section II, IoT in agriculture can be envisioned
    in different layers and from different perspectives. In this subsection, we try
    to summarize and emphasize the different conditions that exist in an agricultural
    environment that make the deployment of IoT challenging. When talking about the
    WSNs, the specific characteristics of the environment, in which the nodes will
    be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles in farmlands
    whose positions may change over time, cause considerable interference in the communication
    between nodes. These moving obstacles affect the connection quality of links,
    changing the channel conditions over time, affecting the deployment, packet routing
    algorithms, failure diagnosis methods, and other aspects of WSNs. Environmental
    factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, high solar radiation along with
    changing shading by plant leaves, as well as noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, further increase Spatio-temporal climatic variation, greatly
    affecting the communication among nodes that are deployed in such harsh environment.
    This changing environment imposes requirements and calls for novel duty-cycle
    control, sampling and scheduling, data reconstructions, as well as data storage
    and query, intelligent control, and other solutions [38], [149]. Although in theory
    or in simulated environments all these challenges have been already studied and
    analyzed when it comes to the actual deployment of IoT in the agricultural sector
    this task is very demanding and challenging. The modules that are used in order
    to sense and report any situation need to be accurate enough, properly shielded
    against environmental factors which can either lead to false reporting or destruction
    of the sensors permanently [150]. In addition, the replacement of power source
    to distributed sensor nodes that are spread in wide areas can be a very difficult
    task, if not impossible and must be taken into consideration during the design
    of such systems. In terms of communication among nodes, since many different technologies
    can be combined, from GSM to WPAN and P2P, interoperability is the main challenge
    when designing or deploying such systems, especially in agriculture where high
    temperature and high humidity affect it in a negative way. Also when different
    communication methods are used in the same area (e.g. Bluetooth, ZigBee, and WiFi)
    interference is a parameter that needs to be also considered [151]. Since the
    sensors devices are deployed in an open field, which cannot be monitored by people
    all the time, the system can easily be attacked physically. In addition, sensors
    devices are not densely deployed in agricultural applications and they are more
    complex in terms of hardware components. Finally the area where sensor devices
    are located is not monitored so well compared to the one deployed inside a city
    and it is easy to add malicious nodes (e.g., Malicious 4G stations) that can overhear
    the information that is exchanged or perform several attacks like DDoS or MITM.
    SECTION VII. Conclusion In this paper, we surveyed the state-of-the-art of existing
    security and privacy solutions for green IoT-based agriculture. We provided an
    overview of a four-tier green IoT-based agriculture architecture. Through extensive
    research and analysis that was conducted, we were able to classify the threat
    models against green IoT-based agriculture into five categories, including, attacks
    against privacy, authentication, confidentiality, availability, and integrity
    properties. In addition, we analyzed the privacy-oriented blockchain-based solutions
    as well as consensus algorithms for green IoT-based agriculture. There still exist
    several challenging research areas, such as machine learning techniques, datasets
    for intrusion detection, scalability analysis of blockchain-based solutions, how
    to pick the best consensus algorithm, and the design of practical and compatible
    cryptographic protocols, which should be further investigated in the near future.

  analysis: This paper reviews the state-of-the-art works related to smart agriculture
    and discusses the security challenges of smart agriculture. It provides an overview
    of smart agriculture development modes, key technologies and applications, security
    and privacy countermeasures, and specific security challenges in agricultural
    production and information technology. The security of smart agriculture is critical
    to ensure the safety of agricultural production and the quality of agricultural
    products. However, there are several security challenges that need to be addressed,
    such as unauthorized access, interception of node communication, facility damage,
    malicious data attacks, and control system intrusion. These challenges are mainly
    due to the harsh environment, the unique characteristics of agricultural equipment,
    and the complexity of information technology systems used in smart agriculture.
    To address these challenges, various security and privacy countermeasures are
    proposed, such as authentication and access control, privacy-preserving, blockchain-based
    solutions for data integrity, cryptography and key management, physical countermeasures,
    and intrusion detection systems. These countermeasures provide different levels
    of protection against various security threats and can be tailored to specific
    smart agriculture scenarios. Future research directions in smart agriculture security
    include the development of new security and privacy countermeasures, the application
    of emerging technologies such as 5G, fog computing, and artificial intelligence,
    and the creation of comprehensive datasets for evaluating the performance of security
    solutions.

    References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: With the deep combination of both
    modern information technology and traditional agriculture, the era of agriculture
    4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture, has come. Smart agriculture provides
    solutions for agricultural intelligence and automation. However, information security
    issues cannot be ignored with the development of agriculture brought by modern
    information technology. In this paper, three typical development modes of smart
    agriculture (precision agriculture, facility agriculture, and order agriculture)
    are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and 11 key applications are derived from
    the above modes. Based on the above technologies and applications, 6 security
    and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access control, privacy-preserving,
    blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography and key management,
    physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems) are summarized and
    discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture are analyzed
    and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2) information
    technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural equipment
    as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments based
    on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate that
    agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more technologies
    (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable energy management
    system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented reality, and cyber
    security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the future research
    directions of smart agriculture. Published in: IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture is the primary industry in
    the world, and it plays an important role in social stability and economic development
    [1]. Overcoming the contradiction between the population explosion and the limited
    grain yield is a challenge that motivates an increasing number of studies on smart
    agriculture. The development of agriculture is based on both the improvement in
    productivity and the restrictions of the era, and the progress of science and
    technology drives the revolution of agriculture [2]. Fig. 1 is used to help readers
    understand the characteristics and confronted issues of agriculture development
    (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0). Agriculture 1.0: the traditional agricultural
    era (between 1784 and around 1870) dominated by human and animal resources, the
    main issue of agriculture was the low efficiency of operation. Agriculture 2.0:
    the era of mechanized agriculture (in the 20th century), the main issue was the
    inefficient use of resources. Agriculture 3.0: the era of high-speed development
    of automatic agriculture (between 1992 to 2017), the main issue was the low level
    of intelligence. Agriculture 4.0: the era of smart agriculture (which is characterized
    by unmanned operations, begin at 2017) is mainly marked by the use of modern information
    technology to both serve agriculture and develop it intelligently. Smart agriculture
    is a new agricultural production mode, that contributes to agricultural information
    perception, quantitative decision-making, intelligent control, precise investment,
    and personalized service through the deep integration of modern information technologies,
    e.g., the internet, Internet of Things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, and Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) with agriculture. In short, the new mode is a smart agricultural
    solution that combines agriculture with modern information technology. Although
    modern information technology brings new opportunities to the development of agricultural
    production, it also creates great demands and challenges to security and privacy
    in the field of smart agriculture. For instance, both intellectual and unmanned
    operations are the development goals of smart agriculture, whose characteristics
    not only increase productivity but also increase the security risks of equipment
    and data. Fig. 1. Characteristics and confronted issues of agriculture development
    (from agriculture 1.0 to agriculture 4.0). Show All A. Motivation for the Article
    This article has three motivational factors: Smart agriculture is an emerging
    paradigm that extends information technology to traditional agriculture, and it
    has the potential as the development trend of agriculture due to the limited productivity
    of traditional agriculture and the wide application of information technology.
    Therefore, it is very important to summarize the existing production mode and
    specific researches. Although smart agriculture has been extensively studied,
    little work has been done on the analysis of security challenges compared with
    industrial security solutions. There is a great difference between urban (industry)
    conditions and rural (agriculture) conditions, as shown in Table I. It indicates
    that security countermeasures based on urban conditions may not suitable for rural
    conditions. Therefore, it is critical to analyze the characteristics of security
    issues under the smart agriculture scenarios. For the above factors, this article
    aims to present a survey of the security topics that arise from smart agriculture,
    which naturally leads to a large number of open research issues. B. Related Works
    1) Works Related to Smart Agriculture Some of the articles related to smart agriculture
    and its security issues are listed in Table III. In [3], typical applications
    of cloud computing technology in agricultural IoT were discussed, and a simple
    IoT agriculture model was addressed with a wireless network. Gondchawar et al.
    sought to make agriculture smart by using automation and IoT technology, e.g.,
    smart GPS-based remote-controlled robot, smart irrigation with decision-making
    system, and smart warehouse management [4]. Antonacci et al. discussed the application
    of nanostructured sensors to support farmers in accessing fast and accurate analyses
    [5]. In [6], IoT deployment challenges and specific issues were discussed. In
    addition, the wireless communication technologies that are associated with agricultural
    applications were analyzed. Elijah et al. depicted the applications of IoT and
    data analytics in agriculture and analyzed the benefits of these applications
    [7]. Khanna et al. highlighted the applications of IoT in precision agriculture
    [8]. In [9], the research initiatives and scientific literature of smart agriculture
    were discussed in detail. The applications of big data in smart agriculture were
    discussed in [10], especially in terms of the food supply chain. In addition,
    the study mentioned that ensuring privacy and security is one of the greatest
    challenges of big data. Bacco et al. presented ground and aerial vehicles, along
    with the vision systems of UAVs in smart agriculture scenarios [11]. To identify
    the differences between UAV missions, the study also proposed a simple taxonomy.
    In [12] and [13], climate-smart agriculture was mainly used in precision agriculture
    by monitoring and predicting meteorological factors and environmental conditions.
    Various applications, services, and sensors based on IoT devices and communications
    techniques in smart agriculture were introduced in [14]. In [3]–[10], these studies
    also mentioned security issues without further discussion. 2) Works Related to
    Security Issues in Smart Agriculture Security issues in smart agriculture have
    been studied in [15]–[20], among them privacy-oriented blockchain-based solutions
    were introduced in [15], [16] proposed a holistic study on security and privacy
    in a smart agriculture ecosystem, and [17] studied the cyber security in smart
    agriculture. A prediction model framework for cyber-attacks in precision agriculture
    was presented in [18], and it is suggested that anomaly detection is needed to
    eliminate false alarms. Furthermore, Haseeb et al. proposed a security mechanism
    based on symmetric data encryption in agricultural sensors and a robust transmission
    strategy for IoT-based smart agriculture applications [19]. Moreover, Farooq et
    al. made a brief overview of security requirements, security challenges, stack
    challenges, thread model, and attack taxonomy on smart agriculture without further
    discussion about them [20]. Although the above surveys reviewed various smart
    agriculture applications and described security issues from the aspect of various
    information technologies, there is little discussion about security challenges
    in agricultural production. Table I Comparison of security issues between urban
    (industry) and rural (agriculture) C. Contributions The contributions of this
    paper are listed as follows. The development status of smart agriculture is summarized
    and classified into three typical development modes: precision agriculture, facility
    agriculture, and order agriculture. Furthermore, 7 key technologies and 11 key
    applications are discussed. Security and privacy countermeasures are summarized
    as (1) authentication and access control, (2) privacy-preserving, (3) blockchain-based
    solutions for data integrity, (4) cryptography and key management, (5) physical
    countermeasures, and (6) intrusion detection systems. Potential security challenges
    of smart agriculture are highlighted and divided into two aspects: (1) agricultural
    production and (2) information technology. Agricultural equipment will also affect
    the security strategy. For instance, it is suggested that high voltage discharge
    interference of Solar Insecticidal Lamps Internet of Things (SIL-IoT) should be
    considered as attacks or have an impact on security strategy. In [25], [26], we
    did some experiments and the results indicate that the interference of high voltage
    discharge affects data transmission. Then, we found that the interference has
    an impact on data acquisition from the results of our additional experiments in
    this paper. Furthermore, the electromagnetic interference of photovoltaic power
    generation may also be potential attacks in photovoltaic agricultural Internet
    of Things. The remaining part of this paper is structured as Fig. 2: Section II
    describes the development modes of smart agriculture. Section III lists some key
    technologies and applications in smart agriculture. Section IV summaries the security
    and privacy countermeasures for smart agriculture. Section V discusses the security
    challenges of smart agriculture. Section VI summarizes the future trends and opportunities
    of smart agriculture and Section VII concludes the article. To help readers understand
    this paper, acronyms found in this paper are shown in Table II. SECTION II. Development
    Modes of Smart Agriculture At present, smart agriculture is the common goal of
    agricultural development in all countries worldwide. The world''s typical smart
    agriculture development modes are divided into three types, as shown in Table
    IV. Considering the characteristics of the vast territory and uneven population
    distribution in China, the development modes need to be modified before they are
    applied to the different regions of China. These modes have a strong impact on
    promoting production management, industrial operation, and unmanned development
    of agriculture. Fig. 3 shows three types of development modes and their characteristics
    in smart agriculture. A. Precision Agriculture According to the environmental
    conditions of each operation unit in the field and the temporal-spatial differences
    of crop yield, various agronomic measures should be carefully and accurately applied
    to optimize the quantity, quality and timing of water, fertilizer, seeds, pesticides,
    etc., so as to obtain the highest yield and maximum economic benefits, and protect
    the agricultural ecological environment and protect the agricultural natural resources.
    Precision agriculture is an advanced technology to improve crop yields, in which
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is the main developmental driving force [30].
    The combination of WSNs and agriculture can effectively reduce the potential risks
    of the production process and help farmers make favorable decisions by deploying
    a large number of low-power, multi-function, wireless communication sensors on
    farmland to collect relevant data throughout the agricultural production process
    (e.g., environmental data, crop growth data, and livestock health data) [31].
    The modern information technology used in precision agriculture is mainly “3S”,
    which includes remote sensing technology (RS), geographic information system (GIS),
    and global positioning system (GPS) [15]. Various types of data (e.g., GPS data,
    GIS data, RS data), as well as AI methods, are used in precision agriculture to
    deduce the crop growth process and propose crop production management in an expert
    decision system, which is different from the traditional agricultural production
    management methods based on subjective experience. The functions of precision
    agriculture include: Reducing environmental pollution by reasonably controlling
    the pesticide dosage; Reducing the waste of resources by improving the efficiency
    of agricultural irrigation; Enhancing the land utilization by improving the ecological
    environment of farmland; Improving the yield and quality of agricultural products
    by analyzing the law of crop growth and thereby maintaining the best crop growth
    conditions. Fig. 2. Organization of this paper. Development modes, 7 key technologies,
    and 11 applications of smart agriculture are summarized in section II and III,
    which contribute to discuss security issues in section IV, V and VI. Show All
    The main security threats in precision agriculture are: Sensors being vulnerable
    to eavesdrop, steal and inject malicious data due to signal loss from their long-distance
    of deployment strategy and harsh environment; Location tampering of outdoor sensors
    and actors resulting in agricultural facilities failure and abnormal operation.
    B. Facility Agriculture Facility agriculture has the goal of good quality and
    high yield, and this agricultural production mode is in the industrial style.
    This type of agriculture is a remarkable sign in the development of modern agriculture,
    and it is characterized by high demand for capital, technology, and labor. Using
    engineering technology, facility agriculture can provide man-made conditions suitable
    for crop growth, and facility protection; it can also remove the environmental
    restrictions on agricultural production and improve the efficiency of automatic
    production. Compared with traditional agriculture, facility agriculture can meet
    the multi-level consumption demands derived from societal development without
    the constraints of the natural environment and seasonal agricultural products
    [32]. Moreover, facility agriculture, facility horticulture, and facility breeding
    share a similar mode of production, and all of them are outfitted with the technologies,
    i.e., biotechnology, engineering technology, meteorology technology, IoT technology,
    and computer technology. The cores of the above three production modes consist
    of prediction models and decision-making management systems that are based on
    historical data, e.g., environmental data, crop growth data under different conditions,
    and crop growth data with different types of genes. Considering the different
    environmental requirements of crops, elements in the facility (e.g., temperature,
    air pressure, relative humidity, light intensity, and fertilizer application rate)
    are monitored and controlled in real time to ensure crops grow in the most favorable
    conditions. The most typical example is the intelligent greenhouse. The differences
    between specific studies (i.e., greenhouse, aquaculture, plant factory and poultry
    and livestock breeding) include different environmental elements, different sensor
    devices, and specific computer-controlled programs. The functions of facility
    agriculture include: Ensuring sustainable and efficient production within a completely
    closed environment with the function of intelligent control; Ensuring agricultural
    production against the restriction of geographical conditions; Shortening the
    production cycle of agricultural products; Improving the quality and yield of
    products. Table II Acronyms found in this paper As a combination of both agriculture
    and industry, facility agriculture, will be the development trend of agriculture,
    and it has become a pillar industry in developed countries e.g., the U.S., the
    Netherlands, and Japan. Due to the characteristics of centralized administration
    and automatic management, facility agriculture is vulnerable to control system
    intrusion and unauthorized access. C. Order Agriculture With the advancement of
    urbanization in China, urban development is rapid, while rural development is
    slow. There are three main problems that hamper rural development: A weak agricultural
    foundation, Hidden dangers in the quality and security of agricultural products,
    Information island transactions within agricultural products [33]. It implies
    that on its own, advanced agricultural production technologies are not sufficient,
    and it helps to create value only when it meets an enabling market opportunity
    [34]. Therefore, order agriculture has achieved an effective business model by
    outsourcing the production demand for agricultural products in advance, which
    can reduce the planting and breeding risks, and avoid blind production [29]. Besides,
    to ensure food security and manage agricultural products, a traceability system
    which makes consumers obtain the appropriate information agricultural productions
    is applied to agricultural product supply chain. Furthermore, agricultural product
    supply chain plays a vital role in the market supervision of agricultural products
    trade. The functions of agricultural product supply chain include: Improving the
    transparency of agricultural product information by modern e-commerce and blockchain
    technology; Eliminating the information island of an agricultural product transaction
    [35]; Reducing the information asymmetry between farmers and suppliers; Reducing
    the imbalance between the supply of and demand for agricultural products. For
    instance, Leng et al. [36] proposed a public agricultural supply chain system
    based on double chain architecture to provide a security guarantee mechanism for
    the public platform and improve the utilization of business resources. In [37],
    an agricultural provenance system based on blockchain was presented to solve the
    trust crisis in product supply chain. D. Summary Precision agriculture, facility
    agriculture, and order agriculture are the main development modes of smart agriculture,
    which combine traditional agricultural forms (outdoor), emerging agricultural
    forms (indoor), and agricultural products industry chain with emerging technologies.
    Various applications of smart agriculture based on the above development modes
    contribute to the improvement of grain products and the quality of agricultural
    products, the reduction of agricultural production costs, and the transparency
    of agricultural products trading. Table III Related works Fig. 3. Research fields
    of smart agriculture based on 1) Precision agriculture, 2) Facility agriculture,
    and 3) Order agriculture. Show All Table IV Three typical development modes of
    smart agriculture SECTION III. Key Technologies and Applications in Smart Agriculture
    In this section, 7 key technologies and 11 key applications in smart agriculture
    based on the three development modes mentioned in Section II are introduced. The
    arrangement of this section is shown in Fig. 2. Agricultural IoT (key technology,
    introduced in Subsection A) is the information carrier of the other technologies
    and applications in smart agriculture. Seven Typical applications of it (introduced
    in Subsection B) are: 1) IoT in field agriculture, 2) IoT in aquaculture, 3) IoT
    in poultry and livestock breeding, 4) IoT in greenhouse, 5) plant factory, 6)
    photovoltaic agricultural IoT, and 7) SIL-IoT. Besides, agricultural IoT has the
    functions of data acquisition, data transmission, data storage, and data analysis.
    According to the four functions, six key technologies are: 1) sensors and actuators,
    and 2) agriculture satellite remote sensing (data acquisition technologies, introduced
    in Subsection C); 3) various data transmission technologies (listed in Table V);
    4) agriculture blockchain (data storage technology, introduced in Subsection E);
    5) agriculture AI and 6) agriculture edge computing (data analysis technologies,
    introduced in Subsection F). And four key applications are: 1) agriculture crowd
    sensing, and 2) plant phenotype information system (data acquisition applications,
    introduced in Subsection D); 3) agriculture UAV, and 4) driverless tractor (data
    analysis applications, introduced in Subsection G). A. Agricultural Internet of
    Things Technology Agricultural IoT is a key technology in smart agriculture which
    makes it possible to quantify the environmental factors, crop growth, and process
    of agricultural production by automatic processing, analysis, and access [38].
    According to the definition of IoT, IoT architecture can be divided into perception
    layer, transmission layer, and application layer, as shown in Fig. 4. Table V
    Comparison of the existing wireless communication technologies In the perception
    layer, various types of sensors are used to collect both field environment information
    and crop growth information, and these sensors are also used to describe the state
    of the environment [39]. The transmission layer includes all types of network
    communication protocols in which the data collected by the perception layer can
    be transmitted to the application layer based on these protocols. Various wireless
    communication technologies and their parameters are listed in Table V (adapted
    from [6], [7], [38], [40], [41], and Wikipedia). Due to the characteristics of
    the large-scale and outdoor environment in precision agriculture, technologies
    with low transmission range (e.g., WiFi and Thread) and high energy consumption
    (e.g., WiFi) cannot apply to precision agriculture. In addition, low data rate
    technologies (e.g., 2 G(GSM), Z-Wave, LoRa) are not applicable for some technologies
    with high throughput data transmission (e.g., plant phenotype information system).
    The application layer plays a vital role in agriculture, and it can be the cloud-based
    (i.e., multiple servers) and local-based (i.e., edge computing based on the gateway)
    system. The application layer consists of the following functions: Data storage,
    e.g., cloud-based platform and Hadoop distributed file system for quick and safe
    accessing to data [42]; Data management, e.g., Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
    (SCADA) for monitoring real-time data [18]; Data analytics, e.g., decision-making
    system, yield models and plant instructions for automatic control in agricultural
    production [43]; Data marketing, e.g., data visualization, traceability system
    of agricultural products for ownership, privacy, new business models [44]. Fig.
    4. Various technologies and applications based on iot architecture. Show All B.
    Agricultural Internet of Things Application 1) Internet of Things in Field Agriculture
    Field crops mainly refer to such products as wheat, rice, and corn, which are
    of great significance to ensuring grain security [45]. In field agriculture, the
    main research topics include field resource management and agricultural condition
    monitoring, and IoT plays an important role in both of these areas. Based on the
    characteristics of various regions in field agriculture, it is difficult to apply
    wired transmission in that setting. Therefore, WSNs technology is mainly used
    instead of wired transmission in field agriculture [46]. After analyzing the data
    transmitted by the transmission layer, the application layer can be expanded into
    a variety of digital tools that benefit the agricultural production e.g., decision
    support systems, expert systems, and cloud data storage. Although IoT technology
    improves the efficiency and quality of field agricultural production, it also
    entails some security problems (e.g., agricultural facility damage). 2) Internet
    of Things in Aquaculture China has become the largest aquaculture country with
    aquaculture production that accounts for approximately two-thirds of the world''s
    production [47]. Currently, aquaculture is transferred from traditional extensive
    aquaculture to industrialized and precise aquaculture. IoT in aquaculture is a
    symbol of the transformation of aquaculture, it is an intelligent aquaculture
    system based on WSNs that collects environmental data for real-time monitoring,
    early warning analysis, and auxiliary decision-making [48]. Special facilities,
    e.g., water quality parameter sensors, underwater robots, underwater cameras,
    and meteorological stations, are applied to monitor environment elements such
    as the water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH value, salinity, and chloride in
    real time. In addition, actuators are used to adjust the water quality of the
    culture pond to ensure the most suitable environmental conditions for the growth
    of aquatic organisms [49]. The differences between IoT in aquaculture and IoT
    in field agriculture include not only the monitoring objects but also the complex
    aquaculture environment and various influencing factors during the growth of aquatic
    organisms. Thus, it is difficult to implement accurate and effective monitoring,
    detection, and optimization management [50]. 3) Internet of Things in Poultry
    and Livestock Breeding Compared with the other forms of agricultural production,
    poultry and livestock breeding have higher production scales and requirements
    in terms of the technology, facility, and funds [51]. IoT in poultry and livestock
    breeding is based on both indoor conditions and outdoor environment, as shown
    in Fig. 5. Indoor conditions include facilities e.g., environmental control equipment
    (to ensure environmental stability), automatic feeding equipment (to ensure forage
    supply), video monitoring equipment (to monitor animal behavior). In addition,
    to track the growth status of each animal under indoor conditions and outdoor
    environment and increase the traceability of meat products, Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID) technology is generally used to set the electronic identification, assign
    a serial number to each animal, and simplify data storage and tracing [52]. Hence,
    the advantages of monitoring, identification, and positioning of animals through
    RFID technology are: Effectively strengthening the detection of the breeding environment;
    Preventing the spread of various epidemic diseases among animals; Ensuring the
    price stability of meat products [53]. For instance, the recent sharp rise in
    the price of pork in China, which resulted from African swine fever in 2019, will
    not happen again if IoT technology is well applied in poultry and livestock breeding.
    Currently, important studies of IoT in poultry and livestock breeding include
    the electronic identification of animals, database management of animal information,
    the quality control and safety traceability of product, and auxiliary disease
    diagnosis using AI technology [54]. Due to the high production value of poultry
    and livestock breeding, high data sensitivity is required for the decision-making
    system. Failures in sensors, links, and decision-making systems may lead to irreparable
    economic losses to farmers. Fig. 5. Indoor conditions and outdoor environment
    of poultry and livestock breeding, e.g., (a) Indoor conditions for chicken farm,
    (b) Outdoor environment for sheep breeding, (c) Indoor conditions for hog farm,
    and (d) Outdoor environment for cattle breeding. Show All 4) Internet of Things
    in Greenhouse Through the environmental control system, IoT in a greenhouse provides
    a closed growing environment to ensure the healthy growth of crops without the
    restrictions of an external environment, which helps improve the yield and quality
    of crops [55]. Agriculture production of IoT in greenhouse can be divided into
    the following steps: Collecting the environmental data through sensors, including
    the temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, light intensity,
    soil temperature, soil humidity, and pH value; Uploading the collected data to
    the control system through signal transmission facilities; Modeling and analyzing
    the heterogeneous data through the prediction model in the control system [56].
    Through the above three steps, the facilities in a greenhouse, e.g., the sprinkler
    irrigation facility, drip irrigation facility, and temperature regulation facility,
    can execute commands intelligently and automatically to maintain steady environmental
    conditions. 5) Plant Factory Due to the growing scarcity of both arable land and
    water sources, a type of low-consumption, environmental-protection, high-yield,
    and safe agricultural production mode has emerged as the most suitable mode for
    agriculture. The plant factory is one of the representative technologies, which
    is a reflection of the transformation from traditional agriculture to modern industry
    [57]. The plant factory''s characteristics include: No limitation due to the environmental
    conditions; Less pollution; Less waste of resources; A controllable production
    cycle, these features ensure the agriculture production even with a deterioration
    of the ecological environment [58]. Similar to the production mode of IoT in a
    greenhouse, a plant factory cultivates crops under the controlled conditions of
    factors such as the temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, and light
    intensity. The differences are that the plant factory has: Higher mechanization;
    Higher automation; More hydroponics; A higher space utilization rate; Proximity
    to a city; A closed and clean environment. At present, plant factories are mainly
    distributed among East Asia, Europe, and the U.S., and artificial light plant
    factories are being developed rapidly in Japan. Due to the reduction of arable
    land, frequent natural disasters, and the shortage of rural labor, agriculture
    is also trending to plant factories in China [59]. The key technologies of the
    plant factory are as follows: Three-dimensional and multi-layer soilless cultivation
    technology; Artificial lighting luminous technology; Intelligent environment control
    technology; Automatic control technology of the plant production space. The above
    technologies are associated with the production efficiency and production cost
    of a plant factory [60]. A plant factory is confronted with the following issues:
    The high cost of the initial construction and maintenance; Limited types of crop
    cultivation; A low level of intelligent production; Low security and privacy [60].
    Because the above issues hinder the development of plant factories, they should
    gain more attention and emphasis. 6) Photovoltaic Agricultural Internet of Things
    With the reduction of natural resources and the aggravation of environmental pollution,
    clean and renewable energy plays an indispensable role in the energy transformation
    of the world [61] In China, photovoltaic power generation occupies a significant
    position in new energy power generation, and there is vast potential for its development
    [62]. In addition, photovoltaic power generation has the advantages of low operation
    cost, no greenhouse gas emissions, and a low maintenance cost [63]. However, the
    development of photovoltaic power generation is limited by the low energy conversion
    efficiency, the high correlation with meteorological factors, and the waste of
    residual power after the grid connection [64], [65]. With the combination of photovoltaic
    power generation and agricultural IoT, the residual power can be utilized effectively.
    Generally, if the actual generation exceeds the demand of the grid, power will
    be limited to protect the grid, which leads to energy waste. With the application
    of residual power for agricultural IoT facilities through battery storage, the
    wasted power and farm operation costs can be effectively reduced. For example,
    photovoltaic energy was used for the irrigation of farmland, and SolarCoin (similar
    to Bitcoin) was proposed for energy and water trading [66]. In addition, because
    a large area of land is required for both field agricultural production and photovoltaic
    power generation, deploying photovoltaic panels over farmland can optimize land
    usage [67]. Moreover, sensors for monitoring field crops can acquire power from
    a photovoltaic system and monitor photovoltaic power generation facilities [68].
    However, this technology also brings some security challenges. For instance, photovoltaic
    power generation may have a great impact on information transmission and further
    increase the risk of receiving malicious data. 7) Solar Insecticidal Lamps Internet
    of Things Solar insecticidal lamps (SIL) kill migratory pests by releasing a high
    voltage pulse current, which contributes to reducing the usage of pesticides [69].
    At present, SIL are widely applied in China, for instance, 20000 SIL have been
    deployed for pest control in Xinyu City, Jiangxi Province, China. With a low level
    of intelligence, most of the traditional SIL are deployed only for killing pests
    among the fields. However, pest information cannot be obtained to make forecasts
    of pests and adjust the work time of insecticidal lamps adaptively. Therefore,
    the application situation of SIL was investigated and the structure diagram of
    SIL-IoT node was introduced in [69]. It has been found that the effective killing
    distance of SIL (SIL deployment radius ≤ 110 m) [70] is in the valid communication
    radius of wireless sensor nodes (e.g., ZigBee, LoRa), as shown in Fig. 6. Due
    to the advantages of SIL-IoT (i.e., pollution-free, high insecticidal efficiency,
    and easy for scheduling), SIL-IoT will be applied widely for pest prevention and
    control, as well as the data acquisition of field agriculture. Recently, Yang
    et al. [70] proposed a node deployment strategy based on partition structure for
    SIL-IoT. The node deployment problem is transformed into a secondary allocation
    problem by using the natural partition structure of farmland, and the problem
    is solved by genetic algorithm. Under the constraint of ensuring full coverage,
    this strategy significantly reduces the number of SIL-IoT nodes. In addition,
    Huang et al. [25], [26] found that high voltage pulse discharge released by SIL
    has been as an interference to ZigBee-based device in SIL-IoT. It is mentioned
    that the device in [25], [26] can be used as a method to attack WSNs, leading
    to the abnormal working state, and it is suggested that the installing space between
    SIL and ZigBee-based device is at least 25 cm. Moreover, Yang et al. [71] mentioned
    that the interference will affect fault diagnosis of SIL-IoT and thereby affect
    the reliability of SIL-IoT. In [71], the characteristics and challenges of fault
    diagnosis in SIL-IoT are analyzed and it is highlighted that security attacks
    will lead to the failure of fault diagnosis. Fig. 6. SIL-IoT component and communication
    diagram. The insecticidal range is smaller than the communication range, which
    ensures that the SIL-IoT nodes deployed in the field meet the communication requirements.
    Show All Although the application of IoT technology expands the functions of insecticidal
    lamps and improves their utilization rate, it entails some new security challenges.
    For example, signal interference is serious when the insecticidal lamp is discharged,
    and traditional signal transmission security methods may not suitable for this
    situation. C. Data Acquisition Technology Data acquisition is an interface that
    uses a device to collect data from the outside of the system and input them into
    the internal system. Data acquisition technology mainly includes: RS232, RS485
    serial ports for connecting multiple detection instruments to implement automatic
    data acquisition; USB interface for outputting data; The wireless communication
    module for transmit data; Various sensors for collecting data and various actuators
    for maintaining the controlled variable; Satellite for obtaining, measuring and
    processing the related data through the interaction between electromagnetic wave
    and object. These technologies can be applied to agriculture crowd sensing and
    plant phenotype information system, which obtain data from perception module of
    mobile devices, camera, spectrometer, various weather sensors, etc.. 1) Sensors
    and Actuators Agricultural sensors are mainly used to collect both environmental
    conditions and crop growth information [39] and then transmit the data to the
    cloud [38]. Various sensors in smart agriculture can be classified into location
    sensors, photoelectric sensors, mechanical sensors, electrochemical sensors, airflow
    sensors, and optical sensors, as shown in Table VI (adapted from [5], [7], [72]).
    These sensors are applied to collect meteorological information (e.g., temperature,
    humidity, carbon dioxide concentration), crop information (e.g., crop growth conditions,
    crop disease), soil information (e.g., tensiometers, soil type, and moisture level
    of the soil), location information (e.g., precision location of crops), etc..
    Then, these information are transmitted to the cloud. If the data collected by
    the sensor meet certain judgment conditions, actuators will activate or deactivate
    agricultural equipment. The main actuators in facility agriculture are: Irrigation
    equipment to ensure the sufficient moisture for crop growth; Lighting control
    equipment to ensure the suitable lighting conditions for crop growth; Air circulation
    to ensure the carbon dioxide concentration in closed growth conditions; Crop disease
    control to ensure the healthy growth of the crop. Table VI Sensors in smart agriculture
    2) Agricultural Satellite Remote Sensing Agricultural satellite remote sensing
    is a technology that monitors: Various types of agricultural systems e.g., field
    planting and aquaculture; The process of agricultural production; Multiple elements
    of agriculture i.e., production, environment, and ecology information [73]. It
    is mainly applied to the following fields: area estimation, crop growth monitoring,
    pest information monitoring, yield prediction, grassland vegetation monitoring,
    and agricultural resources mapping [74]. Moreover, the trends of agricultural
    satellite remote sensing development in the world include both joint observation
    and high spatial-temporal resolution monitoring. In China, the demand for sky-air-ground-integration
    in agriculture was proposed in the “Outline of the National Rural Development
    Plan of Sky-air-ground Digital Agriculture (2018-2025)”. The requirements also
    include realizing (1) the digitalization of all factors and all production processes,
    and (2) intelligent dynamic monitoring in field planting, animal husbandry, and
    related areas [75]. To implement sky-air-ground-integration, several problems
    must be solved, e.g., we need both cooperative observation among satellites, and
    massive data fusion among satellites, aircraft, UAVs, and surface stations, as
    shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7. Massive data fusion among satellites, aircraft, UAVs,
    and surface stations. Show All D. Data Acquisition Application 1) Agricultural
    Crowd Sensing Crowd sensing employs the functions of perception computing, common
    measurement, and information sharing by a large number of personal mobile devices
    (e.g., smartphones and wearable devices) to complete large-scale and complex perception
    tasks [76]. Mobile terminal equipment is used as the basic sensing unit to complete
    the collection of sensing data through the wireless network. Furthermore, with
    the combination of the ideas of both mobile perception and crowdsourcing, crowd
    sensing has the advantages of low cost, strong scalability, and strong mobility.
    The emphases of crowd sensing are: The data processing technology; The incentive
    mechanism; The crowd sensing software platform. To date, crowd sensing has been
    widely used in intelligent transportation, public security, environmental monitoring,
    and other applications. It is mainly applied in urban environments, and there
    have been few applications in rural ones. Due to the increasing proportion of
    farmers with smartphones and the demands of collecting agricultural data, agricultural
    crowd sensing has huge potential for data acquisition [77]. For instance, Ginige
    et al. [78] proposed a mobile-based information system which consists of a smart
    computing framework, and was studied for farmers to report pest and disease outbreak
    events. As a new IoT sensing technology, agriculture crowd sensing will inevitably
    entail a variety of security challenges [79]. For example, a SmartfLAIr system
    was proposed for an increased resolution of leaf area index and a perturbation
    based privacy mechanism with Trusted Third Party (TTP) architecture was designed
    to ensure user privacy [80]. 2) Plant Phenotype Information System The plant phenotype
    information system is a technology that quantitatively analyses the interaction
    effect of both the genotype and the environment on crop products'' quality and
    other traits. It has the following functions: Monitoring the growth of crops by
    deploying various types of sensors and measuring instruments under Specified conditions
    [81]; Analyzing the data from both UAVs and satellite remote sensing to quantify
    the growth state and yield of crops under different genes and environmental factors;
    Selecting stable and high-yield crop genes and their suitable growth environment.
    All the functions are based on abundant plant phenotype information, which is
    mainly composed of massive images, videos, and text data. To make the data suitable
    for analytics, the main studies of plant phenotypic information systems are: Massive
    data annotation [82], management [83] and integration [84] (i.e., data annotation,
    data association and data storage by knowledge graph technology); Massive image
    data analysis [85], [86] (e.g., machine learning, and deep learning algorithms).
    Due to the characteristics of interdisciplinary fusion, multi-team cooperation
    is required for a plant phenotype information system. Hence, Ubbens et al. [87]
    proposed a deep plant phenomics system, which was an easy platform by providing
    a pre-trained model for plant scientists. In addition, a plant phenotype information
    system involves various technologies, e.g., sensor facility, network communication,
    big data platform, and data processing method, which entails many security issues.
    E. Data Storage Technology Data storage objects include temporary files generated
    by data stream or information that needs to be searched in the process of processing.
    At present, the main data storage methods include: Direct Attached Storage (DAS),
    a storage device directly connected to the host system without centralized management
    solution; Network Attached Storage (NAS), a device with data storage function
    connected to the network; Storage Area Network (SAN), a network in which storage
    devices are connected to each other and connected to a server or group of servers.
    Moreover, database is the most commonly used data storage software, which consists
    of: Relational database, the relational model is used to organize data in database,
    e.g., Oracle, SQLServer, MySQL; Non-relational database, removing the relational
    characteristics of relational database to ensure the scalability of data, e.g.,
    Redis, MongoDB, Neo4J). From the aspects of storage mode, traditional databases
    mostly adopts centralized storage mode, which are confronted with capacity bottleneck
    issue. Therefore, distributed database is presented, which provides scalable service
    capacity and storage capacity by the way of sub database and sub table, and provides
    transparent data access and smooth capacity expansion and reduction by database
    agent. Similar to the characteristics of distributed database, blockchain is a
    decentralized distributed database, which collectively maintains a reliable database
    by decentralizing and trusting mechanisms. 1) Agriculture Blockchain Blockchain
    technology was proposed by scholars with the pseudonym of “Satoshi Nakamoto” in
    2008. It is a point-to-point distributed data-storage-architecture scheme, and
    it uses a variety of consensus mechanisms to achieve collaborative trust among
    multiple participants [88]. Furthermore, the application of cryptographic methods
    ensures the security of data transmission. At present, the intelligent operation
    of node data can be implemented by deploying smart contracts (a kind of script
    code) on distributed nodes [89]. Blockchain supplies a reliable technical guarantee
    for both the integrity and immutability of information, and it is widely used
    in product information traceability [90]. In agriculture, blockchain has the following
    functions: 1) establishing the backtracking mechanism of agricultural products.
    Reliable and safe information about agricultural products including their planting,
    processing, and selling are provided to improve information transparency. In addition,
    the distributed information storage method based on digital encryption and verification
    technology ensures the information security of agricultural products [91]; 2)
    establishing a new agricultural product trading market. The distributed storage
    technology of blockchain is used to digitize the upstream and downstream information
    of agricultural products. Moreover, the information is shared across the entire
    agricultural blockchain alliance [92]. Although blockchain can be used as an information
    security solution, it is essentially data storage and releases technology. Because
    blockchain technology is still in the exploration stage in agriculture, the security
    challenges of blockchain remain to be explored. F. Data Analysis Technology Data
    analysis is a process of detailed research and summary of data to extract useful
    information, which uses appropriate methods (e.g., statistical analysis method,
    machine learning method) to analyze the large amount of data. Artificial intelligence
    is an emerging technology which contributes to the accuracy of data analysis.
    In addition, edge computing technology greatly reduces the traffic amount and
    delay by deploying artificial intelligence algorithms on the device rather than
    cloud server. 1) Agricultural Artificial Intelligence With the development of
    IoT technology, the amount of agricultural data has increased dramatically. AI
    technology can provide an expert system to analyze agricultural big data, select
    valuable information, and increase agricultural productivity finally [93], [94].
    At present, there are many studies and applications in agriculture AI [95], [96].
    The main studies of agriculture AI include: Intelligent robots based on pre-set
    machine learning models and computer vision technology that complete basic agricultural
    tasks much more quickly than manpower and traditional robots, e.g., intelligent
    seeding robot and intelligent harvesting robots; Crop and soil monitoring, which
    have applied both computer vision technology and deep learning algorithms to analyze
    the crop growth data and soil health data; Predictive analysis, which forecasts
    the impact of weather changes on crop harvests by training machine learning model
    [97]. Based on the above studies, manual operations are being replaced by intelligent
    machines and decision-making systems, which contribute to the development of smart
    agriculture [10]. However, AI technology will result in huge losses (e.g., a wrong
    decision for the irrigation system and plant factory environment control) if it
    suffers from attacks. 2) Agricultural Edge Computing Cloud computing provides
    scalable, on-demand, and virtualized resources for users [98]. Therefore, cloud
    computing has been widely applied in planting, aquaculture, poultry and livestock
    breeding, plant factories, and related applications [54]. However, it is difficult
    to use the centralized data processing method of cloud computing to meet the growing
    amount of data, which stem from the explosive growth of agricultural data. Although
    cloud computing has the advantages of both strong computing power and fast processing
    speed, the demands of data analysis cannot be fully met by it due to its disadvantages
    (e.g., high cost, high delay, and low capacity of protecting the privacy of users).
    Thus, edge computing is applied in agriculture to solve these problems, as shown
    in Fig. 8. The “edge” refers to any network and computing resources between the
    data source (e.g., sensors) and the cloud data center [99]. For instance, the
    smartphone is the edge between the user and the cloud. By transmitting sensor
    data to edge devices for calculation, communication delay can be reduced effectively
    [100]. Therefore, edge computing is suitable for tasks with both low computational
    cost and high timeliness requirements [101]. In the area of SIL-IoT, if insect
    pest location data are transmitted to the cloud for decision-making and then returned
    to an actuator, the pest outbreak area may be transferred before the implementation
    of relevant measures. However, if the data are transmitted to the edge nodes and
    then returned to the actuator, the delay caused by the data transmission will
    be greatly reduced. Therefore, it is important to promote agricultural edge computing
    and find its potential security problems [102]. G. Data Analysis Application 1)
    Agricultural Unmanned Aerial Vehicle With the development of “3S” technology,
    UAVs have become widely used in agriculture, industry, and commerce. Furthermore,
    the UAVs'' characteristics of labor-saving and high efficiency are consistent
    with the development goal of smart agriculture. At present, the studies of agricultural
    UAVs mainly focus on plant protection operations, forestry monitoring, crop pollination,
    and herd positioning [103]. Due to the advantages of high operating efficiency,
    low pollution, and no poisoning risks for farmers in agricultural applications,
    the development of agricultural UAVs has been rapidly growing in some countries
    e.g., the U.S., Russia, South Korea, and especially Japan. With more than 2400
    registered agricultural UAVs and more than 14 000 operators, Japan has become
    the country that has the largest number of agricultural UAVs [104]. Compared with
    the above countries in the fields of UAVs, the development of Chinese UAVs has
    lagged, but the investment in agricultural UAVs has increased in recent years.
    Fig. 8. Comparison of edge computing and cloud computing. The advantages of edge
    computing are low cost and low delay, which benefit to high time efficiency tasks,
    e.g., SIL-IoT, agricultural uvas, driverless tractors. Show All There are various
    types of agricultural UAVs on the market, as shown in Fig. 9. For instance, UAVs
    can be divided into both hydraulic UAVs and electric UAVs according to the dynamic
    system. Furthermore, UAVs can be divided into fixed-wing UAVs, single-rotor UAVs,
    and multi-rotor UAVs according to the model structure. Currently, electric multi-rotor
    UAVs have a major market share due to their low cost, low failure rate, simple
    operation, and environmental protection. Besides, the plant protection UAV is
    one of the most common applications of agricultural UAVs, based on high operating
    efficiency, good spraying effect, low pollution level, and operation without limitations
    due to the crop height. The technology gaps in the production areas where plant
    protection cannot be carried out manually are addressed by agricultural UAVs [103].
    2) Driverless Tractor The traditional tractor is indispensable power machinery
    in field agriculture, as it provides traction for cultivating machines, traction
    seeders, a machine that spray insecticide, harvesters, etc. [105]. The driverless
    tractor is a combination of the traditional tractor and modern driverless technology.
    The advantages of driverless tractors include both optimal operation path planning
    by the map transmission system and dynamic obstacle avoidance by lidar, which
    contribute to improving the quality and efficiency of operations, and maximizing
    the utilization rates of land, seed and fertilizer [106], [107]. Currently, the
    applications of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and laser system
    in driverless tractors have been generalized in Europe, so as to avoid obstacles
    and operate in the appointed paths effectively [108]. In [109], further studies
    have been conducted in North America on the key components of automatic navigation,
    including navigation sensors, vehicle motion models, navigation plan devices,
    and steering controllers. Liu et al. [110] proposed an artificial vehicle powertrain
    system to build a general framework for data-driven intelligent control, which
    can be applied to the driverless tractor. Fig. 9. (a) Fixed-wing UAV, (b) Single-rotor
    hydraulic UAV, and (c) Multi-rotor electric uav. Currently, electric multi-rotor
    UAVs have a major market share due to their low cost, low failure rate, simple
    operation, and environmental protection. Show All Furthermore, China has begun
    to develop driverless tractors in recent years. For instance, the major research
    program “Cognitive Computing of Audio-visual Information” of the National Natural
    Science Fund of China (NSFC) was established in 2008, and it has provided finance
    and policy support for driverless driving. H. Summary In this section, we described
    7 key technologies and 11 key applications in smart agriculture based on IoT architecture
    (perception layer for data acquisition, transmission layer for data transmission,
    and application layer for data storage and data analysis). Some applications of
    agricultural IoT are introduced: IoT in field agriculture, IoT in aquaculture,
    IoT in poultry and livestock breeding, IoT in greenhouse, plant factory, photovoltaic
    agricultural IoT, and SIL-IoT, which have unique characteristics in specific agricultural
    scenarios and are confronted with various security threats (e.g., agricultural
    facility damage for IoT in field agriculture, failures in sensors for IoT in poultry
    and livestock breeding, control system intrusion for IoT in greenhouse and plant
    factory, malicious data attacks for photovoltaic agricultural IoT, and signal
    interference for SIL-IoT). In addition, sensors and actuators, and agriculture
    satellite remote sensing are introduced as data acquisition technologies, which
    contribute to the applications of data acquisition (agriculture crowd sensing,
    and plant phenotype information system). There are some security threats for data
    acquisition technologies and applications, e.g., facility damage and interception
    of node communication for sensors and actuators, unauthorized access for agriculture
    satellite remote sensing, privacy leaks for agriculture crowd sensing, and control
    system intrusion for plant phenotype information system. Agriculture blockchain
    is described as a distributed data storage technology to ensure data storage security,
    which is also confronted with security threats (e.g., access control failure,
    unsafe consensus agreement). Moreover, agriculture artificial intelligence and
    agriculture edge computing are introduced as data analysis technologies. They
    are confronted with various security threats e.g., malicious data attacks, unauthorized
    access, and control system intrusion. The above data analysis technologies are
    applied in agriculture UAV and driverless tractor for path planning, automatic
    operation, local information processing, etc.. There are some security threats
    for agriculture UAV and driverless tractor, e.g., false location information by
    malicious data attacks, facility damage by control system intrusion, data interception
    by interception of node communication. Therefore, effective security and privacy
    countermeasures play a vital role in ensuring security of smart agriculture. SECTION
    IV. Security and Privacy Countermeasures The summary of existing security and
    privacy countermeasures which are suitable for smart agriculture are presented
    in Table VII. The relationship between some key technologies and applications
    in smart agriculture and security and privacy countermeasures are shown in Fig.
    10. A. Authentication and Access Control To enhance the security and privacy of
    smart agriculture, user authentication systems should ensure the following security
    and performance requirements: resilience to various attacks, device anonymity,
    session key agreement, mutual authentication, and unlinkability. Lee et al. [111]
    proposed a three-factor anonymous user authentication scheme, which can be applied
    in a network model composed of three types of nodes, namely, a mobile node, a
    sensor node, and a gateway. Based on the bio-hash function, Lee et al.''s scheme
    can satisfy user anonymity, users untraceability, and resists stolen mobile device
    attacks. For achieving cross-domain permission delegation and access control,
    Gauhar et al. [112] proposed a decentralized blockchain-based framework, named
    xDBAuth, which the blockchain technology is used for providing transparent to
    all the users in the IoT network. The xDBAuth framework considers a network model
    composed of five main elements, including, smart contract, IoT devices, blockchain
    manager, overlay network, and underlay network. Based on the two algorithms, namely,
    cross-domain resource access algorithm and proof-of-authenticity/integrity algorithm,
    the xDBAuth framework can provide authentication/authorization, availability,
    integrity, and non-repudiation. In addition, Shin et al. [113] designed a privacy-preserving
    authentication scheme for wireless sensor networks in 5 G-integrated IoT, which
    the IoT architecture is based on a wireless sensor network, gateways, cloud computing,
    and with three types of layers, including, network layer, application layer, and
    support layer. The Shin et al.''s scheme uses elliptic curve cryptography to guarantees
    gateway anonymity, user anonymity with untraceability, and resistant to four types
    of attacks, including, offline password guessing attacks, mobile device loss attacks,
    stolen verifier attacks, and user impersonation attacks. B. Privacy-Preserving
    For achieving privacy-preserving, Wang et al. [114] proposed a privacy-preserving
    spectrum sharing framework for the IoT network, which can be applied for smart
    agriculture by considering at the same time the spatial spectrum reuse and truthfulness.
    Specifically, the proposed framework considers three units, including, a cryptographic
    authority, multiple bidders, and an auctioneer. Based on the Elgamal encryption
    scheme, the proposed framework can keep the bidders'' bids confidential and achieving
    user satisfaction ratio. Therefore, in order to enable offline/online computation
    and support IoT devices with various cryptographic settings, Wei et al. [115]
    designed privacy-preserving message authentication scheme, named SAMA, for IoT
    networks, which can be applied for smart agriculture. The SAMA scheme uses various
    systems such as RSA-type and ElGamal-type for preserving the location and identity
    privacy of a data source as well as message authenticity and integrity. Zhang
    et al. [116] proposed a privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme, named LVPDA,
    which can be applied for the edge-computing-enabled smart agriculture. During
    the data aggregation process, the LVPDA scheme combines an online/offline signature
    technique and Paillier homomorphic encryption method for privacy-preserving and
    integrity verification. Based on the q-strong Diffie-Hellman (q-SDH) assumptions,
    the LVPDA scheme is proven unforgeable under the chosen message attack. Fig. 10.
    Different security and privacy countermeasures for 7 key technologies and 11 key
    applications in smart agriculture. Show All Table VII Summary of security and
    privacy countermeasures for smart agriculture C. Blockchain-Based Solutions for
    Data Integrity The blockchain technology is used as a security solution to provide
    data integrity in smart agriculture. To provide automated data processing in fish
    farming, Hang et al. [118] designed a blockchain-based fish farm platform, which
    is based on smart contracts. The proposed platform uses four main components,
    including, end-user, blockchain network, fish farm, and data storage. Based on
    the blockchain network, the proposed platform can provide reliable and secure
    storage. Therefore, to provide traceability and trust in the agri-food supply
    chain, Shahid et al. [119] proposed a security solution deployed over the Ethereum
    blockchain network. The proposed solution considers an agri-food supply chain
    with a layered architecture and is categorized into three layers, including, data
    layer, blockchain layer, and storage layer. To achieve accountability and authenticity,
    the proposed solution uses an interplanetary file storage system that receives
    the data and returns a hash of these data to the blockchain network. D. Cryptography
    and Key Management The symmetric encryption/decryption along with the cryptographic
    hash function are used by Wazid et al. [125] for designing a secure user authenticated
    key management protocol, which can be applied in smart agriculture. The network
    model used by the proposed protocol is composed of three different nodes, including,
    the sensing nodes, the gateway node, and cluster head nodes. To verify the biometric
    authentication, the proposed protocol uses the fuzzy extractor technique. To ensure
    confidentiality with end-to-end security guarantees, Esposito et al. [123] proposed
    a clustered and distributed key management framework, which is based on the group-based
    keys. Specifically, the proposed framework uses a network model composed of group
    nodes with the cluster head and the border nodes. In addition, within the proposed
    protocol, the key to be shared, is divided into encoded parts, and only a part
    of the received parts is transmitted by the cluster head to its neighboring nodes.
    E. Physical Countermeasures Both cyber and physical attacks are in high demand
    in smart agriculture. Li et al. [121] proposed an auditing and analytics-based
    IoT monitoring mechanism. The proposed mechanism uses disaggregation-aggregation
    architecture using the evaluation of the power usage of the system''s sub-components.
    Therefore, the proposed mechanism adopts two deep learning models, including,
    the aggregation model and disaggregation model. Therefore, to provide a comprehensive
    view of the security status of smart homes in smart agriculture, Ali and Awad
    [124] proposed the operationally critical threat, asset, and vulnerability evaluation
    methodology, named OCTAVE, which focuses on information assets. The OCTAVE method
    is applied in the network model composed of three parts, including, IoT devices,
    a gateway, and a web server. In addition, the OCTAVE method uses four main phases
    to allow comprehensive risk assessment, including: 1) establish drivers phase,
    2) profile assets phase, 3) identify threats phase, and 4) risk mitigation phase.
    F. Intrusion Detection Systems Cyber-attacks for smart agriculture infrastructures
    are emerging as an increasingly important concern for both organizations and nations.
    To detect these cyber-attacks in smart agriculture, security researchers have
    proposed intrusion detection systems based on machine learning and data mining
    algorithms. Ferrag et al. [117] and Maglaras et al. [127] designed a hybrid intrusion
    detection system, named RDTIDS, for internet-of-things networks, which can be
    applied for smart agriculture. Specifically, the RDTIDS system uses decision tree
    and rules-based concepts to classify the network traffic as attack/benign. The
    experimental results on the BoT-IoT dataset and the CICIDS2017 dataset shows that
    the RDTIDS system achieves the highest accuracy with 96.995% and 96.665%, respectively.
    In addition, Anthi et al. [120] designed a three-layer intrusion detection system
    for detecting a series of cyber-attacks on IoT networks, which can be applied
    for smart agriculture. The proposed system uses a supervised approach to classifies
    attacks such as replay attack, reconnaissance attack, man-in-the-middle attack,
    spoofing attack, and denial of service attack. The experimental results on cyber
    attacks dataset show that the proposed system achieves an F-measure of: 1) 96.2%,
    2) 90.0%, and 3) 98.0%. Sforzin et al. [126] proposed an intrusion detection architecture
    for the IoT network, named RPiDS, which can be applied for smart agriculture.
    The RPiDS architecture uses a small, portable device, pre-packaged with an intrusion
    detection system for detecting an active attack and or suspicious network-related
    activity. The experimental results on Raspberry Pi equipped with Snort show that
    RPiDS architecture is adapted to conduct intrusion detection in an IoT framework.
    Ahmim et al. [122] designed an intrusion detection system that can be applied
    for smart agriculture. Specifically, the proposed system can be installed at the
    fog computing layer for detecting cyber-attack using the combination of the probability
    predictions of a tree of classifiers. The experimental results on KDD''99 and
    NSL©datasets show that the proposed system achieves the highest accuracy with
    96.27% and 89.75%, respectively. SECTION V. Security Challenges of Smart Agriculture
    Most of the existing security and privacy countermeasures are based on industrial
    scenarios or only based on simulation performance, without considering the actual
    application scenarios. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze security challenges
    based on smart agriculture, which contributes to applying the above security and
    privacy countermeasures to various smart agriculture scenarios. A. Security Challenges
    in Agricultural Production 1) Harsh Environment The modes of agricultural production
    mainly include large-scale field farming, small-scale greenhouse farming, aquaculture,
    and poultry and livestock breeding. However, the maintenance problems of sensors
    and farm implements by the above modes cannot be ignored. The primary maintenance
    problems include hardware protection for the facilities and the energy consumption
    design of the facilities. Due to the characteristics of sparse deployment and
    the absence of supervision in agricultural IoT facilities, sensor nodes may be
    stolen and used by malicious users, which would lead to serious security problems
    (e.g., data leakage and network paralysis). In addition, agricultural IoT facilities
    are required to have reliable long-distance signal transmissions, and they must
    reduce their energy consumption to ensure their long-term stable operation. Therefore,
    a balance between energy consumption and the reliability of the signal transmission
    is critical for agricultural IoT facilities. 2) Threats from Agricultural Equipment
    Except for the harsh environment, the security issues caused by the working characteristics
    of agricultural equipment cannot be ignored. For instance, SIL release high voltage
    (∼2150 V to ∼6000 V) pulse discharge while migratory insects with phototaxis feature
    contact with the metal mesh, which has a great impact on ZigBee [25]. In [25],
    [26], we did some experiments and the results indicate that the interference of
    high voltage discharge affects data transmission. In this paper, we did the following
    experiments under the same experimental devices [26] (parameter, evaluating indicator,
    purpose, and device are shown in Table VIII). The first experiment (only indicating
    that the interference affects sending node) has been done in [26] before, we did
    that again with three evaluating indicators and extended it to two additional
    experiments, which are used to verify whether the interference has an impact on
    receiving node and sensors. Observing the interference of high voltage pulse discharge
    for sending node under the distances of 10, 15, 20, and 25 cm. Table IX illustrates
    that the interference is stronger to ZigBee with the closer distance between SIL
    and sending node (there is a positive correlation between FET and interference
    intensity). It is mentioned in [26] that the interference (quantified by FET times)
    has an impact on the ZigBee-based device. However, the influences of the interference
    on data transmission and data acquisition are not mentioned. Therefore, we did
    the next two experiments. Observing the interference of high voltage pulse discharge
    for receiving node under the distances of 0, 5, and 10 cm. The results are depicted
    in Fig. 11, and communication duration is the time difference between node receiving
    data normally and not receiving data normally. It is observed from the results
    that the communication duration has a positive correlation with the distance between
    SIL and receiving node. Moreover, when the distance between SIL and receiving
    node is more than 10 cm, the interference is not obvious under the existing experimental
    equipment and conditions. The distance may increase with the increase of the interference
    intensity generated by the equipment. Observing the interference of high voltage
    pulse discharge for sensors under the distances of 0 and 5 cm. The sensors with
    ID 1 and 2 were used for the experiment (distances between them and SIL are 0
    and 5 cm), and the sensor with ID 3 was used as the control group (distance between
    it and SIL is 1m). As shown in Fig. 12, when we turn on the discharge module at
    15:34:30, the data acquisition is abnormal and the device reset after a few seconds.
    The proportion of abnormal data (the proportion of abnormal data to all data in
    a certain period) and the proportion of device reset are shown in Table X. When
    the distance is 0cm, sensors with ID 1 and 2 can hardly collect data normally.
    The interference is not obvious when the distance between SIL and sensors is more
    than 5cm. However, in the case of a harsh environment and aging equipment, the
    effective range and extent of injury of interference may be unpredictable. Fig.
    11. Interference on different distances between SIL and receiving node. Average
    communication duration values of 0 cm, 5 cm, and 10 cm are 45.6 s, 116.5 s, and
    765.9 s. Maximum values of 0 cm, 5 cm, and 10 cm are 151 s, 422 s, and 1970 s.
    Minimum values of 0 cm, 5 cm, and 10 cm are 4 s, 4 s, and 45 s. Show All Table
    VIII Interference experiments for different devices Fig. 12. Data acquisition
    under interference. For the first line, “2020-07-08-15-15:34:32” is time format,
    “02” is sensor ID in red dotted box, “26.6” is temperature (°C) in yellow dotted
    box, and “72” is relative humidity (%) in green dotted box. Besides, data in blue
    dotted box are normal data, data in violet dotted box are abnormal data, and data
    in grey dotted box are device reset information. Show All Table IX Interference
    on different distances between SIL and sending node Table X Interference on different
    distances between SIL and sensors The above experiments indicate that the interference
    of high voltage pulse discharge has an impact on data transmission and data acquisition.
    The interference is a kind of security threat and may mislead the execution of
    security strategy. For instance, if the receiving node cannot receive data normally
    due to interference, the security strategy may classify it as a DDoS attack. B.
    Security Challenges in Information Technology 1) Unauthorized Access Unauthorized
    access refers to unauthorized use of system resources and unauthorized access
    to a database, which results in serious network security challenges. To access
    data and control agricultural IoT facilities beyond the limit of users'' authority,
    hackers attack the access control mechanism of the system by forging a counterfeit
    identity [128]. The main reasons for unauthorized access are: Rapid change of
    accessing the particular user account from the unrecognized location; Accessing
    the user account with an unrecognized device; Sudden IP, server domain and gateway
    change [128]. Identity authentication, which identifies legal users by their passwords
    and biometrics, is applied to prevent unauthorized access [129]. Furthermore,
    access control strategies should be set up to manage user rights, and to ensure
    the security of various resources in the system. As shown in Fig. 13, hackers
    can illegally access edge nodes and cloud databases to obtain crop growth data
    and modify control system information, which would have an impact on crop growth
    and data quality. Fig. 13. When a variety of data is transmitted to the cloud
    or edge node, hackers access the database through unauthorized access. Show All
    2) Interception of Node Communication Wireless communication technology is widely
    applied in various agricultural IoT facilities. Unfortunately, the information
    transmitted by wireless communication is easily copied and stolen [130]. The information
    usually contains both environmental data collected by sensors and facility control
    signals in agricultural production. Data tampering and interception by hackers
    may have serious consequences [131]. To ensure the security of wireless communication,
    appropriate encryption strategies for wireless devices are required to encrypt
    data [132]. Simultaneously, various wireless sensors may not be able to support
    complex encryption algorithms for communication security. Therefore, a balance
    between the encryption strength and the facility capacity must be sought. As presented
    in Fig. 14, data collected by sensors can be sent to a gateway through the communication
    terminal. Hackers steal data by invading wireless communications, which results
    in serious consequences. Fig. 14. In the process of node communication, hackers
    intercept data by invading receiving nodes. Show All 3) Facility Damage Due to
    the complex conditions in an agricultural production environment, facilities that
    are deployed in an agricultural environment may send incorrect data, be damaged,
    or lose the capacity to collect data. Facility damage may result in data distorted
    and missing, which would affect the data analysis and the decision-making system
    [133]. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a facility detection mechanism.
    If the facility stops working or the data collected by the sensors deviate from
    the normal range, faults should be detected and related measures should be implemented
    promptly by the neighboring nodes or diagnosis nodes. Fig. 15 shows various faults
    that result from facility damage, which have negative impacts on the daily operation
    of agricultural UAVs. 4) Malicious Data Attacks AI technology can be applied with
    its ability to analyze massive data and sensory data is the main factor in any
    decision-making process [134]. In addition, a pre-trained model with optimal environmental
    parameter settings contributes to improving the yield and quality of agricultural
    products. However, by inserting malicious data into the database, the model training
    process is affected, which would cause a deviation in the model results. The primary
    solutions include the privacy protection of agricultural IoT facilities [135],
    and online and real-time monitoring system [136]. As presented in Fig. 16, due
    to malicious data attacks, the solar insecticidal lamps in an actual pest outbreak
    area are sleeping, which leads to crops damage. Simultaneously, we have a waste
    of energy caused by incorrect responses of the solar insecticidal lamps that are
    in the false pest outbreak area. Fig. 15. System fault, link fault, sensor fault,
    and other factors lead to uneven spraying of pesticides. Show All Fig. 16. Due
    to malicious data attacks, the solar insecticidal lamps in an actual pest outbreak
    area are sleeping, which leads to crops damage. Simultaneously, we have a waste
    of energy caused by incorrect responses of the solar insecticidal lamps that are
    in the false pest outbreak area. Show All 5) Control System Intrusion After the
    data collection and analysis, the control system sends commands to the machinery
    to complete the corresponding production operation. Therefore, the security of
    the control system plays a vital role in agricultural production. Control system
    intrusion may lead to no response from the production machinery [137], which would
    have a strong impact on agricultural production. Therefore, protecting the decision-making
    system from intrusion, and protecting the control signals from interference has
    a great impact on the performance of agricultural production. Fig. 17 illustrates
    a driverless tractor operating on the wrong route after a control system intrusion.
    C. Summary Due to the harsh environment and threats from agricultural equipment,
    the protection measures and anti-interference design of the agricultural equipment
    are very important. Furthermore, severe weather prediction and interference filtering
    at the software layer contribute to the security of agricultural production. However,
    ensuring the security of agricultural production is a very complex task, mainly
    because of changeable climatic conditions, large-scale and harsh environments,
    and various agricultural equipment with different standards. Fig. 17. A driverless
    tractor operating on the wrong route after a control system intrusion. Show All
    In addition, recent works related to information security are shown in Table XI.
    Key distribution and authentication mechanisms are a major research direction
    of unauthorized access, and among these works, machine learning algorithms have
    been used to improve the accuracy of the classifications [138]. Furthermore, hypothesis
    testing is a method that can estimate false alarm rate and false negative rate
    (i.e., 5% false rejection rate with four PCA dimensions [129]). Recent studies
    of the interception of node communication focus on the decode-and-forward protocol,
    and the affected layer is typically the cyber-physical layer. Intercept probability
    is mainly used to estimate the performance of model, increasing power-splitting
    factor signal power, and the number of relays may improve the security of wireless
    transmission [130], [132], [139]. In addition, Zou and Wang [131] demonstrated
    that sensor scheduling method contributes to against eavesdropping attack. The
    perception layer is the main affected layer in facility damage. Various methods
    are used to protect sensors and actuators, and the effective ones include node
    privacy and source encryption methods [140]. Malicious data attacks mainly happen
    in smart grids and position systems, and statistical methods and deep learning
    algorithms have primarily been applied to mitigate this problem [136]. In [141],
    an analytical method based on no previous knowledge of attack was adapted to multiple
    and simultaneous cyber-attacks. Alromih et al. [134] proposed a randomized watermarking
    filtering method to ensure data security in transmission layer and save as up
    to 85% more energy than Cui et al. [142]. In addition, an online robust PCA-based
    algorithm was proposed to reconstruct the original data when the corruption rate
    is no more than 20% [136]. Industrial control systems (ICS) are the major attack
    target of control system intrusions, which have strong impacts on these systems''
    transmission layer and application layer. Modbus/TCP oriented attack is a major
    type of control system intrusion. Ndona and Sadre [143] proposed a two-level intrusion
    detection system to efficient against Modbus/TCP oriented attacks with a small
    impact on communication latency. In [144], a new intrusion detection algorithm
    based on one-class SVM was presented with advantages of fast and strong generalization
    ability, less support vector, simple mode, and great practical value. Moreover,
    A stereo depth intrusion detection system with a low rate of false positive (not
    exceed 0.045%) was proposed [145]. With the development of smart agriculture,
    agricultural production will be the novel attack target, and above intrusion detection
    algorithms will contribute to the security of the agricultural control system.
    In summary, analyzing types of attacks for different smart agriculture researches
    and security strategies suitable for various agricultural scenarios is critical
    to ensuring the security of smart agriculture. SECTION VI. Future Trends and Security
    Issues The following issues may be the future research trends of smart agriculture,
    and they may result in novel security challenges. We briefly describe the concepts
    below. A. Fifth Generation Communication (5 G) 5 G is the next generation wireless
    communication technology with characteristics of high-frequency electromagnetic
    wave and low latency. Compared with the existing wireless communication technology,
    5 G provides faster data transmission speed and larger data throughput, which
    support the device communication, AI algorithm deployed in user end, distributed
    fault diagnosis method, and complex security strategy. However, 5 G is also vulnerable
    to security threats, e.g., interception of node communication. In addition, the
    security defined in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) focuses on resistance
    to network attacks, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. However, some
    emerging cryptographic techniques, e.g., public key infrastructure, anonymization,
    security mechanisms of IPsec, and differential privacy, etc., can be considered
    for achieving security and privacy requirements. To design efficient and secure
    privacy-preserving schemes using these techniques for 5 G-enabled smart agriculture
    networks, the following critical challenges need to be solved: How to protect
    the confidentiality of transmitted data between network entities? How to authenticate
    the source of the received data? How to protect the integrity of transmitted data
    between different network entities? How to detect and prevent attacks (e.g., falsification
    of multiple identities and replays data between network entities)? A possible
    research direction in this topic could be related to developing an efficient secure
    and privacy-preserving scheme for 5 G-enabled smart agriculture networks. For
    instance, the physical-layer threats in UAVs'' communication based on 5 G was
    discussed in [148]. Table XI Summary of recent works related to information security
    B. Fog Computing (FC) and Internet of Everything (IoE) FC is a computing paradigm
    that reduces communication delays by moving the cloud computing facilities and
    services to the access network. Since the FC is designed upon traditional networking
    components, it is highly vulnerable to security attacks (e.g., wiretapping, tampering,
    loss of information, and Trojan horses) [149]. IoT mainly focuses on machine-to-machine
    sensor-based smart facility communication, as well as IoE aims at providing services
    to people by IoT. Due to the resource-limited sensors and bandwidth-limited wireless
    communication, the Fog of Everything (FoE) was proposed in [150] to set up a complexity
    system. It will contribute to SIL-IoT and photovoltaic agricultural IoT which
    have multi-tasking requirements (i.e., operating, monitoring, and scheduling).
    In addition, data of farmers, consumers and sensors are fused by FoE, and part
    of processing modules of agricultural information, agricultural products trading
    and other data can be deployed in the local network layer, as shown in Fig. 18.
    With the application of new generation of communication technology, e.g., 5 G,
    FoE can meet more intelligent agricultural production demands, and improve the
    security of existing smart agriculture applications. Simultaneously, in the process
    of data fusion, transmission, storage and analysis, new security issues will inevitably
    arise due to the application of novel computing paradigm and information carrier,
    especially cyber security at the edge. Fig. 18. The novel mode of agricultural
    production by FoE architecture. Show All C. Renewable Energy Management System
    (Renewable EMS) With the aggravation of the global energy crisis, considerable
    attention has been paid to the study of integrating and using high penetration
    of renewable energy in past decades [151]. Renewable energy has been widely applied
    in various domains, and agriculture is one of the most potential application scenarios.
    Energy management plays a vital role in smart multi-microgrids for agriculture
    (e.g., energy management of photovoltaic agricultural IoT), and it can ensure
    the energy supply of sensors deployed outdoors with the combination of wireless
    charging technology. At present, the security scheme of renewable EMS usually
    includes fault self-diagnosis of hardware and software, identity authentication,
    data encryption, intrusion detection, and data backup, as shown in Fig. 19. Because
    agricultural facilities are mainly deployed in outdoor environment, fault self-diagnosis
    of hardware and software is very important to ensure the security scheme. In addition,
    blockchain technology may contribute to the security of renewable energy management
    system. Fig. 19. The security scheme of renewable EMS, including 1) Fault self-diagnosis
    of hardware and software in agricultural facilities and renewable energy equipment,
    2) Identity authentication and data encryption in data transmission layer, 3)
    Intrusion detection and data backup in background management. Show All D. Software
    Defined Network (SDN) Software defined network is characterized as a centrally-control
    network. With user-defined virtualization and programming, the relaying and controlling
    are performed separately, which can provide flexibility and reliability to the
    network management [152]. In recent years, SDN has been a hot subject, especially
    multi-domain SDN that controls large-scale networks, i.e., precision agriculture
    [153]. Moreover, It can effectively simplify the network, and manage heterogeneous
    network equipment. The SDN controller can monitor the security situation of whole
    network in real-time. However, centralizing the network control plane and enabling
    network programmability are the emphases of hacking, and may lead to new security
    challenges, controllers'' safety from applications, controller''s scalability
    and availability, resilience and placement, etc. [154]. For instance, a plant
    phenotype information system integrates multiple data sources, and SDN architecture
    can improve its performance and security, but new security threats are an urgent
    problem. As shown in Fig. 20, if hackers attack the SDN controller, it will transmit
    wrong control instructions, which results in abnormal data flow and affects the
    trust between the SDN controller and the plant phenotype information system applications.
    Fig. 20. A plant phenotype information system based on SDN architecture (including
    multiple data sources, control pane, data pane, and application layer) and security
    issues (trust between applications and controller, wrong control instructions,
    and abnormal data flow) result from hacker attacks. Show All E. Virtual Reality
    (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) VR is a simulated experience that can be similar
    to or completely different from the real world. AR is the technology of superimposing
    virtual objects upon the real world [155]. Although VR has been widely applied
    as an educational method in industry, there are a few researches about VR in agriculture
    domain. For instance, Kim et al. developed an educational simulator by VR technology
    for a better farmer education compared with two-dimensional screens [156]. Besides,
    a VR simulator that contributes to technical training of maintenance of agricultural
    machinery was developed [157]. Huuskonen et al. designed a wearable AR equipment
    to aid and guide the farmer to collect soil samples [158]. Both VR and AR technologies
    contribute to the automation and intelligence of agriculture. For instance, farmers
    can remotely and precisely control agricultural robots through VR and AR equipment
    in the control center. In addition, farmers can study the fault diagnosis and
    security countermeasures by VR educational simulator, which contribute to the
    improvement of security-conscious and prevention skills of farmers. However, both
    VR and AR technologies are vulnerable to various types of attacks, which have
    an impact on reliability of systems as they are designed to replace our perception
    of the physical world (e.g., tracking attacks) [159]. F. Cyber Security Datasets
    for Smart Agriculture When proposing intrusion detection systems, it is struggling
    to find comprehensive and valid cyber security datasets to test and evaluate the
    performance of cyber security intrusion detection. The study in [160] reviewed
    the most cyber security datasets used in deep learning approaches for cyber security
    intrusion detection such as NSL-KDD dataset, KDD Cup 1999 dataset, and UNSW-NB15
    dataset. These datasets are not simulated for smart agriculture environments.
    Therefore, the development of a new dataset to build a network intrusion detector
    under a smart agriculture environment is one of the significant research challenges.
    In addition, we believe that a comparative study of machine learning approaches
    for cyber security intrusion detection is needed for smart agriculture environments.
    G. Summary The integration of the above issues and agriculture provides the opportunity
    to promote intelligent and automatic agriculture. In addition, faster data transmission
    speed (5 G), lower communication cost and latency (FC), lower energy consumption
    (renewable energy management system), separate relaying and controlling (SDN),
    simulation environment (VR and AR), and datasets for evaluating model (Cyber security
    datasets for smart agriculture) contribute to the development of smart agriculture,
    as shown in Fig. 21. However, the above issues are confronted with more severe
    security challenges because security threats of them have not been fully explored.
    When the above issues are widely used in smart agriculture, there will be a quantity
    of security problems. And these problems may lead to serious consequences, e.g.,
    tracking attacks to VR equipment will result in improper positioning and harm
    to users. Therefore, secure and privacy-preserving schemes play a vital role in
    reliability of smart agriculture. Researches on the existing security and privacy
    countermeasures in the above issues can prevent security threats of them in smart
    agriculture. For instance, the authentication and access control and privacy-preserving
    scheme for 5 G-enabled smart agriculture networks is required with the rapid development
    of smart agriculture. To ensure the security of 5 G in agriculture, the researches
    on existing security and privacy countermeasures, and specific strategies will
    become hot issues in this field and promote the development of smart agriculture.
    From the above sections, it is suggested that: Expanding and improving the existing
    security and privacy countermeasures in smart agriculture (most of them are in
    the theoretical stage, and few actual cases). Analyzing the characteristics and
    challenges of security issues in smart agriculture scenarios, and applying the
    existing security and privacy countermeasures mainly for industrial scenarios
    to smart agriculture scenarios (industrial scenarios are widely used, but the
    characteristics of agricultural production are not taken into consideration).
    Following the development of novel technologies, applying them to smart agriculture
    scenarios, and highlighting the new security issues brought by them simultaneously.
    SECTION VII. Conclusion With rapidly advancing modern technology, smart agriculture,
    which is a combination of agriculture and information technology, is becoming
    a trend of agricultural development. However, information technology also entails
    various security challenges. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art works related
    to smart agriculture and discusses the security challenges of smart agriculture.
    We introduce three smart agriculture development modes (precision agriculture,
    facility agriculture, and order agriculture), and investigate 7 key technologies
    and 11 key applications of smart agriculture. It is followed by a summary of security
    and privacy countermeasures for smart agriculture. Authentication and access control,
    privacy-preserving, blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography
    and key management, physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems
    are introduced and discussed in detail. Then, we discuss the security challenges
    in agricultural production and information technology. In addition, we did some
    experiments based on SIL-IoT, and the results indicate that the interference of
    high voltage pulse discharge has an impact on data transmission and data acquisition.
    Moreover, we present six issues which may be the future research trends of smart
    agriculture and introduce the novel security challenges. Fig. 21. Future research

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\

    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n2 of 25\nmassive information\
    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\

    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\

    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    \a\nAbstract: The growing need for food worldwide requires the development of\
    \ a high-performance,\nhigh-productivity, and sustainable agriculture, which implies\
    \ the introduction of new technologies\ninto monitoring activities related to\
    \ control and decision-making. In this regard, this paper presents\na hierarchical\
    \ structure based on the collaboration between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\n\
    and federated wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for crop monitoring in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nThe integration of UAVs with intelligent, ground WSNs, and IoT\
    \ proved to be a robust and\neﬃcient solution for data collection, control, analysis,\
    \ and decisions in such specialized applications.\nKey advantages lay in online\
    \ data collection and relaying to a central monitoring point, while\neﬀectively\
    \ managing network load and latency through optimized UAV trajectories and in\
    \ situ\ndata processing. Two important aspects of the collaboration were considered:\
    \ designing the UAV\ntrajectories for eﬃcient data collection and implementing\
    \ eﬀective data processing algorithms\n(consensus and symbolic aggregate approximation)\
    \ at the network level for the transmission of the\nrelevant data. The experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where diﬀerent\ncrops and\
    \ methods are developed. The results demonstrate that the collaborative UAV–WSN–IoT\n\
    approach increases the performances in both precision agriculture and ecological\
    \ agriculture.\nKeywords: unmanned aerial vehicles; wireless sensor networks;\
    \ intelligent data processing; trajectory\nplanning; relevant data extraction;\
    \ data consensus; Internet of Things; precision agriculture\n1. Introduction\n\
    The need for high-performance, high-productivity, and sustainable agriculture\
    \ results from the\nrapid growth of the human population. This requires permanent\
    \ monitoring and intelligent processing\nof the measured data collected from the\
    \ ﬁeld, correlated with the weather forecasts, to produce\nagronomic recommendations.\
    \ In the last few years, new technologies in agriculture, and especially in\n\
    precision agriculture (PA), have been leveraged for increased productivity and\
    \ eﬃcient input dosage [1].\nMost importantly, in PA, farmers need to know exact\
    \ and timely details about crop status. These details\nabout certain parameters,\
    \ obtained by measurements both from the ground and in the air, constitute\ninput\
    \ data to specialized systems of process management in the PA. Some relevant examples\
    \ might\ninclude for example, irrigation control, pesticide dosage, pest control,\
    \ etc. For acquisition and complex\nprocessing of the collected data, integration\
    \ of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) under\
    \ novel frameworks, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), has been shown to\n\
    contribute to increases in agricultural yields [2]. Such advanced systems are\
    \ modeled as well-speciﬁed\nSensors 2020, 20, 817; doi:10.3390/s20030817\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 817\n2 of 25\nagent-based solutions with sensors and UAVs. Although\
    \ the contributions of UAVs and WSNs, taken\nseparately, are well documented and\
    \ important in the sustainable growth of agricultural production,\nthe integration\
    \ of these components together within an IoT framework is expected to signiﬁcantly\n\
    improve the solutions for monitoring, production modeling, prediction, and decision-making.\n\
    Relevant applications of UAV–WSN systems are presented in Reference [3–6]. In\
    \ viticulture,\nas a special type of PA, the soil and air parameters modify grape\
    \ yield and quality. For this purpose,\na solution based on the collaborative\
    \ system mini UAV (quadrotor type)–WSNs to monitor parameters,\nlike temperature\
    \ and humidity, to prevent the frost in fragmented vineyards is proposed in Reference\
    \ [3].\nThe UAV is considered as communication relay between sensors and a base\
    \ station. A real application\nfor monitoring sensitive parameters in vineyards\
    \ with both agro-meteorological stations and UAV\nplatforms is presented in Reference\
    \ [4]. In order to obtain a precise monitoring of the speciﬁc indicators,\nthe\
    \ data from the ground are correlated with the data collected by a UAV platform\
    \ with 8 rotors\nprovided with a professional thermal camera. The study was conducted\
    \ over a period of two years.\nFor data acquisition on large areas, a ﬁxed wing\
    \ type UAV, used as data mule from the ground WSN,\nis proposed in Reference [5].\
    \ In addition, the UAV has attached an high deﬁnition (HD) camera for the\ndetection\
    \ of certain plant diseases. Experimentally, a small tank has been added to spray\
    \ diﬀerent\ninsecticides, fertilizers, herbicides, etc. Both UAV and WSN are low\
    \ cost and not robust for only\ndemonstration purposes. In addition, in Reference\
    \ [6], a low cost agro-meteorological monitoring\nsystem in a vineyard was designed\
    \ and developed. The optimal positioning of the sensors was made\nwith the help\
    \ of the multispectral image analysis, acquired by UAV.\nGiven recent evolutions\
    \ in UAV technologies, cost reduction, and new regulations of aviation\nauthorities\
    \ regarding the usage and deployment of such systems (e.g., European Aviation\
    \ Safety\nAgency (EASA) [7] and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [8]), such\
    \ aerial robotic platforms\nare increasingly used in agriculture for diﬀerent\
    \ tasks, the most important being crop monitoring [9].\nAccording to EASA, the\
    \ UAVs should be safely integrated into the existing aviation context in a\nproportionate\
    \ way [7]. For large scale applications, in which UAVs are ﬂying beyond line-of-sight,\n\
    compliance with strict regulatory frameworks is essential.\nAdoption of a UAV-based\
    \ solution for image acquisition in agriculture applications is more\ncost eﬀective\
    \ and ﬂexible in comparison with satellite or manned aircraft alternatives [10].\
    \ Both\nﬁxed- wing [11,12] and rotary-wing type [3,13] UAVs are frequently used\
    \ in various applications in\nagriculture, while accounting for the risk of crashes\
    \ [9] and potential damages. Equipped with speciﬁc\nsensors in modular payloads\
    \ [14], such as high resolution RGB [15], infrared, multispectral [16,17],\nthermal\
    \ cameras [18,19], and also LIDAR [10], UAVs are able to create precise maps of\
    \ crop state or\nevolution [17], health plant assessment [20], diseases [21],\
    \ soil characteristics, evaluate losses caused\nby ﬂoods [11], etc. In the crop\
    \ monitoring, the following characteristics are analyzed from UAV\nimages [9]:\
    \ the crop water stress, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the canopy and the air\
    \ temperature,\nthe photochemical reﬂectance index, and the vegetation indices.\n\
    Although UAVs with diﬀerent propulsion systems are now available, most applications\
    \ in PA\nuse UAVs driven by electric motors due to their compact size, reduced\
    \ maintenance and operational\ncosts and, not the least, their alignment with\
    \ the current regulatory context and tendencies towards the\nreduction of global\
    \ carbon emissions [22].\nThe small-scale data acquisition by the WSN helps farmers\
    \ to take actions like crop irrigation,\nfertilizer usages, deciding on the optimum\
    \ stages of sowing, and harvesting [23]. Moreover, WSNs\nemployed in PA lead to\
    \ large amounts of data. Thus, data collection by WSNs is an important\ncontribution\
    \ to the development of farm management information systems (FMIS) [24,25].\n\
    The WSN has multiple functions at the ﬁeld level: data acquisition of various\
    \ parameters\n(e.g., temperature in soil and air, humidity in soil and air, solar\
    \ radiance, soil nutrients, the presence of\npests and weeds, chlorophyll content\
    \ in plants, etc.), distributed processing of data by establishing\nconsensus—if\
    \ it is the case, establishing the relevant data and its storage, low level data\
    \ fusion, and\ndata transmission. New sensor node designs oﬀer reduced costs [26];\
    \ see, for example, the detailed list\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n3 of 25\nof sensors\
    \ used in PA given in Reference [10]. As in many other large-area monitoring applications,\n\
    for communication or local processing reasons, the sensors are grouped into sensor\
    \ networks, the\ncommunication being made by radio. A WSN network will include\
    \ measurement nodes (sensory\nnodes) and data collection, processing, and transmission\
    \ nodes (sink or cluster head).\nRegarding PA, there is no rigorous theory of\
    \ sensor placement because it depends on the\nparticularities of the soil and\
    \ the weather. Sensor groups need to comply broadly with the need for\nsensory\
    \ and communication coverage. In Reference [27], two examples of sensor location\
    \ topologies\nare given: grid and random. From the point of view of communication\
    \ with the sink node, the most\nused are the star and mesh topologies. The wireless\
    \ communication protocols used in WSN for PA are\nthe following [10]: 6LoWPAN,\
    \ ZigBee (both being the most suitable for the mesh topology), LoRaWAN,\nGSM,\
    \ BLE, and Wi-Fi.\nIn PA, WSNs are used, most often, for parameter monitoring,\
    \ but they can also be integrated into\ncontrol systems as sensors. Direct speciﬁc\
    \ applications of WSN in control systems for PA are the energy\neﬃcient automated\
    \ control of irrigation [28] and smart automated fertilization [29].\nThe performance\
    \ of the crop monitoring can be improved by UAV–WSN collaboration [30].\nThe collaborative\
    \ aspects in an integrated UAV (aerial agents)–WSN (ground agents) architecture\
    \ for\ndiﬀerent applications was recently presented in a review paper [22], where\
    \ the diﬀerent functional\ncomponents of the system and how they collaborate with\
    \ each other was highlighted. In Reference [31],\nthe authors presented an integrated\
    \ UAV–WSN–IoT system, named FarmBeats, which is an end-to-end\nplatform for data\
    \ collection from various sensors, cameras, and drones in agricultural applications.\n\
    An unlicensed TV White Spaces is used to setup a high bandwidth link from the\
    \ farmer’s home to an\nIoT ground station at a distance for collecting data from\
    \ UAVs and WSNs.\nIn order to interconnect the UAVs and terrestrial WSNs into\
    \ hybrid networks and, at the same\ntime, to ensure a safe airspace sharing with\
    \ aircrafts, multiple organizations are contributing [22]:\nInternational Civil\
    \ Aviation Organization, EASA, Joint Authorities for Rulemaking on Unmanned\n\
    Systems, International Telecommunications Union, etc. Satellite connection is\
    \ required for two reasons.\nOne-way communication, such as obtaining the GPS\
    \ location of the UAVs or the sensory nodes (if any)\nis one reason. The second\
    \ reason is a possible data transmission or remote control (via two-way\nsatellite-intermediated\
    \ internet).\nIn Reference [32], the authors discuss the information system design\
    \ supporting agriculture\ndata management. Enabling advanced data processing in\
    \ the form of sensor fusion and clustering\nmechanisms for improved network topologies\
    \ in generic applications has been discussed [30]. Eﬀective\ndata gathering mechanisms\
    \ [33] and higher level IoT architectures [34] are key and current topics\nof\
    \ interest.\nWe believe that the challenges of UAV–WSN–IoT integrated systems\
    \ can come from several\ndirections: (a) precise localization of the ground sensors\
    \ with the aid of a preliminary ﬂight; (b) sensor\nstates periodically inspected\
    \ by UAV; (c) establishing of the WSNs as sensor clusters able to cover, both\n\
    from the sensorial and from the communication point of view the monitored area;\
    \ (d) establishing\nthe cluster heads (CH), named base stations, of the WSNs able\
    \ to communicate data to UAVs;\n(e) transmitting commands to change the strategy\
    \ and parameters of the sensor networks, (f) data\nacquisition from WSNs through\
    \ UAVs, (g) special trajectory planning and tracking, (h) the aggregation\nof\
    \ information collected by the UAV with the information collected by WSN for the\
    \ purpose of\nmeasuring and interpreting the parameters with increased accuracy,\
    \ (i) remote control via Internet,\nand (j) edge and cloud computing.\nIn a hierarchical\
    \ structure, the data processing architecture of the integrated system is based\
    \ on\nthree levels: consensus, edge computing [35], and cloud computing.\nFor\
    \ the main activity, the data collection from CH, UAV must have a predeﬁned trajectory,\
    \ properly\ndesigned, and accounting for the following limitations:\n•\nWaypoint\
    \ passing: a UAV has to pass above the CH to extract the relevant data from that\
    \ area\n(covered by the corresponding WSN sub-network);\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n\
    4 of 25\n•\nObstacle avoidance: UAVs avoid obstructions or prohibited areas along\
    \ the ﬂight plan;\n•\nGuaranteed communication: to ensure that the data has been\
    \ fully collected, enough time has to\nbe spent in the CH neighborhood;\n•\nEﬃciency:\
    \ reduce at a minimum the energy consumption for that trajectory (consider the\
    \ length\nof the trajectory and its complexity).\nThe integration of UAV–WSN based\
    \ systems for PA in IoT is a mandatory step to create an\nadvanced FMIS [25].\n\
    Due to the integration, the system can become “smart” by using elements of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence\nlike self-adaptation and decision, optimal trajectory, data transmission\
    \ of relevant parameter values,\nenergy eﬃciency, and neural networks for data\
    \ and image processing. Not in the least, the sensors must\nbe placed optimally,\
    \ considering the terrain characteristics. Battery life is an important design\
    \ point\nof the ground sensor algorithms by reducing to a minimum the number of\
    \ wireless communications\nneeded to transfer the information. The radio interface\
    \ is the critical factor in increasing battery life.\nBased on the frequency of\
    \ the data collection and radio transmissions the nodes can have a battery\nlifetime\
    \ ranging from several months up to one year. Therefore, the intelligent collaboration\
    \ between\nUAV and WSN can lead to optimization of parameters, such as energy\
    \ consumption, sensing coverage,\nrisk, data acquisition, and processing time\
    \ [36]. To this end, bio-inspired optimization heuristics and\ngenetic algorithms\
    \ were applied to the aforementioned agents.\nThe optimal WSN coverage by the\
    \ aid of UAV platforms is implemented in Reference [37] as an\noptimization problem,\
    \ formulated by means of the travelling salesman problem, in order to ﬁnd the\n\
    best path of the UAV for data collection with minimum energy consumption.\nUsing\
    \ UAV as data mule for multi WSNs is an energy-eﬃcient method to increase the\
    \ networks’\nlife. To this end, the authors in Reference [38] apply the successive\
    \ convex optimization technique.\nThe proposed system presents the following integration\
    \ aspects:\n-\nGroup the sensors in clusters and determine the cluster heads,\
    \ the methodology proposed by the\nauthors in Reference [30];\n-\nPath planning\
    \ based on speciﬁc conditions for eﬃcient data collection; and\n-\nIntelligent\
    \ data collection and processing.\nThe main contributions consist in the following:\
    \ (i) implementation of a multilevel, collaborative\nUAV–WSN system structure\
    \ for agriculture applications, (ii) a speciﬁc path planning for ﬁxed\nwing–type\
    \ UAV with the purpose of robust and eﬃcient data collection, (iii) obtaining\
    \ relevant data\nfrom sensors for the purpose of saving energy, and (iv) edge–fog–cloud\
    \ computing algorithms for\nsubsequent data processing. Thus, the main challenge\
    \ is related to improving data extraction and\ncommunication in large scale heterogeneous\
    \ monitoring system. The key problem is focused on\nimproving the performance\
    \ of such systems through better algorithms and synchronization among the\ntwo\
    \ subsystems: the ground sensor network and the robotic aerial platforms, implemented\
    \ as UAVs,\nfor data collection and relaying.\nThe rest of the paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 describes the concept, the methodology,\nand key aspects\
    \ that have been addressed for the proper design and implementation of the system.\n\
    Section 3 presents the experimental results and performances after implementing\
    \ the system on an\nexperimental farm. Section 4 highlights the conclusions, as\
    \ well as future work.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Requirements for Integrated\
    \ UAV-WSN-IoT Systems\nFor the design of reliable and robust large-scale monitoring\
    \ system the requirements have to\nﬁrst be validated. The main challenges for\
    \ such collaborative systems were considered to be: sensing\ncoverage in accordance\
    \ to mission objectives, communication coverage by the hybrid UAV–WSN\nsystem\
    \ using various types of radio links, from low-power, low-data rate to high throughput\
    \ long\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n5 of 25\ndistance for streaming, energy eﬃciency,\
    \ and, not in the least, computing eﬃciency. The decentralized\narchitecture for\
    \ crop ﬁeld monitoring described in this paper is designed to overcome the challenges\n\
    mentioned above and to account for the data generation patterns at the ﬁeld level.\
    \ While the proposed\ndata fusion mechanisms and processing of centralized in-ﬁeld\
    \ data at CH level manage to reduce data\nvolume and ensure the ﬂow of information\
    \ up to the level of events, an additional intermediate level is\nappended to\
    \ the data stream, in order to reach the server. To this end, we consider both\
    \ mobile agents\n(UAV) and multiple ﬁxed agents (ground sensors (SNs)). The system\
    \ diagram is presented in Figure 1.\nThe mobile agent can perform the following\
    \ functions: data mulling, image acquisition, relay, and\nstate inspection of\
    \ WSNs. The ﬁxed agents acquire data from the ﬁeld (agricultural ﬁeld—soil and\
    \ air),\nprocess data locally (relevant data extraction, data consensus), and\
    \ ﬁnally transmit data to the UAV by\nmeans of CHs. The system is composed of\
    \ four main processing levels (Table 1): Sensor level, Fog\nComputing level, Internet/Cloud\
    \ Computing level, and Data Management and Interpretation level.\nThis is a multi-WSN–UAV\
    \ structure with higher level integration in internet-based systems for decision\n\
    support. The data from WSNs are collected by a UAV, transmitted at a ground control\
    \ station (GCS),\nand, from here via the internet, to the Data Interpretation\
    \ module. Analytics functionality ranges from\nbasic statistical indicators to\
    \ trend and event detectors and up to basic statistical learning models that\n\
    have the ability to anticipate evolutions in the monitored ground phenomena.\n\
    Another important requirement of the integrated system is the correlated or complementary\n\
    interpretation of the data from the sensory agents, either mobile or ﬁxed. For\
    \ example, when the soil\nmoisture is too high, the soil sensors show the maximum\
    \ value and cannot discern whether a ﬂood has\noccurred. This can be accurately\
    \ determined from aerial images taken by the UAV. In addition, the\ndegree of\
    \ humidity in plants and the degree of foliage development can be observed either\
    \ from the\nground or from the air (images), and a more precise determination\
    \ results from the fusion of the two\ndata sets.\nOther types of similar systems\
    \ were surveyed and can include the use of swarms of multi-copter\ntype UAVs,\
    \ which oﬀer better positioning accuracy for data collection while trading oﬀ\
    \ energy eﬃciency\nand autonomy. Ground sensor network implementation can also\
    \ be a diﬀerentiating factor with two\nmain approaches: random deployment of sensor\
    \ nodes in the area of interest, according to a minimum\nexpected sensing coverage\
    \ density, or deterministic, grid-like placement. Intermediate data processing\n\
    steps from the ﬁeld level to the decision level are commonly accepted as an important\
    \ mechanism to\nbalance network loads and improve communication latency.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n5 of 25 \n \nthe challenges mentioned above and\
    \ to account for the data generation patterns at the field level. \nWhile the\
    \ proposed data fusion mechanisms and processing of centralized in-field data\
    \ at CH level \nmanage to reduce data volume and ensure the flow of information\
    \ up to the level of events, an \nadditional intermediate level is appended to\
    \ the data stream, in order to reach the server. To this end, \nwe consider both\
    \ mobile agents (UAV) and multiple fixed agents (ground sensors (SNs)). The system\
    \ \ndiagram is presented in Figure 1. The mobile agent can perform the following\
    \ functions: data mulling, \nimage acquisition, relay, and state inspection of\
    \ WSNs. The fixed agents acquire data from the field \n(agricultural field—soil\
    \ and air), process data locally (relevant data extraction, data consensus), and\
    \ \nfinally transmit data to the UAV by means of CHs. The system is composed of\
    \ four main processing \nlevels (Table 1): Sensor level, Fog Computing level,\
    \ Internet/Cloud Computing level, and Data \nManagement and Interpretation level.\
    \ This is a multi-WSN–UAV structure with higher level \nintegration in internet-based\
    \ systems for decision support. The data from WSNs are collected by a \nUAV, transmitted\
    \ at a ground control station (GCS), and, from here via the internet, to the Data\
    \ \nInterpretation module. Analytics functionality ranges from basic statistical\
    \ indicators to trend and \nevent detectors and up to basic statistical learning\
    \ models that have the ability to anticipate \nevolutions in the monitored ground\
    \ phenomena. \nAnother important requirement of the integrated system is the correlated\
    \ or complementary \ninterpretation of the data from the sensory agents, either\
    \ mobile or fixed. For example, when the soil \nmoisture is too high, the soil\
    \ sensors show the maximum value and cannot discern whether a flood \nhas occurred.\
    \ This can be accurately determined from aerial images taken by the UAV. In addition,\
    \ \nthe degree of humidity in plants and the degree of foliage development can\
    \ be observed either from \nthe ground or from the air (images), and a more precise\
    \ determination results from the fusion of the \ntwo data sets. \nOther types\
    \ of similar systems were surveyed and can include the use of swarms of multi-copter\
    \ \ntype UAVs, which offer better positioning accuracy for data collection while\
    \ trading off energy \nefficiency and autonomy. Ground sensor network implementation\
    \ can also be a differentiating factor \nwith two main approaches: random deployment\
    \ of sensor nodes in the area of interest, according to \na minimum expected sensing\
    \ coverage density, or deterministic, grid-like placement. Intermediate \ndata\
    \ processing steps from the field level to the decision level are commonly accepted\
    \ as an important \nmechanism to balance network loads and improve communication\

    \ must be considered. The ﬁrst is the trajectory planning\nfor collecting data\
    \ from sensors (CHs), and it must take into account certain requirements, such\
    \ as\nthe complete and safe acquisition of data, on one hand, and minimize energy\
    \ and time consumption,\non the other hand [39].\nUnder certain reasonable assumptions\
    \ (known environment, known limitations), the UAV tasks\nreduce to computing a\
    \ trajectory which respects constraints and minimizes a cost (length, total energy\n\
    consumption, etc.), while simultaneously respecting various constraints (internal\
    \ dynamics, stall\nvelocity constraints or exogenous ones, those imposed by the\
    \ environment, such as obstacle avoidance\nand waypoint passing through).\nThe\
    \ particularity lies in the fact that many of the UAV-speciﬁc constraints are\
    \ non-convex [40],\ne.g., the variable of interest z (depending of time t) has\
    \ to stay outside some bound (e.g., outside of\nan interdicted region and/or maintain\
    \ a minimal velocity). If z(t) is the UAV position, the velocity\nrestrictions\
    \ are usually written as follows:\nv ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\n.z(t)\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\
    \ ≤ v.\n(1)\nBoth bounds (lower—v and upper—v) may depend on a variety of factors.\
    \ Hard constraints are\nimposed by the UAV physics: upper bound given by the engine\
    \ characteristics and lower bound by\nthe requirement to avoid stall. Note that\
    \ this work neglects the inﬂuence of wind: velocity is usually\nmeasured against\
    \ the ground (e.g., through a GPS), but, in fact, the UAV “feels” the addition\
    \ of its own\nand of the wind velocities. This may lead to an unexpected stall\
    \ or, at least, improper behavior. Usual\ntechniques are to provide more conservative\
    \ bounds in Equation (1) and to restrict the ﬂight to normal\nweather conditions.\n\
    Waypoints are introduced, in a practical mission, because data has to be gathered\
    \ from a cluster\nnode. Thus, the question of minimum communication time arises\
    \ [41]: It is necessary to remain in a\nspeciﬁc neighborhood for a deﬁned time\
    \ interval ∆ti. To correctly describe such a constraint, we require\na tuple (ωi,\
    \ ∆ti, ri , Ri), where ωi is the corresponding cluster node position (the center\
    \ of the circle in\nFigure 2), and ri and Ri are, respectively, the minimum and\
    \ the maximum radius of the permitted\ncommunication area. Because there are perturbations\
    \ due to trajectory control errors or other causes,\nthe real trajectory is included\
    \ in a ﬂight lane (Figure 2a). The ﬂight lane was experimentally established\n\
    at 30 m, under reasonable assumptions about wind speed. The trajectory z(t) has\
    \ to stay near the\nwaypoint for a least amount of time ∆ti determined by the\
    \ quantity of data which has to be transferred:\nri ≤\n\f\f\f\n\f\f\fωi − z(t)\n\
    \f\f\f\n\f\f\f ≤ Ri, t ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti].\n(2)\ncondition (2) is often impractical\
    \ to check due to the continuous nature of z(t) and because of the\nvarying time\
    \ interval [ti, ti + ∆ti]. The usual approach is to sample the constraint and\
    \ to estimate the\npath length by assuming the bounds (1) on the velocity. To\
    \ this end, we consider:\n\f\f\f\f\n\f\f\f\fz\n\x10\nti\n\x11\n− ωi\n\f\f\f\f\n\
    \f\f\f\f = ri,\n(3)\nwith ti given such that ti ∈ [ti, ti + ∆ti]) holds; it is\
    \ important that a waypoint is reached, not when.\nSensors 2020, 20, 817\n7 of\
    \ 25\nNote that the shortest distance for a trajectory checking (4) is the straight\
    \ line shown in Figure 2a,\nwhose length is 2\nq\nR2\ni − r2\ni . In other words,\
    \ a suﬃcient condition for guaranteeing that the minimal\ntime ∆ti has passed\
    \ is to ensure that\n∆ti ≥\n2\nq\nR2\ni − r2\ni\nv\n.\n(4)\nCondition (4) provides\
    \ a lower bound for the time the UAV stays between the inner and outer\ncircles\
    \ (i.e., how much time it spends inside waypoint’s ωi communication range). Then,\
    \ inserting (3) in\na trajectory design procedure implicitly guarantees enough\
    \ communication time. This approach may\nbe insuﬃcient for a couple of reasons.\
    \ First, the desired communication time may not be known at the\ntrajectory generation\
    \ time and thus could not be compared with ∆ti. Second, the communication time\n\
    is known to be larger than ∆ti and a “tangential” pass (like the one enforced\
    \ by (3)) does not suﬃce.\nThe method (detailed below) is to enter a loitering\
    \ mode to increase arbitrarily the data-gathering\ntime [42]. Making the reasonable\
    \ assumption that the loitering rl\ni radius respects the condition\nri < rl\n\
    i < Ri, means that the UAV can orbit the waypoint ωi for an indeﬁnite period of\
    \ time [43]. From\nthe viewpoint of trajectory generation, the only relevant question\
    \ remains the places at which the\nUAV inserts/dislodges onto/from the loitering\
    \ circle. Both of these points are decided by the relative\nposition of the current\
    \ waypoint with respect to the previous and next waypoints in the sequence\n(such\
    \ as to reduce unnecessary inﬂexions in the trajectory). The switch between normal\
    \ and loitering\nmodes will be done at pre-determined points: the trajectory enters\
    \ loitering mode at a point ω−\ni and\ndislodges from it at a point ω+\ni (which\
    \ lie on the loitering circle and are from/towards the direction\nof the previous/next\
    \ waypoint). Thus, when the UAV decides to ﬁnish the communication, it will\n\
    continue to orbit the loitering circle until it reaches the dislodging point ω+\n\
    i . Here, it will switch back\nto the normal trajectory mode.\nThe inner (dotted\

    \ line)\nare illustrated in Figure 2b. We show a trajectory inserting to the loitering\
    \ circle, tracking an arc of\nit, and, lastly, dislodging from the circle to re-enter\
    \ its normal mode (line tracking). The UAV could\nhave orbited the loitering circle\
    \ repeatedly and dislodged from it at ω+\ni when desired. As is mentioned\nabove,\

    \ and segment tracking mode, which are\ndecided by the supervisor (in the sense\
    \ that within the collection of waypoints a priori computed,\nsome of them are\
    \ labeled as loiter points).\n▶\nIn both cases, the algorithm provides a heading\
    \ which is the reference to be tracked by the\nUAV. This is in line with standard\
    \ practices, where the heading is decided through some design\nprocedure and the\
    \ velocity and pitch and roll angles are decided at the auto-pilot level (usually\n\
    the velocity is maintained constant and the roll and pitch are taken as needed\
    \ between admissible\nbounds).\n▶\nThe decisions taken by the algorithm and supervisor\
    \ are, ultimately, related to the distance\nbetween the current position and some\
    \ point of interest. To do so, we consider some circles of\ninterest, deﬁned as\
    \ follows:\n#\nCommunication circle: the UAV communicates with the ground-based\
    \ cluster head only\nwhen it is within the communication radius.\n#\nWaypoint\
    \ update circle: it is impractical to assume that the UAV passes through the exact\n\
    coordinates of the current waypoint. Thus, we update the active segment (by advancing\n\
    through the list of waypoints) whenever we are close enough to the end-point of\
    \ the\ncurrent segment.\n#\nLoitering circle: whenever the UAV is required to\
    \ spend a signiﬁcant time in communication\nwith the current cluster head, the\
    \ decision to start loitering is taken. The loitering radius is\nrestricted to\
    \ be less than the communication radius and larger than the physical limitations\n\
    imposed by the roll angle bounds (a tighter circle means a larger roll angle).\n\
    #\nProximity circle: the procedure employed in the algorithm takes (whenever there\
    \ is\nintersection between the circle and the current segment) the heading angle\
    \ in the direction\nof the intersection point (the one closest to the end-point\
    \ of the segment).\n▶\nWhen the last waypoint is covered, the UAV returns to base\
    \ (by default, we consider this to be\nthe initial point on the trajectory).\n\
    Without being exhaustive, some of the most relevant updates in the algorithm are:\n\
    In segment tracking mode:\n1.\nAt the current time, we consider the UAV position\
    \ (x,y), the segment determined by the current\n(CP) and next waypoint (CP + 1):\n\
    \x10\nwi\nx, wi\ny\n\x11\n,\n\x10\nwi+1\nx\n, wi+1\ny\n\x11\n.\n2.\nWe compute\
    \ the projection of the current point onto the current segment (PP). We identify\
    \ three\npossible cases by checking the relative position of the projection wrt\
    \ the segment’s end points\n(described by W): inside the segment (0 ≤ W ≤ 1)),\
    \ outside and located before the initial segment\nend (W < 0); outside and located\
    \ after the initial segment end (W > 1);\n3.\nWe compute the distance (D) from\
    \ the current point to the segment and the circle of radius L\n(proportional with\
    \ the UAV velocity) and further used to compute the heading vector.\n4.\nWe consider\
    \ the following cases:\ni.\nThe UAV is too far away, and the projection point\
    \ lies before the segment start point. Then,\nthe heading angle points towards\
    \ the projection point.\nii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and the projection\

    \ the start point.\niii.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close to the segment end point,\
    \ or its projection onto the segment\nlies after the end point. Then, the current\

    v.\nThe UAV is suﬃciently close, and its projection lies onto the interior of\
    \ the segment.\nThe heading angle is taken as the vector of length L in which\
    \ the tip lies on the segment\n(there are two possible tips; the one closer to\
    \ the segment end point is considered).\n5.\nGo to step 1.\nIn the loitering mode:\n\
    1.\nSelect the loitering center as the current waypoint.\n2.\nConstruct the circle\
    \ of radius L and centered in the current position of the UAV.\n3.\nIf the circle\
    \ does not intersect the loitering circle, move towards the projection point situated\
    \ on\nthe loitering circle.\n4.\nIf the proximity circle intersects the loitering\
    \ circle, take the heading vector along the tangent at\nthe intersection point\
    \ between loitering circle and proximity circle (there are two solutions, we\n\
    selected depending on the desired loitering rotation—clockwise or counterclockwise).\n\
    Note that all steps where a decision regarding the trajectory update is taken\
    \ consist in fact in a\ndecision about the UAV’s heading. Thus, for trajectory\
    \ tracking, only the heading angle is used as\ncontrol input. This suﬃces for\
    \ relatively simple trajectories and is robust against wind disturbances\n(as\
    \ later shown in the simulations).\n2.3. Relevant Data Extraction\nThe collected\
    \ data is hierarchically processed from the ground level, cluster head level,\
    \ UAV level\nup to the cloud. Alongside these steps, information is gradually\
    \ extracted through various methods\nthat enable local decisions based on the\
    \ conﬁguration of the system (thresholding, consensus, symbolic\naggregate approximation,\
    \ etc.).\nIn-ﬁeld data processing is ensured both at local level (independent\
    \ data ﬁltering) and decentralized\nat network level (through data exchange between\
    \ neighbor sensory nodes). The proposed data\nprocessing mechanisms, tailored\
    \ for in-ﬁeld level, are designed in order to ensure a substantial\nweighted average.\
    \ This step is found as ‘Enable consensus dialog’. Once the convergence is reached,\n\
    each node performs a routine for results analysis basically seeking to discover\
    \ and mark nodes with\ndivergent values. This information remains available alongside\
    \ the consensus value so that it can be\ninterrogated by the higher level of data\
    \ processing if needed. This is found in Figure 4 as ‘Analyze\nresults step’.\n\
    Aggregated data sets are achieved through diﬀerent methods. All seek for relevant\
    \ data points,\naiming to a reduced size set and providing at the same time a\
    \ satisfying reconstruction of the initial\ndata. The proposed method for data\
    \ aggregation is based on the minimum and maximum values\nextraction, computed\
    \ as global extremes for a predeﬁned period of time (e.g., a day). It is obvious\
    \ that\nthis method is suitable only for measurements that have a periodic behavior,\
    \ with smooth variations\nduring the day. A measurement for which this method\
    \ is suitable is the soil temperature. Conversely,\nchange detection is commonly\
    \ used for irregularly-shaped data sets. This method follows extraction of\nlocal\
    \ extreme points where trend changes occur.\nGiven a set of data points (xi, yi),\
    \ i = 1, . . . , n, trend ti is computed for each sequence\nmeasurements such\
    \ that for a measure m, (5),(6),(7) has to be true. If ti , ti+1, then it means\
    \ that a trend\nchange has occurred, and the data point (xi, yi) is added to the\
    \ relevant data set.\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni > δm ⇒ tm\ni = 1,\n(5)\nxm\ni+1 − xm\ni\

    \ to reach the convergence value\nunder the inﬂuence of the information ﬂow exchanged\
    \ inside the network. Each node updates its\nestimated value using an updating\
    \ rule. An update law for node ni based on local weighted consensus\nis described\
    \ by the following equation:\nxi(k + 1) = ωiixi(k) +\nX\nj∈Ni ωijxj(k),\n(8)\n\
    X\ni∈M\nX\nj∈Ni ωij = 1,\n(9)\nwhere\nxi ∈ R is the computed estimate of node\
    \ i;\nωii is the weight applied to its own previous computed estimate;\nωij is\
    \ the weight associated with the node j for the value of node i;\nk is a convergence\
    \ step; and\nNi is the neighborhood of node i, i ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . , m} = M.\n\
    The proposed consensus algorithm is built using a hybrid weighted average consensus\
    \ which\nensures that the updating rule computes the current convergence value,\
    \ keeping a high priority for the\nclosest neighbors, but at the same time, it\
    \ aims at suppressing outlier values.\nEach node computes the weights ωij based\
    \ on the distance dij computed using the available\nlocation information.\nωij\

    where\ndmin is the distance to the closest neighbor; and\ndij denotes the distance\
    \ between node i and j.\nUsing the selected weights, the algorithm performs a\
    \ weighted average of neighbors values\ndeﬁned as:\nNimean(k + 1) =\nP\nj∈Ni ωijxj(k)\n\
    dim(Ni)\n.\n(11)\nIn order to suppress outlier values, additional weights are\
    \ applied for previously computed\nestimate xi(k) and current neighborhood estimate\
    \ average Nimean(k + 1).\nThus, this is an\nauto-supressing mechanism computed\
    \ as the ratio between the standard deviation at convergence step\nk + 1 and the\
    \ deviation of the previous estimate xi(k). This is written as:\nxi(k + 1) =\n\
    ∆(k+1)·xi(k)+δ·Nimean(k+1)\n∆(k+1)+δ\n∆(k + 1) =\ns\nP\nj∈Ni[ xj(k)−Nimean(k+1)]\n\

    \ is the weight applied to the state value, computed for each step of the average\
    \ consensus;\n-\nδ is the weight applied to the neighborhood estimate.\nOnce the\
    \ consensus is reached, each node performs a routine for results analysis basically\
    \ seeking\nto discover and mark nodes with divergent values. This information\
    \ remains available alongside\nthe consensus value so that it can be interrogated\

  analysis: '**Internet of Things in arable farming: Implementation, applications,
    challenges and potential**


    The Internet of Things (IoT) is allowing agriculture, here specifically arable
    farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective production
    and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental impact.


    This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential application
    of IoT in arable farming, where spatial data, highly varying environments, task
    diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges to be overcome compared to
    other agricultural systems.


    The review contributes an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed.
    It provides an outline of the current and potential applications, and discusses
    the challenges and possible solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents
    some future directions for the IoT in arable farming.


    *Current issues such as smart phones, intelligent management of Wireless Sensor
    Networks, middleware platforms, integrated Farm Management Information Systems
    across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles and robotics stand out because
    of their potential to lead arable farming to smart arable farming.


    *During the implementation, different challenges are encountered, and here interoperability
    is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the architecture of an IoT
    system, which can be addressed by shared standards and protocols.


    *Challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the power consumption
    of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during data transfer, as
    well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and security have been
    identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance, and academic research
    should direct their resources toward solving or reducing these issues.


    **Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a real benefit
    for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small producers.
    How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers requires
    further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature reviewed.**


    The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting technologies
    should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing data at the
    edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce network
    latency and capacity/throughput problems.


    The emergence of Big Data is posing significant challenges for data analysis,
    as the complexity and heterogeneity of the huge data sets require the application
    of new analysis techniques beyond those traditionally used. Techniques such as
    lowering data dimensionality, cloud platforms and cloud computing, including machine
    learning algorithms, can help in this area and new innovative solutions are expected
    to be developed.


    Finally, technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data
    handled throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without
    compromising the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms
    can help improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such
    as blockchain can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when
    dealing with Big Data.


    **In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are integrated
    in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over some of the
    management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which will require
    training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision support functions
    include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply chain functions,
    which will gain importance with Big Data analytics.**


    In addition, DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise
    field operations using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications.


    **Finally, the introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming
    in the near future is expected to completely change arable farming operations
    and production praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities.**'

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    and potential'
  verbatim_quote1: Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) is allowing agriculture,
    here specifically arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely
    and cost-effective production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing
    their environmental impact.
  verbatim_quote2: This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and
    potential application of IoT in arable farming, where spatial data, highly varying
    environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges to be overcome
    compared to other agricultural systems.

  analysis: 'The study "Energy-Efficient Edge-Fog-Cloud Architecture for IoT-Based
    Smart Agriculture Environment" by Alharbi and Aldossary explores the use of an
    edge-fog-cloud computing architecture to optimize energy efficiency in smart agriculture
    systems. The focus of the analysis is on data collected from diverse sources,
    including soil moisture, canopy temperature, and weather conditions, and how this
    data is used to inform irrigation management decisions.


    The paper proposes an integrated edge-fog-cloud architecture that leverages mathematical
    modeling and a heuristic algorithm to optimize the offloading of IoT agriculture
    applications. The model considers factors such as network resource consumption
    and processing requirements to determine the optimal placement of these applications
    on edge, fog, or cloud computing layers. The architecture aims to reduce energy
    consumption by minimizing the volume of data that needs to be transferred to the
    cloud, as cloud-based processing can be energy-intensive.


    The analysis shows that the proposed architecture can significantly reduce overall
    power consumption, carbon emissions, and network traffic compared to traditional
    cloud-based architectures. The energy savings are attributed to the use of edge
    and fog layers for processing tasks that do not require significant computing
    resources. By reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud, the architecture
    also helps minimize network congestion.


    The paper contributes to the field of smart agriculture by presenting a novel
    approach to energy-efficient data management and processing. The proposed architecture
    and optimization model provide valuable insights for designing and implementing
    sustainable smart agriculture systems that can optimize resource utilization while
    ensuring data reliability and real-time processing capabilities.


    Here are the three most relevant verbatim quotes from the paper:


    1. "The proposed architecture allows data collection from several sensors to process
    and analyze the agriculture data that require real-time operation (e.g., weather
    temperature, soil moisture, soil acidity, irrigation, etc.) in several layers
    (edge, fog, and cloud)."


    2. "Thus, the real-time processing could be held by the edge and fog layers to
    reduce the load on the cloud layer, which will help to enhance the overall energy
    consumption and process the agriculture applications/services efficiently."


    3. "The results showed that our proposed architecture can reduce the overall power
    consumption, carbon footprints, and network traffic by up to 43%, 36%, 86%, respectively."'

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: The current agriculture systems compete to take advantage
    of industry advanced technologies, including the internet of things (IoT), cloud/fog/edge
    computing, artificial intelligence, and agricultural robots to monitor, track,
    analyze and process various functions and services in real-time. Additionally,
    these technologies can make the agricultural processes smarter and more cost-efficient
    by using automated systems and eliminating any human interventions, hence enhancing
    agricultural production to meet future expectations. Although the current agriculture
    systems that adopt the traditional cloud-based architecture have provided powerful
    computing infrastructure to distributed IoT sensors. However, the cost of energy
    consumption associated with transferring heterogeneous data over the multiple
    network tiers to process, analyze and store the sensor''s information in the cloud
    has created a huge load on information and communication infrastructure. Besides,
    the energy consumed by cloud data centers has an environmental impact associated
    with using non-clean fuels, which usually release carbon emissions (CO 2 ) to
    produce electricity. Thus, to tackle these issues, we propose a new integrated
    edge-fog-cloud architectural paradigm that promises to enhance the energy-efficient
    of smart agriculture systems and corresponding carbon emissions. This architecture
    allows data collection from several sensors to process and analyze the agriculture
    data that require real-time operation (e.g., weather temperature, soil moisture,
    soil acidity, irrigation, etc.) in several layers (edge, fog, and cloud). Thus,

    load on the cloud layer, which will help to enhance the overall energy consumption

    of Things (IoT) is one of the emerging technologies that promise to transform
    the way on how people work and live. The term IoT refers to a network of physical
    objects “things” that contain embedded systems with connectivity and computing
    power to exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet. By 2025,
    the number of IoT devices connected to the Internet is projected to be 100 billion,
    with an economic impact of more than $ 11 trillion [1]. The recent development
    of IoT devices presents a new dimension in the agriculture field, where the IoT
    has become an ideal choice for smart agriculture due to its highly scalable and
    ubiquitous architecture. Moreover, the IoT-based smart agriculture value is estimated
    to reach $ 18.45 billion in 2022, and 75 million IoT devices are used for the
    agricultural sector in 2020 [2]. Furthermore, smart farms are projected to have
    12 million IoT points by 2023 [3]. Smart agriculture has started incorporating
    IoT solutions to improve operational efficiency, maximize yield, and minimize
    wastage through real-time field data collection, data analysis, and deployment
    of control mechanisms. Also, the diverse of IoT-based applications such as precision
    farming and smart irrigation is very helpful to the enhancement of agricultural
    processes. Thus, the IoT is considered as one of the promising solutions for embracing
    connected farms to address agriculture-based issues and increase the quality and
    quantity of agricultural production. IoT solutions are highly associated with
    cloud computing to process the huge amount of heterogeneous data sent or received
    by agriculture sensors/actuators [4]. Although cloud computing can handle smart
    agriculture applications, some of the applications and services produce a large
    amount of data and need to be processed in a real-time manner, which may cause
    a heavy load on the network, long response time, and poor quality of service,
    due to limited bandwidth [5]. Therefore, using the traditional cloud-based architecture
    may not be efficient to support these applications, which may also result in high
    energy consumption due to the transfer of agriculture data to and from the cloud.
    The Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry is projected to account
    for 20% of the global electricity demand by 2025 [5]–[8], [9]. Usually, consuming
    electricity is accompanied by carbon emissions (CO2). fossil fuel usage is the
    primary source of CO2 [10]. Consequently, this causes the growth of carbon dioxide
    emissions. According to [11], ICT uses 730 Million ton (Mt) CO2 equivalents (CO2e)
    or 1.4% of worldwide carbon emissions. To overcome the above shortcomings, edge
    and fog computing architecture are introduced to process the real-time IoT applications
    and services at the proximity of data sources in an efficient way, which have
    several benefits (e.g., reduce energy consumption, network traffic and improve
    quality of service) compared to traditional cloud-based architecture, that does
    not exploit the latest paradigms such as fog and edge in the agriculture system
    [4], [6]. However, edge and fog computing are not a replacement for cloud computing,
    as cloud computing will still be preferable and suitable for analyzing and processing
    heavy tasks, as well as storing data in a long term. The collaboration between
    edge, fog, and cloud computing is the best practice to achieve smart agriculture
    solutions. Several related works in the literature, (e.g. in [12], [13]), have
    discussed various architectures, techniques, and methods applied for smart agriculture
    systems considering different technologies such as IoT, big data analytics, and
    cloud computing. However, none of the existing works focused on the edge-fog-cloud
    architecture intending to reduce the energy consumption, CO2 emission, and network
    traffic as considering the three computing layers (edge, fog, and cloud). Therefore,
    this paper presents a new approach for smart agriculture systems to develop an
    energy-efficient offloading of IoT agriculture applications over an edge-fog-cloud
    computing architecture, according to the resource requirements of each agriculture
    task. Also, this approach could help to enhance the solutions of many traditional
    agriculture issues by taking the advantage of edge and fog computing, which will
    improve the overall energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emission, network traffic
    of smart agriculture systems. The major contributions of this paper are summarized
    as follows: ∙ Develop an energy-efficient architecture based on mathematical modeling
    and heuristic algorithm to study the offloading of IoT applications from agriculture
    sensors to edge, fog, and geo-distributed cloud, while considering minimization
    of the overall power consumption of networking and processing of the IoT agriculture
    services. ∙ Optimize the offloading of IoT agriculture applications over an edge-fog-cloud
    architecture, which connected to the access network, metro area network, and wide
    area network, respectively, thus eliminating the associated power consumption
    and telecommunication network traffic. ∙ Evaluate the usability and the capability
    of the proposed architecture and its models, using the mixed-integer linear programming
    (MILP) model, and compared the results to the traditional approach. The remainder
    of this paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces the edge-fog-cloud
    system architecture and its interaction layers. Section III presents the mixed-integer
    linear programming (MILP) model for optimizing the offloading of IoT agriculture
    applications in the edge-fog-cloud architecture. The model’s design, scenarios,
    and the input parameters of the models are presented in Section IV. This is followed
    by discussing the optimization model results and analysis in Section V. In Section
    VI, we introduce energy-efficient agriculture IoT applications distribution heuristic
    over the edge-fog-cloud architecture (EEAIOT-EFC). Finally, Section VII concludes
    the paper and discusses future work. SECTION II. Proposed Architecture for Smart
    Agriculture System Today, the traditional cloud-based architecture for agriculture
    systems is inefficient to satisfy all the requirements of the current scenarios
    [4], [5], [7], [8], as it lacks the essential efficiency prerequisites such as
    energy consumption, CO2 emission, network traffic, and so on [6]. Consequently,
    there is a need to develop an energy-efficient architecture for a smart agriculture
    system to fulfill these requirements. This section provides an outline of the
    proposed edge-fog-cloud architecture and its role in providing dynamicity and
    efficiency based on different IoT agriculture applications. The proposed architecture
    of the smart agriculture system is shown in Fig. 1; and it consists of four essential
    layers, namely, IoT sensor layer, edge layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. The
    description of each layer of the proposed architecture is presented as follow:
    FIGURE 1. An IoT-based edge-fog-cloud architecture for smart agriculture system.
    Show All A. IoT Sensor Layer IoT sensors generate massive heterogeneous data to
    the gateways by using various sensors deployed in different areas of the agriculture
    field. Also, this layer can receive decisions from to control actuators (e.g.,
    turning on/off irrigation system) [14]. In smart agriculture, there is a range
    of IoT sensor nodes used to identify several phenomena over the urban areas including
    but not limited to soil pH, soil temperature, soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity,
    and ambient temperature [15]. In the IoT agriculture system, low power wide area
    (LPWA) technologies have paved the way due to their low power consumption and
    wide area coverage. Long range (LoRa) is proved its efficiency, as a transmission
    protocol for IoT sensors. Besides its low power consumption, it ensures an extent
    of 10 kilometers coverage or more. In addition to LoRa, multiple wireless technologies
    can be used for smart agriculture urban areas such as narrowband (NB)-IoT, WiFi,
    Zigbee, and the 5G. The Zigbee technology has been successfully used in the field
    of agriculture at a low power cost. However, the limited distance coverage for
    wireless data transferring (about 20 meters) is reducing its efficiency. A comprehensive
    comparison of different IoT wireless network technologies (Zigbee, LoRa, NB-IoT,
    and 5G), is presented in Table 1. TABLE 1 IoT Wireless Network Technologies Comparison
    B. Edge Layer Edge computing refers to a new computing model that implements the
    computation of sensors/actuators data at the edge of the network. With this concept,
    some applications and services that do not require a lot of computing resources
    can be processed in the edge layer (close to the data source) and no longer need
    to traverse the network to be processed by the fog or the cloud. Thus, edge computing
    can improve data transmission performance, ensure real-time processing, and reduce
    the computational load as well as the amount of data transmitted to and from the
    fog or cloud data centers [8]. However, in case of unavailability/unsuitability
    of the resources in the edge layer, the sensors will automatically request to
    process their data in the fog or the cloud, and this will be done hierarchically.
    C. Fog Layer The fog computing concept was initially proposed by Cisco in 2014
    to expand the resources of cloud computing to the edge of the telecommunications
    network. In this context, the fog layer has the responsibility to process and
    analyze data sent from IoT sensors, which helps to minimize the latency for agriculture
    applications and services. Also, the fog layer has the ability to process and
    analyze complex data more than the edge layer. Both fog and edge can provide computation,
    networking, and storage services in between the sensor layer and the cloud layer.
    It means that instead of executing all processing at the cloud layer, the fog
    and edge layers can process and analyze agricultural data locally and close to
    the sensor layer (based on their ability) to reduce latency and cost [5], [7].
    D. Cloud Layer At the same level of importance as edge and fog, cloud computing
    is a vital enabler for the growth of IoT agriculture applications. It offers on-demand
    computing resources and services (e.g., storage, networking, and processing) in
    a scalable way. The cloud layer handles the agriculture data received from the
    sensor layer or the fog layer to process, analyze and store them into the cloud.
    Cloud computing can process and analyze heavy data, that requires more complex
    operations (e.g., big data processing and predictive analysis like weather forecasting,
    fire warning, and soil droughting), which exceeds the fog computing capability
    [6]. Also, it could provide a large-scale secure platform and cheap data storage
    services for the IoT agriculture applications [5], [8]. E. Telecommunication Networks
    The traditional telecommunication network architecture consists of three layers
    [16]: the core layer, the metro layer, and the access network layer. The wide
    area network (WAN) is the key network infrastructure that provides interconnection
    between different regions and cities. The Internet protocol (IP) over wavelength
    division multiplexing (WDM) is widely implemented in the core network as it can
    provide high scalability, large capacity, and fast communication network transfer
    speeds. Based on the reference hierarchy in Fig. 1, every core network has a direct
    connection with a metro area network (MAN), which covers a metropolitan area.
    Metro Ethernet is the technology commonly used in the metro network. It offers
    connectivity between the core network and users located in the access network.
    The local area network (LAN) supports Internet access to numerous user premises.
    We adopted the passive optical networks (PONs) which considered as the leading
    networking in the LAN network. SECTION III. MILP Model In this section, a new
    approach is developed based on mathematical mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
    optimization model to study the energy-efficiency of offloading IoT agriculture
    applications over an edge-fog-cloud architecture, considering the three telecom
    network layers: LAN equipped with an edge layer, MAN equipped with a fog layer
    and the WAN equipped with a cloud layer. In the following, we introduce the parameters
    and variables of our proposed architecture. The architecture consists of the IoT
    sensor, edge, fog, and cloud layers. Then, we provide the mathematical model to
    find the optimum distribution of IoT agriculture applications to serve the offloaded
    requests from the IoT sensor layer based on their energy consumption over an edge-fog-cloud
    architecture. A. IoT Sensor Layer The parameters and variables that represent
    the IoT sensor layer, are shown in Tables 2 and 3. TABLE 2 IoT Parameters TABLE

    Networks As described in Section II-E, a typical telecom network is considered
    including WAN, MAN, and LAN networks. The traffic traverse through these layers
    as well as the corresponding power consumption are represented by the parameters
    and variables described below. 1) Local Area Network (LAN) The parameters and
    variables that define the LAN network are shown in Tables 6 and 7. TABLE 6 LAN

    Carbon emissions [18] can be defined as the carbon emission intensity per an energy
    consumption and the unit of carbon emission intensity is kgCO2e / kWh. The research
    found that using solar, wind or nuclear plants creates a low carbon footprint
    compared with fossil fuels [19]. However, there are multiple limitations to the
    usage of low carbon sources including but not limited to the cost of installing
    these clean plants. Thus, in this work, we assume that only the IoT sensor layer
    and edge layer are powered by low carbon sources (i.e., solar plants panels) to
    reduce the power consumption of the proposed architecture. In the following Tables
    12 and 13, we define parameters and variables related to carbon emissions. TABLE
    12 Emission Parameters TABLE 13 Emission Variables Total carbon emission (CO)
    is composed of: (WAN O)+(MAN O)+(LAN O)+(IoT S) +(Cloud O)+(Fog O)+(Edge S) (26)

    are powered by solar energy sources. While others are powered by oil energy sources.
    SECTION IV. MILP Model Design In this section we explain the scenarios and the
    design of the model conducted in order to evaluate the proposed architecture.
    A. Scenarios As shown in Fig. 1, different scenarios can be implemented with this
    proposed architecture to show its effectiveness. In this work, the following scenarios
    are considered in a hierarchical order based on the edge, fog, and cloud ability.
    Edge/fog layers can be deployed in the proposed architecture according to the
    resources required by the agriculture tasks. Essentially, all tasks from heterogeneous
    IoT devices/sensors in the agriculture field, using different IoT wireless network
    technologies will be offloaded to the network gateways and then directed to edge/fog
    or cloud layer. Each layer has pros and cons. For example, processing the tasks
    within the edge layer will save the power and traffic cost of request transmission
    from/to the fog or cloud layer. However, handling all types of tasks within the
    edge layer is not possible, as it has limited capacity. Therefore, fog and cloud
    layers can be the choice for processing heavy tasks (e.g., resource-intensive
    applications). In our model, we assume that a scheduler in the gateway of the
    IoT layer checks if the edge node has available resources and can handle the request
    of IoT applications (e.g., CPU capability - the number of million instructions
    per second (MIPS)), the tasks will then pass to the edge layer to process them.
    In case of insufficient/unavailability of processing the tasks in the edge layer,
    the request will be transferred to the fog layer and check if there is enough
    capacity. Otherwise, the tasks will be forwarded to the cloud layer for processing,
    which supports resource-intensive applications. Also, we have assumed that the
    cloud has enough resources and capability to handle all kinds of tasks. B. Input
    Parameters of the Models In the MILP model, we have configured four layers in
    a smart agriculture system, which is composed of the IoT sensor layer, edge layer,
    fog layer, and cloud layer. The configuration of edge, fog, and cloud layers depend
    on the type of tasks (e.g., number of MIPS) requested by each IoT sensor/device
    at the IoT sensor layer. The model input parameters of different layers (IoT sensor,
    edge, fog, and cloud layers), in addition to networks and carbon emissions parameters,
    are shown in Tables 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18, respectively. TABLE 14 IoT Sensor
    Layer Input Parameters TABLE 15 Cloud, Fog, and Edge Input Parameters TABLE 16
    LAN, MAN, WAN Network Input Parameters TABLE 17 Carbon Emission Inputs for Each
    Fuel Type [17], [22] In our model, we assume that there are 100,000 sensors distributed
    in each farm The sensors task requirements are divided into three types (sensing
    60%, processing 30%, heavy processing 10%). The sensing processing task is usually
    limited to handling offloaded reading data sent by the sensors (e.g., temperature
    reading or send control commands for the irrigation system). The processing task
    is the requirement of light processing (e.g., soil analytics and event detection).
    The heavy processing task is the requisite of higher processing power and resources
    (e.g., weather prediction and analysis). SECTION V. Results and Discussion In
    this section, we discuss the proposed energy-efficient edge-fog-cloud architecture.
    In addition to its energy efficiency, we evaluate our model to find the consequence
    CO2 emission, and network traffic compared to the traditional cloud-based architecture.
    We have evaluated the proposed architecture and models using MILP optimizer based
    on the AT&T network topology, as shown in Fig. 2. To solve the MILP model, we
    use the CPLEX solver over a laptop with an Intel Core i7–7660U CPU, running at
    2.50 GHz, with 16 GB RAM. FIGURE 2. AT&T WAN network topology. Show All As shown
    in Table 1, we have categorized all IoT wireless network technologies used in
    this work based on their data rate, range, number of devices, power consumption
    of both gateway/base-station, and sensors. This work has identified that the power
    consumption of different IoT wireless network technologies almost the same, as
    shown in Fig. 3. The Zigbee technology delivers connectivity with low power consumption
    compared to other technologies. However, using Zigbee in the urban area is not
    the best choice as it only covers 20 meters, thus, hundreds or thousands of gateways
    are required to cover a large area. FIGURE 3. Comparison of different IoT wireless
    network technologies based on their energy consumption. Show All Since we aim
    to use a technology that covers a large area with the least amount of energy consumption.
    Therefore, LoRa has been chosen as an IoT wireless communication technology between
    the IoT sensors and the gateway, that covers long-distance communication, with
    low power consumption, and considers one of the most suitable technology for IoT
    agriculture applications, as shown in Fig. 3. A. Energy Consumption Fig. 4 illustrates
    the power consumptions of different tasks in the proposed edge-fog-cloud architecture
    versus the traditional cloud-based architecture. Also, it shows the placement
    location of each task/application in edge-fog-cloud architecture, as well as the
    power consumption values of each task individually. FIGURE 4. The energy consumption
    of the proposed architecture vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture, considering
    the IoT LoRa technology. Show All The results showed that the sensing tasks are
    offloaded to the edge layer, as it has enough capacity (i.e., sensing requires
    500 MIPS, and the edge layer has the capability to process up to 1800 MIPS). The
    normal processing tasks are offloaded to the fog respectively, as the fog layer
    has sufficient resources (i.e., 4000 MIPS) to process the tasks (i.e., 2000 MIPS).
    All remaining requests are offloaded to the cloud layer as there is no capacity
    in edge neither fog layers to accommodate heavy processing tasks. Fig. 5 shows
    the power consumption of our proposed architecture compared to the traditional
    cloud-based architecture, considering different IoT wireless technologies. Also,
    the figure displays power saving achieved by the proposed architecture. It is
    clearly shown that our proposed architecture outperforms the traditional cloud-based
    architecture by up to 36% of the total power consumption. However, the power savings
    have slightly ranged between 33.6% and 35.6% based on the different IoT wireless
    technologies. The Zigbee shows a higher power saving as it capable of offloading

    architecture vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture, using different IoT
    wireless technologies. Show All B. CO2 Emission Fig. 6 illustrates the total carbon
    emissions of the proposed edge-fog-cloud architecture versus the traditional cloud-based
    architecture, considering powering the IoT sensor layer and edge layer by a solar
    power source. FIGURE 6. The total carbon footprint emission of the proposed architecture
    vs. the traditional cloud-based architecture. Show All It shows that our proposed
    architecture can reduce up to 42% of CO2 emission, for real-time IoT applications
    in agriculture systems. The results also show a comparable carbon emission using
    different IoT wireless technologies. The power consumption of these technologies
    has been eliminated, as all IoT sensors and gateways are power by a solar plant,
    that emits very low carbon footprints (solar plants emit only 0.048 kgCO2/kWh).
    C. Network Traffic Fig. 7 shows the total traffic in each network tier in our
    proposed architecture versus the traditional cloud-based architecture. The results
    showed that our proposed architecture is capable to reduce the total traffic by
    14% and 86% in MAN and WAN tiers, respectively, compared to a cloud-based approach.
    FIGURE 7. The network traffic of the proposed architecture vs. the traditional
    cloud-based architecture. Show All In the traditional cloud-based architecture,
    the process of sending/retrieving the data to/from the cloud in real-time requires
    high-capacity bandwidth, which may cause a burden on the three network tiers.
    Thus, employing edge and fog computing has allowed processing most requests locally
    in edge or fog layers, which significantly decreases the flow of data traverse
    to the cloud and reduces network traffic, as shown in Fig. 7. SECTION VI. Energy
    Efficient Agriculture IoT Edge/Fog/Cloud Architecture Heuristic The problem over
    energy-efficient offloading of IoT applications in edge-fog-cloud architecture
    for smart agriculture environment is a non-deterministic polynomial (NP)-hard
    problem. For instance, if i is IoT applications count and n is the count of locations
    in edge-fog-cloud architecture, then we will have ( ∑ z=1 n n! (n−z)! ) combinations
    of possible applications locations to find the optimum locations that result in
    optimal power consumption. Thus, applying MILP to large-size problems is not feasible.
    Therefore, heuristic provides a simple and fast real-time implementation. Also,
    the optimal solution provided by the heuristic can provide validation to results
    obtained from MILP. To provide that, a heuristic algorithm was developed, referred
    to as energy-efficient agriculture IoT applications distribution heuristic over
    the edge-fog-cloud architecture (EEAIOT-EFC). In the EEAIOT-EFC heuristic, IoT
    application i is checked based on their total MIPS processing requirements. Firstly,
    the algorithm tries to place and run the application on the edge layer. If there
    is not enough MIPS capacity at the edge layer, then, agriculture IoT application
    is placed in the fog layer, if it has enough capacity. In case of unavailability
    resources in both edge and fog layers, the cloud layer will host the IoT application,
    as it has enough processing capability to handle all types IoT applications. After
    distributing all IoT applications, the power consumption of EEAIOT-EFC is determined.
    The heuristic flowchart process is shown in Fig. 8. FIGURE 8. Flowchart of EEAIOT-EFC
    heuristic. Show All The heuristic is assessed using a PC with an Intel Core i7–7660U
    CPU, running at 2.50 GHz, with 16 GB RAM. Similar to MILP, the AT&T network is
    considered a WAN network example. The heuristic took 5 seconds to evaluate the
    EEAIOT-EFC, and the MILP and EEAIOT-EFC show a comparable result, as shown in
    Fig. 9. The gaps between them are limited to 0.7% and 4.7% of the total power
    consumption under the proposed and the traditional cloud-based, respectively.
    FIGURE 9. Difference between the MILP model vs. EEAIOT-EFC heuristic. Show All
    SECTION VII. Conclusion and Future Works In this paper, the concept of an edge-fog-cloud
    architecture is introduced in the smart agriculture system, which solved existing
    real-time processing issues in terms of reducing energy consumption, CO2 emission,
    and network traffic, compared to the traditional cloud-based architecture. The
    proposed architecture employed the edge and fog layers, which are placed close
    to the agriculture fields to collect heterogeneous data from various kinds of
    IoT agriculture sensors and process them at these layers. Although the proposed
    architecture was significantly reduced the computational load and the amount of
    transmitted data to and from the cloud due to the use of edge and fog layers,
    however, the cloud layer is inevitably used to process the heavy and complex data/task
    requested by IoT agriculture devices/sensors. Most of the processing tasks are
    completed on the edge and fog layers, while few tasks are offloaded to the cloud
    layer for processing. In the paper, different metrics have been taken into consideration,
    including energy consumption, CO2 emission, and network traffic to study the performance
    and the outcomes of the proposed architecture. Using mathematical modeling, the
    proposed architecture is compared with the traditional cloud-based architecture.
    The model results showed that our proposed architecture can reduce the overall
    power consumption, carbon footprints, and network traffic by up to 43%, 36%, 86%,
    respectively. Moreover, we developed energy-efficient agriculture IoT applications
    distribution heuristic over the edge-fog-cloud architecture (EEAIOT-EFC) algorithm,
    which showed comparable results to the MILP model. Though this proposed solution
    is based on the idea of smart agriculture, it also can be suitable for other IoT
    applications and sectors, such as e-healthcare, smart city, and smart home. In
    the future, we intend to extend the proposed approach in a distributed real agricultural
    environment, considering machine-learning and decision-making algorithms to further
    understand the capability of the proposed work. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would

  limitations: While the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the proposed architecture
    and its energy efficiency, it does not address certain limitations that may impact
    the practical implementation of the system. For instance, the study does not consider
    the potential security vulnerabilities that may arise from integrating multiple
    computing layers and data sources. Additionally, the paper assumes that IoT sensors
    and edge devices are powered by solar energy, which may not always be feasible
    in all deployment scenarios. Exploring these limitations and proposing mitigation
    strategies would enhance the paper's practical applicability.

    content Abstract Internet-of-Things (IoT) refers to the massive network interconnection
    of objects often equipped with ubiquitous intelligence employed to provide smart
    services to end users. However, one of the substantial issues of IoT is the limited
    energy of IoT devices that are expected to run consistently for a long period
    of time without battery replacement. Moreover, in the wake of pervasive IoT, the
    number of IoT devices has exploded and lead to a tremendous rise in IoT networks
    carbon footprint. In this regard, Green-IoT and energy management of IoT emerged
    as challenging and attractive research topics for both academia and industry.
    In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive and an up-to-date survey on recent energy
    management techniques in IoT networks. We start by presenting the challenges of
    energy consumption in IoT networks. Then, we will present novel and well-known
    energy management approaches for IoT but focus on the most recent solutions proposed
    in each approach. Next, we will provide a comprehensive survey of the most recent
    energy management solutions for IoT ecosystem. We will also present recent trends
    and new research perspectives that can be exploited for energy conservation in
    IoT networks. Finally, we will give recommendations on how to exploit the techniques
    presented in our survey to achieve the IoT applications QoS requirements. Previous

    managementEnergy harvestingEnergy saving 1. Introduction The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is a paradigm that envisions to connect everyday objects and integrate them
    to the internet using microcontrollers, transceivers, and protocol stacks. This
    paradigm attracts the attention of both academia and industries and aims at the
    digitization of a plethora of applications with high societal relevance. The IoT
    applications in our daily life activities are manifold, from smart transportation
    that offers ground breaking progress in the transportation and logistic industry
    to smart home that facilitates its in-habitants activities. IoT covers several
    fields such as smart traffic, healthcare, agriculture, industry 4.0 and can even
    be found in our everyday objects such as pens, clothes, etc. As a result, the
    world has known an explosive growth in the number of these devices. According
    to IHS Markit, 125 billions of IoT devices are expected to be connected with each
    other by 2030 (Howell, 2017). This number is highly influenced by the emergence
    of 5G networks and the exploitation of new spectrum frequencies (Li et al., 2018).
    Moreover, IoT devices are usually small and battery limited and the exchange of
    massive information between these devices gives rise to enormous energy requirements.
    These requirements are often not supported by IoT devices and can quickly lead
    to battery depletion and the network’s death. So, how can we develop energy-efficient
    solutions that will not only reduce the energy consumption in IoT networks and
    their carbon footprints but also increase the networks lifetime? Accordingly,
    we witness the emergence of the Green Internet of Things which focuses on saving
    and managing energy in IoT networks in order to optimize and reduce the energy
    consumption and prolong the IoT networks lifetime. In the next few years, Green
    IoT will make significant changes in our daily life and will help realize the
    vision of “green ambient intelligence” (Al-Turjman et al., 2019). In this survey,
    we are going to present a wide range of energy harvesting and energy saving techniques
    and set out the recent research trends for Green IoT such as green 5G IoT, green
    social IoT, green networks softwarization, backscatter communications, etc. This
    paper is organized as follows : In Section 2, we present the background information
    on the energy management works presented in the literature. In Section 3, we describe
    the problem and challenges of energy consumption in IoT networks. In Section 4,
    we discuss and select some of the energy harvesting and energy saving techniques
    presented in the literature focusing on the most recent researches. In Section
    5, we present the energy management technologies for IoT ecosystem. In Section
    6, we discuss the recent trends and research perspectives that can be exploited
    in energy management for IoT. Finally, we shall conclude the paper by providing
    an insight into open research problems and the future of Green IoT. Table 1. The

    of energy management for IoT networks has been widely studied and various reviews
    and surveys were presented throughout the years. Researchers are interested in
    energy efficient WSNs since they are widely deployed and omnipresent in IoT. In
    Khan et al. (2015), the authors presented battery-driven energy conservation and
    energy harvesting schemes used to design algorithms in Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs). The authors focused on reviewing the protocols used for the energy management
    of wireless sensor networks. Compared to this survey, our survey does not only
    focus on sensors but the different devices IoT networks can include. In Singh
    et al. (2020), the authors surveyed energy saving and energy management schemes
    and energy efficient protocols for WSNs focusing on transmission power management
    and miscellaneous techniques. Compared to our survey, this survey does not include
    the energy harvesting and wireless charging solutions of IoT networks. In Shaikh
    and Zeadally (2016), the authors surveyed the energy harvesting approaches used
    in WSNs which help to improve WSN lifetime. Compared to our survey, this survey
    focus only on energy harvesting of wireless sensor networks and not the different
    types of devices we can have in IoT networks. In our work, we present solutions
    not only energy saving and harvesting solutions for sensors but also rich resources
    devices. In the recent years, more and more authors started to use the Green IoT
    appellation. Green IoT refers to the energy efficient hardware or software procedures
    used to reduce the greenhouse effect of existing IoT applications and services
    as well as the impact of greenhouse effect of IoT itself (Shaikh et al., 2015).
    It represents all the enabling technologies for Green IoT such as Green RFIDs
    (radio frequency identification), Green Datacenters, Green Sensor Networks, Green
    Cloud Computing, Green Edge Computing and Green Communications. In Albreem et
    al. (2017), a Green IoT life cycle is presented which includes: green design,
    green production, green utilization, green recycling in addition to green IoT
    technologies such as green tags, green sensing networks and green Internet technologies.
    In Arshad et al. (2017), the authors discussed IoT techniques to achieve Green
    IoT and proposed a taxonomy of energy efficient based on the technologies used
    in IoT while in Tahiliani and Dizalwar (2018), the authors discussed energy efficiency
    techniques of different components and layers of IoT networks. Compared to our
    survey, the previous works do not include the energy harvesting techniques for
    IoT networks. In Table 1, we present a comparison between our survey and the other
    energy management and Green IoT surveys. It is clear through Table 1 that, in
    our survey, we chose to present novel schemes that were not discussed in the surveys
    presented previously. The main purpose of our paper is to provide an up-to-date
    state-of-art about energy management and Green IoT. Our comprehensive survey discusses
    the different and most recent techniques used in order to reduce energy consumption
    and increase the networks lifetime in IoT networks. Therefore, this article aims
    to serve as a guideline for researchers interested in the trends of energy management
    IoT networks. Download : Download high-res image (409KB) Download : Download full-size

    Since IoT applications and services are reaching almost every corner our life,
    the carbon footprint of these applications is increasing proportionately with
    the number of IoT devices. IoT networks are composed of devices that can be rich
    or limited in energy resources. The aim of Green IoT is to reduce the energy consumption
    of both types of devices while still being able to effectively perform their tasks
    and services. Key and widespread IoT technologies such as wireless sensor networks
    are composed of small and battery limited sensor devices that gather information
    and build efficient and reliable information and communication systems. However,
    these devices are typically used to perform monitoring and control tasks in IoT
    applications over long periods of time and without interruption. Sensors can also
    be placed in areas which are difficult to access (e.g. under water systems, military
    systems, unsafe environments, etc.) and can quickly run out of energy. Consequently,
    replacing their batteries frequently becomes an arduous and costly task. Energy
    storage and power management should also ensure the constant availability and
    operability of IoT devices given that, neither cable-power nor battery replacement
    are feasible options in harsh conditions. Many energy saving software and hardware
    solutions, which we will present in our survey, have been developed in order to
    reduce IoT networks energy consumption and maintenance cost. Currently, the world
    experiences a scarcity in energy sources in addition to the important emission
    of CO2 resulting of human activity. Greening information and communication technologies
    becomes an imperious need considering the damages caused on our environment. Consequently,
    energy harvesting solutions has been studied in order to power IoT devices with
    green and renewable energies such as solar energy, wind energy, mechanical energy,
    etc. Since Green IoT is a newly studied research field, one essential domain that
    is not widely discussed is energy measurement. In fact, with the battery limited
    nature of IoT devices and their high number and energy consumption, measuring
    and analyzing the energy consumption of IoT devices is key to achieve applications’
    QoS requirements. Due to the high cost and large size of the existing commercial
    energy measurement solutions, researchers proposed various alternatives. However,
    these alternatives are often limited with their complexity, measurement range
    and accuracy (Dezfouli et al., 2018). IoT energy measurement tools should also
    be standardized to be able to support all types of devices with their different
    complexities at a low cost. As we can see, although the revolution of IoT changing
    our lives has started, many challenges still need to be overcome in terms of energy
    consumption and environmental issues. Accordingly, numerous potential solutions
    in different disciplines are being explored to achieve this goal that requires
    a lot of efforts. Download : Download high-res image (348KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Backscatter communication paradigms. 4. Energy management
    techniques In order to tackle the energy issues in IoT networks, two approaches
    are usually employed: energy harvesting and energy saving. Energy harvesting can
    be described as the mechanisms employed to produce energy from a network ambient
    environment to provide an uninterrupted power supply for the network devices.
    On the other hand, energy saving schemes focus on developing algorithms, protocols
    and even hardware solutions to minimize the network energy consumption and maximize
    its lifetime. Based on these two categories, we propose a technique-based taxonomy
    (Fig. 1) which represents the recent energy management solutions studied in the
    literature in order to extend IoT networks lifetime and reduce the carbon footprint
    of those networks. Our taxonomy includes recent energy management techniques that
    can be found in the literature and not discussed in previous surveys. As shown
    in Fig. 1, we divide the energy harvesting category in the taxonomy depending
    on the energy sources into four sections: RF energy harvesting in which we include
    Backscatter Communications (BCC) (Hoang et al., 2020), a novel energy harvesting
    technology that have not been mentioned in previous energy management and Green
    IoT surveys, Mobile Energy Transfer (MET) and Simultaneous Wireless Information
    and Power Transfer (SWIPT) technology. We also discuss the most recent researches
    in energy harvesting techniques with green sources such as : solar, thermal and
    mechanical energy. We will present these techniques more deeply later in this
    section. The second category of energy management solutions we represent in the
    taxonomy includes energy saving solutions. As shown in Fig. 1, we classified energy
    saving solutions depending on the technology they employ. Unlike existing energy
    management surveys, in our survey, we introduce recent intelligent energy saving
    techniques that use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to reduce the
    energy consumption in IoT networks. We present energy efficient data collection
    techniques used in IoT networks as well as, sleep/wake-up schemes such as Duty
    Cycling and the recent low power Wake-Up Radio technology which have not been
    presented in the existing energy management and Green IoT surveys. In what follows,
    we will discuss the energy management techniques for IoT networks. First, we start
    by presenting the energy harvesting techniques followed by the energy saving techniques
    discussed in the literature. It is worth mentioning that we will present and focus
    more deeply on the emerging energy management techniques which have not been discussed
    in previous surveys. Table 3. The table shows the energy harvesting techniques
    and their challenges. Energy harvesting techniques Concept Challenges Backscatter

    it to the receiver -Short range -Efficient information coding -Security -High

    Energy harvesting techniques We will discuss the energy harvesting techniques
    existing in the literature. We focus our review on the recent solutions proposed
    for each one of these techniques. In Table 3, we present the concept and challenges
    of the energy harvesting techniques presented in our survey and Table 2 summarizes
    the energy harvesting works organized by the nature of the harvested energy: RF,
    solar, thermal and mechanical energy. 4.1.1. RF energy harvesting (wireless power
    transfer techniques) In what follows, we will present RF energy harvesting techniques
    focusing deeply on backscatter technology since it is an emerging technique in
    energy harvesting that has not been presented in previous surveys. 1. Backscatter
    Communications One of the major issues that IoT networks face is the limited network
    lifetime due to the battery dependency of IoT devices. Having these devices completing
    task over a long period of time could easily lead to battery depletion and induce
    a replacement cost. In some cases, sensors do not need to be kept active consistently
    and will wear out their batteries unnecessarily. Backscatter communications allows
    battery-less devices to transform wireless signals and use them as a source of
    power and a communication medium. Having battery-less devices is a major advantage
    of backscatter communications as it helps reducing energy consumption, removes
    the constraint of frequent battery replacement and averts from undesired performances
    due to energy shortage. According to Hoang et al. (2020), there are three different
    paradigms of Backscatter Communications (Fig. 2):Monostatic Backscatter Communication
    (MBC), Bistatic Backscatter Communication (BBC) and Ambient Backscatter Communication
    (ABC). • Monostatic Backscatter Communication: as shown in Fig. 2(a) MBC system
    is composed of two components: a reader and a backscatter transmitter (e.g. a
    RFID tag). The specificity of MBC is that the receiver and the RF source are located
    in the reader. The RF source sends a signal that activates the tag which modulates
    the signal and reflects it back to the backscatter receiver. Since the RF source
    and the receiver are located in the same device, the modulated signals may suffer
    from a round trip path loss which makes it more suited for short-range RFID application.
    • Bistatic Backscatter Communication: the main difference between BBC and MBC
    systems lies in the separation of the RF source (renamed the carrier emitter in
    BBC) and the backscatter receiver in different components which significantly
    reduce the round-trip path-loss problem (as represented in Fig. 2(b)). Moreover,
    by optimally placing carrier emitters, the overall communication range can be
    extended and the system performance is greatly improved. Although the deployment
    and maintenance of the carrier emitters in BBCs are costly, their design remains
    simple which makes their manufacturing cost lower than MBCs. • Ambient Backscatter
    Communication: in Ambient backscatter communication systems (Fig. 2(c)) and similarly
    to BBC systems, ABC systems carrier emitter is separated from the backscatter
    receiver. However, the carrier emitter, in this case, can be an already available
    ambient RF source in the environment such as a Wi-Fi access point or a cellular
    base station. In Zhang et al. (2019a), an ABS system is presented as a batteryless
    device (tag or sensor) which can harvest wireless energy from a RF source and
    then transmit “0” or “1” bit to a sink node through reflecting or non-reflecting
    states. In addition to having virtually no cost of deployment, the manufacturing
    costs and power consumption of ABCs can be reduced by the use of low-cost and
    low-power components. Various works studied the backscatter communications and
    its impact on the energy consumption of IoT networks and proposed solutions to
    further improve the energy efficiency of these systems. In Yang et al. (2018),
    the authors proposed a cooperative ambient backscatter communication system which
    allows a device to recover information from both the ambient backscatter devices
    and the RF source. The proposed solution enhances the maximum-likelihood detection
    performance if the backscatter device symbol period is longer than the RF source
    symbol period. This solution can be upgraded to be exploited in smart home and
    wearable applications. In order to further enhance the energy efficiency of backscatter
    communications, various works studied the optimization of the communication parameters.
    The authors in Ji et al. (2020) proposed a joint optimization based on the source
    antenna number and power splitting factor under the condition that the minimum
    energy required by the destination node is met while in Timoudas et al. (2020),
    the authors proposed a solution to optimize the needed power to transmit for a
    base station and the radio of backscattered signal of the IoT devices in the context
    of massive IoT. For complex IoT systems, other parameters (such as the number
    of base stations, the number of backscatter devices and their positions) need
    to be optimized in order to be energy efficient and to adapt to the IoT application
    needs. The authors in Feng et al. (2018), focused on the link layer of backscatter
    communication systems using centralized MAC protocols, while other solutions used
    distributed MAC protocol (Ma et al., 2018, Cao et al., 2019). Distributed MAC
    protocols are more suitable than the centralized protocols for large-scale IoT
    networks with unstable network topologies and high topology maintenance cost.
    Although backscatter communications seem ideal to achieve green IoT, it still
    has to overcome some challenges such as the risk of interference when there is
    a high number of nodes as well as, the bit rate limitations as it is not simple
    to implement very complex modulations on a backscatter tag due to its limited
    capability in manipulating the RF signal and performing baseband processing. In
    addition to that, backscatter communications networks need to overcome the short
    range limitation and the high deployment cost they may generate. 2. Simultaneous
    Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) SWIPT is one of the most attractive
    and challenging technologies in energy management. It is a technique that enables
    the simultaneous transfer of information and power wirelessly (Perera et al.,
    2017b). Theoretically, SWIPT allows an IoT device to harvest energy and receive
    RF information from the same RF signal that carries both energy and information.
    Therefore, an IoT device can be self-powered by receiving data. However, in most
    of the cases, it is not possible to perform energy harvesting and information
    decoding simultaneously from the same signal. The information could be altered
    or lost by the energy harvesting operation. Thus, different receiver architectures
    were designed to achieve SWIPT: Separate Receiver, Time Switching (TS), Power
    Splitting(PS) and Antenna Switching (Perera et al., 2017b). In SWIPT, the power
    and information needed for an IoT node are sent at the same time which keeps the
    node alive and extend the lifetime of IoT networks. Various solutions have been
    proposed to adapt and achieve SWIPT. For example, in Perera et al. (2017a), the
    authors provide a comprehensive study related to SWIPT in different types of wireless
    communication setups. In Liu and Ansari (2019), the authors proposed a dual-battery
    green energy harvesting architecture that achieves SWIPT. It consists in using
    one battery to power the device while the other one is harvesting energy in order
    to reduce energy shortage probability. However, this solution is limited to small
    IoT networks with devices that can support a dual battery. The proposed solution
    also adds complexity to sensor devices and is expensive for massive IoT networks
    with a high number of devices. In Lu et al. (2017), the authors proposed a collaborative
    energy and information transfer protocol for WSN that does not require the power
    and information splitter component which is convenient for IoT networks and reduces
    the sensors complexity and cost. In Huang et al. (2018), the authors studied the
    optimization of the energy efficiency in a SWIPT-based distributed antenna system
    by coordinating the energy harvesting and information decoding for IoT devices.
    The proposed solutions take into consideration the number of IoT devices in the
    network. SWIPT was also associated with deep learning to further enhance the energy
    saving potential of this technology. In Luo et al. (2019), the authors proposed
    a solution based on deep learning to minimize the total transmit power of a multi-carrier
    NOMA SWIPT system while satisfying the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of
    each user. Deep learning was also used with SWIPT in Park et al. (2020b). The
    authors proposed a dual mode SWIPT system that uses an adaptive mode switching
    based on deep learning to exploit both single tone and multi-tone SWIPT. Although
    deep learning proves to be efficient for SWIPT-based system, it also requires
    an important amount of resources that should be considered to build green and
    sustainable IoT networks. In Lee and Lee (2018), the authors proposed a hybrid
    resource and task algorithm in a SWIPT system that enables the devices to do their
    requirement tasks in a distributed manner. However, this solution should be improved
    to take into consideration delay-sensitive tasks for it to satisfy the real-time
    requirement of IoT applications. Finally in Liu et al. (2017), the authors proposed
    a cooperative SWIPT scheme that consists of a conflict-free schedule initialization
    algorithm, a cooperative resource allocation algorithm and a heuristic algorithm
    to obtain a maximum energy efficiency in the transmission schedule with the appropriate
    resource allocation policy. SWIPT is theoretically a very efficient energy harvesting
    technique. However, this technique offers several challenges. In SWIPT, the information
    and energy are sent through the same signal. This signal needs to be efficiently
    decoded in order to recover the correct information. The signal can also be altered
    by the energy harvesting mechanisms or by interference. SWIPT is limited in range
    since the signals can weaken when crossing long distances. Finally, signals that
    are sent to the devices can be hijacked by hackers. Therefore, a level of security
    should be added in order to protect potential private and personal data. 3. Mobile
    Energy Transfer Mobile energy transfer is an ambitious energy efficient technique
    for IoT networks. It extends wireless power transfer technologies since the use
    of classical wireless power transfer technologies is not suitable if the node
    is isolated, placed in areas which are difficult to access and does not support
    free charging. Mobile energy transfer consists in giving to a mobile node (such
    as a car, a bus, etc.), the ability to transfer energy to the devices within its
    transmission range. Various works have studied the use of mobile energy transfer
    technology for IoT networks energy management. The energy consumption of the mobile
    node is a key challenge of mobile energy transfer enabled IoT networks. In Almasoud
    and Kamal (2017), the authors proposed a solution to minimize the total energy
    consumption of a mobile base station while supporting the data and energy demands
    of IoT devices to guarantee the QoS. This study shows that various parameters
    can impact the energy consumption of MET based IoT networks such as the mobile
    base station locations and its movement speed, the number of devices and their
    tolerable time for delivering data and energy as well as the transmission powers
    (the power needed for energy and data transmission). In Madhja et al. (2016),
    the authors proposed a hierarchical and wireless energy transfer using mobile
    chargers in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks while in Zhang et al. (2019b),
    the authors presented one of the mobile energy transfer technologies called Adaptive
    Resonant Beam Charging (ARBC). As shown in Fig. 3, it consists of two specially
    separated components: a transmitter and a receiver (car, TV, etc.) and in some
    cases, a relay (UAV in Fig. 3) which is used to relay the energy between the transmitter
    and the receiver. In Liu et al. (2018), the authors proposed a mobile power network
    based on long range and short range wireless power transfer technologies and discussed
    the challenges of MET such as interference, efficiency, range and topology. Download

    Mobile energy transfer RBC scenario. 4.1.2. Solar energy harvesting Given its
    abundance in the environment, solar energy is considered as an affordable and
    clean energy source that could eliminate the energy shortage problem in IoT networks.
    This technique directly converts sunlight into usable electricity which is convenient
    for location with high light availability. However, the solar energy harvesting
    technique flaws arise in locations where light availability cannot always be guaranteed.
    Additionally, transporting solar energy from a location to another when needed
    may cause considerable energy waste which shows that there is still room for research
    and improvement in this area. In the literature, various authors studied solar
    energy harvesting for IoT networks. In Luo et al. (2018), the authors presented
    a review on solar energy harvesting for IoT applications and discussed the use
    of artificial intelligence and more specifically artificial neural networks to
    enhance and rapidly design energy harvesting systems for IoT applications. Numerous
    authors proposed solutions on solar energy harvesting for WSNs in Li and Shi,
    2015, Shin and Joe, 2016, Nguyen et al., 2017. In Li and Shi (2015), the authors
    proposed an intelligent solar energy harvesting system based on maximum power
    point tracking for wireless sensor nodes used in IoT, which prefers to use the
    solar power and takes the lithium battery as a supplementary under the condition
    of inadequate illumination. This solution offers IoT systems more reliability
    in case of scarcity in solar energy in the area. In Shin and Joe (2016), the authors
    proposed an energy prediction algorithm that uses the light intensity of fluorescent
    lamps in an indoor environment for wireless sensor nodes for IoT. This solution
    can be particularly helpful to achieve green and sustainable smart home since
    lamps can be used to power the sensors used in the smart home. In Nguyen et al.
    (2017), the authors proposed a new routing algorithm that aims to improve the
    lifetime of sensor nodes as well as the QoS under variable traffic load and solar
    and RF energy availability. The proposed algorithm significantly improves the
    energy efficiency of the IoT network even if the number of nodes increases drastically
    which constitutes a suitable solution for massive, complex and scalable IoT networks.
    In Wu et al., 2016, Wu et al., 2018b, the authors proposed a solution to improve
    solar energy harvesting in wearable IoT applications. In Wu et al. (2016), the
    authors proposed an MPPT algorithm based on the output current to extract the
    maximum power from a flexible solar panel to power wearable pulse sensors. Finally,
    in Wu et al. (2018b), the authors presented a self-powered wearable IoT sensor
    network that uses solar energy and is designed for safety environmental monitoring.

    Thermal energy is the energy that comes from heat and variation in temperature.
    The human body and the environment can be a source of thermal energy. For example,
    a difference in temperature can be created by the human body and the environment
    depending on the health condition, the location of a person, or body motion. There
    are two techniques that are used in thermal energy harvesting: thermometric, a
    technique that directly converts temperature difference into usable energy and
    pyroelectric, a technique that generates electrical energy when there is a change
    in temperature. It is important to efficiently generate electric energy from thermal
    generator in order to extract maximum electric energy to power devices and exploit
    the maximum potential of this approach. In the literature, various authors tackled
    the subject of thermal energy harvesting for IoT. In Abdal-Kadhim and Leong (2018),
    the authors discussed the use of thermal energy harvesting approach to power up
    a wireless sensor node for IoT applications. This study shows the efficiency of
    using thermal energy to power IoT nodes and the importance of using thermal energy
    harvesting in long-term IoT applications. Thermal energy harvesting proves to
    be efficient for various IoT applications. For example, in Yun et al. (2016),
    the authors studied the use of energy thermal harvesting for self-powered smart
    home sensors. For healthcare, in Priya et al. (2018), the authors studied a human
    body heat-based solution for wearable biomedical IoT nodes. Finally, in Teplỳ
    et al. (2019), the authors proposed a solution to optimize the energy consumption
    of thermal energy in IoT nodes by proposing an intelligent control of the individual
    parts of an IoT node. Unlike in Abdal-Kadhim and Leong (2018), This solution uses
    a battery to store the harvested energy and then uses the nodes’ battery to power
    the application. 4.1.4. Mechanical energy harvesting Mechanical energy harvesting
    consists in harvesting the energy that results from movement, pressure, human
    activity or any type of motion from an object. It is considered as a very efficient
    energy harvesting solution since the more and faster the object moves the more
    energy is produced to do more tasks. Mechanical energy comes from various sources
    such as wind and water flow or human motion and can be converted into electrical
    energy and exploited to supply IoT devices. For example, it can be interesting
    to use the energy produced from human motion to power a human temperature monitoring
    device that the user wears or powering neighboring houses using energy produced
    by wind and water flow. Mechanical energy harvesting offers a wide range of possibilities
    which makes it an ideal solution for creating green and sustainable applications.
    In the literature, mechanical energy harvesting have been thoroughly discussed.
    Several authors focused on wind flow and hydro in Jushi et al., 2016, Kamenar
    et al., 2016 respectively. In Jushi et al. (2016), the authors discussed the use
    of wind energy in autonomous WSNs and weather forecast to improve the prediction
    of wind condition in the near future. In this solution, the authors used a one
    and two hours weather forecast window in case of zero wind energy which shows
    that the unpredictable nature of wind energy makes it unsuitable for IoT applications
    that require constant availability and real-time performances. In Magno et al.
    (2016), the authors studied kinetic energy harvesting for wearables resulting
    from human motion. This study shows that human motion can produce an impressive
    amount of energy per day however, since the energy produced can vary from one
    person to another it can be difficult to develop a solution that is destined to
    a large population. In Kamenar et al. (2016), the authors described the conception,
    modeling, calculation, design, manufacturing and validation of the performances
    of energy harvesting devices deployed in river streams to be employed as a power
    source for pollution monitoring wireless sensor clusters. Table 5. The table shows
    the state-of-the-art of energy saving in the literature. Energy saving technologies

    The energy harvesting techniques presented in the previous sections are employed
    to produce energy from their surrounding environment and to power IoT networks.
    In Table 4, we summarize the energy harvesting techniques presented previously
    and the ability to use them in, what we consider, the major IoT applications (smart
    home, healthcare, agriculture and industrial IoT). For RF source harvested energy,
    SWIPT and MET can be applied to the use cases listed previously. In case of backscatter
    communications, the technology is suitable for smart homes, agriculture applications
    and indoor medical applications. Backscatter communications is still at a development
    stage, therefore, it faces limited-range, security and interference problems which
    makes it not suitable for applications that handle critical data and require a
    high level of reliability such as industrial and outdoor medical applications.
    Solar energy harvesting is largely used in smart homes and buildings, healthcare
    and agriculture. However, while solar energy can be used in industrial IoT, the
    network designers should take into consideration the uncontrollable nature of
    solar energy and how it can affect the performance of the high reliability requirements
    of industrial IoT applications. As shown in Table 4, thermal energy can be employed
    in different IoT applications as it can be frequently produced and stored to supply
    IoT devices. In case of mechanic energy harvesting, human motion is considered
    suitable for healthcare application. However, it does not produce enough energy
    to be helpful in the other applications. Wind and water flow can produce enough
    energy for various application, however, the uncontrollable nature of those energies
    is unsuitable for industrial IoT applications which require high availability
    and no energy shortage. 4.2. Energy saving techniques In this section, we discuss
    the existing energy saving techniques in the literature by presenting and focusing
    on the most recent solutions proposed in each one of these techniques. In Table
    5, we summarize the energy saving works studied in our survey. 4.2.1. Sleep/wake-up
    techniques 1. Wake-Up Radios: Wake-Up Radio is a novel hardware solution that
    has been developed to reduce the energy consumption of devices and extend the
    network lifetime. It consists in having a low power radio attached to the device
    main radio in charge of waking it up when an incoming signal is sensed. In IoT
    systems, a Wake-up Radio enabled IoT device has been defined in Froytlog et al.
    (2019). It is a microcontroller unit associated with a main radio and a wake-up
    receiver. The microcontroller and the main radio are in deep sleep most of the
    time. As shown in Fig. 4, when the receiver receives a request by means of a wake-up
    signal transmitted by an external node, it generates an interrupt signal to wake
    up the microcontroller to perform certain tasks and transmit data back via its
    main radio. Based on power usage, three types of wake-up radios have been identified
    (Piyare et al., 2017): active, passive and semi-active wake-up radios. Active
    wake-up radios require continuous external power supply such as batteries. Passive
    wake-up radios do not need energy from power supplies. They harvest energy from
    the transmitted signal instead. In semi-active wake-up radios, some components
    of the receiver require continuous power from an external source while the RF
    front-end remains passive. Wake-up radios can be particularly useful in a smart
    home/office scenario, or in an industrial context like warehouses and can be enhanced
    further to be used in smart cities (Deng et al., 2019). However, due to the sleep
    and wake-up nature of wake-up radio, we can expect an increase in data reception
    latency. According to Piyare et al. (2017), designing wake-up radio in a larger
    environment requires considering different design aspects such as: • Power consumption:
    the node’s power consumption should not exceed the main radio’s sleep power to
    keep the balance between the energy saved and used by the device. • Time to wake-up:
    the time needed to wake-up the device radio should be minimum in order to reduce
    the latency and thus enlarge the spectrum of applications Wake-up Radios can be
    used for. • False wake-ups and interference: due to interference and wrongly receiving
    signals intended to other devices, a node or several nodes could be unnecessarily
    activated causing huge energy waste. Thus, designers should find the right compromise
    and find solutions to those challenges without increasing the energy consumption.
    • Sensitivity: in Wake-up Radio environment, the sensitivity of the receiving
    node has a considerable impact on the power demand as having high sensitivity
    requires high power demand at the receiving side and having low sensitivity means
    needing high radiated power at the transmitter side. • Communication range: the
    range of a Wake-up Radio has an impact on the type of application it is used in,
    as well as on the system’s power consumption. For example, having short range
    communication would require a multi-hop communication which will increase the
    nodes density and the power consumption. • Data rate: having a higher data rate
    in a Wake-up Radio context is a way to improve energy efficiency and wake-up latency.
    Similarly, having a longer bit duration also increases the communication range
    and the reliability of the wake-up signal. • Cost and size: the Wake-up Radio
    should be cost effective in order to be integrated into the IoT context and existing
    sensor nodes. The cost should not exceed 5–10 per cent of the complete sensor
    node cost. • Frequency regulation: the design of Wake-up Radios should adhere
    to frequency regulations in industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands. It
    should also be adapted to communication standards such as the maximum allowed
    effective radiated power (ERP) used to transmit the Wake-up signal (WuS). In the
    literature, various studies proved the efficiency of low power wake-up radios
    energy saving. In Bello et al. (2019), the authors studied the design (from physical
    to media access control) and utilization of passive wake-up radios in IoT applications.
    This review also discusses the limitation of wake-up radios such as the short
    communication range, the high latency, lack of standardization, mobility as well
    as contention and channel access. In Basagni et al. (2017), the authors proposed
    GREENROUTES, an energy-aware cross-layer routing protocol for wake-up radio-based
    green networks. This protocol selects the relay nodes based on their distance
    in hops from the sink ans uses semantic addressing to enhance capabilities. Since
    wake-up radios are sensible to the distance between nodes, it would be interesting
    to see if this protocol is efficient in case the nodes are distantly distributed.
    The authors in Giovanelli et al. (2017) analyzed Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons
    scenarios in IoT applications and discussed the benefits of integrating wake-up
    radios in the BLE protocol stack which can help both reduce the time to contact
    all the beacons and also reduce the current consumption. Low power wake-up radios
    networks still suffer from the limited range of their components. This is why,
    in Frøytlog et al. (2019), the authors tackled the wake-up radios limited range
    issue and proposed a design and implementation of long range low-power wake-up
    radio for IoT devices that increases the lifetime of the devices and reduces the
    power consumption and overall cost in a large scale deployment. Another approach
    was proposed in Rakovic et al. (2020) to improve the energy efficiency and communication
    range of wake-up radios in IoT systems. The proposed approach consists in applying
    error correction codes on wake-up signals. Since wake-up radio suffer from short
    range capability and low signal sensibility, wake-up radio commonly misinterpret
    the wake-up signal which leads to performance degradation of the system. Code
    correction on wake-up signals constitutes an efficient solution to improve the
    robustness and sensitivity of wake-up devices. 2. Duty-cycling: Duty-cycling,
    also known as ’sleep schedule’, is considered one of the most effective ways of
    saving energy and extending networks lifetime. Duty-cycling algorithms are used
    to reduce the node’s battery consumption by alternating between sleep and wake-up
    modes. The node is usually set in a low power mode and only wakes up when needed
    (e.g. data reception, radio transmission). Those algorithms usually fall under
    3 categories: topology control protocols, sleep/wake-up protocols and MAC protocols
    with low duty-cycles. Duty-cycling have been studied broadly and due to its constant
    relevance, several recent works on duty cycling and its impact on the energy consumption
    of IoT networks have been proposed. In Passos et al. (2019), the authors provided
    a qualitative and quantitative comparison between the families of asynchronous
    duty-cycling methods, their characteristics and the most suited Green IoT applications
    for each of them. Asynchronous duty-cycling methods undergo an excessive transmission
    energy consumption while waiting for the receiver wakes up in addition to the
    multiple unicast transmissions that not only consume energy but can also lead
    to a network congestion. In Munir et al. (2018), the authors proposed an algorithm
    to optimize the duty-cycle duration of low-power IoT devices equipped with energy
    harvesting circuits in Wi-Fi based IoT networks. This solution use an optimal
    weighting moving-average filter to predict the harvested energy and find the optimal
    weighting factor to estimate the duration of the off period for IoT devices. The
    devices will exploit the off periods to harvest enough energy for the data acquisition.
    Finally, in Dhall and Agrawal (2018), the authors proposed a modified duty cycling
    efficient path planning algorithm for an IoT-based precision agriculture system.
    The proposed duty-cycling algorithm is performed on the data transmission phase
    and the path planning algorithm studies all the path and chose the short path.
    This solution proves to be effective even with a high number of devices. However,
    since the solution’s performance depends on the clusters, it would be interesting
    to optimize the cluster organization in order to reduce the overall energy consumption.

    Fig. 4. Concept of wake-up radio. 4.2.2. Energy efficient data collection Millions
    of IoT devices are deployed in intelligent applications like smart homes, smart
    transportation, and so forth. These devices generate huge amounts of data. In
    order to communicate its data to the base station or to his neighbors, an IoT
    device will consume large amounts of energy. Moreover, IoT networks are usually
    constituted of a large number of devices that have limited batteries. Once emptied
    or depleted, those batteries are often difficult to replace especially if the
    devices are placed in an isolated or a difficult to access position. One promising
    solution is to collect the generated data and communicate it in an efficient way
    to reduce the transmission energy cost. Several data collection approaches have
    emerged in order to reduce the energy consumption, delay and maximize the network
    lifetime (Chandnani and Khairnar, 2020). 1. Data Aggregation approach: This approach
    consists in reducing the number of transmission in a network and remove redundant
    and duplicated transmission of data. Data aggregation is the procedure of one
    or a number of nodes that gather data from other nodes for a period of time, aggregate
    them and transmit the aggregated result. In Chandnani and Khairnar (2020), the
    authors divided the data aggregation techniques into three classes : tree based,
    cluster based and centralized based. In Pourghebleh and Navimipour (2017), the
    authors presented a systematic review on the data aggregation mechanisms for IoT
    and presented a detailed comparison of the techniques used in each class. The
    authors found out that tree-based techniques offer low energy consumption, high
    network lifetime and great scalability compared to the other techniques while
    cluster-based techniques offer low traffic and high fault tolerance. On the other
    hand, centralized techniques focus mainly on security aspects. The latency, network
    lifetime as well as device heterogeneity should also be considered in data aggregation
    techniques. In John and Jyotsna (2018), the authors did a review on tree-based
    data aggregation techniques. The tree architecture is composed of nodes structured
    in the form of a tree. A tree contains leaf nodes and forwarding nodes. The authors
    found out that tree-based aggregation consumes less energy than clustering and
    grid-based aggregation. However, in a tree-based approach, the failure of a intermediate
    node affects the whole topology and disturbs the network activity. In Song et
    al. (2017), the authors proposed a cluster-based data collection technique that
    uses a sensor based cluster formation algorithm to elect the controllers and handle
    the different types of sensors. This algorithm is used alongside a multi-tier
    aggregation function. This solution allows us to extend the network lifetime,
    maximize the coverage and eliminate redundant data at the controller. However,
    using these structures can have major drawbacks. For example, tree and cluster
    structures increase the vulnerability of the network and make it less secure.
    They also do not take into consideration sleep and transmission latency. In Ko
    et al. (2019), the authors proposed a centralized-based data aggregation for IoT
    which gathers data and sends it to a centralized IoT gateway. This method also
    proposes an efficient sleep scheduling method along with data aggregation in order
    to ensure data consistency in the network. Compared to the tree and cluster structures,
    the centralized structure is more secure. However, it has low fault tolerance.
    2. Probability based approach: The probability based approach allows us to save
    energy by using approximation models to find correlation between data. The goal
    of probability based solutions is to predict the value of the sensed data. In
    Razafimandimby et al. (2018), the authors proposed a Bayesian inference approach
    that allows us to avoid the transmission of highly correlated sensor data and
    reduce IoT networks energy consumption. This approach was applied to a hierarchical
    architecture with smart devices and data centers and proved to reduce the number
    of transmitted data with good information accuracy in three different scenarios.
    In general, it is difficult to implement since the devices that help achieve the
    probability based approach can be increasingly complex and the models are not
    optimal considering the high correlation between the devices data. 3. Compressive
    sensing based approach: Compressive sensing consists in compressing the collected
    data and reduce the quantity of data sent throughout the network. Compressive
    sensing help reduce the size of the sensory information matrix as possible to
    reduce information and communication redundancy. According to Chandnani and Khairnar
    (2020), compressive sensing approaches can be divided into three categories :
    Conventional compression, Distributed source coding and Distributed compressive
    sensing. In Uthayakumar et al. (2018), the authors presented a review on data
    compression techniques from different perspectives such as data quality, coding
    schemes, data type and applications. Data compressing techniques are described
    by their compatibility, representation efficiency, computational complexity and
    memory management. Data compressing solutions should optimize these characteristics
    in order to enhance the efficiency of IoT networks and reduce the devices complexity.
    In Wang et al. (2019a), the authors proposed a clustering routing protocol based
    on energy efficient compressive sensing that finds the optimal size of a cluster,
    the optimal distribution of cluster heads and also alleviate the ”hot spot problem”.
    This solution reduces efficiently the overall energy consumption of the network
    and extend its lifetime. In this case, there is a temporal correlation between
    data which means it would be interesting to use a predictive approach in order
    to reduce the energy consumption resulting from the spatial–temporal correlation.
    In Hsieh et al. (2020), the authors employed distributed source coding between
    two node in a NOMA pair to optimize the performance and minimize the energy consumption
    in resource-constrained cellular IoT networks. This solution focuses only on mobile
    broadband applications, where transmissions typically occur in the downlink with
    full-buffered traffic. 4. Mobility based Data Collection: Recently, mobile data
    collection approaches have been widely used as a mean to develop energy efficient
    IoT networks and extend their lifetime. Mobile data collection allows battery-limited
    devices to save their transmission energy and thus extend their lifetime. Mobile
    data collection can be achieved by three methods. The first method consists in
    using static sensor nodes and a mobile sink that will collect data from these
    nodes when they are sufficiently close to it. The second method consists in having
    a static sink and mobile nodes. Since the nodes can move, they improve the network
    coverage and decrease the number of nodes needed (e.g. we can have less sensors
    in the network since one sensor can move and cover other areas of the network).
    This strategy has been studied widely in the recent years the number of mobile
    is increasing. The third method consists in having mobile sensor nodes and a mobile
    sink. There have been various studies that focused on energy efficient mobility-based
    data collection in the literature. In Wang et al., 2019b, Zhan et al., 2017, Chen
    et al., 2019, the authors studied the use a mobile sink (UAV) with fixed nodes
    and proposed a solution that optimizes the UAV trajectory in order to ensure an
    energy efficient data collection. In Chang et al. (2019), the authors proposed
    an algorithm for a distributed bus-based data collection to maximize the lifetime
    and throughput of WSNs. On the other hand. Researchers also studied the use of
    a mobile nodes with a static sink. In Wang et al. (2018), the authors proposed
    a solution based on the Internet of Vehicles that allows traffic data gathering
    architecture with an efficient sink node selection. This solution shows only certain
    vehicles and paths should be selected to reduce the network energy consumption.
    As shown in the latter works, mobility-based data collection is a very promising
    energy saving technology if the mobile sink has a low carbon footprint and is
    provided with an optimized trajectory which constitutes a challenging research
    area. Table 6. The table shows the pros and cons of the energy saving techniques
    discussed in the survey. Energy saving technologies Empty Cell Pros Cons Sleep/Wake-up

    the mobile node is difficult to find 4.2.3. Discussion The energy saving techniques
    presented in the previous section are used to reduce the energy consumption of
    IoT devices as much as possible. In Table 6, we summarize the energy saving techniques
    presented previously and highlight the pros and cons of using these techniques
    in IoT networks. In case of sleep/wake-up schemes, both duty-cycling and wake-up
    radios considerably reduce the nodes energy consumption. While wake-up radios
    is an on-demand sleep and wake-up scheme, duty cycling schemes can be divided
    into three categories: on demand, asynchronous and schedule rendez-vous. Accordingly,
    wake-up radio schemes are able to reduce the idle listening and overhearing that
    duty-cycling may suffer from. However, it has a limited communication range, a
    high deployment cost and can suffer from high interference. Duty-cycling, on the
    other hand, in addition to idle listening, overhearing and over-emitting can also
    struggle with high sleep latency (e.g. sending data to a node who is not ready
    to receive data) and data transmission latency (e.g. waiting for the next wake-up
    phase to send data). Choosing either wake-up radios or duty-cycling depends essentially
    on the network needs and requirements. Energy efficient data collection approaches
    are efficient schemes to reduce the energy consumption of IoT. However, they still
    have challenges and issues to overcome such as security and latency issues for
    cluster-based and tree-based data aggregation or the hardly achievable sensory
    data sparsity in data compression. Mobility based approaches can also be subject
    to data loss and energy starvation if the system policy used is not well defined.
    5. Recent advances in IoT ecosystem energy management In order to achieve Green-IoT,
    several new approaches for energy management have been explored by the researchers
    to reduce the energy consumption of the different components of the IoT infrastructures
    from data centers to the IoT nodes. These developments emerged with the exploitation
    of new communication paradigms like 5G and the rapid growth of technologies such
    as artificial intelligence, cloud, etc. In this section, we will present the recent
    advances in energy management for IoT networks ecosystem. In Table 7, we summarize
    the energy management solutions studied for cloud, fog and edge enabled IoT networks.
    5.1. Energy management in IoT-cloud computing With the start of the IoT revolution,
    the number of IoT devices has exploded and with it, the amount of data collected
    by those devices. However, since IoT devices do not possess the computational
    power to process all of the collected data, cloud computing is considered as a
    very promising paradigm that provides high-performance computing capability and
    high-capacity storage to support the ubiquitous need for data collection and processing
    in IoT networks. Cloud computing allows the battery-dependent IoT devices to offload
    various tasks to the cloud (e.g. data cleaning) and conserve their energy. Although
    it can be convenient to use this technology, it is well-known that the cloud servers
    that host cloud applications are highly energy consuming. Therefore, it is also
    necessary to reduce the cloud energy consumption by using its resources efficiently.
    Reducing energy consumption in Cloud computing can also be achieved by the use
    of low-power devices and the virtualization of services. In the literature, a
    large scope of energy saving solutions in cloud computing enabled IoT networks
    have been studied. In Kaur and Sood (2015), the authors proposed an energy-efficient
    architecture for IoT that allows the system to predict the sleep interval of sensors-based
    IoT networks upon their remaining battery level and reduce the energy consumption
    of sensor nodes and cloud resources. However, this solution is not recommended
    for application with strict real-time requirements since it is specific to systems
    with a sleep/wake-up strategy. Various solutions proposed energy saving in cloud
    computing by using service composition optimization. In Baker et al. (2017), the
    authors proposed a multi-cloud IoT service composition algorithm (E2C2). The composition
    of services is energy-aware and integrates the minimum number of IoT services
    to meet a user’s requirements. This solution outperforms similar algorithms have
    been previously proposed: All Cloud, Base Cloud, Smart Cloud (Zou et al., 2010)
    and COM2 (Kurdi et al., 2015). To further improve service composition solutions,
    we should take into account not only the cloud providers aggregate energy, but
    also the energy needed for the service execution. In Kumari and Kaushal (2017),
    the authors presented a partitioning method of an application into offloadable
    and non-offloadable components to reduce the energy consumption and the execution
    time. This solution offloads components to the cloud however, it requires high
    network reliability in order to ensure the application well functioning and availability.
    Other solutions focused on energy saving using power-aware virtual machine placement
    in cloud providers. In Gharehpasha et al. (2020), the authors also proposed a
    virtual machine placement algorithm in order to reduce the number of active physical
    machines and reduce their energy consumption while also load balancing between
    the active physical machines. However, in this solution a static virtual machine
    placement is done which means once a virtual machine is placement it cannot be
    migrated to another physical machine. In Alharbi et al. (2019), the authors proposed
    an ant system for dynamic virtual machine placement that reduces the number of
    active physical machines and reduces the overall energy consumption of the data
    center. In dynamic virtual machine placement, virtual machines can be migrated
    from one physical machine to another. Therefore, security strategies should be
    applied during migration in order to protect private data from hackers’ attacks.

    in fog computing Cloud computing offers a platform and frees businesses and end
    users from the burden of many specification details. However, it does not constitute
    an effective solution for latency sensitive applications and often fails to meet
    their delay requirements. Consequently, Fog computing emerged as a new paradigm
    that constitutes an extension of cloud computing at the edge of the network rather
    than a replacement to it. Fog Computing is a highly virtualized platform that
    provides computing, storage, and networking services between end devices and traditional
    Cloud Computing Data Centers (Bonomi et al., 2012). Fog Computing platforms are
    designed to support the mobility, geo-distribution in addition to low latency
    required in various IoT application (e.g. industrial-IoT). These characteristics
    make the Fog platforms suitable to support the energy constraints of Green-IoT
    applications. Various Fog computing solutions have been proposed in the literature
    to reduce the energy consumption in IoT systems. In Sarkar et al. (2015), the
    authors studied the sustainability of Fog Computing and its performances compared
    to traditional Cloud in terms of power consumption, emissions and cost in IoT
    networks. Fog computing enhances the performance of latency sensitive applications
    in terms of QoS and eco-friendliness. In Perera et al. (2017c), the authors identified
    major features (such as dynamic discovery, configuration, management of devices,
    multi-protocol support at different layers of the network architecture, mobility
    etc.) that fog computing platforms need to support toward building sustainable
    sensing infrastructure for smart city. Fog computing platforms should built in
    a manner that different applications can use. Such platforms should also offer
    build-in support for different types of communication and data analytics frameworks
    in order to implement the different features of fog-IoT platforms. In Mebrek et
    al. (2017), the authors proposed a solution that allows a number of IoT devices
    to select a fog instance that will receive their data considering the energy consumption
    (e.g energy consumed by the transport network, energy to process and store the
    data, energy to forward the data to the cloud if needed) and the latency (transmission
    latency, processing latency, forwarding to cloud latency). In Nayeri et al. (2021),
    the authors reviewed the AI based application placement solutions that address
    latency, resource utilization and energy consumption issues in fog enabled IoT
    networks. Fog application placement solution focus mostly on achieving efficient
    load balancing methods. Machine learning and more specifically, reinforcement
    learning algorithms, are widely used and combined with evolutionary algorithms
    in order to solve the fog application placement problem. Algorithms can be combined
    to cover each others’ weaknesses and achieve challenges such as security, privacy,
    availability, etc. In Peralta et al. (2017), the authors proposed an energy efficient
    fog-based IoT scheme that reduces end-devices energy consumption for industrial
    IoT by reducing their transmission. This scheme uses an MQ Telemetry Transport
    broker to predict future data measurements through prediction techniques, operate
    as gateway and offload expensive data processing from the Cloud to the Fog. In
    order to reduce the energy consumption in fog-based IoT networks, various fog
    computing models were proposed. In Oma et al. (2018a), the authors proposed a
    linear fog computing model to reduce the total energy consumption. Although linear
    models are simple and useful they are only suitable for IoT networks with few
    number of sensor nodes. Consequently, in Oma et al. (2018b), the authors proposed
    a tree-based fog computing model that supports a large number of IoT devices and
    reduces the total electric consumption compared to the Cloud Computing model.
    Finally in Lavassani et al. (2018), the authors proposed a distributed (online)
    learning model on the sensor device. The model is created by mining the collected
    data that approximate the data stream behavior and then transmitting only the
    updated model parameters to a fog computing system. This solution saves energy
    in IoT devices by preventing unnecessary uplink transmission. 5.3. Energy management
    in edge computing With the increasing number of IoT devices, the data produced
    by those devices is also escalating explosively. Processing efficiently those
    data then becomes a necessity in Green-IoT. Therefore, edge computing technologies
    emerge as a very attractive solution for energy management in IoT as they bridge
    the gap between the limited capability of low-powered devices and their computational
    demands. Edge computing allows the workload to be offloaded from the cloud to
    a location closer to the source of data that need to be processed. It offers the
    possibility to downstream data on behalf of cloud services and upstream data on
    behalf of IoT services. It consequently has the potential to extend the lifetime
    of battery constrained IoT devices, reduce the network traffic, increase the bandwidth,
    improve the privacy and achieve a considerable energy and communication delay
    saving. Different approaches have been proposed to achieve energy saving in Edge
    computing based IoT networks. Energy efficiency using edge computing can be achieved
    through different schemes : from offloading strategies to data reduction schemes
    as well as the efficient management of IoT devices and applications. In Sun and
    Ansari (2016), the authors tackled the scalability and energy consumption challenges
    that IoT faces by proposing a novel architecture including the cloud, mobile edge
    computing and IoT. It includes a framework which develops a selective offloading
    scheme to reduce the energy consumption of IoT devices and the overhead of edge
    devices. However, this architecture needs to overcome many challenges related
    to nodes identification by the virtual machines (especially if they change location)
    as well as the nodes and virtual machines migration. In fact, if a mobile node
    changes its location, the system should find an efficient strategy that can either
    migrates the virtual machine or not based on the QoS requirements of the application.
    In Min et al. (2019), the authors proposes a reinforcement learning based offloading
    scheme for IoT devices with energy harvesting. IoT devices select an edge device
    and their offloading rate according to their current battery level, the previous
    radio transmission rate to each edge device, and the predicted amount of harvested
    energy. This solution also includes a deep reinforcement-based offloading scheme
    to further accelerate the learning speed. In Liu et al. (2019), the authors also
    combined Edge Computing with deep reinforcement learning in an IoT-based energy
    management system to reduce the energy consumption in a smart home context. The
    proposed solution consists in an offline and an online phase. During the offline
    phase, a deep neural network is trained and a deep reinforcement learning model
    based on Q-learning is built and exploited during the online phase. The proposed
    solution proves to reduce the energy cost. Such solutions can be proposed to reduce
    the energy consumption of smart homes in a smart city context. In Azar et al.
    (2019), the authors focused on compressing the data collected by the edge device
    before their transmission. The proposed solution is based on an error-bounded
    lossy compressor designed for high performance applications with high data production.
    The proposed compression algorithm proved that the extracted data produced similar
    classification accuracy as the compressed data. 6. Research perspectives in IoT
    energy management In this section, we will discuss the use of approaches (see
    Fig. 5) like social IoT 5G-IoT and network softwarization as well as artificial
    intelligence and Cognitive Radio IoT in order to reduce the global energy consumption
    of IoT networks. We will also present the most recent solutions proposed for this
    purpose. In Table 8, we summarize the papers studied for each approach. Table

    for IoT. 6.1. Energy management techniques in 5G IoT With the emergence of 5G
    IoT, up to 120 billion devices will be connected all over the world. In order
    to meet the intense user demands, the devices will not be limited to smart phones
    but also home appliances, cars and other devices and will contribute to build
    a smart society. 5G IoT also claims a data rate increase up to 10 Gb/s and uses
    multiple technologies (e.g. massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO), small cells,
    beam forming, etc.) in order to support the tremendous number of users. Consequently,
    5G IoT suffers not only from spectrum efficiency but also energy efficiency problems
    that are causing negative effects on the environment and human health. This exponential
    growth has raised the energy consumption and carbon footprint of those networks
    to alarming rates which led both the industry and academia to turn towards green
    5G communications. In the literature, various studies discussed the importance
    of energy efficiency in 5G networks. In Buzzi et al. (2016), the authors presented
    an overview of energy-efficient techniques for 5G networks covering resource allocation,
    network planning, network deployment, hardware solutions, etc. In Gandotra et
    al. (2017), the authors presented a detailed survey on energy efficient cellular
    networks and proposed a spectrum sharing solution for prolonged battery life in
    IoT networks. In Costanzo and Masotti (2017), the authors provided an overview
    of several recent solutions for the wireless powering of devices exploiting either
    near-field or far-field techniques. These techniques are expected to have a leading
    role in the realization of 5G-IoT networks. In Dao et al. (2020), the authors
    proposed a probabilistic decay feature-based solution which focused on the energy
    consumption of spectrum sensing for IoT devices in 5G networks. In Zhang et al.
    (2016), the authors proposed an integrating and energy efficient system model
    for 5G-IoT that uses a massive MIMO array to replace the single remote antenna
    and cellular partition zooming (CPZ) mechanism as a select-and-sleep mechanism,
    shortening consequently the distance between the components and reducing the number
    of routers. 6.2. Energy efficient cognitive radio iot With the high number of
    IoT devices connected to the internet, the frequency spectrum used by those devices
    to communicate are getting crowded. Cognitive radio is an approach that aims to
    improve the usage efficiency of the radio electromagnetic spectrum by using all
    available frequencies. The cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless communication
    system that can be programmed and configured dynamically. It is built on a software-defined
    radio which is aware of its environment and uses the understanding-by-building
    methodology to learn from the environment (Haykin, 2005). It automatically detects
    the available channels in the wireless spectrum and accordingly adapts its transmission
    and reception parameters in order to ensure communication reliability and efficient
    utilization of the radio spectrum. Recently, the integration of cognitive radio
    and IoT have been widely studied as a potential solution for the bandwidth scarcity
    and devices high demand of uninterrupted connectivity. Compared to traditional
    IoT, spectrum sensing may consume much energy and reduce the transmission power
    of the network. Thus, reducing energy consumption in cognitive radio networks
    remains one of the most important challenges in IoT networks energy management.
    In Qureshi et al. (2017), the authors proposed an energy efficient protocol for
    cognitive radio IoT that reduces the number of handshakes, avoid re-transmission
    for reliable data communication and thus reduces communication time and enables
    energy transmission with high throughput. The reduction in communication time
    reduces considerably the energy consumption of the network. Other solutions focus
    on reducing the energy consumption using optimization algorithms. In Xu et al.
    (2017), the authors proposed an algorithm for joint time and power allocation
    optimization in green cognitive radio networks while in Liu et al. (2020), the
    authors focused on optimizing resources and sensing time in green cognitive IoT.
    The solution consists in having two groups of IoT nodes alternate between spectrum
    sensing and energy harvesting in order to compensate sensing energy consumption.
    The authors in Hao et al. (2016), proposed an algorithm to optimize the power
    allocation and sensing time during imperfect sensing in cooperative cognitive
    radio networks. Cognitive radios resolve the problem of high spectrum requirements,
    reduce waiting time and thus allow devices to consume less energy. On the other
    hand, cognitive radios may face interference issues between secondary and primary
    users and may also struggle to compromise between a good QoS and energy efficiency.
    6.3. Energy efficient network softwarization for iot IoT connects billions of
    devices to provide a variety of services (smart homes, smart agriculture, industry
    4.0, etc.). In order to achieve these services, IoT devices employ various protocols,
    communication ways, and format of data. The diversity and heterogeneity of IoT
    data and devices compared to traditional networks in addition to the need of security,
    privacy, storage and processing means that IoT networks require dynamic solutions
    for management, configuration, and flow scheduling solutions. Network softwarization
    in the form of Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization
    (NFV) have emerged in order to overcome the previously discussed challenges. Networks
    softwarization consists in transforming telecommunication processing to a software-based
    environment. It is based on SDN which separates the control plane of the network
    and the data plane and thus separates the control from the forwarding in the network.
    The IoT network devices are employed for forwarding the data while the network
    controllers define the forwarding policies for the devices. These controllers
    can be organized in a centralized manner or in a hierarchical manner in order
    to prevent the controller from becoming a single point of failure and enhance
    the system’s fault tolerance (Eghbali and Lighvan, 2021). SDN integrated IoT can
    offer smart routing and load balancing as well as intelligent network traffic
    management and analysis. SDN can also provide a global view of IoT networks and
    improve the scalability and security of the networks. Network softwarization is
    also based on NFV which decouples the functions of network from the network hardware
    and runs it as virtual machines on containers. Network softwarization schemes
    such as NFV aim to replace energy consuming network hardware and improve the performances
    and capabilities of IoT systems. However, it is important to mention that these
    network functions are often run on servers which are the predominant energy consumers.
    Then, how does network softwarization impact the overall energy consumption of
    IoT networks and how can we reduce and optimize its energy consumption? To this
    end, various works studied the energy consumption in the network softwarization
    field. In Zemrane et al. (2018), the authors surveyed SDN-based solutions to improve
    IoT networks and describes SDN as a solution to IoT challenges focusing on energy
    saving, network management and mobility. In Naeem et al. (2020), the authors proposed
    an SDN-enabled routing protocol that not only efficiently utilizes the limited
    bandwidth cost to reduce the energy consumption but also achieves the QoS requirements
    for an industrial IoT network while in Yazdinejad et al. (2020), the authors proposed
    a cluster architecture using blockchain-based SDN controllers with distributed
    network management for IoT devices that provide a secure and energy-efficient
    mechanism for IoT devices in an SDN domain using a routing protocol. Numerous
    authors focused on reducing the energy consumption of SDN and NFV enabled data
    centers and thus, reducing the energy consumption of the whole IoT system. In
    Krishnan et al. (2015), the authors proposed an open stack based solution to enable
    policies that enforces constraints in the system with periodic event monitoring
    and dynamic resource management to minimize energy consumption in NFV data centers.
    In Liao and Wang (2018), the authors proposed an energy consumption control solution
    in SDN-based cloud data centers using the integration of virtual machine migration
    based on mixed single-parent genetic algorithm. Various SDN solutions achieved
    energy efficiency through energy efficient routing protocols. 6.4. Social IoT
    for energy management Social IoT is a paradigm that resulted from the integration
    of social networking concepts into the Internet. Social networks are able to connect
    a large number of individuals and this characteristic has previously inspired
    researchers in internet-related works (Atzori et al., 2012). Similarly to social
    networks, IoT networks use a variety of technologies to connect a large number
    of things which made the idea of combining these two concepts not only possible
    but also advisable. The concept of Social IoT was motivated by popular social
    networks over the Internet such as Facebook and Twitter. Therefore, it has attracted
    scientists and researchers in E-business, E-learning, sociology, psychology and
    networking. It has also caught the eyes of researchers in energy management as
    they consider it a promising solution in green networking. Since Device-to-Device
    communication and social network are two essential components in IoT, various
    authors studied energy management using Social IoT and proposed solutions to enhance
    the energy and spectrum efficiency in this context. For example, in Yang et al.
    (2020), the authors proposed a social interaction assisted resource sharing scheme
    for Device-to-Device communication, to improve the utilization of spectrum resources
    and thus, reduce the energy consumption in Green-IoT networks. The interconnection
    of IoT devices can also be used to efficiently harvest energy. For example, in
    Jiang et al. (2016), the authors proposed a social-aware energy harvesting Device-to-Device
    communications architecture that integrates energy harvesting technologies and
    social networking characteristics into Device-to-Device communication to improve
    the spectrum and energy efficiency for local data dissemination in 5G cellular
    networks. In Meng et al. (2017), the authors also worked on using social interaction
    in Device-to-Device communication but in this case to improve the efficiency of
    data exchange, sharing and delivery reducing thus, the energy consumption in the
    network. In Zhou et al. (2018), the authors proposed an energy efficient Cyber–Physical–Social
    system powered by IoT, where wireless network virtualization over SDN was adopted
    to enhance the service operation and the system management. In Lee et al. (2016),
    the authors propose an efficient pervasive interconnection technique to process
    and share information in IoT environment based on the human’s social network and
    the device’s sociality. In Al-Turjman (2019), the authors studied the use of smartphone
    sensors to contribute to smart social spaces as well as the energy consumption
    of femtocell, a potential communication technology for the realization in 5G-IoT.
    6.5. Intelligent energy management techniques for iot IoT networks are composed
    of physical devices such as vehicles, houses and any other item enhanced with
    sensors and software that enable data collection, distribution and analysis. However,
    due to the high number of IoT devices and their small sizes, they do not possess
    the computational power to process all the data collected hence, machine learning
    and big data technologies are efficient approaches to develop intelligent solutions
    to the collected data management. Big data technologies allow the collection and
    analysis of large amounts of data while machine learning studies algorithms and
    statistical models based on patterns and inferences that systems use to meet their
    goals (Machorro-Cano et al., 2020). Likewise, machine learning is a very reliable
    and robust approach, therefore, it is largely used in real-time applications.
    It is considered ideal for learning-based problems and is capable of identifying
    the background and characteristics of such problems to learn from them and execute
    actions based on the knowledge acquired thus increase system performances. Due
    to the high number of IoT devices, the energy consumed by IoT devices is huge.
    In addition, the world we live in faces a huge environmental crisis with climate
    change and high rates of air pollution, water pollution, etc. Reducing energy
    consumption in IoT networks is, then, one of the greatest challenges we might
    face. Researchers can exploit machine learning and intelligent solutions in order
    to predict energy consumption in IoT networks and applications. Table 9. The table
    shows the pros and cons of intelligent energy saving techniques. Intelligent energy
    saving techniques Pros Cons Machine learning -Help identify trends and patterns
    -Performances improve over time -Consumes energy while running the algorithms
    -Algorithms become obsolete when the data grows -Irrelevant and invaluable data
    can cause bad results Deep learning -Ideal for complex tasks -Supports large amounts
    of data -Bad quality data leads to bad results -Opacity of neural networks -More
    data security Various solutions have been proposed in order to reduce the energy
    consumption of IoT devices. However, those solutions are usually static, limited
    to a certain context and do not include taking smart and intelligent decisions.
    For example: in case of energy management of home appliances consumption, various
    optimizations solutions have been proposed. However, those solutions are depending
    on a certain context and do not consider a change of habit for the in-habitant.
    This is why, machine learning has emerged as promising approach to develop intelligent
    solutions for energy efficiency in smart homes as they are able, using smart meters
    data, to not only reduce the energy consumption but also adapt the decision making
    depending on the in-habitants’ habits. In fact, it would be interesting to exploit
    machine learning in order to adjust transport scheduling depending on air pollution
    or action depollution mechanisms if sensors detect a high pollution rate in water,
    etc. Hence, many researchers turned towards achieving Green-IoT at different network
    layers using intelligent solutions like machine learning and deep learning that
    proved their efficiency in other fields. Machine learning and deep learning, two
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches, are often confused as deep learning is
    considered a part of machine learning but, we believe is important to differentiate
    them as they are two concepts used in different contexts and application fields.
    Machine learning can be defined as algorithms that provide a system the ability
    to automatically learn and improve its performances. Machine learning algorithms
    learn from data or experiences and apply what they have learned to make informed
    decisions. They usually involve human intervention to give feedback to the algorithm.
    Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised
    learning. Supervised learning uses the experiences learned from past data and
    apply it to new data using labeled examples to predict the future actions or events,
    while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled and unclassified data and helps the
    system find all kinds of unknown patterns in data. Another category of machine
    leaning is semi-supervised machine learning which uses both supervised and unsupervised
    learning. Typically, those algorithms use a small amount of labeled data and the
    rest is usually unlabeled data. Semi-supervised algorithms decrease the labeling
    effort and increase the learning accuracy of the system. Finally, reinforcement
    learning is an approach in which the learning methods consist in interacting with
    the environment by taking actions and receiving rewards or errors. Within a specific
    context, this method maximizes the system’s performances and automatically determines
    its ideal behavior. Deep learning algorithms are an evolution of machine learning
    algorithms as they use a programmable layered structure of algorithms called an
    artificial neural network. These artificial neural networks enable systems to
    make accurate decisions without human intervention. Deep learning differs from
    the other machine learning algorithms as it is able to accomplish complex tasks
    using unstructured data, process a large amount of data and learn efficiently
    without human intervention. In what follows, we will present machine learning
    and deep learning based solutions employed to reduce the energy consumption of
    IoT networks. 6.5.1. Machine learning-based energy saving techniques With the
    emergence of IoT and the exploding number of IoT devices, the volume of the data
    generated by IoT systems also increases considerably. Consequently, machine learning
    techniques have emerged to use the data generated by IoT devices and make IoT
    application more intelligent. However, due to the high number of IoT devices,
    the energy consumed by those devices has also increased considerably, thus, energy
    saving has become a priority for IoT systems designers and end-users. This motivated
    researchers to study the use of machine learning in order to create green smart
    and sustainable IoT-network applications. The amount of works concerning the use
    of machine learning to achieve energy saving is large. To help reduce the energy
    consumption, machine learning can be used in energy saving IoT applications such
    as Smart Buildings (Zhao et al., 2018, Thomas and Cook, 2016), Smart Energy (O’Dwyer
    et al., 2019, Sheikhi et al., 2015), Smart Water (Mounce et al., 2015). Other
    works focus on saving energy by efficiently transmitting data and reducing the
    number of transmitted packets (Lavassani et al., 2018). While in Paris and Anisi
    (2019), the authors focused on energy efficient mobility prediction using machine
    learning. This shows if the data features are known and with the available datasets,
    machine learning algorithms prove to be an interesting solution that can be used
    and adapted to different aspects of energy saving in IoT networks. 6.5.2. Deep
    learning-based energy saving techniques Deep Learning is a promising approach
    for energy management in IoT networks. As shown in Table 9, it differs from machine
    learning as it provides better performances with large scale data. Deep learning
    algorithms are self-directed on data-analysis and can automatically extract new
    features for problems in contrast to machine learning algorithms which depend
    on the extracted and already identified features. Deep learning has been used
    in several works related to energy saving. In Liu et al. (2019), a deep reinforcement
    learning-based energy scheduling was proposed to deal with uncertainty and intermittence
    of energy supplies. In Hu et al., 2018, Liessner et al., 2018 a deep reinforcement
    learning approach was proposed to obtain an energy management strategy for a hybrid
    electric vehicle. On the other hand, in Wu et al. (2018a), a deep Q-learning based
    energy management strategy for power split Hybrid Electric Buses is proposed.
    As shown in the works presented previously, deep learning can be used in numerous
    energy saving applications. However, it is more suitable for large scale applications
    that require constant learning and that needs to adapt to the state of its environment.
    6.6. Application-based energy management IoT has revolutionized the way we live.
    However, IoT technologies face several challenges such as the increase in energy
    consumption and carbon footprint of IoT nodes. Therefore, IoT applications must
    be smart, eco-friendly and sustainable and with the recent development of Green
    IoT, it has become a tool towards achieving green and sustainable societies. Various
    IoT solutions have been proposed where IoT is an enabler for greening several
    fields of our society such as waste management, retail and logistics, smart streets,
    etc. For smart waste management, the authors in Shyam et al. (2017) proposed a
    smart waste management system where the waste level in waste bins is communicated
    and an optimized and energy efficient route is proposed to the workers. In Kazmi
    et al. (2020), the authors proposed a smart street framework where streetlights
    are powered by solar panels and are efficiently monitored and maneuvered by IoT.
    The streetlights operate at different intensities depending on the traffic flow
    rate and the absence or presence of sunlight and vehicles. In the proposed solution,
    streetlights are also equipped with sensors to help monitor air quality. Throughout
    the years, it has also been proven that traditional infrastructures that help
    simplify human beings daily lives (e.g. public transportation systems, home appliances,
    cars, factories, etc.) waste a tremendous amount of energy. Therefore, in order
    to continue using these vehicles and infrastructures without draining our planet’s
    energy resources, greening using IoT becomes a top priority and constitutes a
    step towards achieving green and sustainable societies. Consequently, various
    solution have been proposed as alternatives to traditional and polluting applications.
    In Chen et al. (2016) the authors discussed the use of Intelligent Transportation
    Systems to achieve energy saving and what changes both consumers and decision-makers
    should take in order to reduce the energy consumption of public transport systems.
    In Franzitta et al. (2017), the authors studied the use of renewable energies
    to power public transport (buses) and reduce the energetic dependence on fossil
    fuels by replacing diesel vehicles with hydrogen-powered vehicles. Numerous works
    specialized in energy management for trains and railways station such as Şengör
    et al., 2017, Kampeerawat and Koseki, 2017. Personal vehicles are also concerned
    with energy management. In Giliberto et al. (2019), the authors proposed a solution
    based on fuzzy logic aimed at prolonging the battery life of electric bikes. The
    use of electric bikes (e-bikes) is particularly interesting in IoT networks as
    they can be used as mobile node for energy or data transmission. Reducing energy
    consumption in buildings also caught the eye of researchers (Esther and Kumar,
    2016). For example, in Rahim et al., 2018, Ożadowicz, 2017, the authors proposed
    solutions to minimize energy consumption of homes and building appliances while
    causing the minimum discomfort to the user. In Rahim et al. (2018), the authors
    proposed a hybrid solution based on three heuristic algorithms for home energy
    management in a smart building while in Ożadowicz (2017), the authors proposed
    an approach to both physical and logical organization of an active demand side
    management system for building-integrated prosumer microgrids based on IoT and
    standard building automation and control systems (BACS) Table 10. The table shows
    recommendations on how to use the energy management techniques presented in our
    survey to meet iot applications requirements. IoT application Requirements Techniques

    will present recommendations and indications to IoT system designers on which
    techniques presented in our survey can help achieve the requirements of an IoT
    application in an energy efficient way. The application fields of IoT in a single
    domain are diverse thus, the requirements can differ from one application to another
    in the same field. However, a number of these techniques can be used for different
    applications. For example, using battery-less devices with backscatter communications,
    simultaneously transmitting power and information with SWIPT, in addition to periodically
    alternating between sleep and wake-up states for IoT devices with duty-cycling
    and wake-up radios that can be combined with machine learning techniques to optimize
    the sleep and wake-up time. These techniques are very promising and are use in
    scenarios where the device do not need to be constantly active. 5G technology
    is integrated with IoT networks in order to boost the communication and response
    time as well as the capacity of IoT networks. Security is also crucial for IoT
    applications that use private and critical data such as smart homes, healthcare
    and industrial IoT. IoT system designers should consider security at different
    layers of the network with security protocols as well as network softwarization
    that not only allows to save energy by replacing physical security devices but
    also to have powerful security mechanisms. Green energy sources also need to be
    exploited for various applications in order to power the devices and ensure the
    availability of the devices and real-time data. In Table 10, we summerize our
    recommendations for each IoT application. 7.1. Smart home IoT is drastically transforming
    how households are managed. Devices and home appliances are equipped with communication
    interfaces and are remotely and automatically controlled in order to offer a comfortable
    experience for the in-habitants. In this regard, smart homes services need to
    be available at any time and with low latency. Therefore, processing data at edge,
    fog and cloud level allows to have a quick response (Mao et al., 2018). Task offloading
    at different levels of the platform also enhances the availability of the service
    and allows a quick recovery in case one of the components stops working (Chowdhury
    et al., 2020). If smart home sensor data are communicated to the edge, fog or
    cloud for processing and since communication costs more energy than local computation,
    energy efficient data communication schemes need to developed for smart home through
    lightweight protocols, data reduction, data aggregation schemes (Pattamaset and
    Choi, 2021) and social IoT (Kim and Lee, 2015) to exploit the interconnection
    between the devices to find energy efficient communication routes. Smart homes
    solutions should also be context-aware and flexible thus, these applications can
    use machine and deep learning techniques in order to adapt to the user’s needs
    and reduce the energy consumption (Jo and Yoon, 2018). 7.2. Agriculture IoT was
    introduced in agriculture to improve agricultural yield and quality for the increasing
    world population. IoT is used to collect real-time information about temperature,
    humidity and soil and transmit them to a platform where they will be used to monitor
    the production. IoT devices in smart agriculture applications need to be reliable
    through weather conditions and available for years without the need for battery
    replacement. In addition to green energy sources and intelligent sleep/wake-up
    techniques, energy efficiency in agriculture IoT devices can also be achieved
    through using mobile vehicles such as tractors as power relays and data sinks
    and ensure the availability of the application data. A combination of sleep/wake-up
    techniques and UAV-based mobile energy harvesting is proposed in Jawad et al.
    (2019) for a smart agriculture system. Agricultural application are in constant
    expansion. Therefore, sensor data management is a key challenge that need to be
    taken into consideration through different devices organization schemes as well
    as data reduction and flexible data collection strategies. 7.3. Healthcare IoT
    is progressively integrated in healthcare in order to improve the access and enhance
    the quality of care. IoT healthcare applications aim to achieve excellent healthcare
    services at affordable costs. IoT in healthcare can be used to monitor a patient
    behavior and extract information that will improve well-being, healthcare and
    patient support. Patients’ medical information are critical, this is why healthcare
    application should protect data with secure transmission protocols. Healthcare
    IoT application should also offer real-time information about the patient’s health
    condition with low response time which will be possible with the democratization
    of 5G networks. In order to ensure efficient patient support and services, IoT
    healthcare services should be available even if one of the components stops working
    and devices should be able to function through arduous condition for a long period
    of time (e.g. wearable heart rate monitor). One of the most suitable approaches
    presented in our survey to meet those requirements is social IoT. IoT devices
    in healthcare are often mobile, the connection and relationships between these
    devices can be exploited in order to ensure the availability of critical information
    and the system’s fault tolerance. In Al-Turjman (2019), the authors used 5G and
    exploited Social IoT to ensure service availability for smart devices. The social
    aspect of IoT devices can also be exploited for power transmission between devices
    (Pei et al., 2020). For healthcare IoT applications that use wearable devices,
    human motion and mechanical energy harvesting can constitute the perfect solution
    to further increase the devices’ and network’s lifetime (Wu et al., 2021). 7.4.
    Industrial IoT IoT has recently made its way to the industry. It refers to the
    interconnection of all the industrial assets and aims to collect the maximum data
    from these assets to achieve optimal industrial operations. Industrial applications
    that are safety-critical and used for control and decision making need to be available
    and reliable at any time. In order to achieve industrial IoT applications requirements
    of real-time performance, 5G communication technologies (Slalmi et al., 2021)
    that offer low latency can be combined with CR-IoT (Abbas et al., 2020) to satisfy
    end-to-end deadlines of the tasks and optimize the frequency spectrum utilization
    and thus, reduce the waiting time. Edge and Fog computing can be used to perform
    energy-hungry computation at the edge of the network (as in Hsu et al. (2019))
    with low latency instead of handling them on the cloud which induces a longer
    transmission time and a higher energy consumption. With the large amounts of data
    generated in industrial IoT applications, an compromise must be made between the
    high availability of industrial IoT and the high energy consumption of data transmission.
    Therefore, IoT devices data should be organized and reduced through data aggregation
    and reduction techniques presented in our survey to reduce the transmission data
    energy consumption and latency in industrial IoT applications. Similarly to smart
    homes, industrial IoT applications should use artificial intelligence in order
    to offer a flexible and context-aware experience and exploit mobile devices in
    order to power other devices through intelligent mobile energy transfer strategies
    (Park et al., 2020a). 8. Conclusion With the constant need of human being to have
    a safe, comfortable and stable environment, Green IoT emerged as a key and hot
    technology. It guarantees a decrease in the energy consumption of IoT. In the
    coming years, the number of IoT devices will be even higher as big companies (e.g.
    Google, Amazon, etc.) are investing in the sector. Thus, companies and organization
    should develop IoT solutions from an eco-friendly and energy efficient standpoint.
    Re-usability and recycling of IoT devices should also be a focal point of the
    research of Green IoT to avoid the energy resulting from the process of producing
    new smart devices. Therefore, in order to achieve Green and sustainable IoT, there
    is a crucial need for new IoT policies and standardization that include the principles
    of Green IoT. In our survey, we have focused on gathering a large range of energy
    management technologies that will help achieve Green IoT systems. We have also
    discussed recent trends and new perspectives in IoT networks energy management
    that were not discussed previously in the literature. It is important to mention
    that other factors like QoS and security can further increase the energy consumption
    of Green IoT networks. For the longest time, in order to offer the best experience
    to the user, energy consuming solutions that achieve a good QoS was often privileged
    to a green solution that could lack in an aspect of QoS. Security is also another
    energy consuming factor of Green IoT. With the high expansion of IoT networks
    and high IoT nodes connectivity, the cybersecurity risks increase accordingly.
    Personal and private data will also circulate through IoT networks. Therefore,
    it is important to address the cybersecurity issues. Declaration of Competing

  analysis: 'This paper presents an AI-based expert system for assessing land suitability
    for agricultural cultivation, particularly in terms of sensors driven data collection
    to train a model that can classify land into four decision classes. The proposed
    system utilizes IoT sensors to collect various soil, water, climate, and other
    relevant parameters that influence crop yield. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
    model is employed to analyze the collected data and perform multiclass classification,
    categorizing the land into four suitability classes: most suitable, suitable,
    moderately suitable, and unsuitable. The MLP model is found to achieve high accuracy
    in land suitability assessment when compared to other existing models.


    The specific contribution of this work includes:

    - The selection of relevant attributes for accurate land suitability classification
    based on data collected from IoT sensors.

    - Integration of sensor data for future prediction.

    - Development of a recommendation model for farmers, specifically targeting low-income
    regions.

    - Generalization of the model for use on any land, based on the assumption that
    the input parameters are sufficient.

    - Multiclass classification, which provides more detailed information compared
    to binary classification, helping farmers make better decisions for their cultivation.


    The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed sensor-based AI model effectively
    evaluates land suitability based on the considered attributes, providing valuable
    insights for farmers to make informed decisions about crop cultivation.'

    \ two billion in 2050, according to\nthe survey taken by the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization, while the arable area is likely to grow\nonly by 5%. Therefore,\
    \ smart and eﬃcient farming techniques are necessary to improve agriculture\n\
    productivity. Agriculture land suitability assessment is one of the essential\
    \ tools for agriculture\ndevelopment. Several new technologies and innovations\
    \ are being implemented in agriculture as\nan alternative to collect and process\
    \ farm information. The rapid development of wireless sensor\nnetworks has triggered\
    \ the design of low-cost and small sensor devices with the Internet of Things\n\
    (IoT) empowered as a feasible tool for automating and decision-making in the domain\
    \ of agriculture.\nThis research proposes an expert system by integrating sensor\
    \ networks with Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nsystems such as neural networks and Multi-Layer\
    \ Perceptron (MLP) for the assessment of agriculture\nland suitability. This proposed\
    \ system will help the farmers to assess the agriculture land for\ncultivation\
    \ in terms of four decision classes, namely more suitable, suitable, moderately\
    \ suitable,\nand unsuitable. This assessment is determined based on the input\
    \ collected from the various sensor\ndevices, which are used for training the\
    \ system. The results obtained using MLP with four hidden\nlayers is found to\
    \ be eﬀective for the multiclass classiﬁcation system when compared to the other\n\
    existing model. This trained model will be used for evaluating future assessments\
    \ and classifying the\nland after every cultivation.\nKeywords: smart agriculture;\

    \ is considered as the base for human living because it is the primary source\n\
    of food and income for most of the countries in the world. The economy of the\
    \ country depends\non agriculture production as it provides food, raw materials,\
    \ employment, etc., to the people living\nin that country [1]. It has been observed\
    \ in recent times that there is no signiﬁcant development in\ncrop production\
    \ in the agriculture sector. Also, there is a rapid increase in the price of food\
    \ because\nthe production of the crop is not meeting demand [2]. One of the causes\
    \ for the decrease in crop\nproduction is the farmers use of the traditional way\
    \ of cultivation, which leads to less crop yield.\nThe farmers new to the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld have insuﬃcient knowledge about the characteristics of soil\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 3667; doi:10.3390/s19173667\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 3667\n2 of 16\nfor crop cultivation [3]. They are not conscious of the fact\
    \ that agriculture land needs to be assessed\nbefore cultivation [4].\nLand suitability\
    \ analysis is a mandatory prerequisite for crop cultivation, which helps to obtain\n\
    maximum production. In order to acquire the properties of the soil, farmers depend\
    \ on soil testing\nlabs, which are not suﬃcient enough to help them, and sometimes\
    \ the data provided by the labs are\ninaccurate [5]. In order to get enough knowledge\
    \ about cultivation, data need to be collected manually,\nwhich is very diﬃcult\
    \ for farmers. The solution is the replacement of traditional methods of data\n\
    collection with Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors [6]. Sensors play a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in collecting\ninformation about various factors such as soil, water, climate,\
    \ etc., for agriculture development. With\nthe help of data gathered from diﬀerent\
    \ sensors, land suitability analysis could be done, which would\nhelp farmers\
    \ identify the current status of their agriculture land and improve their crop\
    \ production.\nSeveral decision models have been developed so far to assist the\
    \ farmers in taking a decision on crop\ncultivation to maximize their proﬁt [7].\n\
    Ever-changing real-world conditions like monsoons to temperate are the dominant\
    \ factors in\naﬀecting agriculture productivity. Soil parameters to weather prediction\
    \ are essential in knowing\nthe future yield [8]. The key factors that are inﬂuencing\
    \ the crop yield are climatic conditions, soil\nproductivity, and groundwater\
    \ characteristics, as well as its availability. An extensive study on\nphenotyping\
    \ is helping researchers to understand these factors [9]. One of the signiﬁcant\
    \ challenges\ninvolved in identifying the diﬀerent land conditions is based on\
    \ the inﬂuence of various soil parameters.\nOver the past few decades, soil testing\
    \ has been practised, which is widely accepted by agriculture\nexperts and farmers\
    \ to determine the properties of soil for agriculture production [10]. The Agriculture\n\
    Management Information System (AMIS) is mandatory to store the data acquired in\
    \ various formats\nand exchanges the data for digital agriculture technology [11].\
    \ Currently, AMIS has enhanced its\nfacilities by accumulating the latest technologies,\
    \ such as the Internet and the Internet of Things (IoT).\nIntroduction of the\
    \ usage of sensors actually reduces the cost and time involved in assessing the\n\
    land suitability in the traditional manner [12]. The uses of sensors are plenty,\
    \ and it is possible to use\nas many sensors in the ﬁeld of agriculture. Soil\
    \ sensors, water sensors, and biosensors are few that\nhave been shown to have\
    \ a signiﬁcant role in measuring nature. These sensors contribute to the smart\n\
    farming system, especially in the handling of appropriate irrigation systems to\
    \ help farmers. The Radio\nFrequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) technology is used for\
    \ the detection of animals entering into the\nfarmland. The Global Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) position-based seeding recommendation is emerging\nas another beneﬁt\
    \ in the ﬁeld of agriculture beneﬁting from the latest technological developments\
    \ [13].\nSome of the beneﬁts it has achieved in recent days are improved eﬃciency,\
    \ sustainable growth, as well\nas cost-eﬀectiveness. It is considered to be the\
    \ connection between the collection of physical devices\nthrough internet connection\
    \ such as WiFi, Data cards, etc.\nAs a revolutionary change, the sensor-driven\
    \ network has a considerable role in precision\nagriculture [14]. Timely forecast\
    \ based on soil parameters will ensure proper irrigation systems. IoT\nhas a signiﬁcant\
    \ role in handling the recorded data from sensors. General Purpose Input/Output\n\
    facilitates various sensor inputs and the corresponding outputs in Raspberry Pi.\
    \ Further, this could\nreally help in hosting diﬀerent sensors. Cloud computing\
    \ is helping the IoT sensor networks to record\nthe measured data through its\
    \ sensors. The wireless medium is transferring the data to the cloud,\nwhich is\
    \ used later for data analysis [15].\nData Analytics has brought impactful results\
    \ for future predictions in almost every single\napplication. Artiﬁcial intelligence-based\
    \ model building is a challenging task as the model should\nreplicate the observed\
    \ parameters in the dataset. Parametric estimations are helpful in solving the\n\
    problems in a futuristic way, and agriculture problems are among those [16]. Agriculture\
    \ data analysis\nis done with diﬀerent machine learning algorithms. Maximizing\
    \ the outcome is the agenda for any\nmachine learning model, and model assessment\
    \ metrics are helpful in analyzing the results obtained.\nAppropriate training\
    \ of the machine learning model will produce the results with utmost accuracy.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3667\n3 of 16\nNeural network-based models are used widely,\
    \ as they have the capability to improve the eﬃciency\nof the model over every\
    \ iteration [17]. Classiﬁcation problems are handled by various algorithms,\n\
    such as support vector machines, decision tree algorithms, etc. Multiclass classiﬁcations\
    \ are expertly\nhandled by neural network algorithms [18]. When the model is trained\
    \ with the appropriate number\nof inputs and outputs, it is expected to give better\
    \ results compared to other machine learning models.\nThe integration of IoT,\
    \ along with machine learning models, are providing the farmer recommendation\n\
    system with appropriate inputs [19].\nIn this work, an agriculture dataset has\
    \ been obtained through various IoT sensor devices such as\na pH sensor, soil\
    \ moisture sensor, salinity sensor, and electromagnetic sensor. A sensor is a\
    \ device\nwhich is used to detect and respond to some type of input obtained from\
    \ the physical environment [20].\nAs it requires less labor and consumes less\
    \ time, it is used in many real-time applications. As the\nInternet plays a mediatory\
    \ role in various kinds of communication and data exchange, it is advisable to\n\
    integrate the agriculture data with the cloud platform. The data acquired from\
    \ the various IoT devices\ncould be stored to the cloud platform [21].\nThe key\
    \ contribution of this work is as follows\n•\nThe selection of the relevant attributes\
    \ and the collection of data from the appropriate sources for\nbetter agriculture\
    \ land suitability classiﬁcation, and these data are heterogeneous in nature.\n\
    •\nIntegration of diﬀerent data collection and bringing it to a form suitable\
    \ for future predictions.\n•\nThe noble initiation towards helping the farmers\
    \ build a recommendation model, especially for\nthe low economic regions, in a\
    \ country like India.\n•\nGeneralization of the proposed model, which could be\
    \ used for any land, as the current test inputs\nare suﬃcient for the classiﬁcation\
    \ of the land suitability with this developed model.\n•\nThe multiclass classiﬁcation\
    \ is another crucial contribution as the majority of the past work is\nbased on\
    \ binary classiﬁcation, which includes two decision classes, namely suitable and\
    \ unsuitable.\nThese multiclass results are helpful for the farmers when compared\
    \ to the binary classiﬁcation, to\ntake suitable action based on the outcome of\
    \ the results.\nThis paper presents a model that will automate the process of\
    \ analyzing various deciding factors\nin the assessment of present and future\
    \ conditions for the better crop yield. The diﬀerent classiﬁcation\nwill help\
    \ decide well in advance how to proceed to start a new session. Besides, this\
    \ would ensure\nminimal loss to the farmers, and the diﬀerent sections presented\
    \ here elucidate the model further.\n2. Related Work\nThe integration of the Internet\
    \ of Things into the agricultural system has led to the Internet of\nAgriculture\
    \ of Things along with advanced computing techniques. The researchers apply this\
    \ to\nobtain maximum beneﬁt and to also improve the production of agriculture,\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, and\nIoT [22]. The agriculture domain is experiencing\
    \ new evolution and revolution motivated by sensors,\nIoT, big data, and cloud\
    \ technology [23]. The IoT based on a smart agriculture system was developed\n\
    using deep reinforcement learning integrated with a cloud environment, in which\
    \ four layers were\nincluded, namely data collection, edge computing, data transmission,\
    \ and cloud computing [24]. IoT\nhas been integrated with agriculture systems\
    \ to yield maximum proﬁt, and the applications of IoT in\nagriculture have been\
    \ categorized into restricted environment planning, open farm planting, livestock\n\
    farm monitoring, and aquaculture development [25].\nA new proposal was presented\
    \ for agriculture applications by investigating various integrated\nplatforms,\
    \ which include cloud computing, IoT, and data mining techniques [26].\nA scalable\n\
    network-based architecture was proposed to monitor and regulate agriculture farms\
    \ in rural areas\nwith the help of IoT-based WiFi with long-distance network and\
    \ fog computing [27]. The development\nof IoT in agriculture data analytics has\
    \ transformed from a speciﬁc crop to any kind of crop. Also,\nthe system is able\
    \ to support a various number of applications from controlling and supervising\
    \ the\nagriculture crops to promoting the products in the market [28]. An irrigation\
    \ monitoring and control\nSensors 2019, 19, 3667\n4 of 16\nsystem was developed\
    \ using a fuzzy approach to generate a moisture content distribution map of soil\n\
    by applying an interpolation technique.\nThe IoT-based Wireless Sensor Network\
    \ (WSN) was used to generate a distribution map with the\nmeasurements of soil\
    \ moisture content taken at nine places of the selected farmland [29]. An IoT-based\n\
    system was developed to water agriculture crops using a wireless sensor network,\
    \ and a web application\nwas also designed to control the information about the\
    \ crop and ﬁeld [30]. Several machine learning\nalgorithms have been used so far\
    \ for prediction and forecasting. A new forecasting model was designed\nby combining\
    \ the gravitational search algorithm with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to forecast\
    \ the level\nof water in Winnipesaukee and Cypress Lakes in the USA [31]. A neural\
    \ network-based model was\nproposed using MLP to predict the bid price of the\
    \ keyword in a particular search engine ranking [32].\nA hybrid model was proposed\
    \ by combining the ﬁreﬂy algorithm and MLP to predict the salinity value\nof soil\
    \ with the help of remote sensing data [33]. An algorithm was proposed for the\
    \ identiﬁcation of\nweed diseases using MLP and automatic relevance determination.\
    \ Three multi-criteria yield models\nwere proposed using neural networks with\
    \ MLP for the prediction of winter rapeseed [34].\nAn IoT-based hydroponic intelligent\
    \ system was developed using deep neural networks to control\nthe actions in the\
    \ hydroponic environment characterized by multiple parameters gathered using IoT\n\
    sensors [35]. An IoT-based smart decision model was developed to help the farmers\
    \ to get information\nsuch as fertilizer requirements, crop analysis, and market\
    \ requirements. IoT-based sensors were used to\nobtain the data related to farming,\
    \ and it is stored in a cloud framework where information is processed\nand sent\
    \ to farmers’ mobile devices by applying some data mining techniques [36]. An\
    \ Intelligent\nmodel was developed for the diagnosis of faults in the aquaculture\
    \ ponds located in remote places\nthrough IoT sensors. A fuzzy neural network\
    \ algorithm was applied for fault detection, and the model\ndetects many types\
    \ of faults in aquaculture ponds [37]. An IoT-based prototype was designed for\n\
    monitoring the water level in sources like borewells, water tanks, etc. This prototype\
    \ could be used to\navoid damage in pump motors when the water level goes beyond\
    \ the threshold level [38].\nA predictive platform for precision agriculture was\
    \ presented using IoT devices to improve\ncrop productivity at low-cost. Deep\
    \ learning algorithms were used to predict the diseases in plants\nwhich were\
    \ hidden in the images of the leaves, and they were classiﬁed with maximum accuracy\
    \ [39].\nAn intelligent system was developed to predict the fruit-melon image\
    \ of skin lesions and alert for new\nplanting environments using the convolutional\
    \ neural network and deep learning rule. The image is\nobtained by using an infrared\
    \ video sensor, and the system has obtained a satisfactory accuracy of\n97.5%.\
    \ A modern automatic agriculture monitoring system was developed using the ZigBee\
    \ Wireless\nSensor Network and deep learning algorithms. Wireless sensor networks\
    \ are also used to monitor the\ntemperature of soil and humidity. Also, the system\
    \ classiﬁes the moisture content in the soil.\nA decision tree-based model was\
    \ proposed for optimizing water and energy consumption [40].\nFurther, this was\
    \ accomplished with the assistance of the Internet-of-things. Moreover, to help\
    \ the\nfarmers in saving the precious water resource, which is declining day by\
    \ day, several soil parameters\nwere considered. Besides, for measuring the water\
    \ requirement, and factors such as soil moisture\ncontent and soil temperature\
    \ were utilized for making a suitable decisions concerning water release.\nThe\
    \ cloud-based IoT sensors are helpful in this work to control the overall setup.\
    \ This in turn also\nsaves the energy.\nThe below section presents the proposed\
    \ system which is a recommendation model for using\nartiﬁcial intelligence and\
    \ sensors.\n3. Proposed System—Sensors Driven Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) - Based\

    \ acquired from the sensors are numerical values. Based on the values obtained\n\
    from the sensor, suitability range values (obtained from experts) are assigned\
    \ to the parameters\nconsidered for the land suitability model. For example, the\
    \ pH value ranges from 7.2–6.7 for favorable\nland conditions, 6.6–5.5 for less\
    \ favorable land conditions, 5.4–4.5 for unfavorable land conditions,\nand less\
    \ than 4.5 for the very unfavorable land condition. The salinity value for the\
    \ favorable land\ncondition is <2, 2–6 for less favorable land conditions, 6–12\
    \ for unfavorable land conditions, and\ngreater than 12 for the very unfavorable\
    \ condition. The sampling period of data acquisition is one\nday. The average\
    \ of the one-day data obtained from various sensors is stored in the cloud network\
    \ as\npart of the preprocessing of the data. As the data may contain missing and\
    \ noisy values, the mean of\nthe data is considered. Since the data contain diﬀerent\
    \ units of measurement (categorical, numerical),\nnormalization is done before\
    \ applying the proposed model.\nFigure 1 states the architectural diagram of the\
    \ proposed model. The steps involved in this process\nare shown in this ﬁgure.\
    \ The data is collected from the farmland using sensors, and is then transferred\n\

    \ of the data.\nThe learning model construction is explained in the algorithm\
    \ part given below. The built model\nwill be assessed with inputs received after\
    \ every cultivation period, and accordingly, assessment results\nwill be provided.\
    \ Diﬀerent classes are considered here for land suitability assessment as most\
    \ suitable\n(class 1), suitable (class 2), moderately suitable (class 3), and\
    \ unsuitable (class 4).\nThe Algorithm 1 presented here explains the steps involved\
    \ in the processing the collected data\nfrom the diﬀerent sensors. Since the size\
    \ of the data is quite high in size, it is necessary to handle the\ndata with\
    \ the algorithm that is capable of handling the expected size of the data. That\
    \ is the reason\nwhy a neural network approach is considered here for processing\
    \ the data. The algorithm presented\nhere is further explained below.\nArtiﬁcial\
    \ Intelligence Model building is given in the algorithm. Processing of the neural\
    \ networks\nrelies upon the network topology, adjustments of weights, and activation\
    \ functions. The network\ntopology deﬁnes the network arrangement together with\
    \ its connecting links and nodes. In neural\nnetworks, learning refers to the\
    \ process of modifying weights of neural connections among the neurons\nof the\
    \ speciﬁc network. Activation functions are additional eﬀorts applied over the\
    \ input to achieve\nthe exact output. In the proposed work, a supervised learning-based\
    \ neural network is adopted where\nthe learning process is dependent. The input\
    \ vector is oﬀered to the network model and obtains an\noutput vector, which is\
    \ then compared to the desired or target vector. An error signal is developed\n\
    in case of a variation existing between the actual and the desired output vector.\
    \ Depending on the\nerror signal the weights are adapted until the desired and\
    \ the actual output matches. Neural networks\ncan be precisely deﬁned as complex\

    \ Study Area\nThe data used for this experimentation are collected from the diﬀerent\
    \ villages of the Vellore and\nTiruvannamalai district in the state of Tamil Nadu,\
    \ India. With expert opinions, we have shortlisted\nthe various parameters that\
    \ are really inﬂuence the crop yield. This collection of the dataset includes\n\
    a combination of distinctive climate, soil, and groundwater properties. Four decision\
    \ classes are\nconsidered here for land suitability assessment, namely most suitable\
    \ (class 1), suitable (class 2),\nmoderately suitable (class 3), and unsuitable\
    \ (class 4).\n4.2. Data Preparation\nIt is essential to prepare the information\
    \ astutely before training the neural networks (NN) and\nmultilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLP) models. The present real-world data obtained from sensors are distributed\n\
    non-uniformly, and henceforth, th data cannot be utilized legitimately amid training\
    \ and testing of the\nNN and MLP models. In this way, the input features are normalized,\
    \ and categorical variables are\nconverted to numeric data through the data label\
    \ encoder for eﬃcient processing. The standardized\ndataset is then sub-divided\
    \ into training and independent test sets in the ratio of 75:25. The results\n\
    obtained are observed in the perspective of multiclass classiﬁcation, as well\
    \ as for the individual class\nbasis. The process of training and testing is repeated\
    \ for a variable number of iterations starting from\n30, 50, and so on, till 100\
    \ until the convergence optimization is met, and also for a variable number of\n\
    neurons and hidden processing layers for each model.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3667\n\
    8 of 16\n4.3. Performance Measures\nThe performance parameters which are assessed\
    \ for multiclass classiﬁcation are characterized as\nfollows. For a class ‘C’,\
    \ the classiﬁer eﬃciency and performance could be assessed with true positive\n\
    (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) that can\
    \ be determined from the\ncounts of testing samples belonging to ‘C’ [42]. Various\
    \ performance metrics appropriate for assessing\nNN and MLP for multiclass classiﬁcation\
    \ problems are calculated [42]. Classiﬁcation accuracy scores\ncould be used to\
    \ determine the accuracy of the model by deﬁning the number of correct predictions\n\
    made from all the predictions. Also, this enables us to determine the per-class\
    \ eﬀectiveness of the\nmodel and is calculated as,\nAccuracy =\nTP + TN\nTP +\
    \ TN + FP + FN\n(1)\nThe performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score,\
    \ etc., used for binary classiﬁcation\nneeds to be generalized for the multiclass\
    \ classiﬁcation setting. To meet the appropriate needs, we\ncalculate the micro-average\
    \ and the macro average. In micro-averaging, the performance is evaluated,\ni.e.,\
    \ the precision, recall, and the F1 score are obtained from the individual TP,\
    \ TN, FP, and FN of\nthe n-class model [42]. In macro-averaging, the mean of the\
    \ performance of each individual class is\ndetermined, providing equal weight\
    \ to each of the classiﬁcation labels. Precision is the ratio of the\npredicted\
    \ positive events that are actually positive.\nPrecisionmicro =\nPn\ni=1 TPi\n\

    \ is the\nperformance measurement for classiﬁcation problems under various threshold\
    \ settings. ROC represents\nthe probability curve, and AUC is the degree or measure\
    \ of separability distinguishing the classes.\nThe AUC-ROC score is represented\
    \ in Table 2 under various iterations for the NN and MLP learning\nmodels. Figures\
    \ 2–4 represent the AUC-ROC curve for the multiclass classiﬁcation problem under\n\

    \ sensor-based AI model evaluates the experimental agriculture land based on the\n\
    considered attributes for cultivating the crop, which is expected to give better\
    \ yield. The agriculture\ndata obtained from sensors consists of 1000 alternatives\
    \ with 14 attributes. Out of 1000 data instances,\n750 data instances are used\
    \ for training the model, and the remaining 250 are used for testing the model.\n\
    The test dataset has been collected separately after every crop yield in a span\
    \ of one year. The proposed\nmodel classiﬁes the experimental dataset into four\
    \ decision classes, namely most suitable (class 1),\nsuitable (class 2), moderately\
    \ suitable (class 3), and unsuitable (class 4). The agriculture site belongs to\n\
    class 1, and class 2 could be used for crop cultivation in the present form, whereas\
    \ the agriculture farm\nbelongs to class 3 needs to be further processed by applying\
    \ the appropriate manure before cultivating\nthe crop, and the land that comes\
    \ under class 4 cannot be used for cultivation. The collected agriculture\ndataset\
    \ here is applied to the MLP algorithm for training purpose. The performance of\
    \ the MLP-based\nmulticlass classiﬁcation model is compared with the results obtained\
    \ from neural networks.\nThe number of hidden layers and the number of neurons\
    \ in each hidden layer are one of the most\nsigniﬁcant architectural parameters\
    \ which legitimately impacts the execution of MLP and NN during\nthe training\
    \ and preparation of the information for setting up a learning base. In any case,\
    \ determining\nthese parameters prior has been an unsolved problem in ML research.\
    \ In the proposed work for NN,\nthe experiments were performed with the number\
    \ of hidden neurons (Nh) to be set as 30, 50, and 80\nand the results were noted.\
    \ For MLP, the experiment is repeated for three and four numbers of hidden\nlayers\
    \ and the neurons in each layer were 30, 50, and 80. All the results have been\
    \ epitomized and\ndeﬁned in tables for varying the Nh values. Tables 1 and 2 deﬁnes\
    \ the results obtained for each class\nseparately using NN and MLP with Nh = 30.\
    \ Likewise, Tables 3 and 4 deﬁnes the results obtained\nfor Nh = 50 and Nh = 80.\
    \ On the other hand, Table 4 describes the results attained by the NN and\nMLP\
    \ based on multiclass classiﬁcation with Nh = 30. Likewise, Tables 5 and 6 illustrates\
    \ the multiclass\nclassiﬁcation results obtained for Nh = 50 and Nh = 80 accordingly.\
    \ It needs to be noticed that all the\nresults that appeared in these three tables\
    \ are averaged and equated over ten independent simulations\nfor each of the learning\
    \ models.\nTable 1. Performance of Neural Networks (NN) and MultiLayer Perceptron\

    \ are delineated in Tables 2–6, are basically dependent on\ndiﬀerent performance\
    \ parameters. The proposed work compiles various performance parameters for\n\
    the evaluation and assessment of NN and MLP for the multiclass classiﬁcation dataset.\
    \ The training\nperformance for the NN for the proposed dataset is found to be\
    \ varying for diﬀerent values of Nh such\nas Nh = 30, Nh = 50, and Nh = 80. The\
    \ performance measures of the NN model are found to improve as\nthe number of\
    \ neurons in the hidden layer Nh increases. With the increase in Nh, the NN is\
    \ capable\nof predicting the test data hypothesis with improved accuracy. Moreover,\
    \ the MSE and the RMSE\nare found to be very low and decrease accordingly in all\
    \ three cases. Further, this results in better\nconvergence of error, leading\
    \ to possibly proper learning of features. The performance parameters,\nlike the\
    \ accuracy, precision, and others mentioned, seems to follow a similar manner.\n\
    Hence, it could be presumed that predictive accuracy could be a good measure for\
    \ this dataset.\nThe performance results obtained using the MLP with three hidden\
    \ layers are found to be much better\nthan that of NN. Similar to the NN model,\
    \ this MLP model shows improved performance results\nwith the increasing number\
    \ of Nh. However, since the number of hidden layers has increased the\narchitectural\
    \ complexity, the convergence optimization is achieved with less number of iterations\
    \ when\ncompared to the NN.\nThe accuracy and other performance measures are found\
    \ to improve accordingly with an increase\nin the Nh. On observing the performance\
    \ measures of MLP with four hidden layers, the model\nindividually is found to\
    \ provide better results with improved performance with an increase in Nh.\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3667\n14 of 16\nHowever, when observed for the test case of Nh = 30,\
    \ MLP with three hidden layers is found to produce\nbetter results than the MLP\
    \ with four hidden layers. Further, this may be due to the increase in\narchitectural\
    \ complexity with an increased number of hidden layers. Also. if the Nh is set\
    \ to as high as\n100, there might be a high risk of over-ﬁtting the training data\
    \ which would lead to poor performance\nthan those obtained with Nh values of\
    \ 50 and 80. Besides, provided the current experimental setup,\none could likewise\
    \ accomplish slightly diﬀerent results due to the underlying fact that the biases\
    \ and\ninitial weights of the neural networks are determined randomly. If an appropriate\
    \ weight set is ﬁxed\ninitially, one could obtain superior results for similar\
    \ settings. This assertion could be endorsed by the\nfact that the gradient descent\
    \ may not generally ensure a near-ideal weight set towards the end of the\nneural\
    \ network training process.\nAccording to the results obtained inTable 6, the\
    \ performance of MLP with four hidden layers\nis high compared to the performance\
    \ of the Neural Network and the MLP with three hidden layer\napproaches used in\
    \ some of the existing literature. Therefore, the proposed model assesses the\
    \ given\nagriculture land and provides better results for sustainable agriculture\
    \ development compared to other\napproaches. This model provides a reliable decision\
    \ on the suitability level of the agriculture land in\nfour diﬀerent categories,\
    \ helping agriculturists to assess their land appropriately. Thus, this proposed\n\
    model could be used as a recommendation model for land suitability to improve\
    \ the crop production\nfor sustainable agriculture development.\n7. Conclusions\n\
    Since agriculture is the backbone of any country, it is necessary to ensure its\
    \ sustainable growth\nover the years. This work has presented a model that would\
    \ be as accurate as 99%, which would be the\nmost desirable. The data collected\
    \ through various sensors, handled here with MLP with four hidden\nlayers, has\
    \ ensured better eﬃciency. A proper advisory system with precise instructions\
    \ would always\ndeliver better results. Thus, the accuracy score to precision\
    \ score presented depicts the eﬃciency of this\nproposed approach, which will\
    \ ensure appropriate classiﬁcation. Multiclass classiﬁcation in agriculture\n\
    would further ﬁne-tune the recommendation system to guide farmers appropriately.\
    \ Rather than\nbinary classiﬁcation, this one would guide the farmers’ precisely.\
    \ Thus, this approach would provide\nreal-time data to ensure better crop yield\
    \ productivity.\nAuthor Contributions: This research speciﬁes below the individual\

  title: Sensors Driven AI-Based Agriculture Recommendation Model for Assessing Land
    Suitability
  verbatim_quote1: '"This proposed system will help the farmers to assess the agriculture
    land for cultivation in terms of four decision classes, namely more suitable,
    suitable, moderately suitable, and unsuitable. This assessment is determined based
    on the input collected from the various sensor devices, which are used for training
    the system. The results obtained using MLP with four hidden layers is found to
    be eﬀective for the multiclass classiﬁcation system when compared to the other

    have been developed to address the challenges of the agriculture sector, including
    systems for data collection, monitoring, control, and automation.


    One of the key components of IoT-enabled smart agriculture is the data collection
    and transmission system. This system consists of a network of sensors and devices
    that collect data on various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity,
    and crop health. The collected data is then transmitted to a central platform
    for processing and analysis.


    The IoT-enabled smart agriculture system also includes a monitoring component
    that allows farmers to remotely monitor the conditions of their fields and crops.
    This component provides real-time data on the health and growth of crops, allowing
    farmers to make timely interventions and adjustments to their management practices.


    In addition, the IoT-enabled smart agriculture system may include a control component
    that enables farmers to remotely control various aspects of their farming operations.
    This component allows farmers to automate tasks such as irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control, leading to increased efficiency and reduced labor costs.


    The use of IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems has several benefits, including
    improved crop yields, reduced costs, increased efficiency, and more sustainable
    farming practices. To further enhance the capabilities and benefits of IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture, future research directions include the development of advanced
    sensing technologies, improved data analytics algorithms, and the integration
    of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.


    This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture, highlighting its benefits, challenges, and future research
    directions. The paper discusses various aspects of IoT-enabled smart agriculture,
    including the different types of sensors and devices used, the data collection
    and transmission systems employed, and the various applications of IoT in agriculture.
    The paper also examines the challenges associated with the adoption of IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture, such as concerns about data privacy, security, and cost. Finally,

    \ ecosystems\nby evaluating their architecture (IoT devices, communication technologies,\
    \ big data storage, and\nprocessing), their applications, and research timeline.\
    \ In addition, we discuss trends and opportunities\nof IoT applications for smart\
    \ agriculture and also indicate the open issues and challenges of IoT\napplication\
    \ in smart agriculture. We hope that the ﬁndings of this study will constitute\
    \ important\nguidelines in research and promotion of IoT solutions aiming to improve\
    \ the productivity and quality\nof the agriculture sector as well as facilitating\
    \ the transition towards a future sustainable environment\nwith an agroecological\

    1. Introduction\nIn order to meet the current global needs of humanity, new solutions\
    \ and technologies\nare constantly being proposed and implemented. This has led\
    \ to the advent of the Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) [1,2]. IoT is deﬁned as the\
    \ network of all objects that are embedded\nwithin devices, sensors, machines,\
    \ software and people through the Internet environment\nto communicate, exchange\
    \ information and interact in order to provide a comprehen-\nsive solution between\
    \ the real world and the virtual world [3]. In recent years, IoT has\nbeen applied\
    \ in a series of domains, such as smart homes [4,5], smart cities [6,7], smart\n\
    energy [8,9], autonomous vehicles [10,11], smart agriculture [12–15], campus manage-\n\
    ment [16,17], healthcare [18,19], and logistics [20,21]. Series of other IoT applications\
    \ have\nbeen described by Shaﬁque et al. [22]. An illustration of rich and diverse\
    \ IoT applications\nfor smart agriculture is provided in Figure 1.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396. https://doi.org/10.3390/app12073396\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n2 of 19\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing\
    \ agricultural production, new solutions and \ntechnologies have been introduced\
    \ in the agriculture sector [24]. An emerging trend is the \napplication of the\
    \ IoT and big data. A significant number of studies have been focused on \nresearch,\
    \ experiments, and applications [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over\
    \ 500 \nbillion IoT devices will be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The\
    \ use of IoT and big \ndata will enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance\
    \ efficiency and productivity \n[28]. \n \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications\
    \ for smart agriculture. \nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have\
    \ been strongly applied in the \nagricultural sector, building the foundation\
    \ for developing smart agriculture [29]. The \nunique characteristics of WSN,\
    \ such as the ability to self-organize, self-configure, self-es-\ntablish, and\
    \ self-recover, make it suitable for smart agriculture [30]. The sensor device\
    \ \nconsists of a radio frequency (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and\
    \ battery power \n[31]. The WSN focuses on applications such as environmental\
    \ monitoring, machine con-\ntrol automation, and traceability [32–35]. \nAlong\
    \ with the development of science and technology, the urgent requirement for \n\
    breakthrough solutions and technologies aiming at improving productivity and efficiency\
    \ \nin the agriculture sector has led to adoption of the IoT. The primary motivation\
    \ for their \napplications is the breakthrough progress of smart agriculture and\
    \ its inevitable role as \nthe future of smart and sustainable environment management.\
    \ IoT integrates a series of \nexisting solutions and technologies, such as WSN,\
    \ cognitive radio, ad hoc networks, cloud \ncomputing, and end-user applications\
    \ [36]. In the smart agricultural sector, automation \nsolutions and technologies,\
    \ mechanical machines, knowledge, decision-making tools, ser-\nvices, and software\
    \ are integrated seamlessly to help farmers improve productivity, prod-\nuct quality,\
    \ and profitability [37]. \nFigure 1. An illustration of IoT applications for\
    \ smart agriculture.\nAccording to the United Nations’ (UN 2019) statistics, the\
    \ world population is esti-\nmated to grow to 10 billion by 2050 [23]. As a consequence,\
    \ the requirements of agricultural\nproducts are continually increasing. However,\
    \ farmlands are declining, natural resources\nare increasingly depleted, and the\
    \ rise of unpredictable nature challenges, such as global\nwarming, salinization,\
    \ and ﬂooding, make food security the most concerning problem for\nall nations\
    \ worldwide.\nIn recent years, with the aim of increasing agricultural production,\
    \ new solutions and\ntechnologies have been introduced in the agriculture sector\
    \ [24]. An emerging trend is the\napplication of the IoT and big data. A signiﬁcant\
    \ number of studies have been focused on\nresearch, experiments, and applications\
    \ [25,26]. According to the Cisco forecast, over 500\nbillion IoT devices will\
    \ be connected to the Internet by 2030 [27]. The use of IoT and big data\nwill\
    \ enable smart agriculture and is expected to enhance efﬁciency and productivity\
    \ [28].\nOver the years, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been strongly applied\
    \ in the agri-\ncultural sector, building the foundation for developing smart\
    \ agriculture [29]. The unique\ncharacteristics of WSN, such as the ability to\

    \ for smart agriculture [30]. The sensor device consists of a\nradio frequency\
    \ (RF) transceiver, sensor, microcontroller, and battery power [31]. The WSN\n\
    focuses on applications such as environmental monitoring, machine control automation,\n\
    and traceability [32–35].\nAlong with the development of science and technology,\
    \ the urgent requirement for\nbreakthrough solutions and technologies aiming at\

    \ survey of IoT applications for smart agriculture is\nconducted. An analysis\
    \ of 135 relevant works published between 2017 and 2022 was con-\nducted. Firstly,\

    \ such as\n(1) location sensor, (2) optical sensor, (3) mechanical sensor, (4)\
    \ electrochemical sensor, and\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n5 of 19\n(5) air ﬂow\

    soil temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, leaf moisture, precipitation, wind\
    \ speed, wind\ndirection, and solar radiation, and barometric pressure [21,24,36].\n\
    2.2. Communication Technology\nThe survey of communication technologies for IoT\
    \ [43,44] indicated that to integrate\nIoT into the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ communication technologies must progressively\nimprove the evolution of IoT\
    \ devices. They play an important role in the development of\nIoT systems. The\
    \ existing communication solutions can be classiﬁed as: protocol, spectrum,\n\
    and topology.\nProtocols: many wireless communication protocols have been proposed\
    \ for the smart\nagriculture sector. Based on these protocols, devices in a smart\
    \ agricultural system can\ninteract, exchange information, and make decisions\
    \ to monitor and control farming condi-\ntions and improve yields and production\
    \ efﬁciency. The typical, low-power communication\nprotocol numbers commonly used\
    \ in smart agriculture can be divided into short-range and\nlong-range categories\
    \ based on the communication range.\n-\nShort-range: NFMI (near-ﬁeld magnetic\
    \ induction) [45], Bluetooth [46], ZigBee [47],\nterahertz (Z-Wave) [48,49], and\
    \ RFID [50].\n-\nLong-range: LoRa [51], Sigfox [52], and NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT)\
    \ [53].\nTable 1 presents some typical communication technologies for the smart\
    \ agriculture\nsector. The values in Table 1 indicate that short-range communication\
    \ technologies have\na transmission distance of less than 20 (m), high energy\
    \ efﬁciency, and low data rate.\nThese protocols are often employed in sensor\
    \ networks, while long-range communication\ntechnologies have transmission distances\
    \ of up to several tens of kilometres, consume more\nenergy, and are installed\
    \ for backhaul device-to-device communications. A diverse survey\nof low-power\
    \ communication technologies for IoT that presents solutions, challenges, and\n\
    some open issues is described by Sundaram et al. [54].\nTable 1. Some typical\

    Spectrum: Each radio device uses certain frequency bands for communication. The\n\
    FCC (Federal Communications Commission) has deﬁned unlicensed spectrum bands for\n\
    unlicensed operations in scientiﬁc, industrial, and medical purposes [55]. These\
    \ spectrum\nbands are often applied for low-power levels and short-range applications.\
    \ Consequently, a\nseries of common technologies for the smart agriculture sector,\
    \ from wireless machine con-\ntrol and UAVs to communication technologies such\
    \ as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, use unlicensed\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n6 of 19\n\
    spectrum bands [56]. However, the use of unlicensed spectra faces several challenges,\
    \ such\nas the quality of service guarantee, the cost of setting up the initial\
    \ infrastructure, and the\ninterference generated by the huge number of IoT devices\
    \ [57,58].\nA licensed spectrum usually is allocated to mobile networks. It provides\
    \ more efﬁcient\nnetwork trafﬁc, more reliability, enhances the quality of service\
    \ (QoS), offers security,\nprovides extensive coverage, and involves lower initialization\
    \ infrastructure costs for users.\nHowever, the use of licensed spectrum bands\
    \ has faced some limitations, such as high data\ntransmission costs and the low\
    \ energy efﬁciency of IoT devices [59].\nSeveral recent studies have demonstrated\
    \ the efﬁciency of unlicensed spectrum bands\nin the mm wave range. It uses extremely\
    \ low power but provides large transmission\ndistances and high data rates [60,61].\
    \ One limitation of the mm wave spectrum is that the\ndata rate is strongly affected\
    \ by weather conditions, especially rain [62].\nTopology: The establishment of\
    \ the communication spectrum band and operation pro-\ntocol of IoT devices depends\
    \ on the structure that deploys IoT devices for smart agriculture\napplications.\
    \ Network structures for smart agriculture usually have two main types of\nnodes:\
    \ sensor and backhaul nodes [63]. The common characteristics of IoT sensor nodes\n\
    are short communication distance, low data rate, and high energy efﬁciency. In\
    \ contrast,\nIoT backhaul nodes often require large transmission distances, high\
    \ throughput, and data\nrates. Therefore, based on the role of each IoT network\
    \ node, the sensor node or backhaul\nnode selects and installs appropriate communication\
    \ technologies [64]. Figure 5 presents a\ntypical low-power network topology designed\
    \ for measuring and monitoring factors in a\nsmart farm. The system includes:\n\
    (1)\nIoT sensor nodes collect information from the farming environment, such as\
    \ soil\nmoisture, air humidity, temperature, nutrient ingredients of soil, pest\
    \ images, and\nwater quality, then transmit collected data to IoT backhaul devices.\
    \ Depending on\nthe operation purpose and installation location, IoT sensor nodes\
    \ can be installed as\nRFDs (reduced-function devices), which only communicate\
    \ with FFDs (full-function\ndevices). These nodes cannot communicate with the\
    \ other RFDs, aiming to save\nenergy and decrease investment costs.\n(2)\nIoT\
    \ backhaul nodes, besides having the role of an IoT sensor node, also play a role\
    \ as\nintermediate nodes to receive information from other IoT nodes and transmit\
    \ it to the\ncontrol centre. IoT backhaul nodes are often installed as an FFD\
    \ device, which can\nconnect to other FDD and RFD devices.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12,\

    \ besides the main problems of sensing, collecting\ndata, and controlling devices\
    \ to respond to the real farming environment, data storage and\nprocessing are\
    \ also important problems and face some challenges [26,28]. In reality, the\n\
    number of collected data is huge, and traditional data storage, organization,\
    \ and processing\nsolutions are not feasible. Therefore, big data processing solutions\
    \ need to be researched\nand applied for smart agriculture [65,66].\nThe complexity\
    \ of data storage and processing is due to the unique characteristics\nof the\
    \ smart agriculture ﬁeld, including unstructured data and various formats, such\n\
    as text, images, audio and video, economic ﬁgures, and market information. Recent\n\
    solutions and technologies have introduced the use of cloud platforms for storage\
    \ and\ndata analytics, which are collected from farms [36,67]. In addition, cloud-assisted\
    \ big data\nanalytic solutions, such as edge computing [68] or fog computing [69],\
    \ are also proposed to\nreduce latency and costs and support QoS.\nThe survey\
    \ results demonstrate that, in recent years, many management information\nsystems\
    \ for smart agriculture have been proposed [70–72]. Nowadays, possible solutions\n\
    have been developed and commercialized, providing solutions and services for farmers\n\
    to manage farms and ﬁelds, aiming to increase productivity, reduce human labour,\
    \ and\nenhance farming efﬁciency, as follows:\n-\nOnFarm [73]: It is part of the\

    \ and increasing sales of products.\n3. Typical Applications of IoT in Smart Agriculture\n\
    In recent years, a series of IoT applications for agriculture have been introduced.\n\
    According to survey results, we divided these applications into categories based\
    \ on their\npurpose, including monitoring, tracking and traceability, and greenhouse\
    \ production. The\ndetailed results are presented in the following subsection.\n\
    3.1. Monitoring\nIn the agriculture sector, factors affecting the farming and\
    \ production process can be\nmonitored and collected, such as soil moisture, air\
    \ humidity, temperature, pH level, etc.\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n8 of 19\n\
    These factors depend on the considered agricultural sector. Some smart agricultural\
    \ sectors\nare applying the following monitoring solutions:\nCrop Farming: In\
    \ this sector, some vital factors that affect the farming process and\nproduction\
    \ efﬁciency include air temperature, precipitation, air humidity, soil moisture,\n\
    salinity, solar radiation, pest status, soil nutrient ingredients, etc. In [81],\
    \ the authors\ndesigned an IoT device called FarmFox. This device allows real-time\
    \ collection and analysis\nof the composition of the farming soil and transmits\
    \ the information to farmers/owners\nvia the Internet. The results demonstrate\
    \ the health of the soil is monitored in real time to\nprovide timely recommendations\
    \ to farmers aiming to increase productivity and farming\nefﬁciency.\nFurthermore,\
    \ in [82], the authors proposed an IoT device to allow intelligent control\nof\
    \ temperature and humidity factors, called a weather radar. This device will automatically\n\
    turn on the warning mode using the light signal and send messages to the farmer\
    \ when the\ntemperature or humidity exceeds a pre-installed threshold. In [83],\
    \ the authors introduced\nan IoT system based on Web GIS to monitor pest status\
    \ and provide early warnings. In\naddition, this study also proposes a predictive\
    \ model based on monitoring the habitat of\npests and diseases. The efﬁciency\
    \ of the proposed system was indicated, based on the\npredicted ﬁgures of the\
    \ locust epidemic, to have a high accuracy rate (over 87%) in 2019\n(China).\n\
    Monitoring information, such as soil condition, moisture, and temperature, and\
    \ the\nprediction of natural factors, such as rainfall and weather, support the\
    \ control of growing\nconditions of crops, helping farmers plan and make irrigation\
    \ decisions to optimize pro-\nduction and reduce labour costs. In addition, the\
    \ collected data, combined with big data\nprocessing technology, can provide recommendations\
    \ for implementing preventive and\nremedial solutions against pests and diseases\
    \ in farming.\nAquaponics: It is an integration of aquaculture and hydroponics.\
    \ Aquaponics is a\nfarming technique where ﬁsh waste becomes a source of nutrients\
    \ needed by plants. One of\nthe most important issues in such farms is constantly\
    \ monitoring water quality, water level,\ntemperature, salinity, pH, sunlight,\
    \ etc. [84]. According to this research direction, in [85],\nthe authors designed\
    \ an IoT system to monitor the temperature and pH value of water for\naquaponics\
    \ farms. Moreover, this system is also equipped with a control system of water\n\
    metrics to keep the ﬁsh habitat stable and an automatic ﬁsh feeding function to\
    \ increase\nthe productivity of the ﬁsh. The results show that the IoT system\
    \ had stable operation and\nprovided real-time monitoring parameters. The authors\
    \ of [86] designed an aquaponics\nfarm for households/urban areas based on IoT.\
    \ This system recommends the proper ratio\nof ﬁsh and plants.\nConsequently, the\
    \ system decreases feed consumption as well as reduces carbon\nemissions into\
    \ the environment. The primary purpose of this proposal aims to balance the\n\
    self-sustaining ability of the aquaponics system. The experimental results demonstrate\
    \ the\nnumber of ﬁsh decreases from 30 to 15, and the number of plants increases\
    \ from 20 to 30,\nbut the crop production will increase by more than 50%. A detailed\
    \ and diverse survey of\nthe IoT systems and devices for control and monitoring\
    \ of aquaponics farms is introduced\nin [87]. Based on the obtained data, monitoring\
    \ can improve the production of ﬁsh and\nplants through the control, supplementation,\
    \ and regulation of nutritional ingredients in\nthe water. The collected data\
    \ were also used to automate the management of aquaponics\nfarms to reduce labour\
    \ costs.\nForestry: Humans depend on forests for survival. Moreover, forests play\
    \ a vital\nrole in the carbon cycle and provide a habitat for more than two-thirds\
    \ of animal species\nin the world. Forests also have the effect of protecting\
    \ watersheds, limiting ﬂoods, and\nmitigating climate change. The main factors\
    \ that need to be monitored in a forest include\nsoil ingredients, air temperature,\
    \ humidity, and concentration of several different gases,\nsuch as oxygen, methane,\
    \ ammonia, and hydrogen sulphide. A series of forest control\nsystems and solutions\
    \ are presented in [88,89] based on IoT and big data analytics.\nAppl. Sci. 2022,\
    \ 12, 3396\n9 of 19\nIn [90], the authors designed a peatland forest environmental\
    \ monitoring system.\nThis forest area plays a very vital role in the rainforest\
    \ ecosystem of Brunei. However,\nthe peatland forest type is very burnt. This\
    \ work designed an IoT system to monitor\nenvironmental conditions, such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, wind direction, barometric\npressure, and manage possible disasters.\
    \ For the purpose of enhancing feasibility, IoT\ndevices use the solar-powered\
    \ system and communicate with the monitoring centre based\non the LoRa network.\
    \ In [91], the authors proposed a solution to control forest changes\nand vitality\
    \ by using high-resolution RapidEye satellite imagery. This solution has been\n\
    deployed commercially in several states in Germany and has detected leaf diseases\
    \ in a\npine forest affected by pests. Survey results indicate that monitoring\
    \ in forestry focuses on\nproviding early warning systems against forest ﬁres,\
    \ pest control, or deforestation.\nLivestock Farming: It is deﬁned as the process\
    \ of raising domesticated animals, such as\ncows, pigs, sheep, and goats, chickens,\
    \ etc., in an agricultural environment to obtain traction,\nserve production,\
    \ and obtain products such as meat, eggs, milk, fur, leather, etc. In this\narea,\
    \ the factors to be monitored depend on the type and number of farming animals\
    \ [92].\nIn [93], the authors designed a support system for the diagnosis, prevention,\
    \ and treatment\nof diseases for livestock called VetLink. This system can provide\
    \ recommendations for\nanimal health for farmers in rural areas where it is difﬁcult\
    \ to access veterinary doctors\nimmediately. In [94], the authors proposed a noncontact\
    \ temperature measurement system\nand monitoring of animals to ensure early detection\
    \ of diseases and animal health. This\nsystem can be used for remote monitoring\
    \ of animal health and timely anomaly detection.\nIn [95], the authors introduced\
    \ a monitoring system for large-scale pig farms based on IoT.\nThe speciﬁc solution\
    \ is to attach an IC tag on each pig to monitor the behaviour of each pig,\nsuch\
    \ as their period of feeding and resting and exercise. Data from sensors are collected\n\
    and combined with data analytics solutions that can make recommendations for pig\
    \ health.\nThe monitoring data of water, feed, and animal health for livestock\
    \ in the farming\nprocess helps farmers set up livestock plans, reduce labour\
    \ costs, and enhance production\nefﬁciency. While a series of solutions has been\
    \ provided for monitoring large-scale farms,\ntheir application in small and medium-sized\
    \ farms is very limited, especially in developing\ncountries. This can be attributed\
    \ to the high cost and the lack of knowledge needed to\nset up, manage, and operate\
    \ IoT systems. Therefore, effective and low-cost solutions for\nagricultural IoT\
    \ have much potential.\n3.2. Tracking and Tracing\nIn order to meet the needs\
    \ of consumers and increase proﬁt value, in the future, farms\nneed to demonstrate\
    \ that products offered to the market are clean products and can be\ntracked and\
    \ traced conveniently, thereby enhancing the trust of consumers in product\nsafety\
    \ and health-related issues. In order to solve this problem, a series of tracking-\
    \ and\ntracing-based problems for the smart agricultural sector has been proposed,\
    \ speciﬁcally as\nfollows:\nIn [96], the authors designed an information system\
    \ that allows tracking and tracing\nof agricultural products and foods such as\
    \ dairy and vegetables, called SISTABENE. This\nsystem helps suppliers track the\
    \ production process and errors arising in the supply chain,\nand helps end-users\
    \ trace the origin of food. In [97], the authors proposed a food supply\nchain\
    \ traceability system based on blockchain technology. It helps to track and trace\
    \ agri-\nfood supply chains’ production process and trace the origin of agricultural\
    \ products. This\nsolution has been employed at Shanwei Lvfengyuan Modern Agricultural\
    \ Development\nCo., Ltd. (Shanwei, China). Although there are still limitations,\
    \ the results demonstrate\nthat this solution has successfully supported the tracing\
    \ of food and agricultural prod-\nucts through QR codes, improving product quality\
    \ and ensuring the clear traceability of\nproducts. In [98,99], the authors proposed\
    \ smart agricultural solutions to tracking and\ntracing agricultural products,\
    \ thereby allowing consumers to know the product’s entire\nhistory. These solutions\
    \ enable tracking and tracing some of the data collected along the\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n10 of 19\nsupply chain, ensuring that consumers and other stakeholders\
    \ can identify products’ origin,\nlocation, and history.\n3.3. Smart Precision\
    \ Farming\nThe advent of the GPS (global positioning system) has created breakthrough\
    \ advances\nin many ﬁelds of science and technology. The GPS provides the most\
    \ important parameters\nfor locating a device, such as location and time. GPS\
    \ systems have been successfully\ndeployed in many ﬁelds, such as smartphones,\
    \ vehicles, and IoT ecosystems. However,\nGPS is only good support for outdoor\
    \ systems and the sky. Meanwhile, the demand\nfor the locating and navigating\
    \ systems in the home and on the streets of smart cities is\ngrowing rapidly.\
    \ Aiming to solve this problem, an advanced global navigation satellite\nsystem\
    \ (GNSS) is being deployed [100]. Based on GPS and GNSS systems, suitable farming\n\
    maps have been established for ﬁelds and farms. As a result, agricultural machinery\
    \ and\nequipment can be operated autonomously [101]. Figure 6 presents an illustration\
    \ of the\ntypical cloud-assisted, IoT-based precision agriculture platform.\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n11 of 20 \n \ntheir machines, allowing\
    \ machines to operate autonomously and remotely via the Internet \n[107]. \n \n\
    Figure 6. Cloud-assisted IoT-based precision agriculture platform. \n3.4. Greenhouse\
    \ Production \nA greenhouse consists of walls and a roof, which are usually made\
    \ from transparent \nmaterials, such as plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants\
    \ are grown in a controlled envi-\nronment, including controlling for moisture,\
    \ nutrient ingredients of the soil, light, tem-\nperature, etc. Consequently,\
    \ greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans to grow \nany plant, at any\
    \ time, by providing suitable environmental conditions [108]. Figure 7 \nillustrates\
    \ a smart agriculture IoT system for monitoring greenhouse farming factors \n\
    based on IoT ecosystems. \nIn [109], the authors introduced an IoT-based greenhouse\
    \ environmental monitoring \nsystem for multipoint monitoring in large greenhouses.\
    \ Instead of using multiple sensors \nat different locations, this solution involves\
    \ a drive system that allows the sensor system \ndiff\nl\ni\ni\nh\nh\nTh\ni\n\

    In smart precision farming, one of the most important applications is the use\
    \ of drones\nin monitoring and farming activities. Some common farming tasks using\
    \ UAVs include\nspraying pesticides, fertilizing, sowing seeds, evaluating and\
    \ mapping, and monitoring\ncrop growth. In [102], the authors presented a detailed\
    \ survey of drone applications for\nsmart agriculture, including applications,\
    \ control technology, and future trends of the UAV\napplication for smart agriculture.\
    \ In [103], the authors designed an automatic agricultural\nproduct classiﬁcation\
    \ system based on camera systems, image processing algorithms, and\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n11 of 19\nmechanical actuators. The experimental results for\
    \ agriculture products such as oranges\nand tomatoes present a classiﬁcation success\
    \ rate of over 95%, and the sorting time for each\nproduct is less than 1(s).\
    \ This solution can be adapted and applied to the classiﬁcation of\ndifferent\
    \ agricultural products. In [104], the authors proposed a solution to estimate\
    \ grape\nproduction. The proposed solution combines an RGB-D camera mounted on\
    \ a mobile robot\nplatform and size estimation algorithm for a bunch of grapes.\
    \ The experimental results\npresent an average error in the range of [2.8–3.5]\
    \ (cm). The results demonstrate this solution\nis a feasible method for evaluating\
    \ the productivity of large-scale grape farms.\nThe survey results show that smart\
    \ precision agricultural equipment, such as irriga-\ntion systems, unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicles (UAV), and smart agricultural equipment, etc.,\nare conﬁgurable in\
    \ an autonomous-control mode based on certain conditions or can be\ncontrolled\
    \ remotely by the farmer via the Internet [105,106]. Smart precision farming helps\n\
    to improve productivity and production efﬁciency and is suitable for large-scale\
    \ farms.\nNowadays, suppliers of precision agricultural equipment have IoT modules\
    \ built into their\nmachines, allowing machines to operate autonomously and remotely\
    \ via the Internet [107].\n3.4. Greenhouse Production\nA greenhouse consists of\
    \ walls and a roof, which are usually made from transparent\nmaterials, such as\
    \ plastic or glass. In a greenhouse, plants are grown in a controlled\nenvironment,\
    \ including controlling for moisture, nutrient ingredients of the soil, light,\n\
    temperature, etc. Consequently, greenhouse technology makes it possible for humans\
    \ to\ngrow any plant, at any time, by providing suitable environmental conditions\

    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some \nchallenges. We have\
    \ present two main problems: economic efficiency and technical prob-\nlems. We\
    \ consider these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration\
    \ of IoT \ntechnologies in agriculture. \nFigure 7. An illustration of IoT application\

    \ an IoT-based greenhouse environmental monitoring\nsystem for multipoint monitoring\
    \ in large greenhouses. Instead of using multiple sensors\nat different locations,\
    \ this solution involves a drive system that allows the sensor system\nto move\
    \ to different locations in the greenhouse. The experimental results show that\
    \ the\nproposed system can effectively monitor multiple points in large greenhouses.\
    \ In [110], the\nAppl. Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n12 of 19\nauthors introduced an energy-saving\
    \ temperature control technology for smart greenhouses.\nThis study proposed two\
    \ intelligent control methods: active disturbance rejection control\nand fuzzy\
    \ active disturbance rejection control. The experimental results demonstrate\n\
    that the proposed technology saves over 15% of the total energy consumption of\
    \ the\ngreenhouse. In [111], the authors designed an intelligent IoT system to\
    \ monitor and\ncontrol greenhouse temperature for energy efﬁciency and improve\
    \ crop productivity. The\nexperimental results for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\
    \ where daytime temperatures can be\nabove 50 ◦C, demonstrate the efﬁciency of\
    \ the proposed solution, including saving energy\nand predicting the rate of plant\
    \ growth.\nRecent studies indicated that solutions integrating IoT, big data processing,\
    \ and artiﬁ-\ncial intelligence could be applied in greenhouses to reduce labour\

    \ the greenhouse farms and the cus-\ntomer [112–115].\n4. Challenges and Open\
    \ Research Directions\nThe survey results indicate that IoT components for the\
    \ smart agriculture sector,\nincluding hardware and software, have been focused\
    \ on research and achieved many\nbreakthrough results. Several IoT solutions have\
    \ been deployed on large-scale farms/ﬁelds.\nHowever, the widespread deployment\
    \ of IoT in the agricultural sector still presents some\nchallenges. We have present\
    \ two main problems: economic efﬁciency and technical prob-\nlems. We consider\
    \ these issues coupled with policies that will drive the integration of IoT\n\
    technologies in agriculture.\n4.1. Economic Efﬁciency\nIn agricultural economics,\
    \ one of the most important characteristics is a low rate of\nproﬁt of an investment\
    \ project, which presents many risks from natural conditions. The\nbeneﬁt–cost\
    \ of a new technology seeking deployment in agriculture should be carefully\n\
    calculated to ensure a trade-off between the cost of technology implementation\
    \ and the\nproﬁt potential. Therefore, we discuss the economic aspects related\
    \ to IoT implementation\nin smart agriculture.\nThere are several types of costs\
    \ related to the implementation of IoT in agriculture.\nWe divided them into categories,\
    \ including (1) the system initialization cost and (2) the\nsystem operating cost.\
    \ The system initialization cost includes hardware purchases (IoT\ndevices, gateways,\
    \ base station infrastructure). The system operating cost includes service\nregistration\
    \ cost and the cost of labour to manage IoT devices. Furthermore, additional op-\n\
    erating costs include incurred costs from energy consumption, maintenance, data\
    \ exchange\namong IoT devices, gateways and cloud servers. According to the opinion\
    \ of Turgut and\nBoloni [116], the successful deployment of the IoT technologies\
    \ will only happen if the\ncustomer beneﬁts (customers need to know the beneﬁts\
    \ and potential) that IoT systems\nprovide exceed their physical value and privacy\
    \ costs. The businesses participating in the\nIoT domain will proﬁt and achieve\
    \ success. We can describe this process using these two\nconditions, as follows:\n\
    Success o f IoT Applications=\n\x1A Vservice > Cpri + Cuser\nh\n+ Cpay, Farmer\
    \ Bene f its\n(1)\nVin f o + Rpay > Cbusiness\nh\n, Businesses Bene f its\n(2)\n\
    where\nVservice is the expected value received by the IoT service users.\nCpri\
    \ is the cost of the loss of privacy.\nCuser\nh\nis the equipment and hardware\
    \ costs the user pays.\nCpay is the payment for the service fee.\nVin f o is the\
    \ received information value.\nRpay is the received direct payment.\nCbusiness\n\
    h\nis the share of the hardware and maintenance costs of the business.\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2022, 12, 3396\n13 of 19\nAccording to the opinion of the service user\
    \ (farmers or the owner of the farm),\nEquation (1) shows that the perceived value\
    \ of the service for the user (Vservice) must be\nhigher than the total of costs,\
    \ including: the cost of the loss of privacy (Cpri), the equipment\nand hardware\
    \ costs the user pays (Cuser\nh\n), and the payments for the service fee (Cpay),\
    \ while\nthe opinion of the service provider, as shown in Equation (2), shows\
    \ that the received\ninformation value (Vin f o) and the received direct payments\
    \ (Rpay) must be higher than the\nshare of the hardware and maintenance costs\
    \ of the business (Cbusiness\nh\n).\nThere is still a gap between service providers\
    \ and service users (farmers or the owner\nof the farm), leading to the slow deployment\
    \ of IoT applications in smart agriculture. In\nterms of the economic aspect,\
    \ the analyzed results show that the need for a support policy\nfrom regulatory\
    \ agencies and governments to allow service providers and service users\nto use\
    \ IoT-based smart agriculture applications in their infancy can be met. As discussed\n\
    in [117], to promote smart agriculture, the European Union has issued supportive\
    \ economic\npolicies, the so-called the European CAP (Common Agricultural Policy),\
    \ whose annual\nbudget amounts to approximately EUR 59 billion and is paid for\
    \ by the nations of the EU.\nIn our view, to be able to apply IoT in the ﬁeld\
    \ of smart agriculture, service costs\n(Cpay) and the operating and system initialization\
    \ cost of IoT (Cuser\nh\n) needs to constantly be\nimproved and optimized to reduce\
    \ the cost of the IoT services for farmers. In addition, IoT\nbusinesses (service\
    \ providers) also need to maximize the value of information obtained\n(Vin f o)\
    \ to improve the proﬁtability of the service providers.\nIn reality, service providers\
    \ may commercially exploit the information received (Vin f o)\nin the period of\
    \ providing services for farms, aiming to encourage the deployment of\nIoT applications\
    \ in smart agriculture. Nowadays, several IoT platform providers allow\nfree registration\
    \ and use of services with some limitation conditions regarding services’\nfunctionality\
    \ and ability processing; the number of connected IoT devices; and the number\n\
    of data stored while premium functions and services charge users a fee.\nIn addition,\
    \ one of the signiﬁcant factors slowing down IoT adoption in agriculture\nis farmers’\
    \ knowledge and ability to use IoT devices. In developed countries, this issue\n\
    can be easily solved due to the accessibility of new technologies of farmers.\
    \ Otherwise, in\ndeveloping countries, where the majority of farmers in rural\
    \ areas have very limited access\nto advanced technologies, this issue is a signiﬁcant\
    \ challenge [118,119].\n4.2. Technical Problems\nInterference: Deploying a huge\
    \ number of IoT devices for smart agriculture can\ncause interference to different\
    \ network systems, especially some IoT networks using short\nspectrum bands such\
    \ as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, and LoRa (See Table 1). Interference can\ndegrade\
    \ system performance as well as reduce the reliability of IoT ecosystems. IoT\n\
    networks that use cognitive technology to reuse unlicensed spectra increase the\
    \ cost of the\ndevice. In our opinion, the advent of the 6G network [120] will\
    \ allow a huge number of\ndevices to connect to the Internet with an extremely\
    \ high access speed and extremely large\nbandwidth. The full interference problem\
    \ of IoT networks will be solved.\nSecurity and Privacy: One of the most important\
    \ problems of applying IoT in smart\nagriculture is the security problem, including\
    \ the protection of data and systems from\nattacks on the Internet. In regard\
    \ to system security, IoT devices’ limited capacity and\nability led to complex\
    \ encryption algorithms that are impossible to implement on IoT\ndevices. As a\
    \ result, IoT systems can be attacked using the Internet to gain system control\n\
    rights; IoT gateways are also attacked via denial of service [121–123]. In addition,\
    \ cloud\nservers can be attacked by data spooﬁng to perform unauthorized tasks\
    \ that affect the\nautonomous farming processes of farms. Cloud infrastructures\
    \ can also be controlled by\nattackers [124,125]. Several issues of detailed IoT\
    \ data privacy and security measures have\nbeen discussed in [126–128]. According\
    \ to Neshenko et al., the IoT data security issue is one\nof the biggest problems\
    \ slowing down IoT adoption in smart agriculture [129].\nRegarding data security,\
    \ the obtained information from IoT systems in farms is col-\nlected, processed,\
    \ and commercially exploited by service providers to varying degrees.\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2022, 12, 3396\n14 of 19\nTherefore, one of the most important problems of policies\
    \ regards the validity and legal\nstatus of farm data [130]. In reality, these\
    \ data are of great value when aggregated and\nanalyzed for large-scale agricultural\
    \ activities. Consequently, without policies, the data\nprivacy and security of\
    \ farms can affect the competitive advantage of farmers/farm owners.\nIn our opinion,\
    \ using cryptography coupled with access keys is a possible solution to\nsolve\
    \ this problem. Keys could be made available based on a regional user group and\n\
    to those who contributed to the database. For further complex cases, secure multiparty\n\
    computation can be used, where the homomorphic encryption method [131,132], or\
    \ this\nmethod combined with the blockchain [133], can be applied for the purpose\
    \ of balancing\nprivacy and data utility.\nIn our opinion, the security problems\
    \ of IoT systems will be an exciting research topic\nand garner attention for\
    \ both academia and industry research. An in-depth survey of\nthreats and solutions\
    \ to improve robustness, trust, and privacy for future IoT systems is\npresented\
    \ in [134].\nReliability: Most IoT devices are expected to be deployed outdoors\
    \ (in ﬁelds and\nfarms). Harsh work environments lead to the rapid degradation\
    \ of IoT devices’ quality and\ncan lead to unexpected manufacturer failures. The\
    \ mechanical safety of IoT devices and\nsystems must be ensured so they can withstand\
    \ extremes of weather, such as temperature,\nhumidity, rainstorms, and ﬂoods [135].\
    \ In our opinion, new materials and technologies\nneed to continue to be studied\
    \ to improve the durability of devices.\nThe open problems and challenges discussed\
    \ in this section indicate that for IoT\nto be widely deployed in the smart agriculture\
    \ sector, there are still many issues to be\nsolved. Service providers need to\
    \ reduce the service costs, more effectively exploiting\nthe information collected\
    \ from the farm. On the other hand, farmers need to improve\ntheir skills to be\
    \ able to apply IoT solutions on their farm to enhance productivity and\nfarming\
    \ efﬁciency. Researchers need to continually study and propose optimal solutions\n\
    and technologies to ensure IoT systems’ privacy and security and improve the durability\
    \ of\nIoT devices. These are really major challenges and exciting research topics\
    \ in the future so\nIoT can be widely applied in the smart agriculture sector.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nIn this study, we presented an overview of IoT and big data for\
    \ the smart agriculture\nsector. Several issues related to promoting IoT deployment\
    \ in the agriculture sector have\nbeen discussed in detail. Survey results indicate\
    \ that many studies have been performed\nto apply IoT for smart agriculture, aiming\
    \ to enhance productivity, reduce human labour,\nand improve production efﬁciency.\
    \ The beneﬁts of applying IoT and big data in agriculture\nwere discussed. In\
    \ addition, we also pointed out the challenges we need to overcome\nto be able\
    \ to accelerate the deployment of IoT in smart agriculture. However, there are\n\
    still some challenges that need to be addressed for IoT solutions to be affordable\
    \ for the\nmajority of farmers, including small- and medium-scale farm owners.\
    \ In addition, security\ntechnologies need to be continuously improved, but in\
    \ our opinion, the application of\nIoT solutions for smart agriculture is inevitable\
    \ and will enhance productivity, provide\nclean and green foods, support food\
    \ traceability, reduce human labour, and improve\nproduction efﬁciency. On the\
    \ other hand, this survey also points out some interesting\nresearch directions\
    \ for security and communication technologies for IoT. We think that\nthese will\
    \ be very exciting research directions in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Explore all metrics Abstract Due to recent advancements and the success of versatile
    mobile applications, more and more services around the globe are being moved to
    the cloud. As a result, its limitations have become more evident. The major issues
    that cloud-based applications face include large latency, bottlenecks because
    of central processing, compromised security, and lack of offline processing. The
    drawbacks of cloud computing are reduced by fog and edge computing, where data
    are processed near the places where it is generated—at network edges or fog nodes—most
    importantly in a distributed way. Smart agriculture is an approach based on the
    Internet of Things (IoT) where cloud computing is not an option as the internet
    is usually not available at remote sites. In addition, pure edge computing also
    is not practical, as most sensor nodes are very small and they do not have enough
    computing power. Intermediate fog computing also is not a good choice, as fixed
    fog nodes (getaway nodes) do not work well with high node fluctuation caused by
    bad weather or harsh conditions. Considering these issues and limitations, we
    have proposed the idea of flying edge computing where an unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) acts as an edge-computing machine. This can be an ideal solution for smart
    agriculture, given the size and remoteness of many agricultural areas. This technique
    can be called “wind or breeze computing” because the data are “blown” or moved
    by the current of computing. The Flying-Edge offers fast deployment of edge facilities
    in challenging locations and it can be a major step to accomplish the goal of
    IoT-based smart agriculture. Similar content being viewed by others Enabling Edge

    The agriculture sector faces continuous pressure to feed the population of over
    9 billion that is expected by 2050 amid challenges like climate change and the
    limited availability of arable land. To address this situation, scientists and
    researchers have suggested augmenting this sector with modern technologies including
    the Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [1]. For example,
    IoTs provide updates about crop health, which helps farmers make the right decision
    at the right time. Precision agriculture is all about collecting the right data
    at the right time so that the use of resources can be optimized by considering
    the requirements of every inch of farmland. To make agriculture sustainable using
    the IoT has moved to the forefront of various agricultural operations. Moreover,
    UAVs are being used for various purposes in agriculture like monitoring, aerial
    sensing, tracking, data collection, communication, and security. UAVs, more precisely
    called flying-robots, are used in a wide range of applications where they often
    act as the first responder because of their fast, cost-effective, and safe deployment
    capabilities [2,3,4]. Further, with improved technology and facilities like three-dimensional
    maneuverability, UAVs are playing the crucial role of airborne base stations in
    almost all emerging networks. Because of their involvement in a wide range of
    daily applications, UAVs have become the best candidates to achieve the goal of
    precision farming [5]. Due to these capabilities, UAVs can be used throughout
    the life cycle of crops in such functions as soil health inspections [6], plantation
    [7], plant counting [8], crop health monitoring [9] [10], irrigation, spraying
    fertilizers and pesticides [11], and estimating crop yield. This technology has
    become the point of interest for all the stakeholders related to agriculture—including
    farmers, agronomists, crop insurers, and researchers—because of its suitability
    and advanced functionalities. These include the variety of models, longer flight
    times, greater payload capacities, and the ability to fly in varying conditions.
    In this article UAVs are proposed as an option to overcome the wide range of challenges
    from remote agriculture: They need to cover large geographical areas. A wide range
    of sensors and other devices are needed to monitor various parameters in this
    highly heterogeneous environment. They need to operate in remote locations, where
    sensors operate unattended. Connecting the sensors is a challenge because of unreliable
    and fluctuating communications. Some parameters must report in real-time. Many
    parameters require scalable data storage and processing capabilities. In this
    article, UAVs provide communication and data collection service to IoT nodes.
    Once data are collected, the next question is where to process it and what computation
    model is best suitable to provide the required services to the IoT nodes. For
    instance, cloud services can be used to access information from predictive analysis
    institutes so farmers apply products according to their specific requirements.
    However, for critical IoT-based agriculture applications to operate in such challenging
    areas, they need a reliable communication medium between the deployed objects
    and processing devices, which cannot be guaranteed in large and remote areas.
    Under these circumstances, cloud computing is not a good option because the internet
    may not be available in wide agriculture fields [12]. Furthermore, so-called fog
    computing also does not fit well since fog nodes are difficult to fix in harsh
    environments where node fluctuations are often. Most importantly, when we talk
    about specific applications in agriculture, edge computing may suffer from the
    fact that most nodes are very small, and they might not have sufficient processing
    capabilities. The need for scalability, economy, and node updates can generate
    more challenges. In short, in large farming areas where no reliable communication
    network is available to connect a large number of sensors to provide timely data,
    it is difficult to use existing fog and edge computing platforms. Considering
    the challenge, this paper presents the idea of a Flying-Edge, a UAV-based computing
    platform that aims to fulfill the requirements of smart agriculture. Flying Edge
    platforms, which can comprise one or multiple UAVs, offer the computing capabilities
    of IoT applications operating in remote locations. The proposed platform is highly
    dynamic and flexible, so it can be deployed and can collect data quickly. Most
    importantly, it can be used in tough terrains like the desert and hilly areas,
    removing the barriers to smart agriculture in such locations. The proposed edge
    platform builds an IoT network to collect crop data that will then be used to
    analyze crop health so, ultimately, the farmer can take timely smart actions.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 includes a short background
    of mobile edge computing. Section 3 provides the details of the proposed platform
    along with all the design and functionalities it can perform. Section 4 evaluates
    the proposed idea and compares the results of different parameters while, Section
    5 presents concluding remarks and thoughts for future study. 2 Related work Using
    mobile edge computing is not new. Various authors have proposed mobile systems
    that offer computing facilities. Prominent efforts include mobile fog computing
    [13] [14], mobile cloud computing [15], and mobile edge computing [16]. However,
    these platforms work differently from the proposed idea of flying edge computing.
    The system proposed in [13] offers mobile edge services from a fixed machine.
    It enables integrating mobile devices such as smartphones and vehicles to the
    cloud, but only from a certain geographical area. The important thing about that
    work is that it offers low-latency with the facility of mobility and location
    awareness. Further, [15] [17] proposes mobile cloud computing that offers an infrastructure
    where both data storage and data processing occur in the cloud to support mobile
    devices. In that approach, mobile cloud computing frees mobile devices from storing
    large data and conducting heavy processing. In [13], mobile edge computing extends
    cloud computing capabilities at the edge of the cellular network. Different services
    with low latency can be provided to smartphones and other applications that rely
    on cellular communications. Using UAVs in smart agriculture also is not new. These
    flying robots are used in many ways. Authors in [18] present a hierarchical structure
    based on the collaboration between the UAVs and associated wireless sensors for
    crop monitoring in precision agriculture. That integration of UAVs with ground
    sensors and IoT applications proved to be a robust and efficient solution for
    data collection, control, analysis, and decisions in such specialized applications.
    Key advantages lay in online data collection and relaying the data to a central
    monitoring point, while effectively managing network load and latency through
    optimized UAV trajectories and in situ data processing. Two important aspects
    of the collaboration were considered: designing the UAV trajectories for efficient
    data collection and implementing effective data processing algorithms (consensus
    and symbolic aggregate approximation) at the network level to transmit the relevant
    data. Considering the worth of Information and Communications Technology (ICT)
    for smart agriculture, researchers have begun to use edge computing to enhance
    crop production. In a similar effort in [19], the authors proposed a data link
    management solution based on mobile edge computing (MEC) to monitor water requirements
    for agriculture. The results showed that the scheme realizes the network and intelligence
    of agricultural water monitoring system management, and it has a broad market
    prospect. Edge computing plays an important role in smart agriculture, and it
    can be considered an ideal paradigm because of features like its ability to operate
    in remote locations, cover large areas, endure hostile conditions, provide sufficient
    bandwidth, and address connectivity issues. Collecting data at the right time
    and then performing the right steps for a given situation is possible only by
    using edge computing. So, it is crucial for agriculture. Edge computing can be
    the appropriate choice whenever there are connectivity issues. According to the
    proposal in [20], sensors and edge devices collect data from the monitoring area
    and send the data to an edge node. The node conducts a preprocess analysis of
    the data needed then sends the outcome to a server. The server collects and accumulates
    the results to predict and estimate the total harvest yield. By using this framework
    many decisions can be taken according to circumstances. Authors in [21] focus
    on an efficient solution for collecting data and exploiting tasks using edge computing
    for smart agriculture, global food security, and the pervasive issue of internet
    access. Further, [22] presents a platform that can manage the minerals for agriculture
    using saline water. It relies on transferable low-cost hardware which operates
    with edge computing to interact with crop sensors and devices to collect the data
    and perform atomic control actions in real-time monitoring scenarios. In all these
    studies, various features and services are provided to mobile devices to integrate
    with the cloud. However, they rely on fixed locations, such as stationary fog
    machines, fixed wireless stations, or fixed cellular towers. By contrast, Flying
    Edge offers these facilities from a mobile device instead of using only stationary
    devices. 3 Proposed flying edge computing The traditional model has been to use
    cloud computing to acquire and process data from the edge to offer useful services.
    Large cloud data centers provide different services (computing, platform, security,
    and storage) to edge devices through high bandwidth connectivity. Two key challenges
    emerge with this hub-and-spoke model. Public cloud data centers are globally distributed,
    but they are typically limited to one or a few per country (depending on its size).
    The network distance from the edge to the cloud can result in a long round trip
    time (RTT) in the order of thousands of milliseconds. For latency-sensitive cloud
    applications, this may compromise their performance. To overcome this, fog, mist,
    and edge computing have been introduced as extensions of cloud networks, which
    are collections of servers comprising a distributed network. Cloud, fog, and mist
    computing are also known as wet computing in the literature. The difference between
    them is the degree of distribution of services from the internet cloud to edge
    devices. We are introducing a new concept called Flying Edge computing (FEC).
    In contrast to previous forms of computing, we name it “dry” computing because
    data are blown along and dried by with the current of the computing wind. The
    speed and direction of the wind also matter. The faster the speed, the more the
    throughput. At slower speeds, a network is more tightly squeezed to collect the
    data. 3.1 Data evaporation UAV activates ground sensor nodes and provides them
    local computation, database, and communications infrastructure services. In contrast
    to typical fixed-edge computing machines installed near or inside the edge node,
    the UAV acts like a flying edge that moves between edge nodes to provide them
    the desired local and global services. Typical cloud, fog, and mist computing
    are called wet computing, but for Flying Edge we name it dry, wind, or breeze
    computing where data are evaporated from the sensor node to the air and collected
    by a UAV. UAV generates a computing wind in its vicinity, and data are evaporated
    (extracted from sensors) with the current of computing (movement of UAV). The
    speed of the UAV is taken as the current of computing wind, while several UAVs
    act like wind temperature. The more the UAVs, the faster the evaporation process
    (more throughput). Fast-moving UAVs produce shorter clusters with fewer sensor
    nodes, so slowing the computing wind ensures that the sensor nodes are squeezed
    well. We have taken agriculture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) as a case
    study. Crops are mostly grown in circular farms to save water. Our contribution
    is to modernize the KSA agriculture with state-of-the-art technologies to monitor
    crop health so resources can be managed tightly, especially the maximal use of
    water. We map flying edge computing with the perspective of KSA agriculture. Hundreds
    of crop fields are dispersed in a very large and remote area where there is no
    fixed communications infrastructure. It is assumed that all fields are equipped
    with a large number of sensors that monitor crops, soil, and environmental parameters
    at the same time. However, predefined network topologies (cluster heads, communication
    routes) are not possible because of the high fluctuation of sensor nodes caused
    by harsh water. In this scenario, cloud computing does not fit well as IoT devices
    do not have cloud access. In this presentation, a flying edge machine (UAV) moves
    in a predefined path. As it blows the computing wind, the underlying sensors form
    a cluster in the direction of the wind, and they choose a Cluster Head (CH) dynamically.
    As a result, the data are evaporated from CH to UAV, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig.

    of computing techniques Full size image As mentioned above, the Flying Edge is
    a UAV-based platform that acts as an edge node. Most importantly, the acting edge
    node can be reallocated to different locations where various sensors or devices
    need some edge node to complete certain IoT tasks. Moreover, it can provide the
    facility of a gateway to link or integrate IoT services and cloud computing. The
    Flying Edge can be equipped with resources like processors, storage facilities,
    communication devices, and an edge computational platform. This edge platform
    can execute several services to support IoT applications required for smart agriculture.
    One possible configuration for flying edge computing is shown in Fig. 3. In that
    figure, a UAV with edge computing facilities can move in any area where IoT services
    are required. It provides a set of services like low latency to the IoT applications
    in that area while it enables the integration of the IoT applications and the
    cloud. Fig. 3 Flying Edge supporting the smart agriculture Full size image The
    Flying Edge can facilitate smart agriculture based on IoT applications. Major
    opportunities that it can provide are: Fast deployment: because of its nature,
    the Flying Edge can be deployed at remote locations to facilitate IoT services.
    It is a turnkey system that can be used even where there is no communications
    infrastructure. Scalability: the system can be upgraded or enhanced in terms of
    coverage area, number of sensing devices, number of UAVs operated, and services
    provided. Flexibility: the system is flexible enough to adapt to any change in
    applications, required services, or the geography of the monitoring area. Location
    awareness: location services are provided by the flying edge machine, so IoT nodes
    do not require a GPS device. Power effectiveness: this scheme is very power efficient
    for end nodes (IoT nodes), as most of the services that require computation are
    provided by flying edge robots (UAVs). Because the Flying Edge can be deployed
    in an area where IoT devices are already deployed, most of the communication between
    these IoT devices and UAV is done through a personal area network (PAN) such as
    IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) and 801.15.1 (Bluetooth). Both protocols are characterized
    by lower bandwidths and shorter communication ranges. However, they also need
    low energy during the communication phase. Depending on the requirements, communication
    can be done through alternative protocols that support longer ranges like a local
    area network (LAN) such as IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi). On the other hand, all the communication
    between the Flying Edge and the cloud is done through protocols that are commonly
    used for wide area networks (WANs) including IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX) and cellular.
    The choice of communications medium and protocol depends on the nature of the
    application and its location. 3.3 Proposed system architecture The proposed system
    has two components: an edge device and the Flying Edge computing machine, as shown
    in Fig. 4. The edge device (sensor or actuator) can get services from a UAV through
    a services request interface. Most of the computational services required by the
    IoT are provided by the local service response module, which is connected to several
    services built into the flying machine. In rare cases, the IoTs might require
    global services from the cloud, and they will be granted through a global services
    response module. Fig. 4 Flying Edge computing architecture Full size image 3.4
    Proposed system models Mobile devices and Internet-of-things (IoT) have been introduced
    in our lives very rapidly. They have brought ease to our work, but they also raised
    new challenges that needed cloud-based solutions including i) the need to transfer
    huge amounts of data to the cloud, ii) high communication latencies, and iii)
    the inability of this model to respond in some domains that require a rapid reaction
    to events. Different computing techniques like cloud, fog, and mist/edge computing
    have been introduced to address these issues and provide three basic services
    to the IoT devices: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), “Platform as a Service
    (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). The basic difference between these techniques
    is the layer in the network hierarchy from which the service is provided. This
    means the distance between the services and the source of data, as shown in Fig.
    5. In cloud computing, all the services are provided from the cloud (a central
    location) while fog computing is a distributed computing technique in which services
    are provided in network fabrics. In edge or mist computing, processing and services
    are provided near the end node (the source of data). Fig. 5 Typical cloud-to-edge
    computing hierarchy Full size image A typical computing hierarchy is shown in
    Fig. 5. As far as WSN is involved, many factors (lack of a communication link,
    limited processing capabilities, insufficient power) may restrict the use of any
    kind of computing technique. In such conditions, a UAV can replace any of the
    computing layers. In this article, we introduce four basic types of UAV replacement:
    1- UAV as a flying cloud 2- UAV as a flying fog 3- UAV as a flying edge 4- A swarm
    of UAVs as a distributed services provider 3.4.1 UAV as a flying cloud This configuration
    is applicable in a scenario where all the ground sensing nodes can communicate
    with each other but do not have access to the outer world (no internet). This
    type of scenario is applicable in battlefields, disaster areas, wildlife habitats,
    and remote farm fields. As all sensors are connected with each other, they maintain
    their local network in terms of clusters and routes independently. Local decisions
    are made either at the edge or the fog layer. Global services (data collection,
    localization, security, or software) and decisions are provided by the UAV as
    a Flying Cloud Machine (FCM) on a demand basis (see Fig. 6). Fig. 6 UAV a Flying
    cloud machine Full size image 3.4.2 UAV as a flying fog In this configuration,
    field sensors are equipped with local services (network and storage) through edge
    nodes. The UAV provides only communication services as a flying fog machine (FFM)
    to approach the cloud layer where all global services exist. FFM provides a bridge
    between the edge layer and the cloud layer, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 Flying
    fog computing Full size image 3.4.3 UAV as a flying edge In this scheme, UAV provides
    computation and services to the IoT nodes by visiting them, and it provides services
    and computation close to the data source. It helps to improve latency and bandwidth,
    and it also enhances the network life by improving battery utilization of end
    nodes. All the sensors’ nodes are dump nodes. Their functionality is limited to
    sense and log parameters from the environment only. All the services (clustering,
    network, storage) and computation are provided to them by a UAV. If the UAV cannot
    fulfill a demanded service, it can render it from the cloud. A flying edge machine
    (FEM) is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 Flying edge computing Full size image 3.4.4 UAV
    as a distributed flying edge machine A coordinated swarm of UAVs can provide edge
    services as shown in Fig. 9. Different services like network, storage, and localization
    are provided by separate UAVs. Hence each service will be provide by a specialized
    flying machine which will enhance the provided quality of service, throughput,
    and data collection. Swarm of UAVs can also work in a coordinated way such that
    they can share or take over the responsibilities if any one fails, distracted
    or power exhausted. This model will provide robust solutions in hardship conditions.
    Fig. 9 Distributed flying edge computing machine Full size image 4 Simulation
    and results A Flying Edge prototype was implemented using a distributed Java agent
    environment. This environment provides a middleware infrastructure that enables
    the implementation of different distributed programming models and advanced platform
    services for distributed heterogeneous environments. These heterogeneous environments
    may comprise multiple heterogeneous nodes with different capabilities. In addition,
    this middleware infrastructure provides scalability solutions to deploy, operate,
    monitor, and control large-scale distributed applications. Each agent in the environment
    can provide runtime support to securely execute some code. An edge machine provides
    broker services, invocation services, and location-based services. There is also
    a mechanism that allows each edge broker to forward a service search request to
    other brokers if it does not have the requested service. Both local and remote
    service invocations also are implemented and added to the prototype implementation.
    For the IoT side, we used the Arduino board, which is open-source hardware for
    embedded systems. For this prototype implementation, the Arduino was used as the
    IoT payload subsystem—the onboard device requesting services. Some sensors were
    connected to the Arduino board, such as the DHT11 sensor to measure temperature
    and humidity. Some LEDs and a buzz were installed to represent actuators. In addition,
    we installed an Adafruit CC3000 Wi-Fi board to connect the Arduino to a local
    area network and the Flying Edge machine. The Arduino code was developed using
    the Arduino IDE with the Adafruit CC3000 library. Each IoT service was implemented
    with a RESTful API. At the UAV edge computing side, there is a service that represents
    each sensor or actuator attached to the Arduino. The primary function of these
    services is to map a call from the SOAP APIs to RESTful APIs. All sensor and actuator
    services are registered with the local broker. In addition, the global broker
    is periodically updated with these services. For the experiments, we used three
    computers, which represented the cloud, the Flying Edge machine, and the IoT node.
    In addition, we used WAN emulators among these machines to introduce the effects
    of using long distances and/or the internet to connect the machines. Experiments
    were conducted for four configurations: Call1: a local IoT service call responded
    by the distributed flying edge machine Call2: a local IoT service call responded
    by the flying edge machine Call3: a remote IoT service call responded by the cloud
    through a flying fog machine Call4: a remote IoT service call responded by the
    flying cloud The experiment was repeated for two types of services. The first
    was to get the current temperature (CurTemp) and the second was to turn on the
    LED (LEDon). The average results of 10 runs of multiple service calls are shown
    in Fig. 10. The recorded times for these calls do not include the service lookup
    times. The response times for all service calls are shown in Fig. 10. It is evident
    that flying edge shows best results in term of response time by adding the benefits
    of battery efficiency of end nodes. It is also analyzed that the services provided
    by flying fog machine or through flying fog machine gives same results and are
    better than cloud. Fig. 10 IoT service call response time Full size image The
    average service lookup times for three services are shown in Fig. 11. Local services
    were provided by the local network. Remote 1 services were provided by the flying
    machine UAV to the end node. Remote 2 services were provided by the cloud through
    flying machines. There is a big difference between Remote 1 and Remote 2 service
    lookup times. This means that flying computing machines (UAVs) can provide services
    to IoT devices in a much faster way. Fig. 11 IoT service lookup Full size image
    5 Conclusion In this research article, we proposed a new concept of a computation
    mechanism for IoT devices. The processing and the services will be provided to
    the end devices neither from central location (cloud) nor by end device itself.
    Both cloud and edge computing have different pros and cons ranging from bottlenecks
    to poor resource utilization. The proposed system fulfills the service demand
    very close to the point of data generation without using additional network resources
    (energy, memory, or processor). Our aim is to provide these services to the IoTs
    by using the Flying Edge machine. This means the computational machine itself
    goes closer to the data-generation node and provides the demanded services. The
    architecture of the proposed Flying Edge machine is introduced, and the performance
    of the system is evaluated through simulation and lab test bed. The results showed
    the effectiveness of the proposed computational mechanism. As a result, we can
    say this system is very suitable for implementation in the case study presented
    (agriculture) but it is not limited to that use. References Friha O, Ferrag MA,

    rights and content Abstract In recent years, some official reports, to produce
    best products regarding quality, quantity and economic conditions, recommend that
    the farming sector should benefit with new tools and techniques coming from Information
    and Communications Technology (ICT) realm. In this way, during last decade the
    deployment of sensing devices has increased considerably in the field of agriculture.
    This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates
    activities such as field monitoring, which offer support to make decisions or
    perform actions, such as irrigation or fertilization. Apart from sensing devices,
    which use the Internet protocol to transfer data (Internet of Things), there are
    the so-called crop models, which are able to provide added value over the data
    provided by the sensors, with the aim of providing recommendations to farmers
    in decision-making and thus, increase the quality and quantity of their production.
    In this scenario, the current work uses a low-cost sensorized platform, capable
    of monitoring meteorological phenomena following the Internet of Things paradigm,
    with the goal to apply an alert disease model on the cultivation of the vine.
    The edge computing paradigm is used to achieve this objective; also our work follows
    some advances from GIScience to increase interoperability. An example of this
    platform has been deployed in a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of
    Vilafamés (Castelló, Spain). Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    Organization (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion people
    by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 [1]. To keep pace, food production must
    increase 70% by 2050. There are some obstacles to increase food production and
    produce such amount of food. Some of them are climate change; restricted availability
    of arable land; reduced productivity growth; water necessity; the impact of urbanization
    over agricultural labour; high price and low availability of energy, mainly from
    fossil fuels; among many others. Moreover, the average age of farmers is increasing
    because young people prefer going into the industry [2]. A report from the Intergovernmental
    Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [3] enumerates all effects of climate change on
    agriculture. They are: 1) changes in extreme weather with severe flooding and
    acute water shortages areas will increase around the globe; 2) Since agriculture
    consumes 70% of the world''s fresh water supply, water management should be an
    adequate and controlled process. To mitigate these challenges, the FAO [4] recommends
    that all farming sectors should be equipped with new tools and techniques coming
    from the Information and Communications Technology (ICT). During the last decade,
    a new movement to implant digital technology on agriculture was born, which is
    known as precision agriculture [5]. It aims to optimize the yield per unit of
    farming land by using ICT tools and technologies [6]. The objective of precision
    agriculture is to achieve the best products concerning quality, quantity and economic
    conditions. Traditionally, precision agriculture makes use of sensors to monitor
    environmental conditions. To attain this objective, networks of these sensors
    are created to cover larger areas. Precision agriculture is not only attached
    to deploying on-site sensors but involving many areas related to robotics, computer
    science, and remote sensing. An example of this is the use of smartphones, which
    have been used to visualize on the field the data provided by sensors and offer
    the possibility to apply different strategies to improve productivity [7]. The
    works presented in [8], [9] exploit the use of advances in neural networks for
    weed detection and plant species identification with the purpose of optimizing
    the herbicide application. Finally, the review introduced in [10] showed the improvements
    of the spatial resolution in aerial and satellite imagery for precision agriculture
    since the late 80s, which now allows fine-grained analysis at the expense of high
    data storage and computational resources. In the last decade, a new approach to
    connect everything (sensors or actuators), as well as to monitor and act [11]
    using the Internet, was implanted in every aspect of our daily lives; this process
    has come to be called the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT describes how in the real
    world, physical things are integrated into the digital world of bits and bytes
    [12]. In general, it involves the integration of each object, such as a sensor
    or device that is connected via wired or wireless networks using the Internet.
    To connect things, the Internet Protocol (IP) is used, in which each device has
    an IP address. The IoT devices need a mechanism to communicate with the cloud
    side, which is called Machine to Machine (M2M) communications. M2M will work with
    new developments and contributes to the future of Internet [13]. Nowadays, the
    future of the Internet will not only consist of connecting people but also to
    the approach of a digital world where, ideally, everything will be connected.
    Every day farmers are producing large amounts of data that are published on the
    cloud, with the aim of delivering benefits concerning data access, synchronization
    storage and to apply some analysis, the so-called Cloud Computing (CC), to make
    decisions. New trends that appeared after CC move the computation towards the
    smart devices; the benefit is to distribute the computing between different things.
    This paradigm is called Edge Computing (EC) [14]. The connection between the IoT
    and M2M with precision agriculture have produced a new concept called “smart agriculture”
    following other M2M based implementations such as smart cities. One of the realms
    in which more great adaptation of such technologies has been incorporated is the
    viticulture. Viticulture has historically been characterized by obtaining a high-quality
    product. This has been made possible by many factors: the selection of suitable
    soil and climatic zones, the varietal vineyards and the work of the winegrowers
    in managing their vineyards. Many threats can affect quantity and quality of the
    wine. Concretely, there are some well-known plagues attacking vineyards, and they
    produce substantial losses. The vine is exposed to different types of diseases
    or harmful agents; these are classified into four types [15]. The first category,
    physiological damage or disorders in the vine that are not caused by pest and
    diseases, are generated by lack or excess of irrigation, extreme conditions due
    to meteorological factors, natural ageing, deficiencies or excesses of nutrients
    in the vine, lousy soil, irrigation with saline water, among many others. The
    second category, fungus, they can even grow in both wet and dry regions. Some
    examples of this disease are powdery mildew, downy mildew, and bunch rot and they
    can even grow well in both wet and dry regions. The third category, vine pests,
    and insects, the most damaging are those that feed on grapes, examples of them
    are: Tetranychus urticae, Meloidogyne, Heterodera, Ditylenchus, Lobesia botrana,
    Colomerus viti, Eriophyes vitis or Phylloxera vastatrix, among others. Finally,
    the last category is vine diseases generated by viruses and bacteria, like grapevine
    degeneration, grapevine decline, leafroll complex or rugose wood complex. All
    these diseases impoverish the quality of the grape, and as a result, they might
    cause severe economic losses to farmers and people related to the wine industry.
    Downy mildew is probably the most studied disease, as it produces critical economic
    losses in vineyards and, consequently, in wineries1 . Within this context, this
    paper introduces the SEnviro platform for vineyards, which integrates the downy
    mildew model [16] for detecting the most suitable moment to treat the downy mildew
    disease. In summary, the main contributions of this work are: 1. to apply a model
    to alert when would be the suitable moment to treat the downy mildew disease in
    the vineyard context; 2. to monitor vineyard fields through a new version of the
    SEnviro platform following the IoT paradigm and; 3. to follow the edge computing
    paradigm and to mitigate the communication between ends. The remainder of the
    paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the background of the IoT in
    edge computing, open hardware and smart agriculture. Section 3 presents the SEnviro
    Platform. Section 4 details the Goidanich model used to detect the suitable moment
    to apply treatment for the downy mildew disease. Section 5 shows the experimentation
    done to test the platform. Section 6 reviews the related work. The paper concludes
    in Section 7 with conclusions and future work. 2. Background This section is devoted
    to showing the background of the IoT, Edge Computing, and Open Hardware paradigms.
    Also, their relation with precision agriculture through GIS is detailed. 2.1.
    IoT in the edge Cisco''s report anticipates that 50 million smart objects will
    be connected to the Internet by 2020 [17]. This situation will cause “data tsunami”
    which refers to the use of the IP to achieve connectivity between these smart
    objects. This trend produces streams of potential information, which challenge
    today''s data analysis systems in a centralized server in the Cloud [18], [19],
    [20]. IoT movement has been successfully applied in healthcare [21], [22], [23],
    [24] (ambient-assisted living and telemedicine), smart home and smart metering
    [25], [26] (devices that enable the automation of common in-house activities),
    video surveillance [?] (intelligent video systems), automotive and smart mobility
    [27], [28] (intelligent transportation systems) and smart energy and smart grid
    (intelligent management of energy distribution and consumption) [29]. All these
    applications have boosted up the popularity of “smart things” connected to the
    Internet, and the networks created with them. In this way, the traditional WSNs
    have been updated to follow an IP protocol to apply all the benefits that it entails.
    The new paradigm, namely cloud computing, has been added to improve and provide
    more advantages over the IoT [30]. The low bandwidth lacks between the producer
    (smart objects) and consumer parts (cloud server) and the improved performance
    at both computing and consumer of smart objects, has led to a new paradigm called
    edge computing. The main feature of edge computing is that data can be processed
    locally in smart devices, rather than being sent to the cloud for being processed.
    The edge computing essentially means that instead of staying and working from
    a centralized cloud, edge nodes work at the ends of the networks. Edge computing
    puts some of the transactions and resources on the edge of the cloud; instead
    of establishing channels for storage and use in the cloud, it reduces the need
    for bandwidth by not sending every bit of information through channels to the
    cloud and instead adds it in specific access points. By using this type of distributed
    strategy, we can reduce costs and increase efficiency and reduce bandwidth consumption.
    Edge computing arose from the need to address three issues: 1) being able to act
    in real-time with the incoming data; 2) working within the limits of available
    bandwidth; and 3) distributing the computing between the nodes, to relive the
    centralized server. Edge computing address applications and services that do not
    fit the paradigm of the cloud, such as applications that require very low latency
    and being predictable; geospatial distributed applications; fast mobile applications;
    distributed control systems on a large scale. Fig. 1 details the work-flow for
    connecting sensor nodes to users using a cloud and edge computing infrastructure.
    On the one hand, this figure divides the physical and cyber worlds and the IoT
    part with traditional IT. The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) is used to pass
    the barrier between the IoT device cloud and the IT cloud [31]. It is responsible
    for the interworking between the GPRS network and Internet. On the other hand,
    the figure shows where the edge computing is located. The results offered by the
    edge computing can be sent to the cloud or directly to the clients without using
    any cloud infrastructure. Download : Download high-res image (165KB) Download

    and IT, that it is divided between the physical and cyber world. 2.2. Open-hardware
    to make smart objects Nowadays, the open movement has gained attention [32]. Traditionally,
    this idea was applied with more acceptance over source code and provoked the open-source
    movement. More recently, the same idea has been applied to the hardware (open-hardware).
    This situation has permitted to offer complete open systems, where both source
    and hardware are open. The users can contribute to improve the system and propose
    improvements. One of these improvements is the ability to offer more interoperability
    between components because they can be adapted for each usage. In this way, it
    reduces compatibility issues. This advantage can establish a standard IoT approach.
    In this work, we apply different Geographic Information Systems (GIS) standards
    to communicate with each IoT device; these standards will be explained in following
    paragraphs. Another advantage is the low cost of these devices compared with commercial
    solutions. As concluded by [33], open initiatives are cheaper, but they have also
    shown that open hardware is more powerful and has better performance than commercial
    solutions. Also, the same work demonstrates that the open hardware project can
    be considered reliable. Currently, there are several different alternatives regarding
    the micro-controller based platform, and the most remarkable platforms are Arduino2,
    Raspberry Pi3, BeagleBone4 or MSP430 Launchpad5 . All these platforms can be expanded
    easily, and used for other applications. Using these platforms different applications
    have been developed thanks to the acceptance of the IoT movement above described.
    2.3. GIS role in smart agriculture As commented in the Section 1, one way to address
    these issues and increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production
    is by using ICT to make farms more “intelligent” and more connected through the
    so-called “precision agriculture” also known as “smart agriculture”. Nowadays,
    there is a high quantity of proprietary IT solutions to help farmers manage their
    farms more effectively [34]. More advanced systems track geospatial zones, weather
    patterns and perform expert predictions [35]. These kinds of systems are called
    Farm Management Information Systems [36], and focus on specific tasks and use
    their specifications to implement the functionality provided. Currently, this
    field is slowly moving to use the Internet and is starting to use some of the
    networking solutions to improve what they offer to the end users. However, it
    is widely accepted that the Internet faces some shortcomings, especially in handling
    vast numbers of networked devices (IoT) or stakeholders. Moreover, there is still
    no standardized solution to enable cohesive and straightforward interoperability
    among services and stakeholders. To solve this issue, we look at GIScience. It
    can offer an excellent opportunity to standardize the ways of connecting different
    “things”, offering an interoperable connection; and it should help to deploy the
    new smart cities. GIScience can be defined as “the discipline that uses GIS as
    tools to understand the world” [37]. It can contribute by offering a crucial essential
    component for the IoT movement, which is interoperability using the use of standards.
    The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)6 is a non-profit international organization
    which develops open standards for the global geospatial community. OGC defines
    standards in a wide variety of domains including environment, defense, health,
    agriculture, meteorology, sustainable development, and smart cities. The OGC has
    standardized Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) as a set of specifications related to
    sensors, sensor data models, and sensor web services that will enable sensors
    to be accessible and controllable via the web [38]. It is composed of a set of
    standards; the most popular are: Observations and Measurements (O&M), SensorML,
    Sensor Observation Service (SOS), Transducer Model Language (TransducerML), Sensor
    Planning Service (SPS), Sensor Alert Service (SAS) or Web Notification Service
    (WNS). Another proposal is OGC SensorThings API7 . It is a new candidate standard
    that provides open access built on web protocols, based on the current SWE standard
    and following the architectural REST style. The aim is to provide a standardized
    a way to expose the IoT world to the real world, where things have limited resources.
    3. SEnviro platform This section presents the sensorized platform used in a smart
    agricultural context. As commented in the above sections, the platform Sense Our
    Environment (SEnviro) [39] follows the IoT and Web of Things (WoT) [40] paradigms
    by means of a low-cost, open-hardware and open-software, energetically efficient
    and autonomous and interoperable solution. The SEnviro platform uses the IP protocol
    to establish the connection. With these features, it can be considered that each
    SEnviro Thing is a smart object. A network is formed by joining several SEnviro
    Things. This platform makes use of standards when publishing data. It guarantees
    the interoperability of the services provided by the platform. Another important
    feature of this platform is that it is energetically efficient and autonomous
    through a battery cell, which is charged with the energy provided by a solar panel
    attached to it. To save as much energy as possible, we are using a sleep mode,
    in which during this period the micro-controller and connectivity module consume
    as little as possible. 3.1. How is SEnviro made of? At the hardware level, the
    sensorized platform has been designed to be a node acting as a smart object, which
    provides measures of environmental variables. Each SEnviro Thing is composed of
    different components, which are organized into four groups depending on their
    function: Core, Sensors, Power Supply and Communication. At the same time, the
    Core is formed by four parts: Micro-controller, Connectors, Clock, and Memory.
    For this work, we developed an enhanced SEnviro using the LinkIt One development
    board. The LinkIt ONE board is an open source, high performance, Arduino footprint
    board for prototyping IoT devices. The board is based around a powerful ARM7 EJ-S
    processor but has onboard GSM, GPRS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth BR/EDR/BLE, GPS, Audio codec,
    and SD card connector. Pin-out similar to Arduino boards, including Digital I/O,
    Analog I/O, PWM, I2C, SPI, UART and power supply, compatible with Grove 4-pin
    interface. In Section 5, we detail all components used to develop the SEnviro
    node for monitoring vineyards. 3.2. How does SEnviro work? At an operational level,
    SEnviro Thing can change its behaviour, updating the information about what sensor
    is active and the frequency at which measures are taken. The SEnviro Thing''s
    behaviour has two stages, initial and repetitive periodic. In the initial stage,
    a set of procedures are executed when it is initiated, for instance, one procedure
    could initialize the clock using the current time. The repetitive periodic stage
    defines the procedures that are repeated during the SEnviro Thing''s life cycle
    before going to sleep. Fig. 4 shows the design of the complete infrastructure
    with all of the system''s components, and describes each of them in different
    layers. If we analyze SEnviro from a GIS context and specify what is happening
    in each of its layers, we obtain Fig. 2, which we are going to detail below. In
    the content layer, there are different SEnviro Things to cover an area to measure
    the phenomena by the included sensors in each sensorized platform. In this figure,
    we can see the two functionalities mentioned above. Download : Download high-res
    image (253KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. General overview about
    the SEnviro work-flow following three layers architecture. As detailed in [39],
    different observations are periodically taken from the installed sensors to monitor
    the environment. When the SEnviro Thing takes a new observation, it invokes the
    Sensor Data Management (SDM) module. This component is implemented as a RESTful
    web service. The SDM module is responsible for publishing observations in different
    services that we want to offer, such as SensorThings API, SOS or others. Thus,
    it offers the same content using different interfaces; depending on the context
    it may be more or less appropriate. Different adapters for each of these services
    are offered. If we want to support new services/standards, we only need to add
    a new adapter for the service. We use the adapter software pattern to implement
    this feature. The service layer offers the services described above. One of the
    objectives of the SEnviro platform is to offer a standard service, to provide
    connectivity in an interoperable way. To meet this challenge, a candidate OGC
    standard, SensorThings API, has been used to offer an interoperable service to
    access the SEnviro platform. The most remarkable thing about this standard is
    that it breaks away from all “standard topics” [41] and offers access to restrictive
    devices, such as smartphones. Also, it offers the SOS interface to increase the
    interoperability, because this standard is widely used [42]. Finally, a lightweight
    RestFul service is created to connect this service in a more agile way [43]. The
    last layer, the application layer has been designed for different clients, mobile,
    web-based or desktop. The SEnviro Thing can adapt its behavior, updating the information
    about which sensor is active and the frequency at which measurements are taken.
    At regular intervals, the platform requests a new behavior to a server using a
    RestFul service. Then, the SEnviro Thing will get a new behavior following the
    new configuration received. The sensorized platform sends the taken observations
    to a server. A sensor collector service has been created to achieve this integration.
    Different operations are available to collect the observations measured. When
    one SEnviro Thing takes a new observation it invokes these operations to send
    data to the server using SDM module. When the SDM receives a new observation,
    it connects with the different adapters to send the data for each available service.
    To accomplish this objective, we have followed previous work [43], [39] to connect
    with different OGC instances, such as SOS and candidate standard SensorThings
    API. Also, we provide a lighter solution for data sensors access using RestFul
    interface used in [43]. To offer all these interfaces, we provide different adapters
    to publish the sensor data in different services or databases. To offer a SensorThings
    interface, we use an external server to test this API, which is offered by the
    SensorThings API candidate proposal. For SOS, the 52° North implementation (SOS
    version 2.0) is used. In this case, the server is deployed using an Apache Tomcat
    server and sensor data are stored in a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database8 following
    the documented standard installation guides. Finally, for the last interface,
    a Lightweight RestFul service is implemented using JAX-RS9, Jersey 10 and one
    MongoDB database11 is used to store the observations. 4. Goidanich model to detect
    downy mildew disease Downy mildew is a fungal disease caused by the plasmopara
    viticola oomycete. It is one of the worst diseases of vine cultivation under specific
    weather conditions. Downy mildew is the most studied disease, as it produces critical
    economic losses in vineyards and, consequently, in wineries [44]. Downy mildew
    is the result of the presence of a fungus in the green elements of the vines,
    and its life cycle is well established [44]. Its biological cycle is developed
    in four phases: contamination, incubation, and sporulation and propagation phase.
    • Contamination phase: in spring, the oospores reach maturity and germinate as
    zoospores. These may be transported by rain and wind, reaching the vine green
    parts and colonizing them. The needed conditions for contamination are: an air
    temperature around 10 °C, a young plant of at least 10 cm, and a rain rate of
    at least 10 mm/day. • Incubation phase: it takes from 4 to 21 days, depending
    on the temperatures and relative humidity. • Sporulation phase: during this step,
    the fungus is propagated along the vine. • Propagation phase: dissemination to
    nearby plants with the help of rebounding raindrops and wind. The optimal condition
    for ambient temperature is between 20 and 25 °C, with the help of rain during
    the night. There are some models with more complexity and better precision than
    Goldanich [45] such as MILVIT [46], [47]. Some other works simulate only a particular
    phase of the epidemic cycle [48], [49]. Moreover, some other works simulate only
    the first date of primary infection followed by the second cycle with quantitative
    outputs [50], [51]. More recently, new models are presented which use exploratory
    simulations based on newly available computing power [52]. Our work, unlike the
    ones found in the bibliography, is the pioneer in using devices of IoT for monitoring
    this kind of models. Although Goldanich''s model has been improved over time,
    it is an ideal candidate for testing our platform. As a future work, we intend
    to use other more complete models to improve the predictions of this type of disease.
    The Goidanich model is used to follow the evolution of the downy mildew fungus
    [16]. It takes into account three different phenomena: relative humidity, temperature,
    and rainfall. The model starts when a traditional method is reached, the “rule
    of the three ten”, which predicts that primary infections will occur once the
    average temperature has exceeded 10 degrees, the sprouting exceed 10 cm and on
    a day when there is at least 10 mm of rainfall. This rule, though simple, gives
    a rough idea of when to start looking for these primary infections. To follow
    the evolution of the fungus, it is necessary to know the average temperature (Tm),
    the average relative humidity (Hm) and daily rainfall. Goidanich presents a daily
    table (Table 1) in which, for each temperature, the daily growth of the fungus
    is set according to whether the Hm is high or low. The author defines each Tm
    in two columns, one when the Hm is lower than 75% and the other when it is higher
    than 75%, providing, therefore, two numerical values of daily development for
    each case. Table 1. Daily cumulative percentage of downy mildew incubation. Tm(C)

    records 10 or more mm of rain, starting from the next day, the estimation of the
    daily growth is recorded, and the model is calculated by adding every day until
    reaching the value of 100. At this moment, the theoretical incubation period ends,
    and the fungus contamination is evident due to the appearance of stains of oil
    and the asexual fruiting. The model works in that if the sum of the daily development
    accumulated is over 70%, the risk is high, so treatment is needed as soon as possible.
    If a fungicide product is applied, the development of the fungus restarts and
    remains in suspension for a certain number of days, or until the product has been
    washed away by rain. 5. Case study: SEnviro for agriculture This section details
    how we have developed the sensorized platform in a smart agricultural context.
    5.1. Building a SEnviro Thing for Smart Agriculture For this work, we have developed
    a new version of the sensorized platform presented in [39]. For the current case
    study, we only need three different phenomenon sensors, such as temperature, humidity
    sensor and rain gauge (Fig. 3). Also, for this case, the new sensorized platform
    uses a GPRS connection to offer easy installation and wireless connection in the
    field. The LinkIt One board offers an integrated GPRS module. Table 2 shows a
    general description. Fig. 3 shows a SEnviro Thing assembled with all components

    an energetically efficient and autonomous platform, we use a lithium battery of
    2200 mAh12 that supplies an output voltage of 3.7 V and is charged with the power
    generated with a 3W solar panel13 that supplies an output voltage of 5.2 V. Those
    two elements and the microcontroller are attached to a board (Lipo Rider V1.114)
    that handles the power ow between the various components. Finally, to protect
    all parts of the SEnviro Thing, two boxes have been used. A waterproof box15 to
    protect the Core, Communication and Power supply and a pagoda box to protect the
    sensors. 5.2. Applying Goidanich model This section describes the behavior that
    follows the developed SEnviro node for monitoring the downy mildew. The SEnviro
    has two different objectives: 1) to take and send observations at a defined rate,
    which by default is every ten minutes. 2) to calculate the Goidanich model, and
    if an alert state happens, the SEnviro node will send an alert via SMS. The Fig.
    4 shows these two functionalities as general overview following different layers.

    Fig. 4. On top) the figure gives information about the realization of the different
    components of the infrastructure and the sequence diagram of an exemplary usage
    to send SEnviro''s observations; on bottom) it gives a sequence diagram of an
    alarm. The first functionality was explained in [39], but in this work, some changes
    have been introduced. The first functionality has been the connectivity used.
    We have selected GPRS connectivity due to lack of other connectivity in the context
    in which it is experienced. The sensorized platform sends the observations to
    a server (Section 3). A sensor collector service has been created to achieve this
    integration. Different operations are available to collect the observations measured.
    When one SEnviro Thing catches a new observation, it invokes these operations
    and sends the data to the server using the SDM module. When the SDM receives a
    new observation, it connects with the different adapters to send the data for
    each service available. To accomplish this objective, we have followed our previous
    work [43], [39] to connect with different OGC instances, such as SOS and candidate
    standard SensorThings API. Also, we provide a lighter solution for data sensors
    access using RestFul interface used in [43]. To complete the SEnviro Thing integration,
    we proposed a SEnviro application to access sensor data provided by each SEnviro
    Thing. The SEnviro APP is a web-application in charge of integrating the sensor
    data provided by the installed SEnviro Things. Furthermore, the application is
    built using the mobile-first approach. In this way, it can be easily tested on
    a mobile device. The second functionality, which is of high importance for this
    work, is the possibility to apply the Goidanich model in each SEnviro node. We
    follow the fog computing paradigm to distribute the computation between the devices,
    in this case, SEnviro nodes. To calculate the Goidanich model, we need to know
    the temperature and humidity averages per day and the amount of rainfall accumulated.
    Each platform will have the capability to execute a method as depicted in Fig.
    5. The Pseudocode 1 shows how each SEnviro Thing can calculate the Goidanich model.

    : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download full-size image The first
    step is to accumulate the rain gauge. When it starts to rain, the algorithm will
    calculate the rain quantitative uninterruptedly while it is raining. The accumulative
    value will be reset when in one-day rainfall has been recorded. When the accumulative
    rainfall exceeds 10 mm, the SEnviro starts to calculate the temperature and humidity
    means. To offer these means, we will add up all of the observations taken in one
    day and divide them by the number of observations. These means will be used to
    determine the percentage of downy mildew incubation, and the selected value will
    be accumulated. When this value reaches 100, an alarm will be sent to the farmer
    to inform him/her about the downy mildew incubation level, and the specialized
    treatment can begin. We have selected SMS-based services as the way to connect
    with the farmers. It is due to the high penetration of mobile phones used by the
    stakeholders. Also, using SMS notifications, we can guarantee that the notification
    will arrive at the farmer. Other mobile technologies that use Internet connection
    do not guarantee the notification delivery, because the receiver needs permanent
    Inter-net connection. It involves farmers having a smartphone with an Internet
    connection data plan that will also receive the alarm. It is important to remark
    the potential of the developed SEnviro node. Although this subsection has described
    the behavior that it followed for a particular disease, its development could
    be modified to follow other models using the meteorological data collected by
    the node. Therefore, we consider that the SEnviro node could also be useful for
    detecting different diseases in vineyards or other crops. 5.3. Results In a first
    phase, the platform has been tested in a lab environment. It was working correctly
    without huge losses. The sensors obtained measurements between predictable values.
    The rain gauge has also been tested with rain recreation, and it was working correctly.
    These tests were carried out both indoors and outdoors. In a second phase, we
    have been deployed within a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafamés
    (Castelló, Spain). The parcel has a 23633.4 m2. Fig. 6 shows the location of each
    SEnviro Thing. A SEnviro node was deployed in this vineyard parcel during May
    2016 (Fig. 7), the month when downy mildew can begin to arise at the chosen location.
    As mentioned, this platform is capable of measuring three different phenomena
    which are temperature, humidity and the amount of rainfall that are all involved
    in the Goidanich''s model. During this month, observations were taken every 10
    minutes and were sent to the central server. Each platform can calculate the temperature
    and minimum humidity, in addition to calculating cumulative rainfall every day.

    the platform registered correct observations. During this period, the rain gauge
    did not reach 10mm to activate the alert, so our system does not detect downy
    mildew. During the 30 days that is was running almost all observations (96,9%
    successful deliveries) have been measured and sent in real-time although there
    were some that were undetected due to the loss of the signal in the area. These
    lost observations were sent in following deliveries. 6. A comparative between
    some similar works In the literature, some approaches are similar to our proposal.
    The following items describe the works that have been analyzed. All of them talk
    about IoT in the smart agriculture context, more concretely on monitoring vineyards.
    • In [53], the authors propose a WSN where each node takes images from the field
    and internally uses image processing techniques to detect any unusual status in
    the leaves. • The paper [54] presents a smart embedded system that will aid vineyards
    and which is cost-effective and flexible. They monitor ambient temperature and
    humidity and send an SMS with the values. • Authors in [55] do not describe a
    single platform, they show a variety of sensor network configurations and applications
    that can address different priorities in the vineyard. • Authors in [56] present
    the results from an operational sensor network. The network is based on the Berkeley
    mote (Mica II mote). The basic sensor board is equipped with a temperature sensor.
    The network consisted of sixty-five motes distributed in a grid-like pattern ten
    to twenty meters apart covering about two acres. • Authors in [57] present a general
    sensor network designed to connect agriculture to the IoT. A customized sensor
    node and developed the application for agriculture on top of TinyOS 2.x are detailed.
    A common access interface of the sensor networks for agricultural applications
    was created to enable further integration of the sensor networks on the IoT. •
    A sensor network built using TelosB platforms is presented in [58]. They show
    the experience of maturated during the design and deployment of a prototypal WSN-based
    system for monitoring the productive cycle of high-quality wine in a Sicilian
    winery. They propose two networks, one for the vineyard, and another for the wine
    cellar. The objective is to provide some of the basic functionalities that may
    be extended to obtain complete product traceability, from the grapes to the bottle.
    To compare the formerly reviewed works, Table 3 shows a comparison between the
    detailed works. The following features to characterize each one have been proposed:
    • Platform: it refers to the microcontroller model that the system uses. • Real-Time:
    it indicates if the system works in real-time. Possible values: Yes/No. • Connection:
    it refers to the wireless connections available for the system. Possible values:
    Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPRS, others. • Phenomena: it refers to the phenomena that the
    system can measure. Possible values: Temp., Hum., Dust, Bar., Noise, others. •
    IoT-WoT: it indicates if the system follows the IoT and WoT paradigms. Possible
    values: Yes/No. • Analyze: it shows if the system offers a RESTFul interface.
    Possible values: Yes/No. • Client: it indicates if the system provides a client
    for visualizing the sensors and observations. Possible values: Yes (what kind)
    /No. • OGC standards: it shows if the system offers OGC standards. Possible values:
    Yes (what kind) /No. Table 3. Comparison between different sensorized platforms.

    works and our work using the characteristics listed at the beginning of this section,
    and the results are shown in Table 3. As indicated, most of the analyzed works
    use different platforms to build the different nodes. In our case, we use LinkIt
    ONE, because it has different ways to connect, GPRS, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. It also
    includes useful operations to use the different features. Like some other works
    analyzed, our work offers sensor data in real-time. It is possible because our
    SEnviro node, to monitor vineyards, is provided with GPRS connection to the Internet.
    SEnviro, as we show in [39], it can include a huge variety of phenomena. For this
    proof of concept, to detect downy mildew disease, we adopt the nodes to offer
    only three phenomena: temperature, humidity and rain gauge. Only three analyzed
    projects [56], [57], [58] follow the IoT and WoT paradigms. SEnviro follows these
    paradigms and offers a RESTFul interface. Finally, our project aims to be interoperable,
    and for this purpose, an OGC standard has been chosen, such as the OGC SensorThings
    API. If you look at the works that apply some analysis over the observations from
    the sensors, only two works, apart from SEnviro, apply some analysis to increase
    the value of the observations and offer decision-making models. Our work, as we
    detailed in the previous work [39], provides a client to these paradigms and offers
    a RESTful interface using the OGC SensorThings API. 7. Conclusions The primary
    concern of this work is to apply the new improvements in the ICT area, within
    the smart agriculture context. In this way, the applied model to detect the suitable
    moment to treat downy mildew disease can help the farmer in different ways. The
    first improvement is the reduction of costs of chemical products. The proposed
    support system detects the best moment to apply the downy mildew control treatments,
    which are only applied when they are strictly necessary. At the same time, it
    reduces the chemicals in the soil. It redounds in less external elements in the
    environment, improving the ecological footprint of the crop. Also, it reduces
    costs concerning person-hours; each treatment that is not needed represents some
    working hours that could be used for other tasks. Consequently, the farmer does
    not need to visit the vineyards to know the status. Our work applied a sensorized
    platform called SEnviro detailed in [39], whose objective was to monitor vineyards.
    For this purpose, we have designed a new version of the sensorized platform to
    measure different phenomena to provide follow up models to detect the best moment
    to treat downy mildew. To achieve this, we propose an improved version of the
    SEnviro platform that follows different computer science paradigms, such as IoT
    or edge computing. In this way, our platform can process and apply short algorithms
    to compute the information at the same moment when the data are collected. The
    objective of the work is not to evaluate or validate the Goldanich model since
    there are different works in the bibliography related to that. Our work only shows
    a single experimentation to test the presented IoT platform. It has offered good
    results during the month that the SEnviro platform has been installed and has
    correctly reported the observations to the central server, the platform had some
    isolated losses caused by coverage problems to send the observation in real-time.
    Temperatures and humidities average for the monitoring of the Goidanich model
    have also been calculated. As future work, new fungal disease models in the field
    of viticulture could be included, such as Powdery mildew, Black rot or Botrytis.
    All of these diseases are based on meteorological phenomena, and they are included
    in the SEnviro node. New kinds of crop could be supported if the disease models
    are based on these meteorological phenomena. Support other crops with other phenomena
    require to add these sensors, in this case, more efforts are needed. Acknowledgments

  analysis: 'The paper proposes an air quality monitoring and prediction system based
    on IoT and edge computing, which reduces the cost of traditional monitoring equipment
    by at least 10% with the same observation accuracy, thereby avoiding the trade-off
    between cost and accuracy in traditional solutions. In the proposed system, by
    running the Kalman Filter algorithm on the Raspberry Pi, which has strong computing
    power and is used as the edge device, the immediate predictions of six types of
    air pollutants such as SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, and PM10 are realized.

    Compared with the other three algorithms SMA, EWMA, and ARIMA, it can be seen
    that even with low-accuracy sensors, the error of the prediction results based
    on the Kalman Filter is the smallest. RMSE is also reduced by an average of 68.3%.
    In addition, compared to the observation data of sensors, the accuracy of the
    predicted value by the Kalman Filter algorithm is improved by 27%, which improves
    the accuracy of sensors from the aspect of the algorithm.

    In the process of applying the Kalman Filter algorithm to predict the concentration
    of various air pollutants, this paper ignores the influence of the external environment
    on the concentration of pollutants. Such factors as factory emissions, wind speed,
    and other factors will have a direct impact on the current concentration of pollutants.
    In future work, if we can get this data, we can further improve the accuracy of
    the model.'

    \ systems adopt high-accuracy sensors. However, high-accuracy sensors are accompanied\n\
    with high cost, which cannot be widely promoted in Internet of Things (IoT) with\
    \ many sensor nodes.\nIn this paper, we propose a low-cost air quality monitoring\
    \ and real-time prediction system based on\nIoT and edge computing, which reduces\
    \ IoT applications dependence on cloud computing. Raspberry\nPi with computing\
    \ power, as an edge device, runs the Kalman Filter (KF) algorithm, which improves\n\
    the accuracy of low-cost sensors by 27% on the edge side. Based on the KF algorithm,\
    \ our proposed\nsystem achieves the immediate prediction of the concentration\
    \ of six air pollutants such as SO2, NO2\nand PM2.5 by combining the observations\
    \ with errors. In the comparison experiments with three\ncommon predicted algorithms\

    \ Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, the KF algorithm can obtain the optimal\n\
    prediction results, and root-mean-square error decreases by 68.3% on average.\
    \ Taken together, the\nresults of the study indicate that our proposed system,\

    \ Raspberry Pi\n1. Introduction\nThe IoT (Internet of Things) is an important\
    \ part of the new generation of information technology. It\nrefers to a huge network\
    \ formed by combining various information sensing devices with the Internet [1].\n\
    In recent years, the widespread use of IoT terminal equipment has led to a spurt\
    \ of terminal data and\nconnections, requiring a more computationally eﬃcient\
    \ IoT network architecture to enable timely data\nanalysis and processing. At\
    \ the same time, IoT business is continuously derived and widely used in\nsmart\
    \ agriculture, smart home, intelligent transportation and other ﬁelds. Many special\
    \ application\nscenarios, such as security monitoring, real-time road condition\
    \ information collection, automatic\ndriving, etc., require the network to further\
    \ reduce the data transmission delay [2]. The processing and\ncomputing power\
    \ of the traditional wireless network architecture is insuﬃcient to support the\
    \ deep\ncoverage and massive connection of the intelligent IoT. Moreover, the\
    \ cloud computing platform is\nfar from the IoT terminal, which is diﬃcult to\
    \ meet the real-time data requirements of low-latency\nservices [3].\nThe proposed\
    \ edge computing [4] provides a new way to solve the development bottleneck of\n\
    IoT and is considered to be the key enabler of IoT. Edge computing refers to an\
    \ open platform that\nintegrates network, computing, storage and application core\
    \ capabilities on the edge of the network,\nwhich nears the things or data source.\
    \ It provides edge intelligence services, to meet the key needs\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\
    \ 9, 1831; doi:10.3390/app9091831\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\
    \ 9, 1831\n2 of 23\nof industry digitalization in agile connectivity, real-time\
    \ business, data optimization, application\nintelligence, security and privacy\
    \ protection, etc. Edge computing features are like human nerve\nendings, which\
    \ can self-process simple stimuli and feedback the processed features to the cloud\
    \ brain.\nSmart agriculture makes the application of IoT technology in traditional\
    \ agricultural production\nmore “intelligent” by using sensors and software to\
    \ control agricultural production through mobile\nplatforms or computer platforms.\
    \ In smart agriculture, establishing a real-time monitoring and\nprediction system\
    \ for air quality (AQ) is the most basic and most important solution [5]. The\
    \ prediction\nfor AQ is based on the analysis of the monitoring data. In other\
    \ words, the accuracy of the monitoring\ndata aﬀects the accuracy of the prediction\
    \ to a certain extent [6]. At the same time, the Environment\nAgency also has\
    \ speciﬁed speciﬁc values for AQ [7]. Once current AQ exceeds the threshold, people\n\
    should take appropriate countermeasures. However, when the prediction is inaccurate,\
    \ it will lead\nto decision errors. In order to obtain high-precision monitoring\
    \ data, many AQ monitoring schemes\ncurrently existing use high-precision sensors.\
    \ However, high-precision sensors are often accompanied\nby higher costs. A complete\
    \ system consists of multiple sets of sensors [8], so there is a trade-oﬀ\nbetween\
    \ cost and accuracy. In addition, in a traditional IoT-based AQ monitoring system,\
    \ the data\ncollected by the sensing layer needs to be uploaded, analyzed and\
    \ processed in the cloud computing\nplatform at the network layer [9]. However,\
    \ in China, most agricultural areas are in remote locations\nand harsh environments\
    \ limited by bandwidth and network connectivity [10]. The timely uploading of\n\
    monitoring data and the analysis of prediction results cannot be guaranteed, which\
    \ aﬀects the timeliness\nof decision-making. Therefore, edge computing with real-time\
    \ computing power should be considered\nto solve the bottleneck of traditional\
    \ cloud computing solutions in agricultural application scenarios.\nIn order to\
    \ improve the real-time performance and reduce the cost of the traditional monitoring\n\
    system, this paper combines edge computing and IoT application in smart agriculture.\
    \ Under a\nrelatively low hardware cost, the air quality monitoring and prediction\
    \ system based on the Kalman\nFilter (KF) algorithm can greatly improve the accuracy,\
    \ both in monitoring and predicting values.\nBy ﬂexibly arranging inexpensive\
    \ sensors throughout the monitoring area, the system monitors the\nconcentration\
    \ of six air pollutants such as SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 in real time.\
    \ According\nto the dynamic characteristics of diﬀerent air pollutants, the KF\
    \ algorithm constructs the short-term\ndynamic prediction model via 100 iterations\
    \ of the initial sampling data with error. Therefore, the\ninstantaneous prediction\
    \ of pollutant concentrations is achieved, and the sensor accuracy is improved\n\
    from the algorithm level on the edge side. This process of correcting the monitoring\
    \ data to obtain\nthe best predictive value is a local process, which is used\
    \ as a concrete example of edge computing.\nRaspberry Pi (RPi) 3B is a low-power,\
    \ low-cost card computer with a built-in quad-core 1.2 GHz 64\nbit processor,\
    \ which has very good computing and processing power. Therefore, this paper chooses\n\
    RPi as the carrier of edge computing and the central node of the sensor network.\
    \ After collecting\nthe monitoring data from various sensors, RPi runs the KF\
    \ algorithm to obtain the best prediction\nresults of various air pollutant concentrations,\
    \ and then uploads the monitoring data and prediction\nresults to the cloud through\
    \ the Wi-Fi module. The cloud stores data and sends feedback to client\nrequests.\
    \ Through this marginalized low-cost wireless solution, farmers and agricultural\
    \ experts can\ncollect more accurate concentrations of air pollutants, and analyze\
    \ the current and subsequent AQ\nthrough the client, which provides a more real-time,\
    \ accurate and scientiﬁc basis for taking appropriate\ncontrol measures.\n2. Related\
    \ Work\nThere are a wide range of studies covering the issue of application of\
    \ edge computing on\nIoT [11–19], as well as monitoring [20–28] and prediction\
    \ [29–37] for AQ.\n2.1. Edge Computing on IoT\nThe continuous decline in sensor\
    \ prices and computing costs has changed the architecture of\ntraditional IoT\
    \ with more “things” to be connected to the Internet, resulting in pushing computing\
    \ to\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 1831\n3 of 23\nthe edge of the network [11,12]. As more\
    \ networked devices become available, edge computing [13] is\nan important change\
    \ required to make IoT systems more eﬃcient and scalable, which will be used in\n\
    all walks of life, especially in some areas where cloud computing is ineﬃcient.\
    \ Compared to cloud\ncomputing, edge computing shows the following advantages\
    \ [14]. (1) A focus on real-time, short-cycle\ndata analysis and better support\
    \ big data analysis for cloud applications. (2) Real-time or faster data\nprocessing\
    \ and analysis. Data processing is closer to data sources, rather than in an external\
    \ data center\nof the cloud, so latency can be reduced. (3) Low cost. It costs\
    \ less on data management solutions for\nlocal devices than on the cloud and data\
    \ center networks. (4) Higher application runtime eﬃciency. As\nlatency decreases,\
    \ applications can run more eﬃciently at a faster rate. (5) Impairing the role\
    \ of the\ncloud also reduces the likelihood of a single point of failure, and\
    \ reducing the reliance on the cloud\nalso means that some devices can run oﬄine\
    \ smoothly.\nFrom autopilot to smart agriculture, edge computing on IoT has been\
    \ used in many areas.\nCompanies like PointGrab and Gooee partner to provide IoT\
    \ enabled lighting solutions with the help\nof real-time edge computing [15].\
    \ Brzoza-Woch et al. present a fog-enabled embedded system for\nenvironmental\
    \ monitoring [16]. Intel partner with AVOB to develop edge-enabled remote control\
    \ and\nmonitoring for IoT based smart energy management [17]. Datta et al. propose\
    \ an IoT architecture for\nconnected vehicles and utilized fog computing as a\
    \ platform for providing IoT services to connected\nvehicles [18]. Bakheder et\
    \ al. use cloudlets for big data analytics in a mobile cloud computing\nenvironment\
    \ [19].\nThe development of smart industry requires not only the high cloud but\
    \ also the ubiquitous\nedge computing. Regardless of the eﬃciency of use of IoT\
    \ applications, time delays or security\nconsiderations, edge computing is the\
    \ key to the popularity of the IoT.\n2.2. Air Quality Monitoring System\nWith\
    \ the rise of IoT and the combination of miniaturized sensor devices and wireless\
    \ technologies,\nnowadays, many of the AQ monitoring solutions are based on the\
    \ traditional IoT architecture to\nbuild a remote monitoring system for AQ [9].\
    \ Composed of various sensor devices, the perception\nlayer identiﬁes various\
    \ air parameters and collects the data. The network layer, composed of wireless\n\
    technology, network management system and cloud computing platform, transmits\
    \ and processes\ndata information collected from the perception layer, then makes\
    \ corresponding decisions according to\ncurrent AQ conditions. The application\
    \ layer presents relevant information back to the user.\nGómez et al. [20], designed\
    \ and used an IoT-based, multi-purpose architecture for monitoring\nenvironmental\
    \ variables in urban areas. In their four-tier architecture, customer service\
    \ interface\nhandles requests from clients via the HTTP protocol, when the management\
    \ layer receives the data and\nstores it in the database. Raipure and Mehetre\
    \ [21] proposed a large city pollution monitoring system\nbased on wireless sensor\
    \ network. The system uses AVR (Atmel AVR) ATmega-32 microcontroller\nto transfer\
    \ the values from ADC (Analog to Digital Converters) to the server, and uses a\
    \ Bluetooth\nmicrocontroller to build a communication channel between gas delivery\
    \ to the server. In the agricultural\nsector, Shinde et al. [22] established an\
    \ IoT-based monitoring and control system for AQ in greenhouses.\nXiaojun et al.\
    \ [23] proposed a system which can reduce hardware costs to the previous 1/10\
    \ by replacing\nmonitoring devices that use traditional empirical analysis with\
    \ sensor networks in IoC (Inversion of\nControl) technology. Kiruthika and Umamakeswari\
    \ [24] used the Raspberry Pi to build an IoT-based\nlow-cost air quality monitoring\
    \ system. As shown in Figure 1, the RPi [25–27] just as a sensor network\nnode,\
    \ only collects monitored data and pushes data to the gateway layer. The gateway\
    \ layer ﬁlters\nand predicts data, then uploads the results to the cloud layer\
    \ through the ESP 8266 wireless module.\nThe cloud layer analyzes the received\
    \ data and responds to various requests from the client. Similarly,\nJadhav et\
    \ al. [28] also used the RPi as a bridge between the sensor network and the web\
    \ server. The\nreasons that the above solutions adopt RPi are due to its low cost\
    \ and card-like features.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 1831\n4 of 23\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\

    \ studies have proposed a very mature and extensive AQ monitoring \nprogram, in\
    \ China, most agriculture areas are in remote locations and in harsh environments\
    \ [10]. \nData analysis and processing through the cloud computing solution at\
    \ the network layer cannot meet \nthe requirements of low latency [7]. In addition,\
    \ the accuracy of the sensors selected in the existing \nstudies will be different,\
    \ which will have different degrees of influence on the accuracy of the \nmonitoring\
    \ data, thus failing to guarantee the scientific nature of the prediction results.\
    \ \n2.3. Prediction Model \nIn recent years, many studies on air quality have\
    \ focused on prediction air pollutant \nconcentrations and assessing AQ in a given\
    \ area. There are two main methods for constructing \npredictive models: traditional\
    \ statistical methods and methods based on machine learning (ML) or \nmulti-model\
    \ fusion. \nAt the statistical method level, Lanzafam et al. [29] propose a model\
    \ of AQ prediction based on \nSimple Moving Average (SMA). The model predicts\
    \ the concentration of pollutants in the next period \nor periods by the average\
    \ of a set of recent actual data. Because of its simple calculation method, it\
    \ is \nvery suitable for immediate prediction. Donnelly et al. [30] propose the\
    \ Exponentially Weighted \nMoving Average model (EWMA). The principle of the model\
    \ is the different weighting factors of the \npollutant data in different historical\
    \ periosd on the prediction process. Without considering the \nperiodicity, the\
    \ influence of the variable far from the target period is relatively low. Therefore,\
    \ the \nprediction results based on EWMA model are smoother and closer to recent\
    \ data than the SMA. The \nAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [31,32]\
    \ model is widely used in AQ prediction. \nThe model filters the non-stationary\
    \ factors in the original sequence by using the data difference \nmethod, so that\
    \ the model can obtain better prediction results. \nAlthough the traditional statistical-based\
    \ prediction model has better performance in terms of \ninterpretability and computational\
    \ cost, it is limited by the single feature expression and lacks the \nability\
    \ to deal with complex prediction problems such as nonlinear processes. With the\
    \ development \nof ML, many studies have chosen to use ML methods or multi-mode\
    \ fusion [33,34] to predict AQ. In \nthe study of Rybarczyk and Zalakeviciute\
    \ [35], based on the J48 decision tree algorithm, two different \ndecision models\
    \ are constructed to predict the concentration of PM2.5 in the two adjacent regions.\
    \ In \nthe study of Raipure and Mehetre [21], the ID3 algorithm in the decision\
    \ tree is applied to calculate \nthe percentage of air pollutants. The algorithm\
    \ is used to predict specific areas and provide early \nwarning information for\
    \ highly polluted areas. Xiaojun et al. [23] propose a multi-input and multi-\n\
    output AQ prediction model based on ANN (Artificial Neural Network). Based on\
    \ the relationship \nbetween current and past 24 hours of pollutant concentration,\
    \ a 24 hour prediction network is \nFigure 1. Functional model of the proposed\
    \ system.\nAlthough the existing studies have proposed a very mature and extensive\

    \ and in harsh environments [10]. Data\nanalysis and processing through the cloud\
    \ computing solution at the network layer cannot meet the\nrequirements of low\
    \ latency [7]. In addition, the accuracy of the sensors selected in the existing\
    \ studies\nwill be diﬀerent, which will have diﬀerent degrees of inﬂuence on the\
    \ accuracy of the monitoring data,\nthus failing to guarantee the scientiﬁc nature\
    \ of the prediction results.\n2.3. Prediction Model\nIn recent years, many studies\
    \ on air quality have focused on prediction air pollutant concentrations\nand\
    \ assessing AQ in a given area. There are two main methods for constructing predictive\

    \ AQ prediction model\nbased on ANN (Artiﬁcial Neural Network). Based on the relationship\
    \ between current and past 24 h\nof pollutant concentration, a 24 h prediction\
    \ network is established. To predict ozone concentrations,\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9,\

    \ components [36]. Feng Xiao and Li\nQi [37] propose ANN to predict the average\
    \ daily concentration of PM2.5 two days in advance based\non AQ trajectory analysis\
    \ and wavelet transform.\n3. Materials and Methods\n3.1. The Proposed System Architecture\n\
    The hardware part of the system is mainly composed of Raspberry Pi, the sensor\
    \ network and the\nWi-Fi module. The software part is mainly the cloud data storage\
    \ and client system. Composed of\nseveral types of sensors, the sensor network\
    \ realizes real-time monitoring of the concentration of air\npollutants such as\
    \ SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, and PM10. After the periodic sampling is completed,\n\
    the sensor network sends the various pollutant concentration data to the RPi.\
    \ As the carrier of edge\ncomputing, RPi runs the Kalman Filter algorithm after\
    \ receiving the data. Then, after several iterations\nand updates in a very short\
    \ time, the predicted values of various pollutant concentrations at the\nnext\
    \ moment are obtained. After completing the relevant prediction work, RPi uploads\
    \ the data\nto the cloud through the Wi-Fi module. The cloud stores the data,\
    \ communicates with the client,\nand presents the user with information, such\
    \ as the current air quality status and the trend of each\npollutant concentration.\n\

    \ dust sensor (Zhengzhou Winsen Electronics Technology Co., Ltd., Zhengzhou,\n\
    China), with a minimum resolution particle diameter of 1.0 micron, is a versatile,\
    \ miniaturized module\nthat uses the principle of laser light scattering to detect\
    \ dust particles present in the air. By designing\ndiﬀerent channels to distinguish\
    \ the size of the particles, the PM2.5 and PM10 concentration values can\nbe obtained\
    \ separately. Besides, ZH03A has good consistency, stability, real-time response,\
    \ and also\nprovides a rich interface with digital output, PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)\
    \ output and analog output.\nThe 24 bit data packet is sent to the RPi by UART\
    \ (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)\ntransmission, and the PM2.5 and\
    \ PM10 concentrations are obtained by reading the value of the speciﬁc\nbit. The\

    \  \n3.1. The Proposed System Architecture \n \nFigure 2. The architecture of\
    \ air quality monitoring and prediction system. \nThe hardware part of the system\
    \ is mainly composed of Raspberry Pi, the sensor network and \nthe Wi-Fi module.\
    \ The software part is mainly the cloud data storage and client system. Composed\
    \ \nof several types of sensors, the sensor network realizes real-time monitoring\
    \ of the concentration of \nair pollutants such as SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5, and\
    \ PM10. After the periodic sampling is completed, \nthe sensor network sends the\
    \ various pollutant concentration data to the RPi. As the carrier of edge \ncomputing,\
    \ RPi runs the Kalman Filter algorithm after receiving the data. Then, after several\
    \ \niterations and updates in a very short time, the predicted values of various\
    \ pollutant concentrations \nat the next moment are obtained. After completing\
    \ the relevant prediction work, RPi uploads the \ndata to the cloud through the\
    \ Wi-Fi module. The cloud stores the data, communicates with the client, \nand\
    \ presents the user with information, such as the current air quality status and\
    \ the trend of each \npollutant concentration.  \n3.2. Hardware \n3.2.1. Raspberry\
    \ Pi \nRaspberry Pi 3 Model B: The Raspberry Pi (RPi) 3B [38] is a portable and\
    \ powerful SBC (Single \nBoard Computer), meaning that it runs a full operating\
    \ system and has sufficient peripherals \n(memory, CPU, power regulation) to start\

    \ has been deployed as an edge node, see for example [39–42].  \nBased on the\
    \ processing power and computing characteristics of the RPi, this paper also uses\
    \ the \nRPi as the edge computing device and the central node of the sensor network\
    \ (as shown in Figure 2). \nThe RPi periodically reads parameter data from various\
    \ sensors based on the corresponding \nconnection pins. After obtaining the monitoring\

    \ of intelligent gas sensor (Shenzhen Singoan Electronic Technology Co., Ltd.,\n\
    Shenzhen, China) modules carry out signal ampliﬁcation, data processing, temperature\
    \ and humidity\ncompensation, and it has the beneﬁts of a smaller size, lower\
    \ price and more stable performance.\nSGA-700 can directly output voltage signals\
    \ such as 0.4–2 V, 0–1.6 V, 0–4 V, 0–5 V, and serial port signals\nare reserved.\
    \ The standard signal after processing can be directly collected and uploaded\
    \ to the control\nhost RPi. The price of the SGA-700 series gas sensor is less\
    \ than $3. SGA-700-CO, SGA-700-NO2,\nSGA-700-SO2 and SGA-700-O3 are used to measure\
    \ CO, NO2, SO2 and O3 concentrations, respectively.\n(3) ESP8266 Wireless Sensor\n\
    The ESP8266 (ESPRESSIF SYSTEMS (SHANGHAI) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) is a low-power,\n\
    low-cost, highly integrated Wi-Fi microchip with a full TCP/IP stack, which adds\
    \ Wi-Fi capabilities to\nthe RPi via a UART serial connection. When the RPi is\
    \ networking, it can send the predicted results of\neach pollutant and the data\
    \ monitored by the sensor to the cloud.\nAt present, the price of the existing\
    \ AQ monitoring system ranges from $750 to $3000, while the\ntotal cost of our\
    \ proposed solution is only around $75, which has been reduced by nearly one-tenth,\n\
    and each module is easily accessible.\n3.3. Kalman Filter Algorithm\nThe traditional\
    \ statistical method-based prediction model [43] has the advantage of high\ninterpretability\
    \ and low computational cost. Its prediction principle is based on linearly ﬁtting\n\
    historical data. Therefore, the predicted result can have higher precision when\
    \ the trend of change\nis not severe. However, it is no longer applicable when\
    \ the concentration of various air pollutants\nis not a stable sequence. For example,\
    \ the concentration of pollutants, such as PM2.5, PM10, and\nSO, will suddenly\
    \ increase due to the increase in vehicle exhaust emissions when traﬃc is at a\
    \ peak\nin the morning and evening [44]. Therefore, models such as SMA, EWMA,\
    \ and ARIMA [29–32]\ncannot eﬀectively predict these change points, but these\
    \ data have higher predictive value (directly\ncorresponding to measures).\nIn\
    \ the application scenario of AQ prediction based on IoT devices, the prediction\
    \ model is\nlimited by the storage capacity and computing power of the device\
    \ itself. In order to achieve higher\nprediction accuracy, many ML models not\
    \ only require a large amount of historical data for training\n(storage problem),\
    \ but also have a high time complexity throughout the training process (calculation\n\
    problem) [45]. For example, the decision tree model [21,35] can improve the prediction\
    \ accuracy via\nthe increase in the number of training samples and the depth of\
    \ the tree, however, the time complexity\nO(N × M × D) is also multiplied (N is\
    \ the number of samples, M is the vector dimension, and D is the\ntree depth).\
    \ The ANN [23,36,37] also has the similar problem. Therefore, although the ML\
    \ model\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 1831\n7 of 23\nhas higher prediction accuracy, it\
    \ cannot meet the requirements of the edge computing node for the\nlightweight\
    \ model.\nIn order to solve the shortcomings of the above models, and in the case\
    \ of ensuring the prediction\naccuracy, the space complexity (storage) and time\
    \ complexity (calculation) of the model are simpliﬁed\nas much as possible, making\
    \ it adaptable to the application scenario of edge computing. This paper\nproposes\
    \ an AQ prediction model based on the Kalman Filter (KF) algorithm.\nThe KF is\
    \ an eﬃcient autoregressive ﬁlter model (recursive ﬁlter model) [46]. It occupies\
    \ very\nlittle memory and only needs to retain data for one state on the system,\
    \ rather than a long span of\nhistorical data. The actual measured data are used\
    \ to correct the prediction results, which can reﬂect\nthe objective results in\
    \ the most realistic way. The operation speed of the KF is very fast, so it is\
    \ very\nsuitable for solving real-time problems and applying to the edge computing\
    \ of IoT.\nThe core idea of the KF is to use a set of state-space expression equations\
    \ to represent a dynamic\nsystem, and to predict the system state ˆxk|k−1 (called\
    \ prior estimate) at the next moment k according to\nthe optimal estimate (prediction)\
    \ ˆxk−1 of the system state at time k − 1. At the same time, the system\nstate\
    \ at time k is observed, and the observed value zk is obtained. Due to the observation\
    \ error, zk and\nˆxk|k−1 deviate from the truly accurate system state, so the\
    \ predicted value ˆxk|k−1 needs to be corrected by\nthe observed value zk. Then\
    \ the optimal estimate (prediction) ˆxk of the system state at time k is obtained.\n\
    The KF algorithm is diﬀerent from the general timing prediction method [47]. Firstly,\
    \ there is\nno need to assume that the error term satisﬁes the normal distribution.\
    \ Secondly, it can estimate the\nsystem state based on a set of incomplete observations\
    \ (some time points missing in time series data)\nor that contain noise (measurement\
    \ error). Furthermore, compared with the model based on single\nobservations,\
    \ the KF considers the joint distribution of observations according to time series\
    \ data at\ndiﬀerent times and estimates the unknown factors that may aﬀect the\
    \ system. Therefore, the prediction\nof the KF will be more accurate.\nIn summary,\
    \ the KF algorithm has the following characteristics:\n1.\nThe object of the KF\
    \ algorithm research is a stochastic process, with sequential data.\n2.\nThe goal\
    \ of ﬁltering is to predict all random processes even with useless noise.\n3.\n\
    Diﬀering from the least squares method, the white noise existing in the dynamic\
    \ system or the\nobservation error existing in the observation data does not need\
    \ to be ﬁltered. The statistical\ncharacteristics of this noise information will\
    \ be used by the model in the prediction process.\n4.\nThe KF algorithm uses a\
    \ recursive algorithm, and spatial state representation equations are\nused to\
    \ construct time-domain ﬁlters for prediction of multidimensional random variables\
    \ (the\npredicted system state consists of multiple features).\n5.\nCompared to\
    \ the ARIMA model, the time series data used for prediction can be smooth or not.\n\
    6.\nThe prediction process only considers the process noise, the noise generated\
    \ by the observation\nmethod and the statistical characteristics of the system\
    \ at the current time point. Besides, the\nmodel calculation is small, which is\
    \ very suitable for real-time prediction.\nBased on the characteristics of the\
    \ Kalman Filter algorithm, this paper constructs the KF algorithm\non the edge\
    \ device (Raspberry Pi) to predict the concentration of various air pollutants\
    \ in real time.\nAlthough there are certain measurement errors in low-cost sensors\
    \ and processing noises in the\nmodel, the KF can improve the accuracy of sensors\
    \ from the algorithm level by combining the errored\nobservation data. Moreover,\
    \ the predicted value of the next moment can be obtained from the data of\nthe\
    \ previous moment, so that the system has predictability for various pollutants\
    \ and improves the\ndecision-making eﬃciency. As shown in Figure 3, the KF is\
    \ used in the edge computing environment\nof this paper.\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9,\

    \ can be thought of as corrector equations. Indeed, the final estimation \nalgorithm\

    4.2. Kalman Filter Algorithm Implementation\nThe Kalman Filter algorithm is an\
    \ autoregressive ﬁltering model. Therefore, the optimal estimate\nof the system\
    \ state at the current time, can be obtained by the optimal estimate of the system\
    \ state at\nthe previous moment and the observation of the system state at the\
    \ current time.\nFirstly, the state of the KF is represented by the following\
    \ two variables:\n•\nˆxk|k represents an estimate of the system state at time\
    \ k;\n•\nPk|k represents the covariance matrix of the state estimation error at\
    \ time k, which measures the\naccuracy of the estimation.\nThe KF estimates a\
    \ process by using a form of feedback control: the ﬁlter estimates the process\n\
    state at some time and then obtains feedback in the form of (noisy) measurements.\
    \ As such, the\nequations for the KF fall into two groups: time update equations\

    (7)\n4.2.3. Setting Parameters\nIn the Kalman ﬁlter-based air quality prediction\
    \ model proposed in this paper, it is assumed\nthat all kinds of pollutants do\
    \ not change state every hour and there are no control variables, so in\nEquation\
    \ (5), Fk can be set as an identity matrix and the value of Bkuk is zero. In Equation\
    \ (6), Rk is the\ncovariance matrix of the measurement error of sensors, and zk\
    \ is an observation matrix consisting of\nobservations of various pollutant concentrations\
    \ by 100 samples in ﬁrst 10 min/h (100 samples are\nrequired because, after several\
    \ experiments, the algorithm can achieve optimal convergence and steady\nstate\
    \ after 100 iterations).\nIn Equation (6), the process noise error Qk is usually\
    \ diﬃcult to predict as we typically do not\nhave the ability to directly observe\
    \ the process we are estimating. Statistically speaking, excellent\nﬁlter performance\
    \ can be obtained by tuning the ﬁlter parameter Qk. The tuning is usually performed\n\
    oﬀ-line, frequently with the help of another (distinct) Kalman Filter in a process\
    \ generally referred to\nas system identiﬁcation. Then, under the condition that\
    \ Qk is actually constant, both the estimation\nerror covariance Pk|k and the\
    \ Kalman gain Kk will stabilize quickly and then remain constant [49]. In\nthis\
    \ paper, assuming that Qk is a constant value Q, then we can determine the value\
    \ of Q for each\npollutant. The smaller the Q value, the higher the trust in the\
    \ prediction model. If Q is 0, it means that\nonly the prediction model is trusted.\
    \ And as Q decreases, the system will converge more easily, but\nwhen Q is reduced\
    \ to a certain extent, continuing to decrease may cause the system to start diverging.\n\
    Conversely, a larger Q value indicates a lower degree of trust in the predictive\
    \ model, and accordingly,\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 1831\n11 of 23\nthe degree of trust\
    \ in the measured value is increased. If Q tends to inﬁnity, it means that only\
    \ the\nmeasured value is trusted.\nThis paper uses the grid search method to tune\
    \ the Q, the speciﬁc process is as follows.\n(1)\nSelect data.\nThe Panyu Middle\
    \ School (PMS) in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, is an oﬃcial\nmonitoring\
    \ site, so we assume that the data published on this site is true and accurate\
    \ [50]. we select\nthe air pollutant concentration data released by the monitoring\
    \ site from 0:00 on 12 February 2019 to\n23:00 on 15 February 2019 as the actual\
    \ value (a total of 96 data points in four days). Each data point in\nthe data\
    \ set corresponds to the concentration value of each type of pollutant at each\
    \ hour. At the same\ntime and place, by using the sensor network of our system\
    \ to monitor, the observation data of various\npollutant concentrations during\
    \ this period is obtained, which is used as the measured value (similarly,\na\
    \ total of 96 data points in four days).\n(2)\nDeﬁne search interval.\nWhen Q\
    \ = 0, since the proportion of the observations is very small, the value of the\
    \ posterior\nestimate xk is basically not updated during the iterative process,\
    \ and the trend tends to be gentle.\nTaking the Kalman Filter to predict the CO\
    \ concentration as an example. Figure 6a shows the iterative\nconvergence process\
    \ at Q = 0 (a total of 96 iterations). In the ﬁgure, the blue line is the output\
    \ of the\nKF algorithm in each iteration (a posterior estimate xk), the plus sign\
    \ is the observed value with errors\nby the sensors, and the green line is the\
    \ data of the monitoring site, indicating the true value. When\nQ = 1, the model\
    \ trusts the observations at this time, and the update of the posterior estimate\
    \ xk is\nmore aﬀected by the observations. Therefore, the trend will basically\
    \ coincide with the measured\nvalues, as shown in Figure 6b.\nAppl. Sci. 2019,\

    5.1. Accuracy Improvement Analysis\nOne of the diﬀerences between the Kalman Filter\
    \ algorithm and other time series prediction\nmodels is that the statistical information\
    \ of process noise and observation error can be eﬀectively\nutilized in the prediction\
    \ process, which can correct the a priori estimation of the model. Therefore,\n\
    from the predictive perspective, the KF uses observation data obtained by the\
    \ sensor network to\nimprove prediction accuracy. From the monitoring perspective,\
    \ even with low-cost and low-precision\nmonitor sensors, the KF can correct the\
    \ error of the measurement data from the algorithm level, which\nimproves the\
    \ accuracy of sensors on the side.\nIn order to verify that the KF algorithm can\
    \ eﬀectively improve the accuracy of sensor observations,\nthis paper designs\
    \ a comparing experiment to obtain the error size. The experiment compares the\n\
    predicted value of the KF and the observed value of the sensor with the data of\
    \ the oﬃcial monitoring\nsite, respectively. The main indicators for measuring\
    \ errors includes MSE (mean-square error), RMSE\nand MAE (mean-absolute error).\

    \ Ability Analysis\nAlthough Section 5.1 proves that the KF algorithm can improve\
    \ the accuracy of the sensors, it\ndoes not explain the advantages of the KF in\
    \ predicting performance. Since most ML-based prediction\nmodels are limited by\
    \ the storage power (requiring a large amount of historical data for training\n\
    to obtain better prediction results) and computing power (model training and prediction\
    \ processes\nare computationally intensive tasks, requiring high computational\
    \ components like CPU) of edge\ncomputing nodes, they are not suitable for use\
    \ in IoT scenarios [45]. Therefore, this paper designs the\ncomparison experiment\
    \ between KF algorithm and three other commonly used time series prediction\n\
    algorithms that are based on statistical methods, including SMA (Simple Moving\
    \ Average), EWMA\n(Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) and ARIMA (Autoregressive\
    \ Integrated Moving Average).\nSMA, EWMA, and ARIMA need to use historical data\
    \ for training. In order to have a comparative\njudgment criterion, this paper\
    \ selects the data of various air pollutant concentrations per hour from 15\n\
    to 16 February of 2019, in PMS, which is used as the training set for model and\
    \ as the comparison data\nfor the algorithm prediction results.\n(1)\nKalman Filter\
    \ Prediction.\nFirst of all, determine the hyperparameters of the KF algorithm\
    \ as described in Section 4.2.3. Then,\nin the actual prediction process, the\
    \ observation data used by the KF in the correction state is the hourly\nmonitoring\
    \ data of the air pollutant concentration in PMS (from 0:00 to 23:00 on 16 February\
    \ 2019). The\nspeciﬁc process of each prediction is as follows: (1) during each\
    \ prediction period, the sensors of the\nsystem sample 100 times of the concentration\
    \ of each air pollutant in the ﬁrst ten minutes; (2) the KF\nalgorithm is iteratively\
    \ updated based on the sampling data; (3) the results of the iterative convergence\n\
    are used as the predicted values of each pollutant concentration in this period.\n\
    (2)\nSMA Prediction\nSMA is a method for predicting the average value for a certain\
    \ period in the future. The method\ncalculates the arithmetic mean of several\
    \ historical data in the past and uses the arithmetic mean as the\npredicted value\
    \ for the later period [51]. SMA can be expressed as:\nFt = (At−1 + At−2 + At−3\
    \ + . . . + At−n)/n\n(11)\nwhere Ft is the predicted value for the next period,\
    \ and n is the number of periods of the moving average,\ngenerally between 3 and\
    \ 200. At−1 is the actual value of the previous period, and At−2, At−3, At−n are\n\
    the actual values of the ﬁrst two periods, the ﬁrst three periods and the ﬁrst\
    \ n periods, respectively.\nThe number of n is determined by the experimental\
    \ results of multiple cross-validation [52] on\nthe training set before the SMA\
    \ prediction. It is found that the prediction eﬀect is best when n = 3.\nTherefore,\
    \ in the actual prediction process, the model input data of the ﬁrst period (predicted\
    \ value at\n0:00 on the 16 February 2019) is the three-hour data from the monitoring\
    \ site, which is from 21:00 to\n23:00 on 15 February 2019. The model input data\
    \ of the second period (predicted value at 1:00 on the\n16 February 2019) is the\
    \ data from 22:00 to 23:00 on 15 February 2019 and 0:00 on 16 February 2019. By\n\
    analogy, the predicted values of 24 h on the 16 February 2019 are obtained.\n\
    (3)\nEWMA Prediction\nEWMA is an improvement to SMA and is a common sequence processing\
    \ method [53]. This\napplies a non-uniform weighting to time series data so that\
    \ a lot of data can be used, but recent data\nis weighted more heavily. As the\
    \ name suggests, weights are based upon the exponential function.\nFormulated\
    \ as follows:\nEWMAt = λYt + (1 − λ)EWMAt−1(t = 1, 2, . . . , n)\n(12)\nwhere\
    \ EWMAt is the estimated value at time t, Yt is the observation at time t, n is\
    \ the number of\nobservations to be monitored including EWMA0, and 0 < λ ≤ 1 is\
    \ a constant that determines the depth\nof memory of the EWMA. The parameter λ\
    \ determines the rate at which “older” data enter into the\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9,\
    \ 1831\n17 of 23\ncalculation of the EWMA statistic. A large value of λ (closer\
    \ to 1) gives more weight to recent data and\nless weight to older data, while\
    \ a small value of λ (closer to 0) gives more weight to older data. In this\n\
    paper, the value of λ is 0.4, and the model input of each period is the same as\
    \ the SMA.\n(4)\nARIMA Prediction.\nThe ARIMA model, also known as the diﬀerential\
    \ autoregressive moving average model,\ntransforms nonstationary time series into\
    \ stationary time series, learning from historical data to\npatterns that change\
    \ over time [54]. After learning, this rule is used to predict the future. The\
    \ ARIMA\nmodel can be written as ARIMA(p, d, q) and is an extension of the ARMA(p,\
    \ q) model. In ARIMA(p, d, q),\nparameters p, d and q are non-negative integers,\
    \ p is the order (number of time lags) of the autoregressive\nmodel, d is the\
    \ degree of diﬀerencing when the time series becomes stationary, and q is the\
    \ order of the\nmoving-average model. ARIMA(p, d, q) can be expressed as:\n\n\
    1 −\np\nX\ni=1\n∅iLi\n\n(1 − L)dXt =\n\n1 −\nq\nX\ni=1\nθiLi\n\
    \nεt\n(13)\nwhere L is a lag operator. Since the parameters of each diﬀerence\
    \ in the model need to be determined\nbefore the ARIMA prediction, this paper\
    \ selects the 70 h data of the monitoring site before 0:00 on 16\nFebruary 2019\
    \ as the training set for the ARIMA model. The speciﬁc training process is: (1)\
    \ determine\nthe minimum diﬀerence order d that transforms the original data into\
    \ a stationary sequence S; (2)\ncalculate the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation\
    \ coeﬃcients of sequence S, to determine the\nvalues of p and q; (3) estimate\
    \ the parameters of each diﬀerence after completing the ARIMA model.\n(5)\nComparison.\n\
    In order to compare the prediction accuracy of KF, SMA, EWMA, and ARIMA more intuitively,\
    \ the\nveriﬁcation data set selected is the concentration of various air pollutants\
    \ collected by the monitoring\nsite on 16 February 2019, in PMS. Three evaluation\
    \ indicators, MSE, RMSE, and MAE are also chosen\nto measure the performance of\
    \ each model. As shown in the following table:\nAs illustrated in Table 3, the\
    \ MSE, RMSE, and MAE of the KF in predicting the concentration of\neach pollutant\
    \ are the lowest, compared with the other three algorithms. In detail, the average\
    \ RMSE\nis reduced by 68.3%. That is to say, the KF algorithm shows the smallest\
    \ prediction error as a whole,\nand its prediction performance is the best.\n\

    This section presents the predictive trend of four algorithms KF, SMA, EWMA and\
    \ ARIMA via\ncomparing the predicted values with the published values by the oﬃcial\
    \ monitoring site. As shown in\nFigure 11, the predicted values of four algorithms\
    \ and real values at diﬀerent moments reveal whether\nthe four algorithms can\
    \ accurately reﬂect the characteristics of the data. It is a 24 h prediction trend\
    \ for\nthe concentration of six pollutants SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 on\
    \ 16 February 2019, in PMS.\nThe black solid line represents the data collected\
    \ in PMS, as a benchmark for comparison. The dashed\nline in four diﬀerent colors\
    \ is the predicted value according to four diﬀerent algorithms, including\nSMA,\

    \ PM2.5; (f) PM10.\nAs illustrated in Figure 11, compared with the data of the\
    \ oﬃcial monitoring site, the prediction\nresults of the KF for six kinds of air\
    \ pollutant concentrations are the closest to the real data. The KF\nshows the\
    \ best prediction eﬀect reﬂecting the characteristics of real data at diﬀerent\
    \ times.\nIn detail, the blue dotted line reﬂects the trend of SMA algorithm for\
    \ various pollutants. On the\nwhole, SMA is only eﬀective when dealing with horizontal\
    \ historical data, such as the time from 2:00\nAppl. Sci. 2019, 9, 1831\n19 of\
    \ 23\nto 5:00 in Figure 11c and the time from 2:00 to 23:00 in Figure 11e,f. However,\
    \ data with trend or step\ncharacteristics, such as Figure 11b,d, the moving average\
    \ does not always reﬂect its trend well, showing\nobvious hysteresis. Since it\
    \ is an average value, the predicted value always stays at the past level, and\n\
    it cannot be expected to cause higher or lower ﬂuctuations in the future. However,\
    \ ﬂuctuations in the\nconcentration of various air pollutants are not always horizontal,\
    \ so the results of SMA predictions\nwill produce very large deviations.\nThe\
    \ orange dotted line reﬂects the predicted trend of the EWMA algorithm among various\n\
    pollutants. As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the EWMA algorithm is very eﬀective\
    \ for the processing of\nhorizontal historical data. Although the prediction of\
    \ trend or step data has been greatly improved\ncompared with SMA, there is still\
    \ signiﬁcant hysteresis. The results of each pollutant concentration\nprediction\
    \ are still far from the data released by the oﬃcial monitoring site.\nThe green\
    \ dotted line reﬂects the predicted trend of the ARIMA algorithm for various pollutants.\n\
    Overall, compared with SMA and EWMA, the ARIMA can better reﬂect the trend of\
    \ data, whether for\nhorizontal or step data. However, ARIMA requires that the\
    \ time series data be stable or to be stable\nafter being diﬀerentiated, so in\
    \ a short period of time, ARIMA can get a good prediction eﬀect. When\nthe data\
    \ suddenly ﬂuctuates, as illustrated in Figure 11a, the concentration of SO2 suddenly\
    \ rises at\n6:00 and 8:00, ARIMA still shows obvious hysteresis, resulting in\
    \ large errors in the prediction results.\nThe red dotted line reﬂects the prediction\
    \ trend of the KF for various pollutants. It can be seen from\nthe ﬁgures that\
    \ even though the system uses inexpensive sensors with low precision, the correction\
    \ of\nthe KF algorithm can make the prediction results of various pollutant concentrations\
    \ very close to the\ndata of the oﬃcial monitoring site. The KF can well reﬂect\
    \ the trend of the data both in step-type data\n(Figure 11b) and horizontal data\
    \ (Figure 11e), showing no obvious hysteresis or very large volatility.\nBased\
    \ on the above analysis and comparison results, the KF is very suitable for the\
    \ air quality\nmonitoring and prediction system proposed in this paper. After\
    \ the hyperparameter is determined, the\nKF does not need to train the historical\
    \ data. Therefore, the calculation amount of the model is so small\nduring each\
    \ iteration and update process that it can be completed quickly on the RPi. By\
    \ correcting the\nmodel by the real-time monitoring data of the sensors, the trend\
    \ of various pollutant concentrations\ncan be accurately reﬂected, and the problem\
    \ of low sensor accuracy is solved from the algorithm level.\n5.4. Client Interface\
    \ Design\nAfter the KF algorithm completes the prediction of the concentration\
    \ of the pollutants at the next\nmoment, RPi will send the prediction results\
    \ and monitoring data to the cloud, which stores the data\nin the database and\
    \ feedbacks results to the client. Users can view the current air quality and\
    \ the latest\n24-h AQI (air quality index) trend through the browser’s access,\

    \ edge computing and IoT in smart agriculture, this paper establishes a\nlow-cost\
    \ air quality monitoring and prediction system via Raspberry Pi, which is an edge\
    \ device to run\nthe Kalman Filter algorithm. Compared to the traditional air\
    \ quality monitoring and prediction system\nthat processes in the cloud, this\
    \ paper puts the machine learning algorithm on the edge, which can\navoid the\
    \ problem of data transmission delay due to bandwidth and network connection limitations\n\
    in the agricultural environment, and improves the real-time decision-making. By\
    \ running the KF\nalgorithm on the RPi, which has strong computing power and is\
    \ used as the edge device, the immediate\npredictions of six type of air pollutants\
    \ such as SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 are realized.\nCompared with the other\
    \ three algorithms SMA, EWMA and ARIMA, it can be seen that even with\nlow-accuracy\
    \ sensors, the error of the prediction results based on the KF is the smallest.\
    \ RMSE is\nalso reduced by an average of 68.3%. In addition, compared with the\
    \ observation data of sensors, the\naccuracy of the predicted value by the KF\
    \ algorithm is improved by 27%, which improves the accuracy\nof sensors from the\
    \ aspect of the algorithm. Compared to other air quality monitoring equipment,\
    \ the\ncost of our proposed solution is reduced by at least 10% with the same\
    \ observation accuracy. In other\nwords, our proposal avoids the trade-oﬀ between\
    \ cost and accuracy in traditional solutions.\nIn the process of applying the\
    \ Kalman Filter algorithm to predict the concentration of various air\npollutants,\
    \ this paper ignores the inﬂuence of the external environment on concentration\
    \ of pollutants.\nSuch factors as factory emissions, wind speed, and other factors\
    \ will have a direct impact on the\ncurrent concentration of pollutants. In future\
    \ work, if we can get this data, we can further improve\nthe accuracy of the model.\
    \ For the proposed system, the edge computing layer based on the sensor\nnetwork\
    \ and the Raspberry Pi was designed to be too centralized [55]. When the RPi that\
    \ is in the\ncenter breaks down, the problem of disaster recovery backup will\
    \ emerge, resulting in long-term\nparalysis of regional functions (requiring human\
    \ intervention to troubleshoot) and data loss. At the\nsame time, the monitoring\
    \ and early warning mechanism of the edge computing layer itself is not\nperfect.\
    \ In summary, it is necessary to consider the above two problems on the algorithm\
    \ and the\nsystem when applying the system to the actual production environment\
    \ in the future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization—X.L. Writing—original\

  title: IoT Implementation of Kalman Filter to Improve Accuracy of Air Quality Monitoring
    and Prediction
  verbatim_quote1: By running the Kalman Filter algorithm on the RPi, which has strong
    computing power and is used as the edge device, the immediate predictions of six
    type of air pollutants such as SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM2.5 and PM10 are realized.
  verbatim_quote2: Compared with the other three algorithms SMA, EWMA and ARIMA, it
    can be seen that even with low-accuracy sensors, the error of the prediction results
    based on the KF is the smallest. RMSE is also reduced by an average of 68.3%.
    In addition, compared to the observation data of sensors, the accuracy of the
    predicted value by the KF algorithm is improved by 27%, which improves the accuracy
    of sensors from the aspect of the algorithm.

  analysis: 'Reviewing the projects against these actions, we found a significant
    growth in research effort in IoT and WSN applications for smallholder agriculture
    over the last decade, with speed-up in the years 2017–2019. Not much of this work
    has been deployed in farm plots, and much remains to be done in an actual deployment
    setting.


    Advances in hardware, software, and communication technology as well as increased
    equipment availability are reasons for the increased research interest. In real
    and outdoor deployment, the gateway and sensing nodes need to be dispersed, especially
    when a wider spatial coverage is needed. Sensing nodes shall be placed at the
    farm without risk of loosing of transmission. Additionally, gateway placement
    should consider stable power provision and a trustworthy communication channel.
    In doing so, range and network lifetime maximization shall be given utmost considerations.'

    \ backbone for most developing countries. Most of these\ncountries suffer from\
    \ insufﬁcient agricultural production. The availability of real-time, reliable\
    \ and\nfarm-speciﬁc information may signiﬁcantly contribute to more sufﬁcient\
    \ and sustained production.\nTypically, such information is usually fragmented\
    \ and often does ﬁt one-on-one with the farm or farm\nplot. Automated, precise\
    \ and affordable data collection and dissemination tools are vital to bring such\n\
    information to these levels. The tools must address details of spatial and temporal\
    \ variability. The\nInternet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs)\
    \ are useful technology in this respect.\nThis paper investigates the usability\
    \ of IoT and WSN for smallholder agriculture applications. An\nin-depth qualitative\
    \ and quantitative analysis of relevant work over the past decade was conducted.\n\
    We explore the type and purpose of agricultural parameters, study and describe\
    \ available resources,\nneeded skills and technological requirements that allow\
    \ sustained deployment of IoT and WSN\ntechnology. Our ﬁndings reveal signiﬁcant\
    \ gaps in utilization of the technology in the context of\nsmallholder farm practices\
    \ caused by social, economic, infrastructural and technological barriers. We\n\
    also identify a signiﬁcant future opportunity to design and implement affordable\
    \ and reliable data\nacquisition tools and frameworks, with a possible integration\
    \ of citizen science.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; wireless sensor network;\
    \ affordable digital data infrastructure;\ntechnology assist in smallholder data\
    \ acquisition; smart agriculture\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture contributes more\
    \ than 25% to the gross domestic product (GDP) [1] and\n55% to employment opportunities\
    \ in developing countries [2]. It is thus a prominent sector\nto target poverty\
    \ reduction, and is crucial for economic global policy-making. Smallholder\nfarming\
    \ forms a signiﬁcant component of this sector with a food production rate of more\n\
    than 70% globally and more than 60% in developing countries [3]. For instance,\
    \ in Ethiopia,\nsmallholder farming accounts for about 95% of total agricultural\
    \ production of the coun-\ntry [4]. An estimated 2.5 billion people practice smallholder\
    \ agriculture and, in doing so,\nmanage about 510 million farms [5].\nSmallholder\
    \ farmers often own a fragment of farmland and operate under perilous\nconditions\
    \ due to their heavy reliance on ecosystem services that can be scarce and poten-\n\
    tially show signs of degradation [6,7]. Unpredictable and extreme weather conditions\
    \ may\nbring drought or ﬂooding, which lead to soil erosion and depletion, hindering\
    \ farms from\noperating at full potential [8]. The limited ﬁnancial capacity of\
    \ smallholder farmers also\nmeans that their investments in yield-improving mechanisms\
    \ are restricted. As a result,\nan area of focus in these communities is an affordable\
    \ means to increase farm production\nwith efﬁcient and sustained utilization of\
    \ available resources [6].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22093273\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n2 of 31\nThe development\
    \ of context-speciﬁc solutions is critical to improve and sustain better\nproduction\
    \ by smallholders. It is important to invest in agricultural practices that can,\
    \ not\nonly provide for future generations, but are also climate-resilient [9,10].\
    \ Such approach\nrequires a data richness that comes directly from the farm allowing\
    \ informed decision-\nmaking on issues such as how to prepare land, what to plant,\
    \ how much to consume and\nhow much to sell or store [11]. Real-time information\
    \ on farming systems, soil and crop\nhealth, water management, livestock management,\
    \ and agro-climatic attributes such as\nrainfall and soil moisture could enable\
    \ smallholder farmers to practice more sustainably\nand increase their productivity.\n\
    Sustainable agriculture consists of practices that opt to meet present and future\
    \ food\ndemands while fulﬁlling social and economic equity, protecting environmental\
    \ health\nand increasing proﬁtability [9,12,13]. Sustainable agriculture and optimization\
    \ of farm\nyield needs better understanding of local and farm level contexts of\
    \ farm production\nand productivity parameters, of which some are variable in\
    \ space and over time. At the\nsame time, most smallholder farms are found in\
    \ rural areas, which often display poor\ninfrastructure and sites are often inaccessible,\
    \ challenging the collection of these data. As a\nresult, information produced\
    \ is rarely complete and often does not quite ﬁt with farm levels.\nEven when\
    \ data are available it is commonly outdated and not representative of current\n\
    situations. Consequently, intuitive farming decisions and traditional farm practices\
    \ persist\namong associated communities and cause over-exploitation of the scarce\
    \ resources leading\nto poor production [14]. Thus, viable technological approaches\
    \ that are easily adoptable\nand reliable are needed for the efﬁcient acquisition\
    \ of in situ farm data. With proper\nenabling tools, such data can be obtained\
    \ affordably [11].\nRecently, with the advent of technology and powerful computing\
    \ infrastructures, it\nhas become possible to obtain, analyze, and generate sound\
    \ agricultural information in a\ncost-effective and timely manner. Remote sensing\
    \ (RS), proximal sensing (PS) and in-ﬁeld\nsensing (IfS) paved the way for enhanced\
    \ data acquisition complementing conventional\napproaches such as survey and physical\
    \ ﬁeld observation [15,16]. A detailed discussion of\neach approach is presented\
    \ in Section 3. The large spatial and temporal coverage and recent\nadvances in\
    \ high-resolution imagery, has made satellite technology indispensable to capture\n\
    farm-related data remotely. Recent works have shown how RS platforms like Sentinel-1/-2\n\
    and MODIS can be used to efﬁciently capture farm data [17–19]. PS technology,\
    \ with more\ncloser look than RS, is effectively utilized for better farm observation,\
    \ agricultural disaster\nmanagement, and agricultural land classiﬁcation [20,21].\
    \ IfS with spatially dispersed\nnetwork of small, inexpensive, and efﬁcient sensing\
    \ devices, known as wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) has created opportunities for precise farm\nmonitoring [22,23].\nVarious\
    \ authors have reported the effective utilization of WSN and IoT for soil data\n\
    collection in large-scale farming [24–27]. It remains unclear how effective the\
    \ case can\nbe in smallholder agriculture. Thus, this paper aims to establish\
    \ scientiﬁc understand-\ning concerning:\n1.\nWhether IoT and WSN can also be\
    \ used and potentially beneﬁt smallholder farming\n2.\nWhether the immediate data\
    \ needs of the smallholder farmer are addressed, and\n3.\nWhich design and implementation\
    \ issues need to be considered for IoT and WSN\napplication in smallholder agriculture.\n\
    To this effect, we analyze literature on the state-of-the-art over the past ten\
    \ years,\n2011–2021. The analysis is done through a comprehensive literature review\
    \ and presented\nin sections below. The paper summarizes prior research work,\
    \ explores key limitations\nand prospects, and identiﬁes knowledge gaps. This\
    \ work also proposes a high-level,\nWSN-based IoT architecture for agricultural\
    \ application and discusses the challenges and\nopportunities related to IoT implementation\
    \ in smallholder agriculture. Published journals,\nwhite papers, conference proceedings\
    \ and real systems are the inputs to our work.\nThe remainder of this paper is\
    \ organized as follows. Section 2 describes the unique\ncharacteristics of smallholder\
    \ farms and the main factors affecting their productivity.\nSensors 2022, 22,\

    Smallholder farmers are often characterized as being conservative, tech-resistant\
    \ and\nshowing a low adoption rate to innovations [28]. It is important to understand\
    \ the root\ncauses for these which may lie in the community. With this knowledge,\
    \ we may avoid\nthe incongruity between technology adoption and actual farmers’\
    \ conditions. Certain\nfarm or farming characteristics are common amongst smallholders\
    \ and distinguish them\nfrom large-scale enterprise farming. Almost by deﬁnition,\
    \ land size is a key property.\nBased on this, smallholder farms are those practiced\
    \ on a small portion of land, 2 ha on\naverage [7,29]. Most smallholder farms\
    \ are also known to practice farming on the basis\nof natural biophysical conditions\
    \ to crop growth, such as rain [29], and to apply a mix of\ncrop growing and livestock\
    \ breeding. However, the extent of these characteristics may vary\nwith demographic\
    \ and economic conditions of the location, the ecological zone and other\nterrain\
    \ parameters [7]. A systematic, multi-criterion deﬁnition needs to be formulated\
    \ from\nsimilar characteristics exhibited by the farmers. These characteristics\
    \ can be categorized in\nfour dimensions:\n•\nSocial attitude;\n•\nThe use of\
    \ resources and infrastructure;\n•\nAwareness and preparedness;\n•\nProductivity.\n\
    2.1. Social Attitude\nFamily ownership, subsistence farming, risk avoidance, communal\
    \ information needs\nand reliance on extension services are social characteristics\
    \ of smallholder farms. Most\nsmallholder farms are run by a family and mostly\
    \ for the family’s subsistence with small\nproduction [7]. The condition of total\
    \ dependence on the farm to feed the family creates atti-\ntudes of considerable\
    \ risk avoidance and resistance to costly farming practices with farmers.\nConsequently,\
    \ there is slow adoption of technology and new farming approaches [28]. In-\n\
    stead, low-return but sustained production practice is preferred over technology-supported\n\
    farming by most smallholders [7].\nSome forms of information provide added value\
    \ when shared amongst members\nof the farmer community. Adjacent plots owned by\
    \ different smallholders will often be\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n4 of 31\nunder\
    \ similar farming practices and communication between neighbor farmers is more\n\
    readily trusted. As a result, relevant information emerging in the community may\
    \ get\ncommunal use. Agricultural extension workers also assist farmers through\
    \ community\nlevel knowledge transfer regarding improved farm management, input\
    \ application and\nother tasks towards better productivity. They serve as a bridge\
    \ to pass on higher level\ndecisions to farmers and oversee their implementation.\
    \ This makes smallholder farms\nhighly dependent on extension workers for information\
    \ and know-how.\n2.2. Resource Usage and Infrastructure\nSmall farm size, farming\
    \ practices with mixed crops, limited access to ﬁnance and\nweak transport, communication\
    \ and on-farm infrastructure are conditions familiar to most\nsmallholder farms.\
    \ A farm’s land may be further split into smaller but discontinuous plots\nwhere\
    \ different crops are cultivated. This practice expresses a risk mitigation mechanism\
    \ to\nstabilize farm income and reduce the impact of failure shocks, even when\
    \ it is reported to\nhave negative correlation with yields [30]. Diverse cropping\
    \ on fragmented lands causes\ncomplications for technological assistance and innovation,\
    \ for one because plot and crop\nrequirements may vary. The required investments\
    \ make farmers resistant to such changes,\nwhich are better suited to and have\
    \ often been developed for larger-scale farming.\nTheir limited ﬁnancial capacity\
    \ also makes farmers less interested in technological\ninvestments. They heavily\
    \ rely on farming and have minimal or no alternative source of\nincome [7]. Most\
    \ farms are remote and suffer from poor physical and institutional infras-\ntructure\
    \ in provision of electric power, road access, irrigation, communication networks,\n\
    and access to social services [31]. These challenges hinder successful implementation\
    \ of\nagricultural innovation.\n2.3. Awareness and Preparedness\nIn the absence\
    \ of agricultural information systems, smallholders are vulnerable to\nnatural\
    \ hazards. Water excess or scarcity are particularly dangerous because most farms\n\
    apply rain-fed practices. Adoption of agricultural innovation and technology is\
    \ hard to\nachieve without systematic assistance and training. In addition, the\
    \ generally low literacy\nrate of smallholders causes low awareness and preparedness\
    \ for on-farm solutions. This\nrequires attention to be paid to minimal initial\
    \ investment level, ease of use, sensitivity to\nculture, language and other acceptance\
    \ barriers. Fuelled by scientiﬁc ﬁnds, it is crucial to\nexpand rural education\
    \ and regular capacity building of extension workers.\n2.4. Low Productivity\n\
    Various socio-economic, environmental and biophysical factors often correlate\
    \ strongly\nwith production levels of smallholders. They include genetically determined\
    \ behavior of\ncrops, soil properties, climate conditions, topography, farm ﬁnancial\
    \ status and illiteracy.\nWeak land management practices [32], the volume of family\
    \ labor [33] and uninformed\nuse of farm inputs are also factors that contribute\
    \ to poor farm productivity. The low\nproductivity is also often exacerbated by\
    \ crop disease and pests [34,35]. In addition to the\ninculcated effect of the\
    \ above factors, scarce research and development activities and lack\nof accurate\
    \ and timely information negatively impact farm yields [36,37].\nIt is worth noting\
    \ that these factors do not equally impact farming across all small-\nholder landscapes.\
    \ Their role and severity vary with micro-climate, region, and agro-\necological\
    \ zone. Understanding them as root causes within the space-time variability is\n\
    critical for ﬁnding contextual solutions. Our review, as discussed in Section\
    \ 5.2, reveals soil\n(in its various properties) as the most central attribute\
    \ that impacts agricultural production.\nWe should thus strive to obtain accurate\
    \ on-farm information about relevant soil properties\nto allow valuable diagnostics.\n\
    Considering the aforementioned characteristics, smallholder farms can be deﬁned\n\
    as: family-run, small farms that are often fragmented into disjoint plots, that\
    \ are nature-dependent\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n5 of 31\nand have limited operational\
    \ budget, limited information access and technology support, and often\ndisplay\
    \ low production levels.\n3. Data Acquisition in Smallholder Agriculture\nComprehensive\
    \ data on farm inputs, natural resource utilization, and environmental\nand biophysical\
    \ attributes is required to assist in improving farming. There are four possible\n\
    ways to acquire both technical and socio-economic data at the smallholder farm\
    \ level. These\nare: conventional, or by remote sensing, proximal sensing and\
    \ in-ﬁeld sensing.\n•\nConventional data collection Interviews, focus group discussions,\
    \ surveys, sam-\nple collections and observations, on-farm trials and yield measurements\
    \ are the\nconventional primary data collection approaches used in agronomic research\
    \ and\nprojects [38–40]. These are techniques for which physical presence of the\
    \ data col-\nlector is needed, and they demand high resource mobilization, especially\
    \ human\nlabor. Sample collection, on-farm trials, observations and measurements\
    \ are used\nto collect physical data such as soil properties and fertility, crop\
    \ condition and yield\nestimates, while interviews, focus group discussions and\
    \ surveys can be used for socio-\neconomic data collection. In general, these\
    \ data collection techniques exhibit a number\nof challenges. (i) Prolonged collection\
    \ period to capture precisely spatio-temporal\nvariability [41]; (ii) non-traceability\
    \ as most smallholders have little formal education\nand do not keep written records\
    \ of parameters during farm work, leading to lack of\nevidence; (iii) data collection\
    \ is considered intrusive and less-trusted by farmers as the\nactivities are mostly\
    \ non-participatory and thus less transparent [40]. Collected data\nmay be biased\
    \ due to misinformed collectors or the use of poor sampling schemes.\nThis may\
    \ result in incomplete data with quality problems, subsequently leading to\nincorrect\
    \ conclusions. However, with careful and proper execution, conventional tools\n\
    are crucial for calibration and other statistical analytic purposes [38]. Such\
    \ data may\nalso complement and/or validate secondary data used in decision-making\
    \ systems.\n•\nRemote sensing Recent research efforts have shown the potential\
    \ of RS and GIS\ntechnologies for monitoring smallholder farms and ﬁlling data\
    \ gaps [42,43]. RS uses\nspace-borne and airborne systems and generates valuable\
    \ data such as crop phenotype,\ngrowth stages and crop health issues, soil type,\
    \ soil moisture and farm input uses [44].\nThe potential of RS to assess crop\
    \ and soil properties, and farm inputs is demonstrated\nin [17,19,43,45,46]. The\
    \ actual application of these tools is uncommon in developing\ncountries. The\
    \ lack of ground truth data, the high learning curve to understand\nand use the\
    \ outcomes, the coarse spectral resolution as well as lack of appropriate\ntraining\
    \ are reasons for their limited use. Small and fragmented farms, vegetation\n\
    heterogeneity, and atmospheric conditions also diminish quality and usefulness\
    \ of RS\ndata [47,48]. Nonetheless, RS has high potential in complementing conventional\
    \ data\ncollection approaches and holds promise to assist sustainable farming\
    \ practices.\n•\nProximal sensing A closer look at a farm ﬁeld can be achieved\
    \ with PS; sensors\npositioned approx. 2 m above the ﬁeld surface then capture\
    \ data [49]. A number of\nagricultural parameters including soil properties, crop\
    \ growth metrics and farm inputs\ncan be acquired through this platform [50,51].This\
    \ is done by electromagnetic sensors,\nground penetrating radar (GPR) and gamma-ray\
    \ spectrometry sensors [15,47]. PS\nsensors are typically mounted on tractors,\
    \ spreaders, sprayers or irrigation booms. PS\ntechnology is relatively economical,\
    \ more accurate and offers higher spectral resolution\nthan RS [52]. However,\
    \ low temporal resolution, labor intensity and signiﬁcant cost\nhinder full usability.\
    \ The scarcity or absence of mechanized farming vehicles is\nanother barrier to\
    \ utilization of PS. A review of both RS and PS technology in soil data\ncollection\
    \ and associated challenges is provided in [53].\n•\nIn-ﬁeld sensing IoT and WSN\
    \ can complement the above approaches and help min-\nimize their mentioned challenges.\
    \ IoT is a platform through which objects can be\ninterconnected to generate and\
    \ exchange relevant and valuable information. Objects\ncan be both physical and\
    \ virtual. WSN is at the heart of this platform enabling reliable\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n6 of 31\ninteraction between dispersedly located objects. IoT and\
    \ WSN have application in\nthe broader agricultural domain. Monitoring, tracking,\
    \ automation, and precision\nagriculture can be mentioned in this context. Several\
    \ projects are known in the de-\nveloped world: the EU’s Food and Farm 2020 project,\
    \ the Kansas water preservation\nthrough sensors, and NanoGanesh are a few examples\
    \ [54]. The NanoGanesh project,\nfor instance, is an irrigation automation system\
    \ that creates mobile-based remote\ncontrol for water pumps and water tanks using\
    \ sensor information. The project helps\nfarmers to control water pumps, their\
    \ power supply, and provides vandalism alerts\nof ﬁeld-deployed equipment. Other\
    \ projects have designed affordable, all-inclusive\nfarm improvement mechanisms\
    \ that utilize IoT and WSNs [25,26,55,56]. Smallholder\nfarmers require information\
    \ and advice, down-scaled to the plot level, to improve their\npractice; stakeholders\
    \ such as agricultural extension agents, and (non-)governmental\naid organizations\
    \ also rely on such information for planning. The point-level data\noffered through\
    \ IoT and WSN makes the technology ﬁtting with only a limited number\nof sensors\
    \ per plot. Inexpensive sensors keep things affordable, also to smallholders.\n\
    In addition, IoT and WSN are simple and quick approaches for farm-level data collec-\n\
    tion that allow direct interpretation. Further discussion of IoT and WSN is presented\n\
    in Section 5.\n4. Literature Search Methodology\nAgriculture encompasses various\
    \ activities including crop farming and livestock\nbreeding. IoT and WSN can have\
    \ various applications in this broad domain including farm\nmonitoring, animal\
    \ tracking, and precision agriculture. Our literature search considered\nall these\
    \ sub-domains and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews\n\
    and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework as a standard [57]. The use of IoT and WSN\
    \ for\nagricultural applications was insigniﬁcant until around 2010 and has increased\
    \ signiﬁcantly\nsince then. Hence, we searched for publications in the years 2011–2021.\
    \ Research articles,\nsoftware and data publications, white papers and conference\

    \ Next, results were ﬁltered using the exclusion criteria mentioned in Table 1.\
    \ A ﬁrst\nlevel discrimination was based on the paper’s type, followed by title\

    \ relevant to our study, of which about 50% were in con-\nference proceedings.\
    \ Further analysis was carried out on these papers to understand the\nhardware\
    \ and technical details. Sensors and nodes used in the work, communication tech-\n\
    nologies, power sources and energy harvesting schemes, micro-controllers and transceivers\n\
    were speciﬁcally studied. Section 5 presents a detailed discussion of ﬁndings.\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n8 of 31\n5. IoT and WSN in Smallholder Agriculture\nWe\
    \ argued in Section 3 that IoT has sound justiﬁcation to assist in agriculture\
    \ data\ncollection and address the information gap that smallholder farms face.\
    \ Monitoring crops,\nsoil and weather at farm-level, continually and in (near)\
    \ real-time with reasonable cost\nmay provide closer insight into possible farm\
    \ investments for improved productivity.\nLivestock tracking, pest detection,\
    \ farm input application may support decision-making\nand better farm management\
    \ practice.Unfortunately the deployment areas where IoT is\nmost useful are also\
    \ those the technology is most vulnerable to theft, vandalism and other\nphysical\
    \ damages. Social awareness campaigns can help prevent this and enhance the\n\
    capability of a community to collect data that assist its agricultural practices.\
    \ With proper\ndesign and implementation considerations, smallholder farms can\
    \ be made to beneﬁt from\nthe technology. In line with this, We propose an IoT-WSN\
    \ architecture for agricultural\napplications. The proposed architecture is presented\
    \ in Figure 3 and it has ﬁve layers:\nsensing, control, backhaul, application\
    \ and decision layer.\n \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless \nWired, wireless\

    \ architecture for agricul-\nture applications (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM:\
    \ Livestock Management, WM: Weather Monitoring,\nPAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation\
    \ Monitoring).\nAs can be seen in the ﬁgure, the sensing layer comprises objects\
    \ used to monitor and\ninteract with agricultural elements such as soil, livestock\
    \ or crop. Measurement sensors\nand their controlling nodes are found on this\
    \ layer. Nodes run embedded instruction on\nwhen to measure which agriculture\
    \ elements through one or more sensors. Data collected\nfrom this layer needs\
    \ to reach the control layer through wired or wireless communication\nprotocols.\
    \ Data rate, power consumption and communication range are some important\nfactors\
    \ that affect the choice. Less power-hungry and optimal communication are required\n\
    in agriculture applications. Examples of wireless communication protocols are\
    \ presented\nin Table 2. In real agricultural ﬁelds’ deployment, communication\
    \ signal could be weak\ndue to environmental obstructions such as tree. This might\
    \ cause frequent communication\ninterruption between sensing layer and the control\
    \ layer with signiﬁcant data loss. Design\nand/or implementation considerations\
    \ such as obstruction-aware deployment scheme or\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n9 of\
    \ 31\nnode’s temporary data buffering scheme are required. The control layer is\
    \ responsible for\naggregation of received data and transfer to the back end system.\
    \ It also controls actions\nof actuators through decisions coming from the back\
    \ end system. Based on the device’s\ncapability and application requirement, this\
    \ layer can be setup to perform additional\ntasks such as controlling the frequency\
    \ and time of data reading by sensor nodes and\ndata buffering. A node with higher\
    \ processing and communication capability is setup at\nthis layer. This node is\
    \ often referred as gateway and supports different communication\nprotocols. The\
    \ backhaul layer bridges the communication between the resource-constrained\n\
    gateway device and relatively resource-rich back end system. It manages the underlying\n\
    network and application communication protocols between gateway and network server\n\
    and between the network server and application server. In the later case, the\
    \ communication\nprotocols can be synchronous as in Message Queuing Telemetry\
    \ Transport (MQTT) or\nasynchronous as in Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).\
    \ The network communication\nprotocol can be the reliable Transport Control Protocol\
    \ (TCP) or the efﬁcient User Datagram\nProtocol (UDP). In both cases, the protocol\
    \ choice depends on energy-efﬁciency, inter-\noperability and resource need. It\
    \ is possible for this communication to be disrupted due to\nunstable communication\
    \ infrastructure. Alternatives that could withstand such disruptions\nmay need\
    \ to be identiﬁed. The application layer deﬁnes the business rules and required\n\
    functionality of the agriculture application. This layer also creates the required\
    \ seamless\nintegration of data coming from heterogeneous sensors. Finally, the\
    \ decision layer performs\nanalysis of data received from devices based on the\
    \ business rules and user requirements.\nData analysis, report generation and\
    \ decision support all happen in this layer. The type of\ninformation that is\
    \ generated, target stakeholders, information re/presentation and delivery\ninterface\
    \ are all decisions that must be addressed at the level of this layer. The application\n\
    and decision layers shall address requirements of a speciﬁc agriculture application\
    \ domain\nand answer all users’ needs. This trickles down and dictate the type\
    \ and number of nodes\nto deploy at the sensing layer as well as the timing and\
    \ amount of data to read. Usefulness\nof decisions made at these two layers also\
    \ heavily rely on the quality of data generated at\nlower layers. Hence, data\
    \ validation and quality assurance measures needs to be in place\nat the lower\
    \ layers.\nTable 2. Wireless communication technology comparison with example.\n\

    tion operation. Important types of wireless communication technology are presented\
    \ in\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n10 of 31\nTable 2. Minimal operational resource\
    \ needs, scalability, long data range, high resistance\nto signal interference,\
    \ simple operation and maintenance requirements are critical criteria\nwhen choosing\
    \ a wireless communication technology for such environments.\nOur analysis reveals\
    \ that use of IoT and WSN in smallholder farming evolves around\nthe following\
    \ issues:\n•\nPurpose;\n•\nSensor deployment and implementation;\n•\nCommunication\
    \ technology;\n•\nPower sources;\n•\nComputing analysis;\n•\nQuality assurance.\n\
    We elaborate on these below.\n5.1. Purpose\nAgricultural productivity depends\
    \ on multiple parameters: those of soil, weather, crop\nand other farm management\
    \ practices especially. Careful investigation is, thus, required\nto identify\
    \ those parameters with most impact, to allow tuning farming practices through\n\
    continuous monitoring and analysis.\nFour areas have been associated by the research\
    \ community with the use of IoT and\nWSN in smallholder agriculture: precision\
    \ agriculture (PA), weather monitoring (WM),\npest and animal infestation monitoring\
    \ (PAIM) and livestock management (LM). In preci-\nsion agriculture, work focuses\
    \ on automatic irrigation, fertilization and other farm input\nmanagement actions.\
    \ PA aims at precise and efﬁcient use of agricultural inputs for optimal\nproduction.\
    \ The precision addresses dosage, application location or timing. Irrigation\n\
    management, using monitored soil data from sensors, and deploying actuators contributes\n\
    to efﬁcient and timely water utilization [59,62,65,66,68,69,73,77,90,99,103,108–110].\
    \ Moni-\ntoring of soil nutrients and soil moisture content helps control fertilizer\
    \ application and\npromotes the optimal use of other natural resources [67,75,87,98,101,111].\n\
    In areas with poor coverage, Weather monitoring can potentially benefit from IoT\
    \ and\nWSNs through sensor-based micro-climate weather stations [70,82,83,89,94,105,112].\
    \ Weather\ndata by itself does not fully predict crop performance because other\
    \ variables are also in\nplay. The correct approach is to integrate with other\
    \ agro-climatic variables [67,88,105,113].\nCorrelation between soil moisture,\
    \ air temperature and humidity, and other environmental\nvariables needs to be\
    \ analyzed for agricultural applications. Existing agro-meteorological\ndata collection\
    \ infrastructures in smallholder context are at best sparse. This is mainly\n\
    because of budget constraints. As a result, the quality and quantity of produced\
    \ data are\npoor [83,94]. Setting up automatic weather stations through WSN may\
    \ complement these\nweather stations. In addition to being cost-effective, they\
    \ can be deployed densely to pro-\nduce data of better spatial resolution, and\
    \ can be conﬁgured to acquire data autonomously\nat small time intervals. This\
    \ brings value in agricultural early warning systems.\nThe third area in which\
    \ IoT and WSN is used in smallholder agriculture is pest and\nanimal infestation\
    \ monitoring. Crop pests and diseases and unwanted animal visits to\nfarmlands\
    \ are known causes of crop loss. Both wild and domestic animals pose such threats\n\
    and farmers can beneﬁt from real-time monitoring of animal visits to ﬁelds. Knowing\n\
    a crop’s resource requirements at the different growth stages and timely observation\
    \ of\nleave color changes may reduce crop failure caused by pests and diseases.\
    \ Temperature\nand motion sensors can capture data relevant to these problems.\
    \ IoT and WSN can help\nto set up a sensor network cost-effectively and to the\
    \ required precision and temporal\nscale [60,61,81,92,93,114,115].\nLivestock\
    \ management is the fourth area that may beneﬁt from IoT and WSN technol-\nogy\
    \ [79,80,86,104,116–119]. Most smallholders practice mixed crop farming in combination\n\
    with livestock breeding. The livestock may be as important as the crops. It is\
    \ mostly an\nincome source but it can also be a source for the household’s dietary\
    \ needs. Tracking of\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n11 of 31\ncattle, monitoring animal\
    \ health and safety of feedlots and barns, and monitoring body\nchanges can become\
    \ sensor-based.\nAmong the 53 papers reviewed, we found that PA is researched\
    \ widely with about\n64% of the works targeting it, as shown in Figure 4. The\
    \ classes in that ﬁgure are not\nmutually exclusive as some papers address more\
    \ than one application domain, as discussed\nin Section 5.1 and reported in [91,99].\
    \ Most data collected was used in water management\nand irrigation. Since smallholder\
    \ farms mostly apply rain-fed practices, other use cases\nthat address the much\
    \ needed information of the community shall be sought. These can be\ndeciding\
    \ which crop to plant, the sowing time and pest management [98,120,121]. Weather\n\
    sensor data may also help in situations like drought. Precise information on such\
    \ and\noptimal utilization of other existing farm resources is, thus, also of\
    \ paramount importance\nto this community.\n60%\n10%\n14%\n16%\nPA\nLM\nWM\nPAIM\n\

    \ uses of IoT-WSN\nin smallholder agriculture (PA:Precision Agriculture, LM: Livestock\
    \ Management, WM: Weather\nMonitoring, PAIM: Pest and Animal Infestation Monitoring);\
    \ classes may be mutually overlapping.\n5.2. Sensor Deployment Schemes\nMultiple\
    \ sensors make up a WSN. Sensor deployment in agriculture requires a\ncareful\
    \ design that takes into account the spatio-temporal variability of the parameters\n\
    of interest. For instance, soil moisture may display high spatial and temporal\
    \ variability\nwhile crop growth tends to be slow and monotonic over time, and\
    \ has higher predictability.\nAppropriate sensor deployment shall address such\
    \ variability. It also determines the\nnumber of devices to be used, with budget\
    \ implications. Moreover, some agricultural\nparameters, like soil moisture and\
    \ crop root growth, exhibit spatial variability over different\nsoil depths. Optimal\
    \ placement of sensors is required to address such requirements and\noptimization\
    \ of performance and coverage of the WSN [111].\nWork by [72] presents WSN deployment\
    \ from three perspectives: node movement\n(dynamic, static, hybrid), node type\
    \ (homogeneous, heterogeneous) and system hierarchy\n(single-tier, multi-tier).\
    \ In static node deployment, nodes are placed in a ﬁxed position\nfor the entire\
    \ sensing duration [122]. The dynamic node set-up allows mobility of nodes,\n\
    and a hybrid set-up integrates static and dynamic nodes. Homogeneous nodes are\
    \ those\nwith near-identical characteristics while heterogeneous nodes differ\
    \ in computation power,\nsensing capability and/or transceiver units. A tiered\
    \ hierarchy organizes nodes into clusters\nto extend the spatial coverage with\
    \ the same [123] or a different [122] number of nodes\nin each cluster. Sensor\
    \ placement in WSN typically follows a random [122] or grid-based\napproach [75,106,111].\
    \ In the ﬁrst, nodes are distributed randomly over the target location.\nIn a\
    \ grid-based set-up, nodes are arranged in a regular equidistant way, placed at\
    \ the edge\nor center of the polygon [106,124,125]. As most reviewed papers are\
    \ experimental, little\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n12 of 31\nis discussed regarding\
    \ node placement. A few papers mention cluster-based static sensor\nplacement\
    \ [75,106], and in livestock monitoring, nodes are tied to moving animals.\nThe\
    \ number and type of sensors in a WSN for agriculture monitoring are speciﬁc\n\
    to the application theme or purpose. Sparse air temperature and humidity sensors\
    \ may\nsufﬁce to collect weather data at village-level. High sensor density is\
    \ needed with motion\nsensors in livestock monitoring, unless the purpose is to\
    \ follow group movements only.\nMeasurements from some sensors can also serve\
    \ multiple needs. For instance, relative\nhumidity can be used for weather analysis\
    \ and in crop pest manifestation assessment.\nA dense deployment of nodes with\
    \ high frequency data collection generates a large amount\nof data. However, such\
    \ affects the network’s lifetime and comes with budget implications.\nThe papers\
    \ we reviewed use different sensor types. In PA applications, soil water content\n\
    or soil temperature measurement are common while in livestock management animal\n\
    movement is required. Some sensor types are also commonly found among applications:\n\
    soil moisture and relative humidity sensors are frequently used, as shown in Figure\
    \ 5. Air\nand soil temperature sensors are also often deployed sensors while others\
    \ like light, CO2,\nlocation, soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil acidity\
    \ (pH), wind speed and direction are\nless often applied [79,80,82,83,86,92,94,101,110,111,118,126,127].\n\

    \ reviewed papers (N = 53) showing important types in small-\nholder agriculture.\
    \ Papers typically report multiple sensor types in use.\nMost agricultural parameters\
    \ require time-series monitoring. Expected parametric\ntemporal variability is\
    \ the key factor to determine sensor reading frequency and period; in\nprinciple,\
    \ one wants to capture each signiﬁcant parameter value change. An additional\n\
    concern is especially the daily cycle in the sensor’s ambient conditions, which\
    \ may nega-\ntively impact comparability of sensor readings. Thus, sensors should\
    \ collect data at ﬁxed\nmoments in the day, where it needs to be understood that\
    \ ‘at 7 a.m.’ and ‘one hour after\nsunrise’ are different notions of time ﬁxation.\
    \ Still, post-processing of sensor data should\nanalyze whether the day/night\
    \ rhythm is manifest in the data, and how, if so, to correct\nfor it.\nIn PA,\
    \ for instance, as plants grow their demand for resources evolves. It may thus\
    \ be\nbeneﬁcial to monitor throughout the season for optimal production. In pest\
    \ monitoring,\nthe appropriate sensing period may fall between the ﬂowering and\
    \ senescence phases.\nFor some parameters, even within the active sensing window,\
    \ measurements are required\nmore frequently as, for instance, in soil moisture\
    \ compared to soil type [128]. In most\nreviewed papers, a data read frequency\
    \ may range between 15 and 30 min with no speciﬁc\njustiﬁcation. We observed more\
    \ emphasis given to the energy use efﬁciency of nodes and\nless focus to the efﬁcient\
    \ applicability of acquired data.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n13 of 31\nAs discussed\
    \ in Section 2, smallholder farms have communal data needs and similar\ncharacteristics\
    \ in weather and soil attributes. Thus, it is more cost-effective to deploy a\n\
    variety of sensors than a dense scatter of redundant sensors to obtain a more\
    \ holistic view.\nA WSN node can listen to multiple sensors as most reviewed papers\
    \ actually do. This helps\nto improve understanding of site-speciﬁc interplay\
    \ between parameters. It also simpliﬁes\ncommunication management when more nodes\
    \ are deployed. Overall, an efﬁcient sensor\ndeployment scheme for smallholder\
    \ agriculture shall give due consideration to wide area\ncoverage, efﬁcient power\
    \ use, extended network lifetime, reduced signal loss, low cost\nand reliable\
    \ data generation. It is also crucial to acquire all needed data to the required\n\
    spatial-temporal resolution. These are discussed in less detail in the reviewed\
    \ papers. Only\nsome projects mention a systematic node deployment strategy [73,75,88,100,111].\
    \ Most of\nweather monitoring projects follow the World Meteorology Organization\
    \ (WMO) standard\nto set up their network [82,83].\n5.3. Data Communication Approaches\n\
    Efﬁcient communication needs to be established between the sensing and control\
    \ layer\nas well as between control and backhaul layer for transmission of sensed\
    \ data. The advance-\nment of the wireless communication technology has brought\
    \ signiﬁcant breakthroughs in\nIoT. Radio frequency identiﬁers (RFID) and short-range\
    \ wireless communications have\nBluetooth and ad hoc WSNs as examples. Though\
    \ these technologies are known to have\nlow power requirements and can operate\
    \ for a considerable amount of time, most also have\nshort-range coverage and\
    \ are not suitable for wide spatial coverage applications such as\nagriculture\
    \ [129]. Cellular wireless networks can be used to address this limitation but\
    \ as\nIoT keeps growing and more objects become connected, network trafﬁc management\
    \ and\nsignal generation becomes a concern and requires further design improvements\
    \ [130,131].\nA recent communication technology that tries to overcome these limitations\
    \ is the\nLow-Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN). It elevates the short-range and\
    \ high cost of\npredecessor technology and can connect a wide domain of IoT applications.\
    \ LPWAN is\nsuitable for services with infrequent and small data exchange requirements.\
    \ However,\nit also spans wide spatial coverage with tolerable data loss, making\
    \ it appropriate for\napplications that target resource-constrained and remote\
    \ locations. Table 2 gives examples\nof wireless communication technology mostly\
    \ used in IoT.\nPreference trends for wireless communication technology in smallholder\
    \ agriculture\nover the past ten years are shown in Figure 6. As can be seen,\
    \ Zigbee and WiFi commu-\nnication protocols were predominantly used until recently,\
    \ while LoRa communication\nhas received more interest in the last three years.\
    \ Both Zigbee and WiFi have limited\nrange coverage but better data rates, making\
    \ them suitable for short- or medium-distance\napplications with high data needs.\
    \ The low duty cycle of the Zigbee protocol, which is an\noperational method of\
    \ reducing power consumption, and its large network size also made\nit preferred\
    \ in most smallholder agriculture applications [132,133]. A number of projects\n\
    also operate in standalone mode, a set-up in which a device acts both as a sensing\
    \ node\nand as controller or gateway.\nConsidering the backhaul communication\
    \ that allows gateways to transfer received\ndata to application servers, not\
    \ many alternatives exist in rural areas to cellular communi-\ncation. The penetration\
    \ of this technology has increased in developing countries reaching\nrural areas\
    \ [134–136]. Most publications use the technology for data transmission from\n\
    farms to central server. Trends in technology choice among the reviewed work is\
    \ shown\nin Figure 7. Despite wide penetration, cellular communication is frequently\
    \ unstable and\nunreliable in remote areas and may result in data loss. As a result,\
    \ more reliable options\nneed to be considered.\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n14 of\

    \ standards use in smallholder agriculture applications.\nThe choice of an efﬁcient\
    \ distribution and communication channel among sensing\nnodes is critical to achieve\
    \ energy efﬁciency and reliably collect data. It ensures that nodes\nhave increased\
    \ lifetime and regular responsiveness. To this end, a WSN mesh topology is\ncommon\
    \ among projects; a few mention the use of star topology [100,113] or a clustered\n\
    hierarchical topology [110]. In mesh network topology, nodes have routing capability\
    \ and\ncommunication can be established among each other. This allows reliable\
    \ data transmission\nand reduced data loss. It requires more power energy and\
    \ thus suitable for short range\ncommunication. In star topology, nodes are connected\
    \ to one central node with routing\ncapability, and make a star-like structure.\
    \ Child nodes transmit data to this central hub\nwith no guarantee of delivery.\
    \ The communication range between nodes and the sink shall\nthus be kept reasonable\
    \ or data could be lost. Clustered topology is a tree-like arrangement\nof two\
    \ or more star topology to enhance this communication range. The scale, deployment\n\
    environment and resource have a play on which topology to adopt.\n5.4. Energy\
    \ Sources and Saving\nAnother design consideration for IoT and WSN applications\
    \ in smallholder agriculture\nis the power consumption of devices as commonly\
    \ there is limited or no electricity access.\nA typical sensing node functional\
    \ set-up is shown in Figure 8: it has a radio transceiver,\na micro-controller\
    \ board that interfaces with sensors, and a power unit. Dependent on the\napplication,\
    \ a node can also have extra elements such as a power generator, mobilizer or\n\
    location ﬁnder [137].\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n15 of 31\n \nExternal  parts \n\

    Nodes can run on electricity mains, battery, or solar power. For nodes at the\
    \ sensing\nlayer, easily replaceable Li-Ion batteries are preferred power sources\
    \ because they are\naffordable and bring no technical complications. However,\
    \ frequent replacement is required\nand caution must be taken on the reliability\
    \ or quality of transmitted data due to their\nlimited lifetime. A work-around\
    \ is to apply an energy saving scheme such as sleep-and-\nawake [76,81,83]. This\
    \ allows reducing power consumption of nodes in idle state and\nthus extend battery\
    \ life. Solar power is also a promising option though it has seasonal\nﬂuctuations.\
    \ Nodes at the control layer need to run uninterrupted and require continuous,\n\
    reliable power supply. It also demands signiﬁcant power, which cannot be achieved\
    \ with\nsimple batteries. The wired electric mains is a sound source for such\
    \ requirements. It is,\nhowever, not always available and then solar panels [66,91,92,106,118,138],\
    \ rechargeable\nbatteries [81,84,93,94] or power banks [101] are the possible\
    \ options.\n5.5. Computational Analysis\nFor a systematic study and comparison\
    \ of approaches taken in the reviewed projects,\nwe used an idealized workﬂow\
    \ of a general data science project as presented in Figure 9. It\ndepicts a functional\
    \ action chain from data acquisition to decision-making and information\ndelivery.\
    \ It shows how data are produced, processed and presented (PPP) to stakeholders\n\
    at different operational levels.\n•\nData acquisition This entails the process\
    \ of what and how data are being collected.\nIn IoT and WSN set-ups, the data\
    \ acquisition layer focuses on parameter identiﬁcation,\ndevice selection and\
    \ set-up, communication network selection and establishment,\nand the data collection\
    \ phase itself. The sensing and control layers discussed in\nSection 5 are mapped\
    \ to this stage of data science.\n•\nData curation In this phase, data cleaning\
    \ and pre-processing of acquired sensor\ndata are conducted to improve its reliability.\
    \ Important tasks are ﬁltering, adding,\ndropping and transferring. It also handles\
    \ integration of data from different sensors,\nthrough well-deﬁned data mapping\
    \ algorithms. The heterogeneity of devices, oper-\nating platforms and absence\
    \ of de facto communication standards in IoT and WSN\ncommunication often obstruct\
    \ direct and full utilization of the technology. The syn-\ntactic and semantic\
    \ variations at hardware and software levels of the system pose\ninteroperability\
    \ and integration challenges [93]. Variation in data collection and rep-\nresentation,\
    \ different communication speciﬁcations such as transmission rate and\nbandwidth,\
    \ and data processing and presentation are issues to be addressed in this\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 3273\n16 of 31\ncontext. One of the critical functionality of a data\
    \ curation is, thus, facilitation of such\ndata integration. This phase is crucial\
    \ as the remaining action chains are dependent\non its outcome.\n•\nData processing\
    \ and analysis The data processing and analysis phase is where compu-\ntations\
    \ are executed on the raw, sensor data acquired from farms. These computations\n\
    can be classiﬁed into three general groups: (a) Simple, which is a threshold-based\n\
    if-then analysis that determines incidents as deviations from pre-deﬁned values;\n\
    (b) Statistical, that determines standard statistics such as regressions and ANOVA;\n\
    and (c) AI, which brings forecasting and prediction capabilities through advanced\n\
    mathematical and machine learning computations, using artiﬁcial neural network\n\
    (ANN), deep learning (DL) and other techniques. Operations executed in this phase\n\
    are based on speciﬁc application needs and shall assist the decision-making of\
    \ small-\nholder farms. It is responsible to produce usable knowledge from the\
    \ pre-processed\ndata passed to it.\n•\nInformation presentation and visualization\
    \ The presentation and visualization phase\nhandles the human–computer interaction\
    \ (HCI) and deﬁnes appropriate information\ndelivery mechanisms. It also handles\
    \ the information presentation format prescribed\nas suitable by the end user.\
    \ Three broad categories for presentation and data visual-\nization are: web-based,\
    \ application-based, and SMS- or alert-based. Web-based data\npresentation can\
    \ reach users through a stand-alone web page or as social media feeds,\nsuch as\
    \ tweets. The application-based information presentation uses a dedicated\nmobile\
    \ application developed and installed on the user’s smartphone. Both web-\nand\
    \ application-based mechanisms support graphical and textual data visualization\n\
    options and provide multi-language access. They do require regular internet access\n\
    and smart devices. The SMS information presentation is a text-based data delivery\n\
    that runs on regular phones and can present short alert information to users on\
    \ the\nfarm status and actions advised.\n•\nComputing environment This environment\
    \ determines the computing capabilities\nused in all stages of data processing.\
    \ Edge computing, cloud computing or private\ncomputing environments can be used\
    \ in agriculture data processing. The choice\nof platform depends on the application\
    \ needs and resource availability. In an IoT\nand WSN set-up for agriculture data\
    \ processing, edge computing can be ideal to\nprocess and disseminate information\
    \ to farmers in real-time. This is also advanta-\ngeous especially when network\
    \ communications are fragile, as can be the case in\nsmallholder farming. Edge\
    \ computing, however, may present challenges in deploy-\nment in resource-constrained\
    \ devices such as sensor nodes and may set limits to data\nprocessing implementations.\
    \ AI algorithms speciﬁcally need substantial computation,\nmemory and power resources,\
    \ which are usually scarce in a WSN. Edge comput-\ning also sets higher quality\
    \ requirements to the software as it is harder to upgrade\nonce deployed.\nCloud\
    \ computing offers rich resources to implement sophisticated and large data\n\
    processing algorithms and persistent storage. It also facilitates the re-usability\
    \ of open\ncloud solutions provided as software as a service (SaaS) or infrastructure\
    \ as a service\n(IaaS). However, accessibility and network bandwidth demand is\
    \ a concern in small-\nholder communities. A private server can be set up with\
    \ equivalent resource provision\nto a cloud computing with self-built data analysis\
    \ and presentation mechanisms.\n•\nQuality assurance These are associated tasks\
    \ that ensure overall data processing\nand information generation are of some\
    \ expected quality standard and ﬁt with user\nexpectations. It is a rigorous task\
    \ that needs to be present in every stage of data\nprocessing. During data acquisition,\
    \ some QA measures can be device testing and\ncalibration, and communication network\
    \ reliability and efﬁciency validation. QA\nduring the data curation and data\
    \ processing phases can be validation of data by\npre-processing algorithms in\
    \ terms of reliability, efﬁciency and optimality. A dearth\nof accurate baseline\
    \ data regarding different agriculture parameters challenges these\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 3273\n17 of 31\ntasks. Regardless, some quality assurance have to be in\
    \ place to ensure sensor data\nare reliable before further investigation and decision\
    \ support information generation.\nThe computing environment also needs to meet\
    \ required quality standards such as\nsecurity, reliability and accessibility.\n\

    The calibration of sensors is a critical step before actual deployment in agricultural\n\
    applications.Laboratory analysis, manual investigation and existing repositories\
    \ can serve\nas calibration value sources [76,87,94]. Often, up-to-date ground\
    \ truth data for most\nsmallholder agriculture is not available, thus requiring\
    \ alternatives. One alternative can be\nto compare redundant readings of a sensor\
    \ and formulation of a calibration value. In these\ncases, appropriate testing\
    \ and validation measures must be taken [76,79,82,83]. Outdoor\nIoT-WSN applications\
    \ to smallholder agriculture also need to address environmental effects\ncaused\
    \ by topography, climate and vegetation cover on data quality.\nAnother critical\
    \ point related to quality assurance is security and anomaly control. Se-\ncurity\
    \ is a challenge in IoT and WSN deployment in agriculture as it is distributed\
    \ through\nthe ecosystem and could happen at different levels. The fact that smallholder\
    \ farms are\nfound in uncontrolled and often inaccessible areas and the limited\
    \ literacy rates exacerbate\nthis problem. Security can be perceived from two\
    \ broad perspectives: external and internal.\nThe external security threats are\
    \ posed by outside factors such as physical device damage or\nvandalism, denial\
    \ of service (DoS) attacks, signal jamming and data fabrications. Internal\nsecurity\
    \ threats are anomalies that happen due to wrong data and processing step which\n\
    compromise the reliability and quality of information generated. Faults in data\
    \ acquiring\nand processing anomalies can be mentioned as internal security challenges.\
    \ Security breach\ncould also happen at device, communication or transaction level.\
    \ Physical and logical\nfailures of nodes, calibration problem, device’s lifetime\
    \ and deployment environment could\ncause anomaly in the sensed data. Communication\
    \ anomaly could happen due to weak\nsecurity enforcement, resource or bandwidth\
    \ competitions among nodes and noise attenu-\nation on the signal transported.\
    \ The inability to withstand harsh and resource-deprived\nenvironment could also\
    \ challenge the communication standard and result in anomalous\ndata. Ambient\
    \ temperature and rain pose physical damage risks to sensing nodes and may\naffect\
    \ data and signal quality; tree and crop canopy may compromise the communication\n\
    between sensors and gateway. Lack of proper data curation, and appropriate processing\n\
    model and algorithm could potentially lead to transaction anomaly and generate\
    \ unreliable\ninformation. All these security problems pose quality concerns to\
    \ the IoT and WSN gener-\nated data which inhibit its utilization to decision\
    \ supports. Careful consideration of such\nfactors is required before the IoT\
    \ and WSN deployment for agricultural applications. Water-\nproof and heat-resistant\
    \ cases for nodes, integration of external, omnidirectional antennas\nand/or placement\
    \ of nodes at appropriate height, utilization of appropriate software tools\n\
    are relevant design and implementation considerations.\nProper monitoring and\
    \ analysis schemes may determine the efﬁciency and reliability\nof the installed\
    \ technology. Moreover, appropriate anomaly detection and prevention\nalgorithms\
    \ need to be deployed at the different layers of the IoT WSN communication to\n\
    act accordingly and avoid wrong input to a decision making. Some WSN communication\n\
    standards such as Zigbee and LoRaWAN has added security layer to the protocol\
    \ to\nwithstand the communication security challenge [27]. Transactions can also\
    \ be validated at\napplication layer as presented in [62]. These authors have\
    \ used the block chain technology\nto enforce security measures on sensor generated\
    \ data at the application layer. Recent\ndevelopments in computation platforms\
    \ such as cloud, edge and fog computing can also\nbe utilized to add security\
    \ layers to an IoT system. Hardware, software and data protection\nschemes can\
    \ be realized at these platforms. Susceptibility of data to interference and\n\
    other security threats are likely to be reduced if data are processed near the\
    \ device as in\nedge or fog computing. These innovations can also enhance energy\
    \ efﬁciency of nodes\nand reduce bandwidth competition between signals and more.\
    \ These anomaly detection\ncan be executed either at an end node or gateway level.\
    \ Each end node can be set to\nmonitor all sensors connected to it and detect\
    \ anomalous properties, in real-time. However,\nthe limited processing and storage\
    \ capacity of these nodes might inhibit executing resource-\nintensive and precise\
    \ anomaly detection algorithms. End node anomaly detection are also\nunable to\
    \ identify communication anomalies that could possibly happen at the network\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n19 of 31\nlayer. A rather optimal anomaly identiﬁcation\
    \ can be executed at the gateway node level.\nAs discussed in Section 5, gateway\
    \ nodes have more storage and computational power\nand can serve as a more reliable\
    \ and robust security enforcement platform. In addition\nto its resource abundance,\
    \ the gateway node can also be set as a centralized anomaly\ndetection point for\
    \ both device and communication level anomalies. Such computation\ncapability\
    \ is well-suited to most smallholder agriculture applications as it eliminates\
    \ the\ncloud communication and computation needed for further decisions. The fact\
    \ that measures\ncan be taken in (near) real-time and using the already established\
    \ wireless communication\nmakes fog computing at the gateway level more promising.\
    \ For a bigger WSN setup with\nseveral and heterogeneous sub-networks and multiple\
    \ gateways, a more comprehensive\ncentralized anomaly detection can be carried\
    \ at higher level such as in cloud computing.\nAdvanced analytical and problem\
    \ identiﬁcation algorithms can also run efﬁciently on\nsuch platforms. A hybrid\

    6. Discussion\nIn our analysis, we found a signiﬁcant growth in research effort\
    \ in IoT and WSN\napplications for smallholder agriculture over the last decade,\
    \ with speed-up in the years\n2017–2019. Not much of this work has been deployed\
    \ in farm plots. Figure 10 shows\ndistribution of works in smallholder agricultural\
    \ application domains on different WSN de-\nployment environment over the last\
    \ decade. Most work was conducted only experimentally\nand much remains to be\
    \ done in actual deployment setting.\nAdvances in hardware, software and communication\
    \ technology as well as increased\nequipment availability are reasons for the\
    \ increased research interest. In real and outdoor\ndeployment, the gateway and\
    \ sensing nodes need to be dispersed, especially when a wider\nspatial coverage\
    \ is needed. Sensing nodes shall be placed at the farm without risk of loosing\n\
    of transmission. Additionally, gateway placement should consider stable power\
    \ provision\nand a trustworthy communication channel. In doing so, range and network\
    \ lifetime\nmaximization shall be given utmost considerations. We found no projects\
    \ that addressed\nthese requirements over a wide time span. Moreover, data and\
    \ system validation appear\nnot to receive much attention. Long-term behavior\
    \ of deployed systems and sensed data\nquality must be evaluated repeatedly to\
    \ demonstrate system reliability and usefulness. This\nwill establish conﬁdence\
    \ in any decision-making that utilizes the generated information.\nOnly a few\
    \ of the projects were found to have longer implementation and validation\nperiods\
    \ [26,73,79,82,83,88,93]. The remainder were pilot studies or proofs of concept\
    \ with a\nshort experimentation period of maximally a month.\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\

    \ period.\nLooking into the continental distribution of projects, Asia is the\
    \ front-runner (Figure 11)\nand this aligns with the global Information Communication\
    \ Technology (ICT) development\nindex report of the International Telecommunication\
    \ Unit (ITU) [141]. Asian countries are\nreported to have better ICT coverage\
    \ and utilization, also in rural areas. This implies that ac-\ntive research is\
    \ less challenged and equipment may be more readily available. Nonetheless,\n\
    research in Africa also shows promise. An interesting factor is the heterogeneity\
    \ of research\non the African continent. There seems to be an equivalent effort\
    \ in all types of smallholder\napplication, possibly due to equivalent importance\
    \ and impact on farm productivity. We\nalso observed, only 29% of the total projects\
    \ in Africa are deployed in real-ﬁeld while 50%\nand 21% are experimental and\
    \ simulation executed, respectively. This is also similar in\nAsia but Latin America\
    \ has better real-ﬁeld execution.\nAs discussed in Section 5.1, PA is researched\
    \ most widely and usually for the purpose\nof irrigation management. Smallholder\
    \ farms apply, however, mostly rain-fed practices\nwith limited or minimal irrigation\
    \ and so there is potential mismatch between farmer infor-\nSensors 2022, 22,\
    \ 3273\n21 of 31\nmation needs and produced information. The ubiquity of PA and\
    \ irrigation management\nmay imply two things. First, WSN and IoT implementation\
    \ and management is easy in\na conﬁned area, as in plot-level deployment. It can\
    \ provide precise data readings with a\nsmall number of sensors and few controlling\
    \ nodes. Secondly, the application will not fully\nutilize the data provided by\
    \ the technology. Further research on advanced data analysis is\nneeded as all\
    \ four domains may have signiﬁcant effects towards sustainable agriculture.\n\
    Even though irrigation is important for sustainable and productive farming, it\
    \ is not\nalways a solution to the poor productivity of these farmers. Instead,\
    \ research must focus\nmore on other key parameters such as soil nutrient monitoring\
    \ or early draught prediction.\nSuch can address the urgently needed data by smallholder\
    \ farms and assist sustained and\nefﬁcient utilization of those. Soil moisture\
    \ data, for instance, can be used beyond irrigation\ndecisions such as in pest\
    \ management, decisions in appropriate sowing time and crop\ntype to plant [98,120,121].\
    \ Information from weather sensors may help farmers to take\nappropriate measures\
    \ in situations like drought.\nExisting projects utilize off-the-shelf equipment.\
    \ Furthermore, in smallholder farmer\ncommunity, technical maintenance and operation\
    \ skills may not sufﬁce. In dense de-\nployment schemes, the equipment costs may\
    \ also become a sustenance bottleneck. Such\nconditions could affect farmer interest\
    \ to use the technology. Hence, it is important to\nconsider alternatives like\
    \ producing custom-made devices by integrating components that\nare open source,\
    \ simple, affordable and easily accessible. Non-proprietary Arduino or\nRaspberry\
    \ Pi (RPi) based node micro-controllers can ﬁt to this purpose. In addition to\
    \ being\nopen source, these hardware allows researchers to experiment with and\
    \ program for a ﬁt\nto the speciﬁc needs. A serious online community support also\
    \ adds to the advantage of\nusing open source devices. Table 4 shows micro-controllers\
    \ used among reviewed projects.\nAs can be seen in the table, most of the works\
    \ used Arduino and RPi while in rare cases\nothers like Atmega, MICA and Waspmote\
    \ are mentioned. Proprietary hardware comes\nwith pre-installed ﬁrmware that avoids\
    \ programming and other technical skills at the\nexpense of ﬂexibility and ease\
    \ of customization.\nTable 4. Major micro-controllers used in smallholder agriculture\

    \ mini-\nmize the needed budget and technical assistance. Training and empowering\
    \ members of\nthe community through hands-on and easily understandable materials,\
    \ following partic-\nipatory research where community members are included from\
    \ conception to execution\nand working with active projects in the area could\
    \ also be possible alternatives.\nOur review brings to light that Zigbee (35%)\
    \ and WiFi (31%) WSN communication\nstandards are common in smallholder agriculture.\
    \ As shown in Figure 10, most work\nis in indoor or experimental simulations,\
    \ and this explains the preference for these stan-\ndards. The signiﬁcant set-up\
    \ complexity and cost, limited area coverage and network\ninstability in Zigbee\
    \ and WiFi makes them less-ﬁtting to smallholder agriculture deploy-\nments. In\
    \ Figure 6, we show that recent experiments work with other WSN communication\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n22 of 31\ntechnologies, such as the Long range (LoRa)\
    \ LPWAN standard. This indicates future\npossibilities and rooms for emerging\
    \ WSN standards to be of use in the agriculture domain.\nFor gateway–server communication,\
    \ about 80% of the reviewed work used cellular\ncommunication while wired approach\
    \ is used in rest. They are legitimate choices for the\nsmallholder environment\
    \ though cellular communication is often unreliable. An alternative\nis to use\
    \ a micro-SD in the gateway for storage and later reading, to eliminate data loss\
    \ as\nwell as transmission mismatches. Edge computing (data processing at the\
    \ control layer) is\na recent technology that shall also be considered when communication\
    \ between gateway\nand server is challenged [142]. Communication standards used\
    \ for node–gateway and\ngateway–server among the reviewed works is presented in\
    \ Table 5.\nMost reviewed papers focused on establishing the WSN and on data acquisition.\n\
    The other computing actions deﬁned in Section 5.5 were discussed sparsely, as\
    \ shown in\nTable 3. Speciﬁcally, the data curation and quality assurance phases,\
    \ which are crucial for\nreliable information generation, were not specially described\
    \ in these works. Neither was\nmuch reported on usability of the collected data\
    \ or how such was used in real application\nanalysis. In the few papers that reported\
    \ on data analysis, approximately half used simple\ndata analysis, and a quarter\
    \ statistical and AI analysis. The typical analysis method\nreported was the determination\
    \ of a threshold value. For instance, to set an irrigation\ntrigger, a pre-deﬁned\
    \ soil water content level is checked against the sensor-derived soil\nmoisture\
    \ level. Or such could trigger an alert message regarding possible crop disease\
    \ that\nreaches farmers when the pre-set alert condition is met [60]. Although\
    \ these approaches\nare simple and require few computing resources, more precise\
    \ and robust applications\nrequire soft-coded implementations based on holistic\
    \ and exhaustive scenarios that are\nhard to handle with pre-sets. Proactive applications\
    \ of such type can also support reliable\nprediction and forecasting, which is\
    \ needed in many agriculture applications [23]. These\nmechanisms allow farmers\
    \ to acquire information ahead of time and be aware of what to\nanticipate on.\
    \ We postulate they may even come with a learning effect. This in turn will\n\
    prepare farmers for risks and spur them to explore alternative coping mechanisms.\n\

    \ also needs to reﬂect the spatio-temporal dynamics that\nexist on the farm and\
    \ that can only be met with advanced computational algorithms,\nsuch as using\
    \ AI. The work by [100] is a good example in this context. The authors\ndeveloped\
    \ an agricultural prediction system, capable of generating future complications\n\
    based on sensor-derived time-series data processed with the auto-regressive integrated\n\
    moving average (ARIMA) model. This model deploys probabilistic analysis of time-series\n\
    properties of parameters of interest. The forecasted information is veriﬁed against\
    \ pre-\nloaded information to generate decision support information. Threshold\
    \ values change\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n23 of 31\non the basis of forecasts,\
    \ and when the farmer makes adjustments such lead to periodical\nupdates of thresholds.\
    \ New computing paradigms such as integration of AI and IoT (AIoT)\nare expected\
    \ to revolutionize the data acquisition and processing in IoT applications. Future\n\
    research shall assess how such innovations can be effectively utilized in agriculture\
    \ domain.\nAmong the reviewed works, 31 papers reported on their computing environment\
    \ with\n70%, 21% and 9% in cloud, private and edge computing, respectively. Mostly\
    \ some cloud\nenvironment is used as a persistent data repository and/or data\
    \ visualization platform.\nAbout 30% of the 70% projects involving cloud computing\
    \ utilized SaaS and IaaS such\nas The Things Network or Things Speak. Web-based\
    \ data presentation is the preferred\nmode in these works (57%), while 26% and\
    \ 17% utilized mobile applications and SMS data\npresentation, respectively.\n\
    The use of low-cost sensors creates a need to calibrate sensor readings, following\n\
    speciﬁc implementation requirements. Only some projects were found to report on\
    \ calibra-\ntion issues [87,94]. Since most projects were experimental, sensors\
    \ were used as provided\nby vendors, in off-the-shelf mode. Implementations that\
    \ use sensor readings for actual\ndecision-making, however, shall take appropriate\
    \ test and calibration measures before\ndeployment and production. Humans are\
    \ indispensable in the process of sensor parameter\ninterpretation but none of\
    \ the projects that we reviewed appeared to have considered the\nhuman skills\
    \ component. We recommend that any platform should integrate humans with\nsensors\
    \ for inclusive perception and validation.\nWe also observed that soil chemical\
    \ composition and nutrient sensing is almost nonex-\nistent in reviewed work.\
    \ Research and industry communities need to collaborate to ﬁll\nsuch gaps and\
    \ produce sensors for the unaddressed essential farming factors.\n7. Challenges\n\
    Any innovation or technological intervention comes with challenges and opportuni-\n\
    ties. Especially when the application is in a remote or resource-constrained location\
    \ where\nliteracy and awareness are minimal, various limitations may prevent successful\
    \ implemen-\ntation. This requires a thorough study and analysis of these factors.\
    \ The following are some\nof these challenges that our analysis reveals.\n•\n\
    High investment costs: The investments needed to produce and deploy a WSN and\n\
    IoT system are signiﬁcant, which may not be affordable by most projects. Hardware\n\
    costs are those for gateway and sensor nodes, recurring IoT connection, and power\n\
    provision, while open source tools exist, realistic deployments may need commercial\n\
    cloud applications such as SAAS, which are a substantial cost factor.\n•\nLittle\
    \ awareness: Stakeholders in the agri-chain typically have limited knowledge of\n\
    recent technological innovations. This is a cause of resistance against acceptance\
    \ of\nIoT and sensor technology.\n•\nLow availability of tools and skilled personnel:\
    \ Most IoT and WSN equipment are\nnot produced in the developing countries. Operation\
    \ and maintenance of devices may\nrequire considerable knowledge, language and\
    \ professional skills. Such are often thin\non the ground and this hinders full\
    \ deployment and utilization.\n•\nRegulatory and policy gaps: Telecommunications\
    \ of many developing world coun-\ntries have no clear regulatory arrangement of\
    \ WSN and IoT implementations. The al-\nlowed Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical\
    \ (ISM) radio frequency range for WSN com-\nmunication is not set yet and no other\
    \ rules exist governing the use of frequency\nbandwidth. As a result, investments\
    \ are risky because node communication may\nbecome blocked or interrupted.\n•\n\
    Poor interoperability: IoT and WSN have evolved rapidly over the past ﬁve years.\n\
    A number of tools and platforms exist that can be used for the realization of\
    \ the\ntechnology. There is however no standard yet that guarantees their interoperability.\n\
    •\nLow data quality: WSN deployment often comes with exposure to extreme physical\n\
    conditions. This may cause reading faults and poor data quality. Sensor data reliability\n\
    may also be compromised by deployment errors. Incorrect calibration, inconsistent\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 3273\n24 of 31\npower supply and unreliable communications can\
    \ result in data errors such as outliers,\ndrifts and missing values.\n8. Conclusions\n\
    Most smallholder farms are known to be resource-constrained and remotely located\n\
    which causes sincere challenges in in situ data collection. Consequently, farm-related\n\
    data are unavailable or is only found in small quantity, often fragmented or outdated.\n\
    This leads to uninformed farming practices, and consequently poor production and\
    \ low\nyields. IoT and WSN may prove to be an assisting tool in addressing information\
    \ needs.\nMonitoring crops and soil at farm-scale and in (near) real-time with\
    \ reasonable cost may\nhelp to determine the investments needed to upscale productivity.\n\
    The objective of this study is to investigate the potential for actual use of\
    \ IoT and WSN\nin more data-intensive approaches to smallholder farm practices.\
    \ We focus on how the\ntechnology can acquire farm-speciﬁc and (near) real-time\
    \ data. The kinds of collected data,\nthe different application domains and the\
    \ alignment of research needs are also assessed.\nDesign and implementation considerations\
    \ in smallholder applications are explored as well.\nIoT and WSN have been put\
    \ in practice in large-scale commercial farms but seldomly\nin smallholder farming,\
    \ in spite of general agreement on its adaptability with reasonable\ncost [130,143,144].\
    \ Some promising demonstrations of this have been published. Existing\nworks are\
    \ mostly experimental and may still lack robustness for actual implementation.\n\
    Actual implementation requires trust in and robustness given that failure may\
    \ come with\nunacceptable economic consequences. As a result, investments should\
    \ be kept in check,\nand the usability of free and existing communication platforms\
    \ shall be explored with more\ncase studies and real applications.\nMoreover,\
    \ as most smallholder farms are nestled in poor infrastructural conditions,\n\
    ﬁt-for-all solutions do not typically work. Future work shall consider the poor\
    \ infrastruc-\nture and limited solution space that needs to be contextualized.\
    \ The limited or speciﬁc\nparameters being monitored in most existing projects\
    \ also imply that there is considerable\nroom to integrate additional physical\
    \ and chemical sensors. They may monitor weather,\nsoil, crop, pests, or provide\
    \ other data on farm inputs, their integration is essential. WSNs\nand related\
    \ technological interventions shall be implemented to set an acceptable stan-\n\
    dard of smart smallholder agriculture. Diverse and affordable sensors relevant\
    \ to farm\nproductivity, and applied in mass, may become essential.\nSecurity\
    \ is a topic mostly overlooked and in its early stage of research in IoT and WSN\n\
    application to agriculture [145,146]. Particularly, no work is found that addresses\
    \ this issue\namong the reviewed projects. The need to integrate various communication\
    \ standards,\ndevices and data as well as data accuracy and availability need\
    \ in smart agriculture makes\nsecurity a challenge. Some of the security issues\
    \ speciﬁc to agriculture and discussed in\nSection 5.6 exacerbate the severity\
    \ of the security challenge in this domain. Security threats\nexist at different\
    \ levels of the IoT ecosystem and encompass both physical and logical\nissues.\
    \ Data integrity, reliability, accuracy and availability are qualities expected\
    \ of a smart\nagriculture system. All these create extra demands and opportunities\
    \ for a rigorous and\nin-depth researches addressing the matter. The constrained\
    \ nature of IoT and WSN devices\nis a setback to practice complex and promising\
    \ security solutions and this needs to be\naddressed while proposing security\
    \ measures.\nAs most of the reviewed projects are rooted in the prototype stage,\
    \ no discussion on\nhow such security concerns are addressed is found. Most anomaly\
    \ detection algorithms\nrely on some well-deﬁned data and compare current situation\
    \ against this to detect any\ndeviation or changes. This requires a spatially\
    \ and temporally detailed and reliable data.\nHowever, the absence or sparsity\
    \ of farm-level information to use as a reference is a concern\nwhen it comes\
    \ to smallholder farms. The fact that anomalies and other security problems\n\
    potentially inculcate to unreliable decision support system urges for more attention\
    \ to the\ndomain. Hence, it is necessary to know the existing security vulnerabilities\
    \ and create\nmechanisms to mitigate the effects of incidents. Equal emphasis\
    \ shall be given to security\nSensors 2022, 22, 3273\n25 of 31\nmeasures as to\
    \ the deployment of the agriculture system. Selection of appropriate commu-\n\
    nication standards, layer/s of security measures implementation, level of security\
    \ need\nand appropriate security measures identiﬁcation shall be executed parallel\
    \ to the system’s\nfunctionality development. The usability of existing security\
    \ and anomaly management\ntechniques for IoT and WSN in agriculture is an open\
    \ challenge yet to be investigated.\nInteroperability and data abstraction are\
    \ two functionalities a data curation operation\nin agriculture application needs\
    \ to offer. Seamless integration of all data coming from\nvarious sources and\
    \ data conversion shall be handled on this phase. Open standards such\nas the\
    \ ones by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) provide common languages known\nas\
    \ sensor model language (SML) to deﬁne sensors and their processes, semantically\
    \ and\nreduce the syntactic heterogeneity of data representations [147]. Such\
    \ open standards\nsupport efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and provide\
    \ seamless integration of\nheterogeneous devices. It also allows users to interact\
    \ or access both raw and processed\ndata and reduce latency time. We believe relying\
    \ on such standard for any WSN setup\nhelps in avoiding and early identiﬁcation\
    \ of data anomalies. Such tools shall be explored\nmore and adopted to incorporate\
    \ these functionality to the data curation phase which is\nmissing in all the\
    \ reviewed works. The work by [93] is an exception which reports on\nutilizing\
    \ the OGC sensor web enablement (SWE) platform for their WSN setup.\nCost and\
    \ quality are important factors that inﬂuence such implementations and\nprojects\
    \ must focus on affordability and efﬁciency of technological innovations. The\
    \ in-\ntegration of human and electronic sensors can be one way to achieve these\
    \ requirements.\nA data acquisition platform that utilizes the most abundantly\
    \ found and precise sensors\nwithin the smallholder community, humans, along with\
    \ artiﬁcial sensors is effective for\na whole-sided and inclusive perception.\
    \ Humans’ read data can also be used to validate\nthe accuracy of sensors’ read\
    \ data. Geo-referencing sensing nodes is important to obtain\nlocation-speciﬁc\
    \ data and monitor farm-level spatial variability which is relevant in most\n\
    agricultural applications such as PA. Most applications reviewed, however, lack\
    \ such\ncapability and this remains a research gap to be ﬁlled.\nOne must note\
    \ the inherent limitations of IoT and WSN, which include limited spatial\ncoverage\
    \ and data quality. These need to be recognized and addressed. Consequently,\n\
    there is a need to augment with other data acquisition approaches [63,66,84,148].\
    \ Such a\ndata infrastructure must address required spatial and temporal scales.\
    \ This can be done\nwith complimentary approaches. The use of RS and participatory\
    \ tools alongside IoT and\nWSNs is of particular importance [66,149,150].\nCitizens’\
    \ abundance and capacity to generate as well as validate sensors’ acquired\ndata\
    \ could play a critical role at all stages of the farm data generation: from collection\
    \ to\nlogical decision making and interpretations. Human observations can be integrated\
    \ with\nWSNs to elevate the limited spatial coverage and enrich the data basket.\
    \ Some community\nmembers can also be used to communicate a rather complex ﬁndings\
    \ to farmers in a simple\nand usable forms [151]. These open doors to incorporate\
    \ citizens in any technological\ninterventions to bring about fully-ﬂedged, reliable,\
    \ sustainable and consumable product.\nSoil characteristics speciﬁcally are important\
    \ factors for improved farm yields and\nare must-have determinants for any intervention.\
    \ The spatial and temporal variability of\nsoil attributes needs to be understood,\
    \ both before and during the crop season, to help\nfarmers take appropriate measures.\
    \ Based on the ﬁndings of this paper, the authors are\nundertaking soil physical\
    \ and chemical properties monitoring and data collection research\nthrough sensors\
    \ deployment in two districts located in northern Ethiopia. An experimental\n\

  analysis: 'The proposed work presents the design and analysis of a circular slot
    with complementary split ring resonator (CS-CSRR) antenna for 5G applications.
    The antenna is designed on a substrate with a dielectric constant of 4.4 and a
    thickness of 1.6 mm. The antenna has a circular slot with a radius of 5 mm and
    a width of 1 mm. The CSRR is located on the ground plane and has a width of 1
    mm and a length of 5 mm. The antenna is simulated using a commercial electromagnetic
    simulation software. The simulated results show that the antenna has a resonant
    frequency of 3.5 GHz and a bandwidth of 100 MHz. The antenna has a gain of 4.6
    dBi and a radiation efficiency of 90%. The antenna is suitable for use in 5G applications
    such as mobile communications and wireless broadband access.

    The proposed antenna has several advantages over conventional microstrip patch
    antennas. First, the use of a circular slot instead of a rectangular slot reduces
    the antenna''s size. Second, the use of a CSRR on the ground plane improves the
    antenna''s gain and radiation efficiency. Third, the antenna is designed on a
    low-cost substrate, which makes it suitable for массовое production.

    The proposed antenna is a promising candidate for use in 5G applications. The
    antenna has a compact size, high gain, and low cost, making it suitable for various
    applications such as mobile communications and wireless broadband access.'

    \ types. In our proposed work, we classify dataset1 in 5 type of cancer and dataset2\
    \ in 6 type of cancer. The classification \nis performed when these datasets are\
    \ compatible with our classification method. So we perform pre-processing step\
    \ and then Particle Swarm \nOptimization is used for feature selection of each\
    \ gene. Now on basis of features, Support Vector Machine performs well to classify\

    \ \n \n \n1. \nINTRODUCTION TO BREAST CANCER \nThe scientific review led to recommendations\
    \ based on evidence on breast cancer screening for women of average risk, \nintermediate\
    \ and high. From the beginning, breast cancer has been fought with the rallying\
    \ cry of early detection. There is no \nknown exact cause of breast cancer, but\
    \ evidence suggests that it must be caused by a combination of inherited and \n\
    environmental factors. Our current scientific knowledge of the disease hampers\
    \ efforts to prevent breast cancer. Many \nestablished breast cancer risk factors,\
    \ such as being a woman, age, breast density, family background, heredity, or\
    \ a past breast \ncancer diagnosis, cannot be changed. \nPositively, research\
    \ shows that maintaining a healthy body weight, engaging in physical activity,\
    \ eating sensibly, and limiting \nalcohol intake can all lower the risk of developing\
    \ breast cancer. However, early detection has been the foundation of hope and\
    \ \naction for breast cancer because personal risk reduction is still not a guarantee.\
    \ Early detection will continue to be our top \nstrategy for lowering breast cancer-related\
    \ death and sickness until we can successfully prevent the disease. \nBreast cancer\
    \ detection is the process of diagnosing the disease earlier than would otherwise\
    \ be the case. Breast cancer \nscreening, also known as secondary prevention,\
    \ is the routine testing of people who do not have any symptoms with the goal\
    \ of \nfinding breast cancer as early as possible so that appropriate treatment\
    \ can be provided. Breast cancer mortality in Canada has \ndecreased by an estimated\
    \ 25–30% since the late 1980s due to the introduction of breast cancer screening.\
    \ \nThe recommendations suggest specific technologies for each of the three risk\
    \ groups. Digital or film mammography is specified \nfor average-risk women, digital\
    \ supplemented by ultrasound in intermediate- risk women, and digital supplemented\
    \ by MRI in \nhigh-risk women. The differences in technologies are related to\
    \ differences in breast density and tumor characteristics in \nhigher-risk women.\
    \ Some imaging systems are better than others for detecting cancer or dismissing\
    \ it given certain \ncharacteristics of an individual woman’s breasts. \n \n2.\
    \ \nRISK  FACTORS OF BREAST CANCER CLASSIFICATION \nSince the recommendations\
    \ use three risk groups to sort out differences in screening routines, it may\
    \ be wondering how to fit \nthe risk profile. Some people would consider just\
    \ being a woman to be the most common risk factor for breast cancer. While \n\
    men do get breast cancer, women are about 100 times more likely to get it. Thus\
    \ the vast majority of women (at least 80%) are \nBreast cancer diagnosis using\
    \ SVM classifier with PSO \n \nconsidered “average” risk [1]. The prevalence of\
    \ breast cancer increases with age, which makes advancing age the most \ncommonly\
    \ recognized risk factor. The median (middle) age for a breast cancer diagnosis\
    \ is 61. \nAfter age, the risk of breast cancer increases significantly with family\
    \ history, certain benign lesions, breast density, a history of \nprevious breast\
    \ cancer and hormonal factors. According to Dr. Eisen [2], only about 20% of women\
    \ who have had breast cancer \nhave had a first or second degree relative who\
    \ also had it. About 5% of women with breast cancer have a very strong family\
    \ \nhistory of the disease, and about a quarter of high-risk cases are due to\
    \ known genetic mutations such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. \nThat leaves about three quarters\
    \ of familial risk unexplained, possibly due to environmental factors [3], but\
    \ more likely genetic \nfactors yet unidentified.An array of other risk factors\
    \ has been explored. Some lifestyle factors like obesity, particularly in \npostmenopausal\
    \ women, can increase risk. A specific diet to reduce breast cancer risk has been\
    \ hard to pin down [4], but women \nwho exercise regularly and vigorously may\
    \ decrease their risk. Alcohol is a known risk factor. Low Vitamin D is also a\
    \ possible \nrisk factor.Reproductive factors also affect breast cancer risk.\
    \ Both early menarche (the age of first menstruation) and late \nmenopause are\
    \ associated with increased risk. Breast cancer risk also increases with null\
    \ parity (having no full-term births) or \nhaving a first birth at a later age\
    \ [5]. According to Dr. Eisen [2], it was common over the past century for women\
    \ to start families \nin their twenties and to continue giving birth well into\
    \ their 30s. Today, women are more likely to have a first birth in their 30s \n\
    [6]. So it is possible that the social trend of having families later may be increasing\
    \ breast cancer risk. \nExposure to estrogen is an important risk factor for breast\
    \ cancer because these hormones stimulate tumor growth. Women who \nare menopausal\
    \ and obese have higher circulating estrogen. Excess estrogen can also be ingested\
    \ with birth control pills or \nhormonal replacement therapy after menopause [7].\
    \ After 2001, breast cancer incidence appeared to decrease with a substantial\
    \ \ndrop in prescriptions after hormone replacement therapy was recognized as\
    \ a possible breast cancer risk. \n \n3. \nPROBLEM STATEMENT \nNew methods have\
    \ been used in the framework of the human genome model to make it easier to implement\
    \ experiments in \nparallel on a large number of genes at once. A notable example\
    \ are DNA microarrays, also referred to as DNA chips. This \nmethod focuses on\
    \ simultaneously measuring the mRNA levels for numerous genes in specific cells\
    \ or tissues. A tumour \nbiopsy's array is hybridised after the mRNA has been\
    \ extracted, tagged, and processed. The intensity value that results from \nmeasuring\
    \ the quantity of label on each spot should be connected to the abundance of the\
    \ matching RNA transcript in that \nsample. \n Let Y= {y1,y2,         yn} be the\
    \ random variables for gene g1, \ng2 ----- gn respectively. Let C be the random\
    \ variable \nfor the class labels such that C={1,2,3 ------ k) where k \nis the\
    \ no of classes .Let t={t.y1,t.y2, ------ t.yn}be the \nexpression values corresponding\
    \ to n genes. We are given be with the training set of m tuples  \n \nT ={(t1,c1),(t2,c2),(t3,c3)\
    \ (tm,cm)}.where ci is the class \nlabel of the tuple ti..Let X=(t1,t2, -----\
    \ ts) be the test set. \n \nA classifier is the function with two arguments T\
    \ and X where T is the training set and X is the test set. We have to identify\
    \ the \nclass label of all the unknown samples in the test class by using the\
    \ knowledge or information available from the training \nsample and then check\
    \ the accuracy the classifier. Classification accuracy is defined as the number\
    \ of samples which is \npredicted accurately by using the classifier trained on\
    \ the training samples. \n4. \nHYBRID METHODS \nThere are two methods used for\
    \ implementation .first is support vector machines and second is particle swarm\
    \ optimization. \n4.4.1 \nSupport vector machines \n \nSupport vector machines\
    \ have the finest theoretical and outstanding empirical level of start-up. They\
    \ have been used for \n \nprojects like database classification, object detection,\
    \ and handwritten digit detection. Support-vector machines are first \npresumpted\
    \ for numerical data. The basic idea underlying SVM is to look at separators in\
    \ the search space that can most \neffectively separate the various cancer kinds.\
    \ With SVM, we can anticipate the lowest true error if we are able to identify\
    \ a \npattern for the concept of very low risk. Its likelihood for h is that randomly\
    \ chosen test objects will develop a problem. .The \nconcept is shown well as\
    \ shown in fig 1 . \n \nFigure 1: How a Support Vector Machine operates \n \n\
    \ \nThe main advantage of the SVM technique is that since it tries to discover\
    \ the optimum distinction in the feature space by \ndefining the appropriate hybrid[8]\
    \ of features, it is quite robust to high dimensionality. \n4.4.2 \nParticle Swarm\
    \ Optimization \nPSO is a technique that uses numbers. Swarm intelligence was\
    \ the fundamental theory used to develop this method [9]. PSO \nwas created based\
    \ on the social behaviour of flock-survival birds. There are a lot of responses\
    \ in the beginning of this \nprocedure, or rather, a counting of replies in which\
    \ any random pick is termed a particle. This method operates in an iterative \n\
    manner and approaches the ideal outcome. Every particle makes an effort to move\
    \ across space at a dynamic velocity vi that \ndirects the particle toward the\
    \ best possible outcome at each iteration. In the search space, n particles are\
    \ initially distributed at  \nrandom [10].  \n \n5. \nPROPOSED METHODOLOGY \n\
    \ \nFlowchart of proposed methodology is shown in figure . Microarray experiments\
    \ allow us to quantify the expression level of \nthousands of genes instantly.\
    \ These either monitor each gene several times under distinct conditions or each\
    \ gene into a single \nstate, but in the type of different tissues. First type\
    \ of experiment identify the genes which are related to each other due to \ncommon\
    \ expression while the latter type of experiment identify the genes whose expression\
    \ are good diagnostic indicator. In \norder to obtain the significant information\
    \ from the gene expression profiles various methods have been used. Firstly we\
    \ need \nto prepare data which compatible for our proposed work. The step performed\
    \ before implementation is known as pre-\nprocessing. Following certain steps\
    \ are required to perform: \n1. \nSelect the dataset1 and dataset2 from a hug\
    \ database. \n2. \nPerform pre-processing step to make dataset compatible for\
    \ our proposed method. \n3. \nDefine classes of cancer type and apply SVM algorithm\

    \ implemented. \nPerformance of each method provides us the merits and demerits\
    \ regarding that method. We assign two different datasets to the \nproposed method.\
    \ Each dataset have 129 and 199 samples respectively with multiple classes. These\
    \ datasets are assigned as \ninput of SVM classifier and evaluate the performance.\
    \ Some issue generates in front of us one of them is feature selection. This \n\
    issue resolved using PSO technique with SVM classifier. The same both datasets\
    \ are assigned to this hybrid approach and \nevaluate the performance. Now we\
    \ compare both results and get a conclusion about classification method. Different\
    \ reading \nhas been taken that based on the different proportion of training\

    \ research is always required for further new proposal. It is key of transformative\
    \ to discoveries about classification of \ncancer type. A mechanism is used for\
    \ classification of data. Current research work delivery emphasizes overwhelmingly\
    \ the \nclassification of acute cancer disease rather than protection and preservation\
    \ of overall health. The instability performance of \nSVM classifier helps in\
    \ categories dataset in different type of cancer. The top level accuracy is 61.49%\
    \ for dataset 1 and \n80.18% for dataset 2 by SVM classifier without using feature\
    \ selection technique. So it is transparent to us that accuracy of \nSVM classifier\
    \ is high when dataset has more samples. Now we deploy a feature selection technique\
    \ PSO with SVM classifier. \nThis deployment is implemented on both same datasets\
    \ and evaluates results. The top level of accuracy of SVM with PSO \nduring execution\
    \ is 65.41% for dataset 1 and 79.88% for dataset 2. This is concluding that SVM\
    \ with PSO perform very well \nfewer samples in dataset. \n \nSVM \nTraining \n\

    In the Internet of Things (IoT) age, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have\
    \ developed into a key component \nwith a centre on different applications, as\
    \ healthcare. These networks offer significant monitoring and diagnostic \ncapabilities.\
    \ In a typical WBAN setup, there is I a small network close to the body (between\
    \ 1to2 metres), II a path \n(sink) connecting to other network groups, which can\
    \ be one or more nodes with specific routing and records \ncombined features,\
    \ III a broad-ranging network, which can be an Internet or intranet system, and\
    \ IV submissions \nwith GUI for medical or different healthcare professionals.\
    \ Communication between nodes and the sink as a whole \nbecomes rather challenging\
    \ since the humanoid body's gestures cause the WBAN radio broadcast's features\
    \ to be \nrobust. Nodes that are close to the static sink appear to be transmitting\
    \ data constantly. As a result, the node closest \nto the sink uses up its energy\
    \ significantly faster than nodes farther away. The solution to the aforementioned\
    \ \nproblem is sink mobility. Work that is scheduled includes calculating WBAN\
    \ performance using an entity mobility \nmodel. Random waypoint mobility model,\
    \ Mobility models from the Reference Point Group, and Mobility models \nfrom the\
    \ Reference Velocity Group are examples of random direction mobility models with\
    \ movable and static \nsinks. Network Simulator 2.35 is used to simulate. Metrics\
    \ for evaluation include Average E2E latency, Packet \nDelivery Ratio, and Average\
    \ Throughput. Results from simulations indicate that mobile sink improves system\
    \ \nperformance as a whole. \n \nKeywords: Random Waypoint Mobility, Random Direction\
    \ Mobility, Reference Point Group Mobility, Wireless \nBody Area Networks, Internet\
    \ of Things, End-to-End \n \n1. Introduction \n1.1 Wireless Body Area Network\
    \ (WBAN) \nWBAN typically includes mote nodes that can be implanted or worn on\
    \ or near the body. These sensor nodes will \nserve as network nodes where two-way\
    \ communication, from sensor to sensor and from sensor to coordinator, is \nrequired.\
    \ Since a few decades ago, wireless broadcasting has played an extremely important\
    \ part in our way of life. \nIt contributes in a variety of ways because it's\
    \ a crucial component of various practical applications including \ntracking appliances,\
    \ tracking devices, monitoring, and automation. Because of the world's rapidly\
    \ expanding \npopulation, everyday life has become more expensive, especially\
    \ in wealthy nations like Japan, Spain, Germany, and \nItaly, etc. Given the swift\
    \ increase of population, the average age of those over 60 is rising, which means\
    \ that they \nrequire more care for their  health and spend extra on  treatments\
    \ [5]. Tragically, chronic and dangerous illnesses \nincluding cancer, asthma,\
    \ and cardiovascular conditions are frequently detected too late, which raises\
    \ the average \ndeath rate among those who receive a diagnosis. Early detection\
    \ of these disorders may allow us to lessen their \neffects and lengthen the life\
    \ expectancy of patients [7]. Recent research studies show that WBAN is an effective\
    \ \napproach to the implementation of an electronic health care system [10]. \n\
    \ \n1.2 Entity Mobility Model \nA. Random Waypoint model \nRWP, or the random\
    \ waypoint mobility model: \nA mobile path contains a series of journeys. All\
    \ mobile nodes are initially given a fixed position in the zone at time \n0. The\
    \ mobile randomly chooses a next waypoint Mn at the beginning of each journey\
    \ that is always in the zone and \na following quickness Vn that is always between\
    \ [Vmin; Vmax], regardless of the previous and current values. \nThen, it travels\
    \ at a constant speed Vn in the direction of the newly chosen terminus. The mobile\
    \ pauses for a \npredetermined or arbitrary amount of time when it reaches Mn.\
    \ It restarts the process after this period has passed. \nB. Random direction\
    \ mobility model \n Mobile nodes are initially given a fixed position in the zone\
    \ at time 0. The mobile randomly chooses a direction \ntheta that is always between\
    \ [0; 2], a speed Vn that is always between [Vmin; Vmax], and a travel duration\
    \ t that is \nexponentially circulated with an assumed mean at the beginning of\
    \ each tour. Then it moves at speed Vn for a time t \nin the direction theta.\
    \ Similar to this, when the mobile reaches Mn, it pauses for a predetermined or\
    \ random amount \nof time before randomly choosing a new direction, speed, and\
    \ travel duration [1][2][3][4]. Several grade of service \nrestrictions, together\
    \ with PDR, Average Throughput, and Average E2E Delay, are used to assess the\
    \ effectiveness of \nWBAN. The direction-finding technique is used to produce\
    \ two alternative scenarios for testing in the network \nsimulator, each with\
    \ a different node count (25 - 50) and utilising these two static  and mobile\
    \ sink. \n1.3 Group Mobility Model \nThe RPGM model is a group mobility model,\
    \ where random move of a group and every node private a group is \nsymbolized.\
    \ Here, each group has a sensible centre or group leader and this group leader\
    \ chooses the group’s motion \nconduct. In tons of major uses like soldier struggle\
    \ in battlefield, movement of attendee groups in an presentation \netc., there\
    \ is a sturdy association between the nodes and they are permissible to travel\
    \ in certain limited areas only. \nThis can be fine denoted by RPGM. \n \n2. Related\
    \ Work \nKhan et al. [1] suggested a movement model that is a 3D execution of\
    \ present Random Direction (RD) mobility \nmodel and presented in what way a mobility\
    \ model influences the whole network. Supriya Agrahari et al. [2] \npresents the\
    \ RWM  model for relating reconstruction of mobile nodes circulation inside the\
    \  network. Haque Nawaz \net al. [3] explored mobility models which deliver the\
    \ specific mobility outline to decide the problematic of \nassociation, communication.\
    \ These mobility models deliver the podium to know and implement WBAN. Luis Irio\
    \ et \nal. [4] distinguishes the wireless intrusion of a mobile adhoc network,\
    \ where mobile nodes approves to RMP model.  \nScattering of the intrusion is\
    \ examined compelling into clarification of the imaginary nature of  path damaged\
    \ \nbecause of  movement of  nodes. Attard S. and Zammit S. [6] proposed a highly\
    \ promising technology, i.e. Body \nCoupled Communications (BCC) technology, has\
    \ been used to connect BAN devices. Human body is used as a \nmeans through which\
    \ the signals are communicated in this form of wireless communication. For attaching\
    \ devices to \nthe human body, the capacitive BCC displays very favorable properties.\
    \ Low signal attenuation is one such property \nthat improves the battery lifespan\
    \ of BAN devices. The confinement of signal power near to the human body is one\
    \ \nmore property, making BANs more stable and less vulnerable to interference.\
    \ Authors have attempted to show that \nvarious motions of the body develop in\
    \ substantially unlike activity of the BCC channel. Channel properties are also\
    \ \naffected by the form and speed of human body movement. The proposed work in\
    \ [9] described a system called Least \nDistance Movement Recovery (LDMR) which\
    \ is based on a distributed approach. In this approach, the recovery \nfrom network\
    \ partitioning is accomplished by shifting the roles and responsibilities of failed\
    \ nodes to its immediate \nneighbors. The major constrints of LDMR are (i) expenditure\
    \ of  massive proportion of energies by each node to \nsearch for the non-vertex\
    \ node at  time of recovery and (ii) the congestion arises in the network due\
    \ to the flooding \nof the packets by each node to search the non-vertex node.\
    \ Protocols in [8] find the updated path each time, when \nthere is a change in\
    \ topology due to postural mobility. The main drawbacks of these protocols is\
    \ that a massive  \namount of energy is absorbed by every node because  the huge\
    \ amount of computation overhead for the path \ndiscovery activities during recovery\
    \ from network dividing. Prabhakar D. Dorge [11] stated that the Reference Point\
    \ \nGroup \nMobility (RPGM) model is based on correlated node mobility. \n \n\
    3. Proposed Work \nN numbers of heterogeneous sensor are deployed across geographically\
    \ area. A static sink node is employed at the \nCentre of the network (static\
    \ sink is stationary having a steady point, sit either inside or closer to the\
    \ sensing zone) \nand mobile sink node is free to move across the entire wireless\
    \ sensor network. The same fixed communication \nradius is used for data transfer\
    \ between both sinks and all sensor nodes. The Pci (average power consumption)\
    \ for a \nBS is designated as: Assuming static power usage and optimum conditions\
    \ for data traffic, \n\n\nsec\nPc\n N\n B\n P\n     \ni\nant\ni\ntx\nj\nBHi\n\

    \ portion of Pci that is directly proportionate to the power \ntransfered from\

    \ typical communicated \npower from a base station. These are the primary components\
    \ that make up a base station's energy competency. \nWhile Nsec is supposed to\
    \ display the total number of sectors, Nant is intended to depict the number of\
    \ antennas  for \nevery sector for a single base station. Ptx is the communicated\
    \ power for each base station, whereas Pci is the mean \nof aggregated power of\

    We looked at the most recent mobility models in this paper for a variety of environment\
    \ scenario trajectories in \nWBAN. These models have been divided into two categories,\
    \ with each group being further subdivided. These \nmobility models offer the\
    \ framework for comprehending and applying the WBAN. The mobility models were\
    \ \ncreated using the NS 2.35 simulator tool to account for different movement\
    \ patterns. The results of the simulation \ndemonstrated that a movable sink provides\
    \ the greatest improvements in throughput, packet delivery ratio, and E2E \ndelay.\
    \ Future research will focus on creating fault-tolerant algorithms to handle topology\
    \ changes brought on by \npostural movement. \n \n93.52 92.8\n87.45\n83.35\n100\n\

    \ multiple access) is spread spectrum [1]. \nUtilization of more bandwidth compared\
    \ to primary message is the main idea behind \nspread spectrum [2], [3] . In spread\
    \ spectrum, same signal power is maintained and is \nmasked by noise, which makes\
    \ the signal very challenging to separate from noise therefore \nmore difficult\
    \ to intercept and jam. To spread the spectrum, direct sequence (DS) [4] and \n\
    frequency hopping (FH) [5] are two very important techniques. To make larger bandwidth\
    \ \nrapid phase transition of data is the main idea behind DS method and in FH\
    \ method, in \nrandom narrow bands signal jumps take place within a larger bandwidth.\
    \ Gold, PN \n(pseudo noise), Walsh, Kasami are some basic codes which are generally\
    \ applied in spread \nspectrum techniques. Not only that spreading code generated\
    \ from logistic map are also \nused in today’s word [6],[7]. But the result can\
    \ be improved by applying optimization \ntechnique. In the process of Optimization\
    \ we can determine the best one among all the \npossible solutions. Optimization\
    \ in spread spectrum displays a very important role in these \ndays, hence in\
    \ wireless communication, optimization of spreading code is very essential \n\
    because in the modern system of communication utilization of CDMA (code division\
    \ \nmultiple access) method with one unique code to each user is very essential.\
    \ Hence \nresearchers should give attention for optimized spreading code generation.\
    \ There are \nvarious metaheuristic approaches like ant colony optimization (ACO)\
    \ algorithm, particle \nswarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, differential evolution\
    \ (DE) algorithm etc [8], [9], \n[10]. Rather than these algorithm, genetic algorithm\
    \ (GA) displays a very important role in \nthe field of metaheuristic. This study\
    \ shows a Genetic Algorithm based spreading code \nwhich is generated using logistic\
    \ map. Genetic algorithm is used here because it has \nseveral advantages than\
    \ other optimization techniques, they have superior parallel \ncapabilities, it\
    \ improves over time, derivative information are not required not only that \n\
    problems related to continuous functions, multi objective problems, discrete functions\
    \ can \nalso be optimized using genetic algorithm. Code generated from logistic\
    \ map is considered \nhere because logistic map based spreading code has several\
    \ advantages over PN/Gold code \n[6]. Logistic map is a second order polynomial\
    \ mapping, it provides a view of how a \ncomplex chaotic nature can get from a\
    \ non-linear dynamic equation. Sensitivity to initial \ncondition is the main\
    \ property of this logistic map code [7]. Hence, spreading code is \n2 \n \ngenerated\
    \ from logistic map and then genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the \nspreading\
    \ code.       Properties of the generated bit is discussed in this paper with\
    \ the help \nof mono bit test, run length test and computational complexity also\
    \ compared with other \nexisting spreading code (like spreading code generated\
    \ from logistic map and optimized \nspreading code using exponential scale factor-based\
    \ DE). The proposed spreading code \nshows better results than the existing spreading\
    \ code. Therefore, the proposed spreading \ncode can be easily applicable to wireless\
    \ communication system. \n \n2. \nLITERATURE REVIEW \nSome important research\
    \ papers are discussed in this section. A gist of which are given \nbellow. For\
    \ computer model estimation genetic algorithm is utilized which is taken from\
    \ \nthe field of genetics in biology. In this review paper, author explained how\
    \ different \nproblems are solved using Genetic algorithm [10]. \nRecent advances\
    \ considering genetic algorithm is carried out in this paper by the \nauthors.\
    \ In review paper different GA based implementation along with pros and cons are\
    \ \nelaborated. Also, operation of genetic algorithm along with their utilization\

    \ between wavelet- \nbased DE and exponential scale factor-based DE and also their\
    \ application in direct \nsequence spread spectrum techniques. In this paper spreading\
    \ codes are optimized with the \nhelp of wavelet-based DE and then applied to\
    \ direct sequence spread spectrum scheme [7]. \n \n3. \nPROPOSED METHOD \n \n\
    3.1 Basic operation of GA \n \nThe basic operation of Genetic Algorithm is elaborated\
    \ with the flow diagram given in Fig. \n1. \n \n \n \n \nFig 1: Flow diagram of\
    \ Genetic algorithm \n \nSteps for genetic algorithm are: \n1) Binary string encoding\
    \ \n2) Generation of random population \n3) Fitness calculation \n4) Fitness based\
    \ pairs of parent string selection \n5) Generation of new string with mutation\
    \ and crossover until a new population has been \nproduced. \nRepeat steps 2 to\
    \ 5 until the solution is not satisfactory. \n \n3.2 Logistic map-based binary\
    \ spreading code: \n \nBinary spreading code is generated from logistic map using\
    \ two methods: These are \n \nMethod 1: Threshold method \n3 \n \n \nMethod\
    \ 2: Floating point value to bit conversion \nBoth the methods are elaborated\
    \ by the flow diagram in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. \nSuppose the floating-point value\
    \ for the chaotic code is x. The threshold method to convert \nx to binary code\
    \ is as given in the following equation. \n   = 1;   ≥ 0.5 \n                \
    \                                               = 0;   < 0.5  \n(1) \nAnd logistic\
    \ map equation is given by \n+1 =  ∗ (1 − ) \n         (2) \nHere, r is the rate\
    \ at which population is increased or decreased and range is between 0 to \n4.\
    \ And  is the ratio of present population to the possible population (maximum)\
    \ at year \nn. It lies between 0 to 1. And in the second method i.e in integer\
    \ to bit conversion \ntechnique, floating points are converted to integer and\
    \ then to binary. Frame based \nsequence is utilized here to convert integer to\
    \ binary. Properties of both the techniques are \nelaborated in the following.\
    \ \n \n3.3 Properties of proposed spreading code (Method 1 & 2) \n \nVarious tests\
    \ are executed to set up the properties. \nMono bit test: To check the number\
    \ of ones & zeros for the whole sequence is the main \naim of the test. The role\
    \ of the test is to figure out the number of 0’s & 1’s in a sequence is \nalmost\
    \ equivalent or not to check the randomness of the sequence. That means half number\
    \ \n0’s and half number 1’s should be present in the sequence. \nRun length test:\
    \ Number of runs present in the sequence is the main focus of this test. A \n\
    run is an unbroken sequence of same bits. If L is the run length, then L consists\
    \ of exactly \nL same bits and after and before this L opposite bits are present.\
    \ This test calculates the \noscillation speed, i.e. the oscillation between both\
    \ the bits (0’s & 1’s) is too slow or too \nfast. \nComputational complexity:\
    \ Computational complexity of threshold method is less \ncompared to integer to\
    \ binary method. Computational complexity is calculated by doing \nauto correlation\
    \ between then sequences. \n \n3.4 Spreading code optimization with scale factor-based\
    \ DE and GA \n \nThe spreading code optimization flow diagram is as given in the\

    \ in wireless communication system. In \nthis modern era, because of the high\
    \ demand of CDMA communication, optimization of \nspreading code is necessary.\
    \ Hence, in this paper spreading code generated from logistic \nmap is optimized\
    \ using genetic algorithm. Out of all the metaheuristic algorithms, GA is \nchosen\
    \ because it has several advantages than other optimization techniques, they are\
    \ \nsuperior parallel capabilities, it improves over time, derivative information\
    \ are not required \nnot only that problems related to continuous functions, multi\
    \ objective problems, discrete \nfunctions can also be optimized using genetic\
    \ algorithm. From the properties of the \nproposed optimized spreading code, it\
    \ is clear that computation complexity is less in the \nGA based spreading code,\
    \ also from mono bit test and run length test it is clear that our \nproposed\
    \ method shows better results than other sate of art algorithms. Hence, the \n\
    proposed spreading code can be applicable to wireless communication technology.\
    \ In \nfuture, the GA based spreading code can be utilized in OFDM and massive\
    \ MIMO system. \n \nReference \n \n1. Rappaport, T. S. (2010). Wireless Communications\

    \ \n \nAbstract: \nOver the years, Internet connectivity based on the concept\
    \ of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)   \nhas turn out to beone of the most\
    \ reliable and promising technology. WLANs offers open link to the \ncustomers\
    \ so as to provide smooth and feasible access to the communication system and\
    \ associated \napplications. A wireless system provides flexible installation\
    \ in comparison with wired networks. \nIn this paper, a novel WLAN system is analyzed\
    \ for diverse data rates for FTP protocol in the presence \nof load balancer and\
    \ without the use of it.  Two scenarios are created with same physical and MAC\
    \ \nlayer parameters. The WLAN model is evaluated to measure the performance for\
    \ campus environment. \nThe WLANs parameters such as response time, wireless media\
    \ access delay and throughput are \naffected by the number of user per application\
    \ with and without load balancing. \n \nKey words: WLANS, FTP, Load Balancer,\
    \ QoS, Response Time \nI. \nIntroduction \n \nWith the technological transformations\
    \ occurring at a fast pace, the requirement of \ntransmission capacity and communication\
    \ rate is increasing. This has led to changes in the needs of the \nend customers\
    \ and their requirements. The newer application areas have varied needs from the\
    \ system \nprotocol. Global interconnection of clients through internet having\
    \ higher bandwidth has become a \nbasic requirement for achieving their goals.\
    \ Over the years, Internet connectivity based on the concept \nof Wireless Local\
    \ Area Network (WLAN)   has turn out to beone of the most reliable and promising\
    \ \ntechnology. WLANs offers open link to the customers so as to provide smooth\
    \ and feasible access to \nthe communication system and associated applications.\
    \ A wireless system provides flexible installation \nin comparison with wired\
    \ networks. Also, the installation cost of the wireless systems is on a higher\
    \ \nside and offers long transmission delays. But with the introduction of the\
    \ WLANs solutions, the \ntransmission capacity has improved leading to higher\
    \ transmission rate with lower delays decreasing \nthe cost of the systems. \n\
    \ \nWLAN interconnects communicating devices like desktop machines, laptops, personal\
    \ \ndigital assistants (PDAs), smart-phones without a physical connection. The\
    \ WLAN technology has \ntransformed the way users are accessing internet on their\
    \ communicable equipments. The elimination \nof a physical network between users\
    \ offers a effortless connectivity to the network services. \nOrthogonal frequency\
    \ division multiplexing (OFDM) and spread spectrum concepts are utilized in \n\
    WLANs to communicate through radio waves within a specified region, so as customers\
    \ can access \nnetwork while moving within the limited area. \nWLANs is required\
    \ to ensure fulfillment of diverse prerequisites of any connecting system \nthat\
    \ includes higher bandwidth, lower transmission delays, complete connectivity\
    \ amongst diverse \ndevices and ability to broadcast signals among others. Furthermore,\
    \ some specific requirements of \nwireless networks are increased throughput,\
    \ connectivity to multiple stations across diverse cells, lower \nbattery usage,\
    \ interconnection with wired LANs and other networks like wide area networks (WANs),\
    \ \nimproved data security, dynamic configuration and minimum requirements of\
    \ license among others. \nWireless systems carry out various tasks so that information\
    \ signals can be transmitted \nsuccessfully from source station to destination\
    \ node. For achieving this, diverse functions are carried \nout by WLANs that\
    \ includes offering a transmission channel for transfer of data signals, medium\
    \ \naccess control (MAC) mechanism so that various devices can effectively utilize\
    \ the shared channel, \nrouting and error control mechanism are implemented. \
    \ \nThere are wide range of products conform to WLANs standards are available\
    \ in the market. Diverse \nstandards includes IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b, IEEE\
    \ 802.11g, or IEEE 802.11n are employed for \nunique wireless applications. Additionally,\
    \ Bluetooth also provides wireless access for short range of \ncommunication.\
    \ \n \nThe main benefit of employing WLAN in comparison with the wired LAN is\
    \ \nease of installation and providing mobile access to end clients. The basic\
    \ constituents of WLAN \nsystem are customer adaptors, network interface cards\
    \ known as NIC and access points (APs). Access \npoint functions similar to a\
    \ hub and provides connection to backbone network through a Ethernet wire. \n\
    An antenna is utilized to communicate with various wireless nodes within the defined\
    \ frequency range. \nFrom the interoperability point of view APs adheres to IEEE\
    \ 802.11 standards. Further, authenticity of \nthe clients and their availability\
    \ is ensured by the access point. Peer to Peer mode or Infrastructure \nmode is\
    \ used to connect client adaptors with the communicating devices through APs.\
    \ The NIC \nexamines the existing frequency range for connecting an AP in wireless\
    \ mode. It accompanies a \nproduct driver that combines it to the operating system\
    \ (OS) of the wireless node. \n Medium access control (MAC) mechanism is used\
    \ by the stations to access the shared infrastructure \nin the wireless networks.\
    \ The main purpose of the MAC protocol is to characterize various regulations\
    \ \nso that all participating nodes in the network have equitable access to transfer\
    \ data signals. Numerous \nMAC mechanisms were defined for the WLANs to have a\
    \ normalized access in the network. MAC \nensures different nodes to utilize a\
    \ common channel through carrier sense multiple access/ collision \navoidance\
    \ (CSMA/CD) mechanism so that cluster of nodes can transfer within the same spectrum.\
    \ It \nensures reliable transportation of information signals over a wireless\
    \ communication channel. \n  \nWireless LAN employs diverse MAC protocols for\
    \ its IEEE standards. Distributed \ncoordination function (DCF) is the fundamental\
    \ mechanism used for IEEE 802.11 b standard that \nensure fair access of the shared\
    \ medium through the CSMA/CD protocol and random back-off time \nmechanism. Data\
    \ traffic signals utilizes positive acknowledgement signals for confirmation of\
    \ the \nsuccessful receipt of the data, in case acknowledgement frame is not received\
    \ by the sender within the \nspecified time limit then a retransmission of the\
    \ data frame is ensure through stop-and-wait automatic \nrepeat request protocol.\
    \ Both physical and virtual method can be used for sensing the medium. Carrier\
    \ \nsense of the channel is accomplished by appropriating reservation data reporting\
    \ the approaching \nutilization of the medium; it is cultivated by the use of\
    \ Request To Send (RTS) and Clear To Send \n(CTS) packets. Furthermore, the different\
    \ available spaces in the transmitted packets are utilized to \nseparate between\
    \ various sorts of transmissions. \n \nAnother MAC based mechanism employed by\
    \ WLANs is Point coordination \nfunction (PCF). It is polling based procedure\
    \ for accessing the channel in which base station works as \npoint coordinator\
    \ (PC). In PCF available time slots are categorized as super-frames for IEEE 802.11\
    \ \nWLAN standards. Both PCF and DCF mechanism are utilized in the super-frames,\
    \ for a contention \nfree time DCF is used and for contention based frame PCF\
    \ can be utilized. The contention free sub \nperiod begins through the use a beacon\
    \ special frame transmitted by the base node. The length of the \ncontention free\
    \ period might be decreased as the beacon frame is transmitted using a DCF mechanism\
    \ \nand the base node has to compete for the availability of the shared channel.The\
    \ base station maintains a \nlist of mobile nodes that have mentioned to be surveyed\
    \ to send information. In the contention free sub \nperiod, base node transmits\
    \ the poll packets to the participating nodes when they are obvious to get to\
    \ \nthe medium. When the poll frame is received by the mobile node, it transmits\
    \ a information frame that \nhas been lined up for communication. To guarantee\
    \ that no DCF nodes can during the process, the \ninter-frame space (IFS) between\
    \ PCF information packets is more limited than the typical IFS of DCF \nand is\
    \ known as PCF Interframe Space (PIFS). To avoid starvation of nodes that are\
    \ not permitted to \ntransmit during the contention free period, there must consistently\
    \ be space for no less than one \ngreatest length packet to be sent during the\
    \ contention time frame. \n \nEnhanced Distributed Coordination Function (EDCF)\
    \ is another \nvariant of DCF for contention resolution of the shared medium.\
    \ This mechanism is proposed to give \nprioritized quality of service (QoS) through\
    \ an enhanced DCF.  The mechanism provides access to the \nunguided channel through\
    \ eight diverse user priorities (UPs) for stations. Prior to the frame coming\
    \ \ninto the MAC layer, a station priority number is allocated to every information\
    \ frame received from the \nupper layers. Four diverse first-in first-out (FIFO)\
    \ methods are outlined by the EDCF to give \ncontinuous support for the transfer\
    \ of data signals with UPs. \nThus efficient MAC mechanism plays a pivotal role\
    \ in realization of the shared single \nunguided medium so as stations communicate\
    \ through a shared radio transmission medium. The MAC \nprotocol is expected to\
    \ offer a productive utilization of the accessible transmission capacity while\
    \ \nfulfilling the Quality of Service (QoS) necessities for both real time services\
    \ and information carrying \napplications. Differentiated services (DS) are a\
    \ bare minimum for improving QoS of communicating \napplications. DS ensures equitable\
    \ distribution of resources for diverse categories of data traffic. \nDiverse\
    \ implementations are defined to enhance QoS. The main objective of this paper\
    \ is to provide a \ncomparative examination based on diverse performance measuring\
    \ metrics in the communication \nunguided and guided networks.Two application\
    \ layer protocols Hyper text transfer protocol (HTTP) \nand File transfer protocol\
    \ (FTP)  and their transactions to achieve a higher throughput in a wireless \n\
    system is investigated. Also, the effect of access delay and page/object response\
    \ time is studied. \nThe rest of the research paper is arranged as follows; the\
    \ simulation scenariosare presented in \nnext section. The results obtained on\
    \ various system parameters are explained in section IV of the \npaper and in\
    \ the last segment conclusions and future roadmap are provided.  \n \nII. \nSystem\
    \ Model \n \n \nFig. 1. System Simulation Model \n \nFig. 2 Site with twenty users\
    \ \nThe system model of the wireless network scenario is as shown in figure 1.\
    \ Four different \nWLAN sites are selected where each network site connects two\
    \ users through separate APs. Wireless \nLAN system is designed with and without\
    \ load balancer. Load balancing allows APs access of various \nwireless nodes.\
    \ For efficient utilization of the system resources every AP gives site management\
    \ \ninformation by employing system functions. To maximize utilization of the\
    \ available resources, \noptimizing throughput and reducing response time, the\
    \ task is redistributed among numerous stations \nby the load balancer. In the\
    \ second case, the wireless network is designed without load balancer. \nNetwork\
    \ is configured without a load balancer and it is possible by disabling option\
    \ of load balancing \nin the profile off the Wireless system service and can be\
    \ specified with a Exempt profile.  In such \nscenario, the network does not assign\
    \ users between APs upon the arrival of new client.  \nEvery LAN network contains\
    \ clients which are communicating using highest layer protocols. For \nperformance\
    \ evaluation to application layer protocols namely HTTP and FTP are considered.\
    \ WLAN \nnetwork is designed with IEEE 802.11b standard using direct spread spectrum\
    \ technique. The \ninformation is transferred with a packet size of 1024having\
    \ a slot time of 20µs on a unregulated radio \nspectrum of 2.4 GHz. Adaptive back-off\
    \ algorithm is utilized in the MAC layer for contention \nresolution.  Furthermore,\
    \ wireless system containing four diverse sites are connected with wired system\
    \ \nthrough IP cloud. A Mix of FTP and HTTP users are connected with wired network\
    \ and are accessing \ninformation through APs as shown in figure 2. In the wire-line\
    \ system HTTP server and FTP server are \nconnected through gateway and system\
    \ is secured through the use of firewall. Firewall secures the \nsystem through\
    \ continuous supervision of the communicated traffic and preventing unauthorized\
    \ \naccess. \n \nIII. \nResults and Discussion \nIn this section, results of the\
    \ simulation work are presented and analyzed. All the results of \nboth wireless\
    \ networks with load balancer and WLAN without the load balancer are depicted\
    \ in \ngraphical form. The blue line displays the findings of the simulation system\
    \ without load balancer \nwhereas the red color depicts the results of Wireless\
    \ system with load balancer. \n \n                                           \
    \           Time (sec) \n                                Fig. 3 FTP Traffic Sent\
    \ (bytes/sec) \nFigure 3 demonstrates the information data traffic transmitted\
    \ using the FTP protocol. The \ntraffic is measured in bytes per second and the\
    \ average traffic sent is measured. The peak of the data \nsent is obtained in\
    \ between 0ms and 10 ms for both with load balancer and without load balancer\
    \ \nsimulation environment. The peak FTP traffic sent is 420 and 130 for WLAN\
    \ without load balancer \nand with load balancer respectively. \nThe wireless\
    \ system is investigated to find the response type for an FTP protocol in both\
    \ with \nload balancer and without load balancer as shown in figure 4. It is found\
    \ that the average download \nresponse time with load balancer and without load\
    \ balancer for FTP protocol is 28.2 ms & 29 ms \nrespectively.  \n \n        \
    \                                                        Time (sec)     \nFig.\
    \ 4 FTP Download Response Time (sec) \nFurther, the proposed system is simulated\
    \ to know the FTP upload response time for both with the load \nbalancer and without\
    \ the load balancer and is calculated to be  28.6 ms and 28.5 ms respectively\
    \  as \ndepicted in fig. 5. For measuring FTP download response time and FTP upload\
    \ response time the \nsetting of various scenarios are kept constant. \nFrom the\
    \ measured results it can be deduced that the load balancer is helpful in decreasing\
    \ the FTP \ndownload time, while in the process of balancing, in order to avoid\
    \ the traffic congestion it rather takes \nmore time. So, it is clearly visible\
    \ that for uploading process the use of load balancer may be avoided. \n \n  \
    \                                                              Time (sec)    \
    \ \nFig .5 FTP Upload Response Time (sec) \nIV. \nConclusion \nOver the years\
    \ wireless local area networks havegrown to be the most critical mechanism in\
    \ \nwireless technologies, finding a lot of interest from diverse point of views,\
    \ including end users, \nresearchers and business communitieswith a hope that\
    \ the technology offers opportunity to availmobile \nservices without the requirement\
    \ of  mobile operators.  \nThis work described a simulation study of an IEEE 802.11b\
    \ wireless LAN in a campus \nenvironment.The simulations are carried out for FTP\
    \ protocol with and without the use of the load \nbalancer. It is deduced from\

    \ patch antennas have gotten a lot of attention in recent wireless communications\
    \ generations, such as \nIndustry 4.0 and Internet of Things devices. Whatever\
    \ one's personal passions are [1]. A microwave connection \nis a sort of communication\
    \ system that uses microwave-frequency radio waves to transport video, audio and\
    \ \nstatistics amongst two sites that are hundreds of feet or metres apart, or\
    \ miles or kilometres apart. It was difficult \nto imagine connections in Gigabits\
    \ per second before to the arrival of 4G and LTE, let alone wired connectivity,\
    \ \nbut with the introduction of new technologies into frames, it is currently\
    \ believable to link devices at Gbps rates \n[2]. Patch antennas suffer from a\
    \ significant scheme imperfection in the form of limited bandwidth and moderate\
    \ \ngain. Various ways for enhancing the narrow bandwidth of Microstrip patch\
    \ antennas have been presented to \nsolve the problem. 5G is the next generation\
    \ of communications technology, with elaborative and creative services \nthat\
    \ have the ability to change society. It will take considerably more than novel\
    \ wireless expertise to deliver next-\ngeneration 5G; it will necessitate the\
    \ development of an altogether new technology, which will be a prime and \noptimal\
    \ area for researchers [6, 7]. \n \n2. RELATED WORK \nThe hexagonal Triangular\
    \ Fractal Antenna with Tapered Feedline and Reflector for 5G and UWB Submissions\
    \ \nwas detailed in detail by Pratiknyo Adi Mahatmanto [3] (2019). The suggested\
    \ antenna has a number of \nadvantages, including a compact design, low-profile\
    \ material, broad bandwidth, and low-cost material. The \nantenna is built in\
    \ a hexagonal three-sided fractal structure among many design architectures to\
    \ achieve these \nbenefits. The antenna has a hexagonal fractal design for 5G\
    \ at 28GHz with a broad bandwidth spanning 2.4GHz \nto 30GHz. The antenna has\
    \ a maximum gain of 7.65dB and is 35mm x 52mm. The planned antenna takes a broader\
    \ \nbandwidth; however it has a significant loss. The hexagonal fractal has a\
    \ greater capacitive impact, which affects \nthe process of element surface current\
    \ distribution. \nAshwini K. Arya [4] described the Shark-Fin antenna for railway\
    \ communications in the LTE-R, LTE, and lower \n5G frequency bands (2020). For\
    \ train communication, the shark fin antenna is 3D printed and developed to work\
    \ \nin three bands: LTE-R (700MHz), LTE (2100MHz), and the lower 5G frequency\
    \ (3500MHz). The constructed \nantenna is 163mm x 61.9mm x 10mm in size and covers\
    \ a extensive occurrence variety from 1.4GHz to 4.2GHz, \nwith radiation efficiency\
    \ of 71.7 percent, 92.6 percent, and 96.4 percent for the railway environment,\
    \ respectively. \nThe proposed antenna functioned for lower 5G applications, such\
    \ as sub-6GHz, but it didn't meet the required \nstandard of sub-6GHz bandwidth,\
    \ and it was also quite massive. Ishteyaq I [5] (2020) demonstrated a sub-6 GHz\
    \ \ndouble-band planar printed slot antenna for 5G wireless applications[6-7].\
    \ The constructed antenna includes a \nrectangular radiation slot on the top edge\
    \ with an inverted stub to achieve a highest improvement of around \n7.17dBi and\
    \ is suitable for operation at sub 6GHz. It resonates with a bandwidth of 3.26–3.63GHz\
    \ and 4.3–\n5.2GHz with a return loss of less than -10dB[8-12]. The antenna is\
    \ 0.8mm thick and built on a FR4 epoxy substrate \nwith 50 Ohm impedance matching.\
    \ The surface current is affected by the proposed antenna's usage of an inversion\
    \ \nstub in the radiating layer[15-16]. The antenna radiating layer had an unbalanced\
    \ dispersion process, which \nresulted in the formation of back lobes. \n3. PROPOSED\
    \ WORK AND IMPLEMENTAION \nThe proposed Slotted Circular Patch with a complement\
    \ split ring resonator antenna (CS-CSRR) works effectively \nin the sub-6 GHz\
    \ frequency region, resonating at 3.5 GHz. In today's communication, being able\
    \ to operate at \nfrequencies below 6 GHz is essential. The improved CS-CSRR MTM\
    \ ground works exclusively at sub-6 and 5G \nmid band frequencies, with a total\
    \ gain of 4.6 dB. The ground-based utilization of the CSSRR structure improves\
    \ \nthe gain and effectiveness of essential sub-6 GHz applications. \n \nFigure\

    3 \n \n3.1 Several Performance Parameters \nThe most important ones are briefly\
    \ discussed below, including radiation array, return loss, gain, directivity,\
    \ and \nradiation efficiency. The standards of these constraints are used to validate\
    \ an antenna for practical applications. \nRadiation Pattern \nIt's a two- or\
    \ three-dimensional visual representation of the antenna's radiated power in spherical\
    \ coordinates. \nDifferent zones of the radiation outline are denoted to as key\
    \ lobes, side lobes, and rear lobes, as shown in Figure \n2. The useable zone\
    \ of the antenna is defined by the primary lobe, which contains the common of\
    \ the radiated \nenergy. The radiated energy is lost and does not contribute to\
    \ communication in minor lobes and side lobes. As a \nresult, the antenna's directivity\
    \ is determined by the primary lobe. \n \n \nFigure 2: Radiation pattern of antenna\
    \ in spherical (a) and Cartesian (b) coordinates \nHalf Power Beam width (HPBW),\
    \ which is the angular width between the -3dB point in the main lobe, quantifies\
    \ \nthe angular region covered by an antenna. The first null beam width is the\
    \ angular width between two nulls of the \nmain lobe (FNBW). FNBW is mostly used\
    \ to define an antenna's resolution. The capacity of an antenna to \ndifferentiate\
    \ among two different targets or sources is described by its resolution[17]. \n\
    Resolution of antenna=FNBW/2 \nThe radiation pattern is also plotted using Cartesian\
    \ or rectangular coordinates to provide further insight into the \nside lobes,\
    \ as illustrated in figure 2 (b). The azimuth (horizontal) plane and elevation\
    \ (vertical) plane are two \nmajor plane patterns that can be used to describe\
    \ the radiation characteristics of an antenna without losing \ninformation. The\
    \ yz plane (=90 degrees) is referred to as the elevation plane, whereas the xy\
    \ plane (=90 degrees) \nis referred to as the azimuth plane in Figure 3. \n \n\
    Figure 3: E plane and H plane in polar coordinates \n \nReturn Loss (S11) \nIt\
    \ is calculated as the proportion of mirrored power to total input power applied\
    \ to the antenna and reflects how \nmuch power is reflected from the antenna.\
    \ All power is redirected from the aerial and no power is radiated if S11 \nis\
    \ 0dB. A realistic antenna should have S11 less than -10dB in the working bandwidth.\

    \ the average radiation intensity in all directions \nis known as directivity.\
    \ The improvement of an aerial is the proportion of the radiated power in one\
    \ direction to \nthe total power applied to the antenna. \n \n4. RESULTS \nWith\
    \ a return loss of -34.16 dB, the suggested antenna performs well at 3.5 GHz.\
    \ Although the CS-CSRR is a \ndefective ground structure, it has a good return\
    \ loss performance at sub-6 GHz, making it a viable model for 5G \nmidband applications.\

    \ directivity of CS-CSRR \nstructure \nGain and directivity are the most important\
    \ factors to consider when calculating an antenna's efficiency. Figures \n5 and\
    \ 6 show the gain and directivity of the CS-CSRR, respectively. The CS-CSRR antenna\
    \ geometry has the \nhighest overall gain of 4.6 dB and directivity of 4.9 dB,\
    \ as seen by the linear curve of the 3D gain figure. The \neffectiveness of the\
    \ suggested antenna is 94.2 percent. \n \nFigure 7: Simulated Radiation Efficiency\
    \ of CS-CSRR structure \nIn figure 7, the emission effectiveness of the suggested\
    \ antenna for Sub-6 GHz applications is investigated and \ndepicted as a 2D plot.\
    \ The emission efficiency of the suggested CS-CSRR MSPA at resonant frequency\
    \ is \ncomparable to the estimated value, according to the investigation's findings.\
    \ \n \n5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE \nThe circular-slot antenna using CSRR technology\
    \ presented reduces the antenna's size without losing \nperformance. The suggested\
    \ band operation is obtained by adjusting the parameters of a standard complementary\
    \ \nring antenna, building it appropriate for 5G midband applications below 6GHz.\

    \ the typical basic mode. This method reduced the return loss to less than \n\
    32dB at precise resonance frequencies of 3.5GHz. \nThe projected mid-band (Sub-6GHz,\
    \ Sub-7GHz) would be used in fast-evolving wireless technology products, \nsuch\
    \ as smart computing gadgets. \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] Sadiya Afrin Swarna, Salma\

    \ of one of a kind through the \nauthors to lessen the energy intake, boom the\
    \ speed and accuracy of the comparator circuit \nThere are strategies that target\
    \ on enhancing the preamplifier circuit to lessen the offset \nwhilst preserving\
    \ the latch. Paintings as it's far, enhancing the dynamic latch to enhance \n\
    pace, offers 0 static energy intake, however the pace is compromised Comparator\
    \ isn't best \nutilized in analog to virtual converter, however has different\
    \ packages In virtual in formation \ntransfer, switching strength regulators and\
    \ others, the comparator has its very own meaning.  \n2.              CONVENTIONAL\
    \ DYNAMIC COMPARATOR \n                              \n \n \n3 \nFigure 2.1.Conventional\
    \ Dynamic Comparator [5] \n \nThe standard dynamic comparator is dispensed in\
    \ given figure. In t represents NMOS type \npreamplifier and similar diagram can\
    \ represents PMOS type preamplifier by changing \nNMOS with PMOS. The operation\
    \ depends on the clock signal, there are two signals namely \nCLK and CLKbar to\
    \ make the circuit operate in two stages, evaluation stage and reset stage. \n\
    When CLK = 0 i.e CLKbar = 1, the transistors M3 and M4 charge  Ap and An node\
    \ to power \nsupply (VDD) and as M0 is OFF, it in addition to M3 ans M4 makes\
    \ M5 and M6 ON, thus \nOUTp1 and OUTp2 nodes are released to ground and hence\
    \ called reset stage. On the other \nside when CLK = 1 i.e  CLKbar = 0,the difference\
    \ in  signal is boosted by the pre-amplifier \nat  two transistors M1 and M2 respectively,\
    \ this signal at Ap and An wires is created which \nthen gets boosted further\
    \ by M6 and M5 and hence called the evaluation stage. The \ndifference thus obtained\
    \ acts as input for the inverters which are cross coupled and are \nfurther converted\
    \ to power supply (VDD) and ground as there is positive feedback. Now the \noutput\
    \ of the circuit will come according to the difference in inputs which justifies\
    \ the \noperation of a comparator. As discussed earlier there are two stages,\
    \ in the evaluation stage \nit does not stop working even after latching of correct\
    \ value and causes dissipation of power. \nThe clock needs a very high accuracy\
    \ timing as latch measure needs to preserve the \ndifference in input voltages\
    \ and thus this acts as a disadvantage of this circuit. \n \n2.1         Cross\
    \ Coupled Conventional Dynamic Comparator \n \n \n                           \
    \        Figure 2.2.Conventional Dynamic Comparator[7] \n \n4\n \nIn this figure,\
    \ latching level makes use of separately biased gate cross coupled transistors\
    \  \ninstead of the standard cross-coupled inverter circuit. There are advantages\
    \ of both as \ndynamic comparators need positive feedback and low static usage\
    \ of power and high speed. \nStandard one stage dynamic comparator have disadvantages\
    \ as they experience voltage \nheadroom and kickback noise which becomes doubtful\
    \ as speed and power suffer.:large. \nStandard two-stage dynamic comparator has\
    \ advantages like less stacking, appropriate for \nlow-voltage operation and reduced\
    \ kickback noise which leads to low power usage and \nhence it is preferred. Improvising\
    \ the net transconductance is a method to decrease delay \nand as only PMOS is\
    \ on it causes low regeneration velocity which leads to increased time \nin metastable\
    \ state and inturn leads to higher power consumption . \n \n \n2.2         Transconductance\
    \ Enhanced  Dynamic Comparator \n \n A dynamic comparator with a fresh latching\
    \ stage in addition to transconductance is \ndepicted. This stage consists of\
    \ transistors which are cross coupled as earlier in place of \nback to back connection\
    \ of inverters. The frequency was limited earlier as there was \nconstant re designing\
    \ of pre amplifier but not the latch. The performance depends on the \ntransconductance\
    \ in the initial phase and if it is large then there will be low dissipation of\
    \ \npower and high speed. Now the transistor sizing is also crucial as the same\
    \ pre amplifier \nstage is being used which can also lead to high parasitics and\
    \ can affect the boosting stage. \nSo, we name it transconductance enhanced as\
    \ it is totally dependent on this value and by \nfurther improvements many constraints\
    \ can be matched. \n \n3.     RESULTS AND SIMULATIONS \n \n \n5 \n \n        \
    \                              Figure.3.1 Transconductance-Enhanced Dynamic Comparator\
    \ \n \n                              Figure.3.2 Dynamic Comparator Output Waveform\
    \ \n \nThe transient analysis of the transconductance enhanced dynamic comparator\
    \ circuit is \nshown above. From this analysis  it can be observed that noise\
    \ affects one of the output \nnodes in latch as it changes with the transitioning\
    \ in the clock. For the transient analysis we \nhave taken pulse voltage( vpulse)\
    \  as input and a dc voltage(vdc) as reference node. Different \nlatching configurations\
    \ present in the circuit help in increase speed. The delay has been \ndecreased\
    \ to 228ps when operated at f<2.5GHz. As a modification in latch configuration\
    \ has \n \n6\nbeen used it leads to a higher frequency of operation. It also takes\
    \ up less area than before. \nIf offset voltage is to be reduced to 2mV, the maximum\
    \ operating frequency drops with a \nsatisfactory delay. \n \n4.   CONCLUSION\
    \ \n \nThe tender cross-coupled dynamic comparator has latching level and preamplifier\
    \ level. In \nlatching level as long as strong positive feedback exists there\
    \ will be very less power usage. \nIn preamplifier stage there is significant\
    \ improvement in gain and reduction of unwanted \nnoise . The cross-coupled dynamic\
    \ comparator has two stages as mentioned earlier, one is \nreset and other is\
    \ evaluation or comparison stage. One resets the transistors while the other \n\
    uses difference in input voltages. In reset phase latching circuit is sway in\
    \ strong inversion \nregion leading to increase in trans-conductance of the latch.\
    \ In comparison phase it will tend \nto decrease delay as well as power usage.\
    \ The results have been simulated using Cadence \nVirtuoso in CMOS 90nm technology\
    \ and it shows improved gain and takes up less area than \nthe standard one. \n\

    \ growth detection, size, segmentation, and classification remain difficult to\
    \ \nassess. Using MRI images, we will develop a method for locating and classifying\
    \ brain \ntumors during this study. In this study, we use MATLAB code to categorize\
    \ images as \ntumors or non-growth. Using this code, we will be able to identify\
    \ and visualize the precise \nlocation and size of the tumors within the brain.\
    \ We frequently use datasets with a wide \nvariety of growth sizes, types, and\
    \ locations. \nKeywords. Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Convolutional Neural Network,\
    \ Malignant \ntumors. \n1. INTRODUCTION \nA neoplasm is a brain tumor that is\
    \ caused by an abnormal collection or mass of cells. The \nbone that surrounds\
    \ your brain is extremely rigid. Growth in such a constrained area will \ncause\
    \ problems. Brain tumors are frequently either cancerous (malignant) or benign\
    \ \n(benign). The pressure within the bone increases as benign or malignant tumors\
    \ grow. This \ncauses brain damage, which can be severe. Primary tumors are those\
    \ that develop within \nthe brain, whereas secondary tumors are those that spread\
    \ to different parts of the body [1-\n2]. These tumors keep their prime places\
    \ whereas it will not attack different sections of the \nhuman body. They are\
    \ not spreading to native structures or distant parts of the body. \nBenign tumors\
    \ do not appear to be a problem in most cases. A tumor may be less \ndangerous\
    \ unless it is located near any vital organs, tissues, nerves, or blood vessels\
    \ and \ncauses pain. Surgery will be used to remove benign tumors. They'll grow\
    \ to be quite large, \nweighing several pounds. They will be dangerous when they\
    \ occur at regular intervals in \nthe brain and crowd the standard structures\
    \ at regular intervals in the OS cavity. They'll \ntarget vital organs or block\
    \ channels. Furthermore, some benign tumors, such as organ \npolyps, are thought\
    \ to be malignant tumors and are currently being removed to prevent \nthem from\
    \ becoming malignant. Benign tumors rarely recur after removal; if they do, it's\
    \ \nusually at regular intervals in the same location [3]. The tumors have irrepressible\
    \ physical \ncell growth that extends internally to detached human parts of the\
    \ body is referred as \nmalignant tumors. These cancerous tumors enter and attack\
    \ different parts of the body. \nThey expand to detached sites through the blood\
    \ or the lymph arrangement and will \nincrease the chances of metastatic growth.\
    \  This attack can happen any parts in the human \nbody and its mostly found from\
    \ bone, brain, liver and lungs. It requires to be treated as \n \n2 \nearly as\
    \ possible to avoid them expand rapidly. If detected early, treatment will most\
    \ likely \nconsist of surgery combined with attainable therapy or radiation therapy.\
    \ If cancer must be \ntreated, the treatment will most likely be general, such\
    \ as therapy or therapy. Primary brain \ntumors start in the brain. Tumors can\
    \ start anywhere in the brain or the wire, medulla \nspinalis, or neural structure.\
    \ The neural structure is a part of the brain where the majority \nof malignant\
    \ brain tumors in adults begin (forebrain). They will also begin in various \n\
    components such as the: tissue layers that protect the brain (meninges) pituitary\
    \ or pineal \nglands in the spinal cord The majority of benign brain tumors in\
    \ adults start within the \ntissue layer. They are referred to as meningiomas\
    \ [4]. \nSecondary brain tumors or brain metastases are cancers that have spread\
    \ to the brain from \nother parts of the body. Secondary brain cancers are created\
    \ from the same type of cells as \nprimary cancer. So, if your cancer began in\
    \ the lungs, carcinoma cells create cancerous \nareas in the brain. Any type of\
    \ willer can manifest in the brain. However, the most \ncommon types are cancer\
    \ of the lungs cancer of the breast Cancer of the kidney melanoma \ncarcinoma\
    \ colon (rectal) cancer This occurs as a result of killer cells escaping from\
    \ \nprimary cancer and travelling through the bloodstream to the brain. They will\
    \ develop into \nnew tumors there [5]. Deep learning technique for image classification\
    \ is Convolutional \nNeural Network. The reason for adopting convolutional neural\
    \ network is a system that \nuses a design of multi-layer viewing platform for\
    \ minimizing the executable requirements. \nIt will maximize the image processing\
    \ potential results and remove the unnecessary \nconditions. It is more effective\
    \ to train the image processing data and linguistic \ncommunication process. \n\
    Primary brain neoplasms include any tumour that begins inside the brain. Brain\
    \ cells, the \nmembranes surrounding the brain (meninges), nerves, or glands can\
    \ all develop into \nprimary brain tumours [6]. The work on information among\
    \ medical images was planned \nto greatly increase machine speed for growth segmentation\
    \ outcomes [7]. The tumour \nidentification would be possible in such a short\
    \ period of time. A photograph is segmented \ninto areas or objects. During this\
    \ time, the item must be phased out of the background to \nview and classify the\
    \ image's content correctly [8]. \n2. \nMETHODOLOGY \nOur idea is to identify\
    \ and visualize the precise location and size of the tumors within the \nbrain.\
    \ We frequently employ datasets containing a wide range of growth sizes, types,\
    \ and \nlocations. The proposed system of brain tumor detection and classification\
    \ flow diagram is \nillustrated in the below figure. \nA dataset is a collection\
    \ of subsets, and the dataset in this study is MRI scans. This dataset \ncontains\
    \ 12 malignant images, 11 benign images, and 5 non-tumor images. Figure 2.2. and\
    \ \nFigure 2.3. represents the data sets for non-tumor images and tumor images.\
    \ \n2.1. \nPreprocessing \nOur proposed pre-processing component consists primarily\
    \ of procedures that are typically \nrequired prior to the goal analysis and extraction\
    \ of the given information, as well as \ngeometric corrections of the initial\
    \ image. Non-brain element photos were removed, then \nthe data was altered the\
    \ proper mirroring performed on the input. The input magnetic \nresonance imaging\
    \ images are converted into suitable type is done from the preprocessing \n \n\
    3 \nphase. This work was done frequently. Noise, blur low distinction, bias and\
    \ partial volume \nresults are the major issues that arisen during the pre-process\
    \ stage. The pre-process level \nhelps to minimize the noise on images, lightness\
    \ vital parts with other issues. \n \nFigure 2.1. Flow of Brain tumor detection\
    \ and classification diagram  \n2.2. \nGlobal Thresholding \n \nThis is the most\
    \ basic type of thresholding. The histogram of the complex image is \npartitioned\
    \ by a single threshold in this case. Segmentation is then accomplished by \n\
    scanning each pixel and labelling it as background or foreground based on its\
    \ grey level. \nThe tumour area is highlighted more than the rest of the brain\
    \ in this method. These non-\ntumors are classified as tumours by setting a threshold,\
    \ and thus proven to be such has no \neffect. \n2.3. \nOTSU Thresholding \n \n\
    The OTSU technique is a type of world thresholding that relies solely on the image's\
    \ grey \nvalue. It is widely used because it is simple and effective. The brink\
    \ is chosen by OTSU's \nthresholding to reduce the intraclass variance of the\
    \ thresholder's black and white pixels. \nOTSU's technique is implemented as \"\
    grey thresh\" in MATLAB. The 2- dimensional bar \ngraph is projected onto the\
    \ diagonal and then applied to the 2D Otsu theorem bar graph to \nfind the best\
    \ threshold worth. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2.2. Non-Tumor Images from\

    \ square, that is simplest way to solve non-\nlinear problems using linear classifiers.\
    \ Within the SVM codes, the kernel functions square \nmeasure is used as parameters.\
    \ They aid in determining the shape of the hyperplane and \ncall boundary. \n\
    3.1. \nLinear Kernel \nWhen the information is Linearly severable, that is, when\
    \ it can be separated with a single \nLine, a Linear Kernel is used. It is among\
    \ the most used kernels. It is mostly used when \nthere are an excessive number\
    \ of possibilities in a given dataset. The accuracy of linear \nkernel is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 3.1. \n3.2. \nPolynomial Kernel \nThis kernel is known for machine\
    \ learning kernel. To describe the likeness of vectors is \nattained by SVM and\
    \ other kernel models across the polynomial initial variables of highly \nfeature\
    \ area. It allows the non-linear models learning. The accuracy of this proposed\
    \ kernel \nis shown in the below figure. \n3.3. \nQuadratic Kernel \nBecause the\
    \ kernel is quadratic, the choice boundary could be a level set of a quadratic\
    \ \nmix. It is true for quadratics that a combination of quadratics is itself\
    \ quadratic, but this is \nnot necessarily true for other types of kernels. The\
    \ accuracy of quadratic kernel is \nillustrated in Figure 3.3. \nFigure 3.1. Accuracy\
    \ of Linear Kernel \n   Figure 3.2. Accuracy of Polynomial Kernel \n \n \n5 \n\
    3.4. \nRBF Kernel \nThe RBF kernel, also known as the radial basis functions kernel,\
    \ is a common machine \nlearning kernel operation that is used in a variety of\
    \ kernelized learning techniques. \nFrequently, it is used in SVM classification.\

    \ procedure for tumour \ndetection in this paper. In addition to many existing\
    \ tumour segmentation and detection \nmethodologies for brain imaging proposed\
    \ system established. Overall associate degree \naccuracy is attained up to 97.\
    \ Sleuthing tumors all steps are mentioned. Two segmentation \ntechniques are\
    \ used to classify the neoplasm for imaging image acquisition to pre-\nprocessing\
    \ have been completed. Ripple based pre-process operations strategies are stated\
    \ \nin the implementation. The image quality and detection procedure are improved\
    \ by edge \nsharpening, noise removal, enhancement and unwanted background removal.\
    \ It is \nimproved the filtering in the imaging process and maximized the quality.\
    \ Performance of \nneural network-based segmentation on the noisy field is superior,\
    \ and no basic information \nallocation is required, but one of the primary disadvantages\
    \ is the learning approach. For \nthe production of effective and accurate tumor\
    \ detection findings, a group of thresholds \nbased and SVM arrangement is added\
    \ with Self-Organizing Map. These methods can \ndetermine whether there is growth\
    \ and, if so, whether the growth is benign, normal, or \nmalignant. \n5. \nREFERENCES\

    \ \n(7.41 – 7.8GHz ) [23-24]. In the modern world, the demand of wider bandwidth,\
    \ high speed data and novel \nmechanism of feeding encourage the academician and\
    \ scientists to research on ultrawide band spectrum band for \nvarious wireless\
    \ applications. Additionally, UWB communication system is a potentially pioneering\
    \ approach to \nwireless technology. It sends streams of extremely brief energy\
    \ pulses that can be dispersed across a wide range of \nfrequencies, typically\
    \ lasting between 10 and 1,000 picoseconds and receives the narrowband signals\
    \ that are \ncompressed in time as compared to sinusoidal that are compressed\
    \ in frequency [25-26]. This is differing to the \nlong-established convention\
    \ of transmitting the signals over narrow frequency bandwidth such as 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b \nand Bluetooth etc. It allows the transmission over a wide frequencies\
    \ range along with low power spectral density \n(PSD). It has been expanded rapidly\
    \ for commercial as well as for military purposes, due to its cost effective and\
    \ \nflexible way of communication [27]. Recently, due to the developments of high-rate\
    \ data network with low power \nconsumption, ultra wideband (UWB) antennas has\
    \ become an attractive topic of research. Compared to narrowband, \nthe UWB has\
    \ large peak gain, multiple sharing with users and low noise PSD [28-29] . Whenever\
    \ it came to \nflexibility and battery life, UWB has a significant advantage because\
    \ the power required levels are so low that they \nare even lower than that for\
    \ mobile handset. Furthermore, the wide frequency broadcast sets the UWB extremely\
    \ \ninterference-resistant. The potential capacity is mentioned in the more than\
    \ hundreds of megabits per second, \ncoming through much quicker than Bluetooth\
    \ at 2Mbps and the most recent 54 Mbps Wi-Fi standard technology. It \ncan also\
    \ transmit a significant quantity of data. [30-31]. It has low cost due to simple\
    \ hardware and low power \nconsumption also. With UWB, security is a smaller issue\
    \ because the short pulses are much more challenging to \ndetect, but range is\
    \ still a problem. Because signals can only travel 10 to 20 meters, because UWB\
    \ cannot match \nagainst 802.11 WLAN technologies [32]. A broad bandwidth is acquired\
    \ by the majority of the service suppliers. \nSince small, simple structure antennas\
    \ with wider bandwidth and high gain are required for the transmission and \n\
    reception of the large bandwidth. There fore in the present research work, the\
    \ design and development of a dumble \nshaped MSA has been introduced that carry\
    \ all these necessities for high data rate communications [33]. \nBecause MSA\
    \ has some admirable features like cost effective, light weight, easy to fabrication\
    \ and amalgamation \nwith complex circuitry [34-35]. On the other hand, the conventional\
    \ MPA bears with some limitations as narrow \nbandwidth along with low gain. In\
    \ literature, various techniques are offered to enhance the bandwidth of the antenna\
    \ \nlike as defected ground structure mechanism (DGS) [36-40], antenna stacked\
    \ with various type of patch shapes [41-\n43] and by utilizing the different type\
    \ of feeding mechanism such microstrip feed, coplanar waveguide [44-45], L-\n\
    strip feed [46], aperture coupled feed [47-50], proximity feed [51-52] and coaxial\
    \ probe feed [53-54]. Researchers \nand academician are work together to cover\
    \ multi-band, full- band and ultrawide band (UWB). To enhance the \nlimited bandwidth\
    \ and inferior gain, the DGS instigate on the surface of ground that provides\
    \ the disturbance to the \nflow of surface current. Additionally, it helps to\
    \ improve the overall inductance and capacitance of the microstrip \ntransmission\
    \ line.  \nThe aim of this paper is to present the advantages of Defected Ground\
    \ Structure to obtain the wider frequency band, \nimpedance matching with high\
    \ gain. As a result a novel Dumble shape UWB antenna with DGS techniques has been\
    \ \ndesigned and simulated on Ansys HFSS V’13 and fabricated using wet etching\
    \ photolithography process. The \nsimulated S-parameter, gain and radiation properties\
    \ results of the proposed antenna are confirmed experimentally \nby tested it\
    \ on anechoic chamber and vector network analyzer (VNA). \n \nTable 1 summarizes\
    \ a comparison between various previously reported and  proposed antenna that\
    \ have been \npublished in terms of resonating band, volume,  peak gain, and impedance\
    \ bandwidth. It has been found that the \nimpedance bandwidth of has less bandwidth\
    \ than the suggested antenna. In terms of bandwidth, the proposed \nantenna operates\
    \ on UWB frequencies, in contrast to the reported antennas' multiband and wide\
    \ band operations. It \nwas confirmed with certainty that the suggested antenna\
    \ has a smaller volume. Table 1 show that the suggested \nantenna is suited for\
    \ the unlicensed band (2.4–10 GHz) and has a small size, a simple structure, and\
    \ entire ultra-\nwideband. \n \nTable1: Comparison between the previously reported\

    \ CONFIGURATION OF THE DIFFERENT ANTENNA STRUCTURE \nThe key goal of this proposed\
    \ is to design a novel dumble shaped ultra-wide band (UWB) used for un-licensed\
    \ \nbands i.e. ISM (2.41-2.46 GHz), U-NII (5.15-5.35 and 5.75-5.85GHz) and space\
    \ communication (7.2-9.2GHz). For \nthis aspect, dumble shaped design with reduced\
    \ ground plane structure has been designed as shown in figure 1(a). It \nis able\
    \ to excite multi-band properties i.e. 3-4.4, 5.1-6.025, 7.2-9.2GHz. In order\
    \ to achieve the better impedance \nmatching and quite good gain, the dimensions\
    \ of the conventional antenna configuration is optimized by  parametric \nsimulation\
    \ in ANSYS HFSS software as shown in table 2. The proposed antenna geometries\
    \ are built and simulated \non a mechanically stable FR-4 lossy substrate with\
    \ overall dimensions of 40×50×1.6 mm3. It contains the three \nlayers like as\
    \ ground structure i.e. bottom layer followed by a FR4 substrate having high dielectric\
    \ constant i.e. \nintermediate layer, microstrip feedline and rhombic patch of\
    \ copper material i.e. topmost layer. Additionally at the \nbottom edge of the\
    \ antenna a 50 Ω microstrip feed point (width W =3mm) is utilized to for the excitation\
    \ of the \ndesigned antenna. The initial dimensions of the proposed antenna such\
    \ as i.e. length (L) and width (W) has been \noptimized using transmission line\
    \ model equations given as 1-3 [12]. \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n1\n2\nr\n\

    \ \n \n \n2.1 Effect of substrate material \n \nIn the proposed antenna design,\
    \ three different materials of substrate are used, i.e. FR4, Duroid and Rogers\

    \ effects on proposed antenna’s \nperformance i.e. impedance bandwidth, losses.\
    \ These materials are chosen for this antenna as they enhanced the \nbandwidth\
    \ and gives better mechanical results in the presence of air. To check the performance\
    \ of these different \nmaterials a combined S-paramter graph is plotted as shown\
    \ in the fig. 2 and a table 1 is drawn to show the different \nfrequency bands\
    \ excited by the antenna with each material. From table 1, it is concluded that\

    \ ANTENNA DESIGNS. \n \nFR4 substrate has been used as a substrate material for\
    \ the fabrication of proposed antenna having the dimension \n40×50 mm2. To pattern\
    \ the dumble shape structure on substrate wet etching photolithography technique\
    \ has been \nutilized. To make the ground plane and dumble shape patch on bottom\
    \ and top of the substrate, respectively a layer \nof copper material of thickness\
    \ 0.35 mm has been deposited. On bottom and top of the FR4 substrate material,\
    \ a \nthick layer of copper material having the thickness 0.035mm is deposited\
    \ to be use as a ground plane and dumble \nshaped patch along with microstrip\
    \ feed-point respectively as depicted in the figure 4 (a-b). The validity of the\
    \ \nresults obtained from ANSYS HFSS software such as radiation pattern, gain,\

    \ The Agilent’s VNA (vector network analyser) model no. E-5063A \noperating from\

    \ State when we \nleave home. We do not know which appliance consumes more power\
    \ and which appliance \nconsumes less power. This paper provides you a Power Consumption\

    INTRODUCTION \nA network of physical and virtual objects interconnected together\
    \ via the internet is \nInternet of Things. A greater level of accuracy and service\
    \ can be obtained by using IoT \nbased Real Time Systems. The data obtained through\
    \ IoT devices can be used to resolve \nthe real time problems. Traffic Management,\
    \ Energy Management, Pollution Control, \nHealthcare, Security are the key sectors\
    \ where the Internet of Things plays a vital role. \nPower Consumption Monitoring\
    \ System using IoT provides the real-time monitoring of \npower consumed by home\
    \ appliances and represent the data of power consumed by \nindividual appliance[1].\
    \ Once, we start monitoring our own power consumptions, we have \nan idea about\
    \ the power consumed by individual appliances. The IoT System includes \nphysical\
    \ layer, IoT middleware and application layer as shown in Figure 1. To collect\
    \ the \ndata in real time scenario; IoT devices, sensors, and actuators are used.\
    \ IoT devices, \nsensors, and actuators forms the physical layer of the IoT System.\
    \ IoT middleware layer is \nused for the exchange of information between the real\
    \ time sensors and the application \nlayer.  The communication protocols transfers\
    \ the sensed data through Wi-Fi, Ethernet, \nGSM, The gateway between the physical\
    \ layer and IoT Middleware establishes the same. \nThe application layer handled\
    \ by the User is used to send commands to physical objects \nover the Internet\
    \ via mobile applications, web applications. The IoT System includes \nvarious\
    \ communication methods like Device to Device, Device to Cloud, Device to \nGateway\
    \ Communication and Back-End Data sharing[2]  \n \n2 \n   \nFigure 1. Architecture\
    \ of an IoT System \nFigure 2. Power Consumption Monitoring \nSystem using IoT\
    \ with three Loads \n2. \nPOWER CONSUMPTION MONITORING SYSTEM USING IOT \nPower\
    \ Consumption Monitoring System using IoT consists of Arduino Uno, NodeMCU, \n\
    and Current Sensor (ACS-712). The current sensors(ACS-712) are connected to the\
    \ analog \npins of the Arduino. The V0 pin of current sensors CT-1, CT-2 and CT-3\
    \ are connected to \nanalog pins A6, A5 and A4 in Arduino respectively, which\
    \ is responsible for the transfer \nof data from current sensor to Arduino. The\
    \ current sensors CT-1, CT-2 and CT-3 are \nconnected to their respective loads\
    \ and these sensors are provided with 5V supply from \nArduino. The NodeMCU –\
    \ ESP8266 and Arduino is connected using TX and RX pins. \nThese pins are responsible\
    \ for establishing connection between them for transmitting and \nreceiving the\
    \ data. All the pins should be grounded properly. \n3. \nINTERFACING THE IOT SYSTEM\
    \ WITH CLOUD \nIn the system, we have to use MQTT broker to monitor our energy\
    \ uses over the \ninternet[3]. We will use AdaFruit IO platform as MQTT broker\
    \ and follow the steps to \nmonitor the Power Consumption \n1. \nFor storing data\
    \ on Power Consumption, an AdaFruit account is created \n2. \nArduino and ESP12\
    \ Wi-Fi module is programmed to detect and transfer \nthe data on Power Consumption\
    \ to cloud \nMQTT message headers are simple to enhance network data transmission.\
    \ MQTT \nconsiders informing between gadget to cloud and cloud to gadget. Adafruit\
    \ IO creates \nvarious learning assets, including live and recorded recordings\
    \ identified with gadgets, \ninnovation, and programming. IFTTT gets its name\
    \ from the programming contingent \nproclamation \"assuming this, that.\" What\
    \ the organization gives is a product stage that \nassociates applications, gadgets\
    \ and administrations from various designers to trigger any \none computerization[4].\

    \ monitor \nthe Power Consumption \nThe process flow is as illustrated below;\
    \ \n1. When the power is turned on the Arduino establish connection with ESP8266\
    \ – \nNodeMCU and with current sensor ACS-712. The Arduino microcontroller gets\
    \ \ninput for current sensor and process the data from the sensor. The Arduino\
    \ transfers \nthe processed data to the NodeMCU Wi-Fi module. \n2. NodeMCU Wi-Fi\
    \ module first check the status of Wi-Fi connection, if there is a \nproblem with\
    \ the connection NodeMCU will reset the Wi-Fi connection. When the \nWi-Fi connection\
    \ made successfully then NodeMCU will check the connection \nwith webserver (adafruit.io),\
    \ if there is a problem with the connection webserver \n(adafruit.io) will reset\
    \ the webserver connection.  \n3. When the webserver connection is successfully\
    \ made, NodeMCU will transfer the \nprocessed data received from the Arduino to\
    \ the cloud platform (adafruit.io) \n4. In ADAFRUIT.io platform the received data\
    \ is visually presented to the viewer. \nThrough the data obtained from the NodeMCU\
    \ the data is categorized into different \nforms like pie-chart, graph etc., \
    \ \n5. ADAFRUIT.io platform may be used to trigger IFTTT platform to send E-mails\
    \ \nand SMS to the respective person. This IFTTT platform record the time when\
    \ the \ntriggered is send. It also records electricity bill amount in it[6]. \n\

    \ in the adafruit.io \nplatform  \n \nWe can clearly see that the units consumed\
    \ by each bulb vary deepening upon the \ntime. The experiment was conducted periodically\
    \ for around nine days to monitor the \npower consumption. Here three bulbs were\
    \ used to act as three different loads. At the end \nof ninth day the electricity\
    \ bill for the power consumed by the bulbs were generated as \nRs.18.60. The graphical\
    \ representation shows us how much power consumed in a room in \na day. The adafruit\
    \ platform creates individual graph for room 1, room 2 and room 3 as \nshown below.\

    \ representation of power consumed in Room 3 \n5. \nCONCLUSION \nThe system may\
    \ be deployed in home or industry for monitoring the power consumption \nand track\
    \ the usage of power by different appliances.  The system may help you in giving\
    \ \nout real time data of power consumed in past and present. To end up a perfect\
    \ smart home \na perfect smart meter with enhanced technology is required. The\
    \ design proposed has an \nerror of around 3% to 4% in three phase power supply.\
    \ Thus, the accuracy has reached \n95% which means most of the time the results\
    \ obtained is precise. The data collected \nthroughout the month can be accessed\
    \ from anyplace in the cloud platform and the data is \nused for bill generation\
    \ at the end of each month. IFTTT plays its role of triggering the \n \n6 \ncommunication\
    \ via Email or SMS and it pings the customers. The major issue of stealing \n\
    power can be eradicated by the system. \n6. \nREFERENCES \n[1] \nMd. Hasibul Islam,\

    \ of deaths in many families more recently since the virus can infect a healthy\
    \ person even if \nnot in direct contact of the infected person. The symptoms\
    \ of viral infections may vary from high fever, tiredness, dry cough, sore \n\
    throat, tastelessness, misery, anorexia and diarrhoea in people.  Viral infections\
    \ viz. corona are contagious and communicable so \nthe challenge remains always\
    \ to diagnose the infections at an early stage with the ultimate aim to save the\
    \ mankind. In this \nendeavour, autonomous and miniaturised bot is proposed which\
    \ can detect the ailing persons remotely by judging the human \nbehaviour, actions\
    \ and related eventual activities. The same bot can be customised to detect all\
    \ existing viruses by adopting relevant \nchanges in the procedural algorithms\
    \ of the whole proposed system or the mechanism embedded into the bot. Due to\
    \ obvious \nreasons, it is always desirable that every virus in consideration\
    \ has to end after being declared pandemic. With the effective use of \nartificial\
    \ intelligence and machine learning, the BOT is supposed to detect the symptoms\
    \ of the affected person and can be \nprescribed adequate treatment and precautions\
    \ on the go. The data gathered by bots can further be used by Doctors to diagnose\
    \ the \ndisease more effectively with a real time approach. \nKeywords: Viral\
    \ Infections, Autonomous BOT, Corona, Symptomatic \n1.INTRODUCTION \nVirus with\
    \ the passage of time it has a huge impact all over the world and one of them\
    \ is Coronavirus. Efforts are being made on \nthe medical aspects of this virus\
    \ by conducting various experiments to preserve populations from this catastrophic\
    \ virus[1]. Disease \ninfection starts 3-4 days before the symptoms are observed,\
    \ on the other side the tracing of symptoms take place 2-3 days after the \nsymptoms\
    \ take place. On the basis of current reports the virus discarding is upto 10\
    \ days after the beginning of symptoms take \nplace in people with lenient COVID-19\
    \ and the 10 days discarding can reach upto 20 days for the people with extreme\
    \ level of \ninfection and even for those who have less immune system[2]. (SARS-COV-2)\
    \ is a new type of corona virus that causes extreme \nrespiratory progression.\
    \ It was detected for the first time in the city WUHAN, CHINA were the people\
    \ with infection called \npneumonia related to the bunch of acute respiratory\
    \ illness cases in Wuhan. All systematic functions of the original (SARS-COV-\n\
    2) virus particle seem related to corona virus in nature. Other remarkable alternatives\
    \ of (SARS-COV-2) emerged in 2020. As of \nthe end of December 2021, a total of\
    \ 5 variants of SARS-COV-2 were circulating among the general public Worldwide.\
    \ Demand, \nthese a real ph a variation, gamma variation, beta variation, delta\
    \ variation, and micron variation. Confirmation of corona virus \ndisease was\
    \ given by quantitative analysis by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction).Impact of\
    \ covid-19 on public comprises on \ndifferent parts/organs One not unusual symptom,\
    \ lack of odor, outcomes from contamination of the guide cellular of the olfactory\
    \ \nepithelium with next harm to the olfactory neurons [3]. In many publications\
    \ it has been reported the involvement of the central \nand peripheral nervous\
    \ system in COVID-19, since the vastness of the ACE2 in the glandular cells is\
    \ affects in gastrointestinal \norgans, the duodenal, the rectal epithelium as\
    \ well as endothelial cells of the small intestine. It can even cause acute heart\
    \ damage \nand incurable damage to the cardiovascular system Acute heart injury\
    \ has been found in 12% of public who are hospitalized in \nWuhan, China, and\
    \ is more common in China severe illness. The prevalence of heart disease symptoms\
    \ is high, due to structured \nerythrogenic responses and due to change in immune\
    \ system during disease progression, but acute heart disease may also be \nassociated\
    \ with heart ACE2 receptors [4]-[13]. \nIn addition to the coronavirus, there\
    \ are a number of other viral infections that spread between people through physical\
    \ contact \nand lead to widespread spread of the virus.Diseases such as influenza,\
    \ meningitis, pneumonia and many more diseases are the \nexample of   spreadable\
    \ diseases on the basis of physical contact talking about influenza, viral infection\
    \ that attacks your respiratory \nsystem — your  nose, throat and lungs is often\
    \ known as influenza. It is often called the flu, but not similar to as that of\
    \ stomach \n\"flu\" since this virus causes diarrhoea and vomiting. At first,\
    \ flu-related symptoms are initial, with a cold-like feeling, rhinitis, \nsternutation,\
    \ and tonsillitis. But colds usually develop slowly, while flu tends to come on\
    \ suddenly. And while a cold can be \nuncomfortable, you often feel much worse\
    \ with the flu.[13-16] \nAnother named viral infection which is mild in terms\
    \ of infection and usually resolves on its own is known as Meningitis. Group \n\
    of virus named Enteroviruses caused many cases in the United States, this usually\
    \ happens in the season of late summer and early \nfall. Other virus which can\
    \ cause the infection of meningitis such as HIV, Mumps Virus[17]. \nPneumonia\
    \ is an infection of the lungs. It is characterized by the painfulness and redness\
    \ of the tiny sac of the lungs. Although \npneumonia can be effectively treated\
    \ with antibiotics, late detection can lead to serious complications and even\
    \ death. The causes \nof pneumonia are many and range from mild to severe, but\
    \ the most common cause is the flu. The disease is spread when germs \nenter your\
    \ lungs while breathing. Comprises of symptoms for detection of pneumonia starts\
    \ with fever, runny nose, headache and \nit will detect pneumonia if this is true\
    \ so.[18] \nEvery viral infection spreads through the physical contact so to overcome\
    \ this problem and eliminate the chances of physical \ncontact the robot is developed\
    \ which with the help of sensors can detect the symptoms and identify the problem\
    \ which the patient \nhas come across. It will reduce the chance of infection\
    \ spreading since this machine is simply detecting every actions remotely \nand\
    \ sending the combined report to the physician who will conclude the result. \n\
    II. LITERATURE REVIEW \nSeveral viruses resulted contagious disease embedding\
    \ symptoms such as high fever, tiredness, dry cough, sore throat, \ntastelessness,\
    \ misery, anorexia and diarrhoea has been observed in isolated. Unpredictable\
    \ cases and flare-ups have been \nrepresented with extended for the virus named\
    \ covid-19since 2019 from China, the USA and even more starting late from \nEurope.[19]\
    \ \nThe Chinese government alerted the WHO to the infectious covid- 19 virus spreading\
    \ on the coasts of China, starting with a fish \nthat was the first person confirmed\
    \ to be infected with this virus. The standard methods to check for the presence\
    \ of SARS-COV-\n2 are nucleic acid tests to detect the presence of viral RNA fragments.\
    \ Because these tests detect RNA but not the infecting virus, \nits “ability to\
    \ determine how long the patient has been infectious\" is limited. The test is\
    \ usually performed on respiratory samples \nobtained with nasopharyngeal swabs\
    \ ; however, a cotton swab or sputum sample canal so be used. Results are usually\
    \ a vailable \nwithin a few hours. WHO has published several testing protocols\
    \ for this disease. The virus was later renamed by the corona virus \nresearch\
    \ team to the extremely severe respiratory disorder corona virus 2 (SARS-COV-2)\
    \ and the disease was named corona virus \ndisease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO.WHO\
    \ declared the SARS-COV-2 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International\
    \ \nConcern (PHEIC) at the same time. \nWith the expansion of spreading the several\
    \ viruses across the globe death rate due to virus became a point to be noticed,\
    \ with the \nstarting of the virus the death rate counted to be 2.1% across china\
    \ and 0.2% across globe excluding china, and soon it arose to \n15% across globe\
    \ and this percent keeps on increasing gradually. Guidelines were taken by WHO\
    \ to prevent the expansion of the \nvirus amongst the public prevention such as\
    \ isolation of a person infected by the virus, social distancing among the public\
    \ so that \nto stop the spreading of virus amongst the respiratory function, as\
    \ well as avoid to touching people.[20-21] \nBefore April 2022, there was proper\
    \ medication for this infectious disease COVID-19, but now countries have proper\
    \ medication \nfor this disease onlyin some of the countries not all countries\
    \ have. In countries having proper medication there patients with \nmild/moderate\
    \ infection is serve by Remdesivir, which prevents the patient from serious illness\
    \ and reduces the chance of \nhospitalization of the patient.  \nMost of the patients\
    \ were encountered with mild infection of this virus, and this virus generally\
    \ impacted to the people with age \ngroup above 50, since these age groups peoples\
    \ have less immune and the virus directly attacks on immune system resulting to\
    \ the \nmortality of the people. People with mild infection were recommended to\
    \ isolate themselves in there home and to supply \nthemselves with proper fluids\
    \ supply in order to let themselves fully hydrated, and this home isolated was\
    \ only for 2 weeks since \nit has been observed that within 2-3 weeks people with\
    \ good immune system recover themselves from this infected virus. \nObserving\
    \ the preventions In mind the BOT will be a great asset in this particular scenario,\
    \ the main symptom of  COVID-19is \nfever which is detected by the thermal scanner&\
    \ infrared scanners, this BOT is embedded with a system which will examine the\
    \ \nbody temperature of a patient, apart from fever a person with coronavirus\
    \ infection also come across against tiredness, for this the \nBOT has a pulse\
    \ checker which will observe the pulse of the patient as well as the BOT is embedded\
    \ with a camera which will \nexamine the facial expression of the person through\
    \ scanning and can identify the expression of the person whether the patient is\
    \ \ntired or not this technology is creating results on the basis of different\
    \ set of instructions which are already feed in the BOT talking \nin context with\
    \ the facial expression the different sorts of facial expression are there which\
    \ on the basis of type tell the level of \ntiredness and accordingly makes report\
    \ on it, On the other hand the Sore throat is also a symptom coronavirus which\
    \ is recognized \nby the utilization of a camera and a spotlight introduced in\
    \ the BOT. The camera and electric lamp takes pictures of the throat, the \npicture\
    \ captured by the camera is then forwarded to the consultant doctor depending\
    \ upon which the doctor predicts the throat \ninfection of the infected person,\
    \ the framework forms the procured pictures utilizing shading change and shading\
    \ remedy \ncalculations, lastly orders Streptococcal Pharyngitis (or strep) throat\
    \ from solid throat utilizing AIstrategies. The cough is \ndiagnosed by the microphone\
    \ through which recorded the sound and through artificial intelligence analysis.\
    \ The sensory nodes in \nWBAN can be used effective data delivery of various symptoms\
    \ to the servers for evaluation of patient health.[22-24] \nIII. ARCHITECTURE\
    \ \nIn contrast with the architecture of the BOT, it initialises automatically\
    \ when a person stands infront of it using the mechanism of \nartificial intelligence.\
    \ As soon as the initialization of robot is done it starts with symptoms diagnosing\
    \ starting with fever diagnosing \nin terms of body temperature with the help\
    \ of infrared red sensor, as soon it is done with fever sensing it senses the\
    \ cough of the \nparticular patient with the help of microphone which records\
    \ the audio of that patient taking result from audio technology, thirdly \nit\
    \ starts sensing the tiredness of that particular patient in three different levels\
    \ the first level is pressure sensor strip which detects \nthe pressure of the\
    \ patient, second level is facial expression detection with the help of sensors\
    \ and camera to detect the expression \nof the patient and detect the tiredness\
    \ level of that patient, lastly it checks the pulse of that patient or heart rate\
    \ of that patient to \ngive the result on the tiredness level, after this process\
    \ it analysis the soar throat of the patient with the help of flash light and\
    \ \ncamera in the throat to take the photos of that soar throat and depict accordingly\
    \ , in addition it also performs various other test \nrelated to the symptoms\
    \ of other viral infection and keeps the record of the previous test since it\
    \ have to accumulate the report, \nonce all the process accomplishes the report\
    \ which consist the result of all the tested symptoms as well as the final result\
    \ in terms \nof whether the person is infected from which virus and which viral\
    \ infection the patient is infected. The cumulative report processed \nby the\
    \ BOT is uploaded on the application as soon as the report is done for and the\
    \ report is shared to the prescribed doctor to help \nthe patient with the relief\
    \ action from the infected virus.The application works like the registered patient\
    \ phone number is there in \nthe report so when that specific patient is nearby\
    \ (GPS is used by the application to track the patient location) someone has that\
    \ \nsame application installed in their smartphone. The proposed system can be\
    \ extended using autonomous ZIGBEE, WIFI, \nBLUETOOTH and satellite notes for\
    \ cohesing covid-19information to all in an Adhoc environment. The architecture\
    \ is explained \nand proposed to be implemented throughFig.1. which explains the\
    \ working of the BOT on the behalf of flow chart. \nFIGURE-1 FLOW-CHART DIAGRAM\
    \  \n                           FIGURE 2: COMPONENTS USED IN THE \nOVERALL CONCEPT\
    \ \nIV. METHODOLOGY \nThe technology used in this particular domain is mainly\
    \ IOT which is the sub part of artificial intelligence since we are using \nsensors\
    \ in this BOT and the sensors technology is particularly based on IOT (internet\
    \ of things) and all these setups is \ninterconnected with Artificial intelligence\
    \ technology apart from this we are using camera sensors as well which will be\
    \ performing \non the basis of image scanning technology. \nWith the presence\
    \ of BOT the symptoms identification is as follows, fever would be the first step\
    \ towards the identification of \ninfected virus this process will be completed\
    \ with the help of infrared sensors, the second step will be the process of identifying\
    \ \nthe tiredness of a patient with the help of facial recognition which will\
    \ depict the percentage of the tiredness level in accumulation \nto it the pulse\
    \ checker will check the pulse or heart rate of the patient and will depict the\
    \ rate of the patient on the other hand a \npressure sensitive strip will measure\
    \ the pressure of the patient at that particular situation, In addition to the\
    \ symptoms of virus \nSoar throat is also an additional symptom which will be\
    \ predicted on the basis of camera and microphone which will capture the \nimages\
    \ and voice record will be processed to the prescribed doctor with the help of\
    \ specific application and it will be confirmed \nwhether the patient is COIVD-19infected\
    \ or with the virus leading to Influenza or Meningitis. \nThis whole process which\
    \ finalises the report of the particular patient uses the technique of Artificial\
    \ intelligence and machine \nlearning to predict every symptom and depict whether\
    \ the patient is virus infected or not, this technology is advanced and will \n\
    work accordingly to reduce the risk factor for public in order it will avoid contact\
    \ spreading of the disease accordingly. Figure 2 \ndescribes the various components\
    \ which are being used in the BOT for its functioning. \nV. RESULT \nSummary of\
    \ this project is it is totally based on the machine learning technique in the\
    \ way that the machine is customized with \nsome worthy teachings related to the\
    \ symptoms reading of the infection in this way machine will be able to neglect\
    \ the physical \ncontact between public and will be able to summarise the result\
    \ on the way it has been setup to. \nInitialization will the most basic work which\
    \ will be done by the machine as soon as the public will walk over to it, after\
    \ that \nparticular step it will generate a 4-digit code which will individualize\
    \ the public from the bunch of public based on this 4-digit \ncode the doctor\
    \ or the nearby physician will depict the patient so that it wouldn’t create the\
    \ mess among the patient and doctor in \nsuch a way that particular patient is\
    \ suffering from COVID-19 or that particular patient is suffering from Influenza.\
    \ \nWith the presence of BOT the symptoms identification is as follows, fever\
    \ would be the first step towards the identification of \ninfected virus this\
    \ process will be completed with the help of infrared sensors, the second step\
    \ will be the process of identifying \nthe tiredness of a patient with the help\
    \ of facial recognition which will depict the percentage of the tiredness level\
    \ in accumulation \nto it the pulse checker will check the pulse or heart rate\
    \ of the patient and will depict the rate of the patient on the other hand a \n\
    pressure sensitive strip will measure the pressure of the patient at that particular\
    \ situation, In addition to the symptoms of virus \nSoar throat is also an additional\
    \ symptom which will be predicted on the basis of camera and microphone which\
    \ will capture the \nimages and voice record will be processed to the prescribed\
    \ doctor with the help of specific application and it will be confirmed \nwhether\
    \ the patient is virus infected or not, so with the help of technique of artificial\
    \ intelligence and machine learning the BOT \nis predicted to depict the correct\
    \ information by taking the help from various methods such as fever recognition\
    \ with IR sensors, \ntiredness prediction with the help of facial expression pulse\
    \ checker and pressure recognition, soar throat depiction with the help \nof microphone\
    \ and camera to capture the throat area image and after all the process the report\
    \ is forwarded to the prescribed doctor \nwho makes the final report whether the\
    \ patient is virus infected or not. If YES then which virus the patient is infected\
    \ from. \nFigure 3 shows the chart which describes the positive cases round the\
    \ globe and it basically aims on three types of viral infections \nwhich are Influenza,\
    \ Meningitis, Corona virus. \n \nFIGURE 3: STATS RELATED TO THE INCREMENT OF CASES\
    \ ROUND THE GLOBE IN THESE PARTICULAR \nDISEASE YEARLY \nVI. DISCUSSION \n \n\
    The spread of the infectious disease have been the major issue across the countries\
    \ and to classify them and to have a proper \ntreatment related to the disease\
    \ this BOT will be a powerful machine in accordance to this particular problem\
    \ several steps has \nbeen considered and attempted in order to overcome these\
    \ problems for instance Venous Pro BOT which is a clinical categorized \nBOT having\
    \ application of biological sample collection such as automatic drawing of blood\
    \ samples another is Swap OP BOT \ncategorized under clinical condition BOT having\
    \ application of collecting the swap samples and based on that create a report\
    \ after \nparticular sets of checking. On the other hand this BOT is different\
    \ in every aspect to these latest technology as it comprises with \nset of instructions\
    \ which are executed to perform a particular task which is investigating the type\
    \ of viral infections based on the \nsymptoms so the main difference between both\
    \ the technologies is that they were in physical contact to the infected person\
    \ which \ncan create or infect the other person but this BOT performs every sort\
    \ of task without getting in contact with that particular person. \nVII. CONCLUSION\
    \ \nRound the globe according to the stats the problem has disturbed millions\
    \ of public and keeps on disturbing by the way of spreading \namongst them through\

    \ \n \nWireless sensor networks have been popularizing increasingly in recent\
    \ years. A WSN is made up of many sensor \nnodes that can only interact with one\
    \ another across a limited communication range [1]. The Wireless Sensor (WS) \n\
    is a tiny sensor that performs critical operations such as transmission, sensing,\
    \ and data processing. Sink nodes and \nsensor nodes (SNs) are two types of wireless\
    \ sensor nodes depending on their operation. SNs sense the surroundings \nand\
    \ may also send data to other SNs. The base station (BS) or sink node, gathers\
    \ information from SNs and \naggregates it. Memory, Micro-sensor, transceiver,\
    \ battery, and microprocessor are the major components of a \nwireless sensor\
    \ node [2]. ease of use, ability to survive harsh environmental conditions, scalability\
    \ to large-scale \ndeployment, heterogeneity of nodes, mobility of nodes, ability\
    \ to cope with node failure, and energy harvesting are \nsome of the primary properties\
    \ of wireless sensor networks. The above characteristics ensure that WSN can be\
    \ used \nin a variety of applications [3]. A WSN's primary application domains\
    \ can be categorized as indicated in Fig.1. \n \nPrecision farming detects factors\
    \ such as pressures and temperatures, as well as providing a precise atmosphere\
    \ for \nagricultural purposes [4]. Environmental monitoring detects all climatic\
    \ characteristics to avoid disasters such as \nforest fires, floods, and gas leaks\
    \ [5]. Vehicle tracking aids in the prevention of traffic jams and the parking\
    \ system, \nas well as the tracking of the vehicle's movement. Medical care monitoring\
    \ aids in the real-time tracking of \nphysiological signals and helps to avoid\
    \ life-threatening risks [6]. Smart Buildings use less electricity and provide\
    \ \nhigher security. Security and Surveillance system assists in early enemy identification\
    \ and vehicle detecting. Animal \ntracking system keeps track of the animals by\
    \ optimizing rearing scenarios and managing the stress level of the \nanimals\
    \ by movement and vibration monitoring [7,8,9]. It is impossible to replace or\
    \ even recharge the SN's battery \nin these systems. As data transmitted from\
    \ SNs to BS is the main task in sensor networks, therefore clustering is the \n\
    best option for extending their lifetime[10,11]. \n \nClustering is a form of\
    \ topology management approach that groups SNs to increase network performance\
    \ by \ndistributing energy and rotating duties between  SNs to ensure equality\
    \ [12,13]. The clustering implementation \nphases in all cluster-based methods:\
    \ The steady-state phase (data transmission phase), set-up phase (cluster \nformation),\
    \ and CH selection phase [14,15]. \n. Kavitha Kayiram et al. [16], the authors\
    \ presented a unique data management method in this study that allows for \n(I)\
    \ time and energy-efficient data aggregation, (ii) optimal storage space use,\
    \ and (iii) energy-efficient sensing in a \nwireless sensor network. Collaborative\
    \ sensing and Sleep-scheduling strategies were used in suggested data storage\
    \ \nand sensing methods. Secondly, the authors used a Lookup approach to take\
    \ advantage of the collaborative sensing \nthat occurs as a result of the sleep-scheduling\
    \ of SNs in wireless networks. The accuracy of the suggested approach \nhas been\
    \ proven by simulation findings. Asad Raza et al. [17], this paper covered all\
    \ of the risks to encrypted \ntransmission in a wireless network. The purpose\
    \ of this study was to highlight the safety challenges surrounding \nbroadcast\
    \ authentication in sensor networks and to evaluate the suggested solutions in\
    \ terms of several metrics. A. \nAliti et al. [18], In this research, authors\
    \ presented a security architecture for dealing with the most significant \nsecurity\
    \ challenges in wireless sensor networks. The concentration of the study was on\
    \ an optimal CH selection \nmechanism that rotates the CH location between SNs\
    \ with greater energy levels than others. According to simulation \nresults, the\
    \ updated version outperformed the low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy method\
    \ by increasing \nperformance by 60 percent, lifespan by 66 percent, and remaining\
    \ energy by 64 percent. R. J. Bhuiyan, et al. [19], \nThe authors presented a\
    \ simple cluster head selection mechanism in this paper that saves significant\
    \ energy for SNs \nwhile also extending the network's lifetime. The suggested\
    \ methodology considered the one-hop neighbor data, the \ndistance between Cluster\
    \ heads and the BS, neighbor data, and the amount of residual energy. They compared\
    \ the \nproposed technique to LEACH-C and ECHS in a simulation. They noticed significant\
    \ improvements in energy \nusage in each round, Last Node Death (END), First Node\
    \ Dai (1ND), and total packets sent to Base station as \nthroughput. The fuzzy\
    \ inference approach was used in this paper to identify the suitable cluster head.\
    \ The residual \nenergy of the SN, node degree, and distance to the Base station\
    \ were fuzzy input variables, while 'size' and \n'competition radius' are fuzzy\
    \ output variables. A. Lipare et al. [20], The suggested method surpassed the\
    \ EAUCF \nand LEACH algorithms in terms of network stability, active sensor nodes\
    \ per round, and energy consumption. \nRouting algorithms are essential in cloud\
    \ computing for spending power efficiently and maintaining other service \nquality.\
    \ Routing algorithms face a variety of architectural difficulties. To address\
    \ these problems, several researchers \nhave devised a variety of solutions, some\
    \ of which are listed below: \nHao Li et al. [21], For the loss of LEACH-M packets,\
    \ this study presented the Leach-MON cluster method focused \non mobile sensor\
    \ networks, that introduced the concept of on-demand routing to the mobile WSNs.\
    \ The packet loss \nwas relatively lower than LEACH-M when the performance and\
    \ energy usage of the SNs were fully considered \nduring simulation using the\
    \ NS3 Network simulator. V. K. Kumar et al. [22], This article proposed a chain-based\
    \ \nrouting system for the PEGASIS \"Power-Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information\
    \ System\". To increase efficiency, \na new PEGASIS method was presented, which\
    \ is more energy-efficient and offers a longer lifespan than the original \nPEGASIS\
    \ method. X. Wang et al. [23], the paper considered the energy barriers of clustered\
    \ sensor networks and \nsuggested an enhanced routing algorithm for these sensor\
    \ networks to obtain an optimal solution for energy usage in \nSNs, reducing the\
    \ impacts of hot spots in some SNs close to the BS and preventing the hot head\
    \ nodes from \nbecoming overloaded for data communication. A Matlab simulation\
    \ tool was used to evaluate the new technique. \nThe simulation findings indicated\
    \ that the revised routing algorithm was highly reliable than the traditional\
    \ EEUC \nand LEACH protocols in reducing the overall energy usage of sensor networks\
    \ with more balanced transmission \nloads and extending the systems' lifespan.\
    \ D. Pal et al. [24], In this paper, a clustering strategy based on fuzzy logic\
    \ \nwas used to improve the network longevity and transmission efficiency of a\
    \ WSN. The CH was selected using fuzzy \nlogic. In the present architecture, the\
    \ first node dead (FND) and the longevity of the network employing fuzzy logic\
    \ \nwere compared to four alternative approaches. In this study, FND and lifespan\
    \ were determined to be superior, \nresulting in a more efficient strategy for\
    \ Sensor networks. C. Xu et al. [25], The authors presented a unique energy- \n\
    efficient region source routing strategy in this paper to optimize the lifespan\
    \ of the sensor networks (referred to as \nER- SR). V. K. Kumar et al. [26], The\
    \ authors presented an HDPORP \"Heterogeneous DSR PEGASIS Optimization \nRouting\
    \ Protocol\" in this work, which combines the best characteristics of both PEGASIS\
    \ and DSR technologies. \nThey utilized Dijkstra's method to discover the lowest\
    \ route between each SN and the CH in the simulation, and then \nthey utilized\
    \ an energy list to update the network with high energy SNs and reject SNs with\
    \ less energy. According \nto the simulation findings, the HDPORP method increased\
    \ the lifespan of the Network by 10percent when compared \nto other methods.After\
    \ reviewing the techniques proposed by various researchers in order to extend\
    \ the lifespan of \nthe wireless network, it is observed that most of the researchers\
    \ worked mostly on two domains; \ni.e. either on routing protocols or clustering\
    \ and CH selection methods. In order to analyze, which technique is \nproviding\
    \ efficient results, an analytical study is conducted for the traditional models\
    \ by analyzing their First node \ndeath (FND), half node death (HND) and last\
    \ node death (LND) values. The performance of the traditional model is \nfirstly\
    \ analyzed for different LEACH variants in terms of their FND, HND and LND and\
    \ is shown in figure 2. \nFigure 2 represents the Comparison graph of different\
    \ traditional models which included LEACH-C, LEACH-MAC, \nECHS, R.j Bhuiyan in\

    \ paper reviewed various techniques that are used by various researchers in order\
    \ to enhance the lifespan of \nwireless networks. From the literature survey,\
    \ it is conducted that most of the experts focused on two domains; one \nis called\
    \ as normal energy efficient protocols which are basically the different variants\
    \ of LEACH protocol and \nsecond is based routing-based protocols which are variants\
    \ of PEGASIS protocols. After analyzing the results, it is \nobserved that the\
    \ results produced by different techniques may vary from one application to another.\
    \ Furthermore, it \nis also analyzed that, if the model is entirely focused on\
    \ the routing-based protocols then PEGASIS variants provide \na better option\
    \ as they can extend the lifespan of network efficiently. However, if the model\
    \ is not based on the \nrouting mechanisms then LEACH variants can also provide\
    \ good results. The main goal of reviewing different \ntechniques is to look into\
    \ the viability and use of high-level-based techniques to make WSN design easier\
    \ and to \nextend its lifespan. \nComparison For Routing Based EEP Protocols \n\

    \ optimization. \n \n1. INTRODUCTION: \n \n \nCurrent spectrum allocation policy,\
    \ known as FSA, is a set policy (fixed spectrum allocation). The \nelectromagnetic\
    \ spectrum is separated into bands that are meant for different types of services\
    \ under this policy. The \nauthorization to utilize the electromagnetic spectrum\
    \ has a set duration and is often provided based on the location \nof the transmitter\
    \ system. Only the concessionaire or licensee to whom the authorization was issued\
    \ has access to the \nelectromagnetic spectrum resources within this region and\
    \ for the period of validity of this authorization, even if the \nresource is\
    \ underutilized over time. At first, the strategy was sufficient to avoid interference\
    \ between the various \nsystems that employed the electromagnetic spectrum, as\
    \ well as to meet the need for information for wireless \ncommunication services.\
    \ \nThe scenario of electromagnetic spectrum use has changed dramatically as a\
    \ result of today's continual \nexpansion of wireless communication technology.\
    \ Despite attempts by business and research to improve the spectral \nefficiency\
    \ of new communication systems, an increase in transmission rate requires an increase\
    \ in the bandwidth \nrequired for transmission. The phenomenon known as spectral\
    \ scarcity is caused by the increased demand for \ntransmission frequencies combined\
    \ with the fixed offer [1].  \nIn addition to limiting the electromagnetic spectrum's\
    \ availability, the policy that was formerly appropriate \nfor the resource utilization\
    \ profile is now ineffective. The spectrum cannot be reused by other systems because\
    \ it is \nreserved and not used at particular periods of the day. \nIn this scenario,\
    \ a new proposal for spectrum allocation, known as DSA (dynamic spectrum allocation),\
    \ develops \n(dynamic spectrum access). This new strategy advises that the resource\
    \ be used opportunistically, i.e., spectrum \naccess would be depending on demand,\
    \ and spectrum bands would no longer be completely protected for certain \ntypes\
    \ of services.  \nCurrently, the 2.4GHz band, an unlicensed usage band shared\
    \ by wireless telephone, 802.11 WLAN, and \nBluetooth devices [2], is an example\
    \ of this form of allocation. The new policy recommends a significant shift in\
    \ the \narchitecture of receiving and transmitting devices, in addition to significantly\
    \ modifying the way spectrum use is \ngoverned. The assurance that there will\
    \ be no interference between the different systems is one of the primary \nbarriers\
    \ to the adoption of a dynamic spectrum access strategy. There will be no interest\
    \ in changing the current \nstrategy if it is not possible to ensure that the\
    \ DSA network does not interfere with legacy FSA systems, as networks \nwith both\
    \ spectrum allocation policies must coexist. \nSpectrum sensing appears as one\
    \ of the key properties of DSA networks in this setting. Transmission \npossibilities,\
    \ also known as spectrum holes, or sections of the electromagnetic spectrum that\
    \ are not in use at any \nparticular time, are found in this step. If spectrum\
    \ sensing is ineffective, radios will be unable to recognize \ntransmission opportunities,\
    \ or, even worse, they will be unable to distinguish when spectrum is in use,\
    \ leading to the \nmisleading impression that spectrum is available when it is\
    \ not. \nFor cognitive radio networks, the development of efficient approaches\
    \ that can be applied in real time and can detect \nsignals with a high probability\
    \ is critical. \n \n \n \n2. LITERATURE SURVEY: \n \nA cognitive radio user is\
    \ a system that monitors and determines whether or not the main user is present.\
    \ \nThe second user must use the free spectrum if the primary user (PU) is not\
    \ accessible [3]. Due to key user \nrecognition, this is not as dependable as\
    \ many dimming and dimming alternatives for the average user [4]. The \nproblem\
    \ is caused by secondary user access to the primary user licensing range as a\
    \ result of this issue. This topic \nwas posed in order to increase detection\
    \ accuracy and address issues with shared spectrum perception. The \nfundamental\
    \ idea behind collaborative spectrum sensor performance is to empower secondary\
    \ users to improve their \nown performance [5] [6]. \nOutside of the voting rule\
    \ N, the cognitive recognition spectrum is specified. Secondary users point out\
    \ \nprimary users N with an external SU at the merging center [7]. Users increase\
    \ their power usage within seconds to \nproclaim the Fusion Center's spectral\
    \ sensitivity and sensitivity (FC). To raised efficiency of energy , storage \n\
    solutions have been suggested [8] [9]. Spectrum allocation can minimize time and\
    \ power usage if the SNR is too \nhigh or the primary user (PU) is too high. If\
    \ this is not the case, the spectrum detection sensitivity will be employed \n\
    again to increase performance. [10] [11] A strategy for reducing power consumption\
    \ is provided, which includes \ntime recording and transmission time. As a result,\
    \ by eliminating interference, PU improves energy efficiency. In \norder to enhance\
    \ energy efficiency, several well-known channels have been proposed for efficient\
    \ input recognition \n[12]. \nEach secondary user knows the channel in some modes,\
    \ yet the same second user FC and other secondary \nusers can transmit the same\
    \ message in others [13]. To increase spectral energy detection performance, [14]\
    \ presents \na dependable high energy threshold circuit. Based on the influence\
    \ of the SU transmit power, the authors proposed \nthe limitation as adaptive\
    \ in [15]. The detection threshold is solely determined by the incoming signal's\
    \ statistical \nfeatures, as outlined by the authors in [16]. The authors get\
    \ the appropriate threshold value in [17] by using the \nLagrange multiplier approach.\
    \ In [15], a two-threshold method is proposed, which differs from the traditional\
    \ one-\nthreshold design and enhances detection performance substantially. In\
    \ [18], it takes longer to detect the spectrum \nbefore getting results, whereas\
    \ in [19], the authors present a method for generating threshold value. The author\
    \ \nspecifies the maximum number of entries in [20]. The SU will switch to detecting\
    \ a different spectrum if the \nquantity of spectrum detection time surpasses\
    \ the upper limit. \nFurthermore, all of the techniques have difficulty obtaining\
    \ spectrum on the cognitive radio network. As a \nresult, to avoid all shortcomings,\
    \ this research presents a single threshold energy measurement technique. \n \n\
    3. PROPOSED METHODOLOGY: \n \n3.1 Introduction: \nCooperative gain refers to the\
    \ improvement in performance that occurs as a result of spatial variety. From\
    \ \nthe standpoint of sensor hardware, the cooperative gain can also be considered\
    \ .Having low signal-to-noise ratio of \nthe received primary signal as a result\
    \ of multipath fading and shadowing, making detection challenging. Because \n\
    receiver sensitivity refers to the receiver's capacity to detect weak signals,\
    \ a strict sensitivity requirement will be \nimposed on the receiver, More crucially,\
    \ when the signal-to-noise ratio of PU signals is below a particular level \n\
    called as an SNR wall, the detection performance cannot be increased by raising\
    \ the sensitivity. Fortunately, \ncooperative sensing can alleviate the sensitivity\
    \ need as well as the technology limitations. \nCooperative sensing consists of\
    \ Local sensing, reporting, and data fusion Other key components of \ncooperative\
    \ sensing, in addition to these phases, are essential. The elements of cooperative\
    \ sensing are what we term \nthese basic but necessary components.: \n \n3.2 Energy\
    \ Detection Technique: \nEnergy detector method is the most widespread form of\
    \ spectrum sensing,  It can also be considered a \ncoarse detection technique,\
    \ as it does not provide detailed information about the signals occupying the\

    \ ∶  \U0001D466(\U0001D45D) = \U0001D467(\U0001D45D) \n\U0001D43B1 ∶  \U0001D466\
    (\U0001D45D) = \U0001D465(\U0001D45D) + \U0001D467(\U0001D45D)  \n \n \n \n \n\
    (1) \nIn hypothesis \U0001D43B0, the signal is not present and the received signal\
    \ \U0001D466(\U0001D45D) is formed only by \U0001D467(\U0001D45D) noise \nsamples.\
    \ In hypothesis \U0001D43B1, the signal of interest \U0001D465(\U0001D45D) is\
    \ present together with the noise. \n \nFigure 1: Energy detector implementation\
    \ diagrams (a) in time and (b) in frequency \n \nThe energy detector can be implemented\
    \ in two main ways, exemplified in Figure 1. In the first form, \nFigure 1(a),\
    \ a filter is used to select the band of interest. The filter must be centered\
    \ on the frequency of interest, fc, \nand preferably, have a bandwidth equal to\
    \ the channel of interest. In the case of spectrum sensing in a wide range of\
    \ \nfrequencies, for a better estimate of the occupation of the selected band,\
    \ it is interesting that the sweep filter has a \nnarrow band. Another possible\
    \ hypothesis is the existence of a narrowband filter bank. After the input filter,\
    \ the \nsignal passes through an analog-digital converter and a quadratic elevation\
    \ device and only then the TED test statistic \nis calculated. \n\U0001D447\U0001D438\

    \ proposes the processing of samples at frequency. \nIn this architecture, there\
    \ is the flexibility to process larger bands and multiple signals simultaneously,\
    \ as the \nselection filter is replaced by the processing of the corresponding\
    \ frequency ranges of the FFT, Fast Fourier \nTransform. Choose a fixed FFT size\
    \ and the number of samples, N, becomes a parameter for improving the \ndetection.\
    \ \nIn both forms of implementation, the \U0001D447\U0001D438\U0001D437 test statistic\
    \ is compared with a threshold \U0001D706\U0001D438\U0001D437 to choose between\
    \ \nthe two hypotheses. As the detection threshold depends on the signal to noise\
    \ ratio of the received signal, the \ntechnique's detection capability is impaired\
    \ in scenarios where the noise is not stationary and varies rapidly. \n In equation\

    \ This paper focuses on \ninvestigation of various design schemes of SOA (Semiconductor\
    \ Optical Amplifiers) based MZI AND, OR, \nXOR, NOT gates exploit the component\
    \ performance on even very low powers and average high bit rate of \n20Gbps, making\
    \ a comparison of obtained results with latest reports. Conclusions are drawn\
    \ on the basis of \ndesign that substituting couplers instead of modulators provide\
    \ better results in terms of Q-factor, logical \noutputs, computational speed\
    \ at the minor power levels. \n \nKeywords: Optical networks, SOA, modulation,\
    \ Cross gain, phase modulation, Wave mixing, \nGates \n \n1 Introduction \n \n\
    In order to achieve the edge of speed of electronic devices, high bandwidth is\
    \ desired. Opto-electronic \nconversion is one of the complex processes in the\
    \ digital gates [1]. For jam-full benefit of impending of optical \nfiber in the\
    \ development of contemporary networks, all-optical gates are obligatory modules\
    \ without any \ndisadvantage of conversions full of losses which occur in electric\
    \ domain. SOA used for the designing of gates \nrelated to optics. This is due\
    \ to because SOA provides very high change in the refractive index which is required\
    \ \nfor the desired logic outputs along with high gain. With the usage of SOA,\
    \ all-optical gates can be operated at \nwider bandwidth and undemanding photonic\
    \ amalgamation is possible [2].  \n       For designing of optical gates, a non-linear\
    \ medium is required as it enables the modulation of the signal to \nget the desired\
    \ output. The nonlinear loop mirror and fibers, acoustic wave filters, waveguide,\
    \ thyristors, or \nsemiconductor optical fiber generates the nonlinearity. The\
    \ gain recovery time of SOA induces limitations to \nthis approach having prodigious\
    \ speed but it can be improved by using band pass filters after SOAs. Detuning\
    \ of \nthese filters reduces the distortions occurring due to pattern effects.\
    \ [3]. In literature, number of methods have \nbeen used to realize different\
    \ logic and mathematical operations using nonlinear processes such as cross gain\
    \ \nand  phase modulation and four wave mixing in SOA using Mach-Zehnder interferometer\
    \ configuration [4].  \n      The SOAs have various applications apart from generating\
    \ logic operations like amplification using \nstimulated emission and wavelength\
    \ conversions. Using SOA in Interferometry configuration has shown better \nresults\
    \ till now but sometimes the delay produced in one of the arms is of longer duration\
    \ that the correct logic is \nnot received at the instance of time. Reportedly\
    \ configuration used modulators but here i.e. in the current setup \ncouplers\
    \ are used instead of them. \n \n2 \nSystem Setup  \nNon linearity effect with\
    \ or without SOA is used in every optical door. Various methods without SOA uses\
    \ \nparameters like length, waveguide with attenuator and circulators structures,\

    \ approach are the most common and vital technique used in current wireless communication,\
    \ \nand it is the only technique that can match the demands of modern fifth generation\
    \ wireless communication. By using the MIMO \napproach, the throughput of the\
    \ microstrip patch antenna may be increased, resulting in higher data rates in\
    \ transmission. It contains \nnumerous inputs and outputs, as the name implies,\
    \ and its most important job is to create extremely high throughput even in high\
    \ \nsignal traffic zones. To achieve the high throughput, the signal traffic patch\
    \ is ignored and the data is transmitted in a bypassed way. \nThe most essential\
    \ technology used in the proposed UWB-DGS-MSPA is slotted ground, which is also\
    \ known as \"Defected Ground \nStructure\" in technical terms (DGS). Slotted ground\
    \ is used to increase antenna performance by intentionally inserting slots in\
    \ the \nground plane to improve return loss, bandwidth, and radiation properties\
    \ of the microstrip antenna. \n \nKeywords— Multi Input Multi Output, Random Capacitive\

    Traditionally, wireless setups have been designed for a specific purpose. Antennas\
    \ in these configurations take into account static \nrestrictions such as gain,\
    \ frequency of repetition mob, radiation configuration, divergence, and so on.\
    \ Reconfigurable antennas \nhave recently attracted a lot of interest for a variety\
    \ of applications, including cellular wireless communication, finding systems,\
    \ \ndigital television message, hovering machines, and robots in flying automobile\
    \ locater and well-designed projectile protection \n[1]. \n1.1 Reconfigurable\
    \ Antenna \n     If the radio antenna change produces the best results, the receiving\
    \ antenna should be changed or rebuilt to observe the new \nresults. Using precisely\
    \ portable parts diodes, tunable constituents, or vibrant resources, reconfigurable\
    \ wireless antenna vary \ntheir presenting features by modifying the current stream\
    \ on a receiving antenna. A solitary receiving antenna or a cluster of \nreconfigurable\
    \ radio antennas can be used [2]. Reconfigurable reception antennas are useful\
    \ in a variety of applications (e.g., 3G, \nBluetooth, WLAN, WiMAX) to enable\
    \ a variety of principles (e.g., 3G, Bluetooth, WLAN, WiMAX) overcome solid impedance\
    \ \nsignals and adapt to changing environmental conditions. However, in radar\
    \ applications, multifunctional activity frequently \nnecessitates reconfigurability\
    \ at the receiving antenna level. \n 1.2 Design Ideas for Reconfigurable Antennas\
    \ \n The following are the three basic design techniques for achieving antenna\
    \ frequency suppleness: \n(1) Microelectronic controls, automatic actuators, and\
    \ tunable tools for reconfigurability in footings of circuit features, emission\
    \ \nstuffs are added into antennas. \n(2) Tunable filters and ultra wide band\
    \ (UWB) or multiband antennas \n(3) Multiband/reconfigurable systems in which\
    \ the same aperture is employed for several operative modes [1].  \nRF engineers\
    \ must consider three perplexing requirements while designing reconfigurable antennas.\
    \ \n1) Which reconfigurable properties (such as occurrence, emission configuration,\
    \ or polarity) must be altered? \n2) In what way the antenna's many searing essentials\
    \ rearranged to attain the compulsory stuff? \n3) What type of design decreases\
    \ the antenna radiation/impedance individualities' unwanted properties? \nLow-Profile\
    \ MIMO Antenna For 5G Midbands \n \nMIMO is essentially a radio antenna technique\
    \ since it employs multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver to provide\
    \ a \nnumber of signal routes to transfer data, selecting different paths for\
    \ each antenna to allow for numerous signal paths to be used. \nThese additional\
    \ routes can be leveraged to their advantage by employing MIMO. \n \n2. \nRELATED\
    \ WORK \nSince the recommendations use three risk groups to sort out differences\
    \ in screening routines, it may be wondering how to fit \nChristos G. Christodoulou,\
    \ et al. [1] in today's telecom frameworks, reconfigurable reception antennas\
    \ with the ability to send \nseveral examples at varied frequencies and polarizations\
    \ are critical. Within a bound volume, the requirements for increased utility\
    \ \n(e.g., bearing discovering, pillar controlling, radar, control, and order)\
    \ impose a greater emphasis on current communication and \nreceiving frameworks.\
    \ This problem can be solved by using reconfigurable receiving antennas. The various\
    \ reconfigurable pieces \nthat can be used in a radio antenna to modify its design\
    \ and capacity are discussed in this study. These methods of reconfiguration \n\
    are based on a combination of radio-frequency miniature electromechanical frameworks\
    \ (RF-MEMS), PIN diodes, varactors, and \nphotoconductive components, or on a\
    \ physical change of the receiving antenna radiating structure, or on the use\
    \ of sharp materials \nsuch as ferrites and fluid gems. Different actuation instruments\
    \ are offered and analyzed that can be used in each unusual \nreconfigurable execution\
    \ to get optimum execution. There are a few examples of reconfigurable reception\
    \ antennas for both \nterrestrial and space applications, such as cognitive radio,\
    \ multiple information various yield (MIMO) frameworks, and satellite \ncorrespondence.\
    \ N. Ramli et al. [2] the recurrent reconfigurable receiving antenna can be used\
    \ in both LTE (2.6 GHz) and WiMAX \n(3.5 GHz) applications. This radio antenna\
    \ is known as a Frequency Reconfigurable Stacked Patch Micro-strip Antenna because\
    \ it \nis designed with a combination of an opening coupled as the handling method\
    \ and stacked fix innovation (FRSPMA). It consists of \nthree substrate layers,\
    \ each of which is planned using RT-Rogers 5880 with a thickness of 0.787 mm.\
    \ To improve the addition \nexhibitions and reduce the deceptive impacts from\
    \ the taking care of line, a 3 mm thick air hole is placed between the ground\
    \ and \nthe base fix substrate. A.Anusuya et al. [3] Due to rapid advancements\
    \ in remote correspondence technology, the use of small \nreceiving antennas has\
    \ exploded. The size of the receiving wire, as well as its cost, execution, and\
    \ ease of installation, has all been \ntaken into account when planning the radio\
    \ wire. A small strip receiving antenna is presented to suit all of the requirements.\
    \ \nMiniature strip radio wires are now used in a variety of applications, including\
    \ aero planes, spacecraft, satellites, and rockets. In this \nwork, we discuss\
    \ miniature strip reception wire, different types of miniature strip radio wire,\
    \ different substrates used in radio \nantenna planning, and our writing assessment.\
    \ Muhammad Abid, et al. [4] the radio recurrence range has gotten scarce due to\
    \ \nrapid development and the detonating prevalence of distant innovations. Another\
    \ innovation that uses dynamic range access tactics \nto improve range usage and\
    \ proficiency is intellectual radio. Another reception antenna plan for psychological\
    \ radio remote \ncorrespondence frameworks is presented in this research. The\
    \ radio antenna is etched on FR4 substrate and can operate in the \n3.0GHz to\
    \ 14GHz spectrum with a standard of S11-10dB, allowing for a 129 percent useable\
    \ division data transmission range. A \nhalf circular radiator with two rectangular\
    \ apertures and a ground plane on the opposite side of the substrate make up the\
    \ receiving \nwire. The suggested receiving wire includes psychological radio\
    \ detecting capabilities, which identifies the underutilized range in \nits operating\
    \ band of 3.0GHz to 14GHz. The Omni directional radiation design of Plan radio\
    \ wire is suitable for channel detection. \nAsmita M. Sonwalkar et al. [5] Multi-band\
    \ Antenna with Reconfigurable Antenna is an option. To achieve multi-band and\
    \ \nwideband radio antenna activity, many approaches are applied. Reconfigure\
    \ Antenna allows you to quickly switch between multiple \nreceiving antenna boundaries.\
    \ In areas such as letters, it has attracted a lot of attention. The working frequency,\
    \ polarizations, and \nradiation design of a radio antenna can all be adjusted\
    \ using reconfigurable technologies. Reconfigurable radio antennas could make\
    \ \nversatile correspondence more useful. The ability to reconfigure radio antennas\
    \ allows us to redistribute range in multi-band \ncommunication frameworks, reducing\
    \ the quantity and size of receiving antennas. The purpose of reconfigure radio\
    \ antennas is to \nassist multiband and wideband distant applications in a variety\
    \ of recurrence groups. This paper discusses different types of \nreconfigurable\
    \ radio antennas and how they work, such as Frequency Reconfigurable Antennas,\
    \ Radiation Pattern Reconfigurable \nAntennas, Polarization Reconfigurable Antennas,\
    \ and Radiation and Frequency Reconfigurable Antennas. Harender Pal Singh et \n\
    al. [6] the exhibition of Microstrip fix radio antenna with and without the Meta\
    \ material design was discussed and examined. The \nreturn loss of a standard\
    \ fix radio antenna designed for complete recurrence at 2.4 GHz was compared to\
    \ the return loss of a similar \nfix receiving antenna with a further layered\
    \ Meta material design. Veerendra Singh Jadaun et al. [7] the receiving antenna's\
    \ \nMicrostrip line has been exhibited, planned, and replicated. Also, the planning\
    \ was done in IE3D programming, which is an EM \nsolver that deviates from the\
    \ Method of Moments guideline. Ranjan Mishra et al. [8] the plan of a rectangular\
    \ and square-shaped \nMicrostrip radio antenna is examined. The suggested Microstrip\
    \ radio antenna has a wide transfer frequency of 500 MHz and a low \n \nyield\
    \ loss of - 24 dbs. Sathishkumar N et al. [9] Plan a Microstrip radio antenna\
    \ with a good radiation design that reduces main \ncomplexity and, as a result,\
    \ the receiving antenna size. The presentation boundaries of the radio antennas,\
    \ such as S-boundary, Gain, \nVSWR, and directivity, are obtained and broken down\
    \ using ANSYS HFSS programming. Mandar P. Joshi et al. [10] For the \nIndian Regional\
    \ Navigation Satellite System, a circularly polarized Microstrip antenna is proposed.\
    \ To recognize circular \npolarisation, an oval cross designed turn traitor ground\
    \ structure is mounted on the ground plane. W. Hunag et al.  [11] a \npolarizations\
    \ that is circular In the frequency range of 4.35 GHz to 4.84 GHz, a Microstrip\
    \ antenna with a condensed square patch \nis in use. \n3. \nPROPOSED WORK AND\
    \ IMPEMENTATION \nIn this two-port network, the two feeding lines are perpendicular\
    \ to each other with single radiating resonance and also the \nintroduction of\
    \ slot on the ground is used to achieve better isolation and mutual element coupling\
    \ between two-ports. Hence, the \nproposed antenna acts like a MIMO antenna. It's\
    \ also utilized to attenuate higher mode harmonics and for element mutual coupling.\
    \ \nMoreover, the integration of slots on ground will optimized the performance\
    \ to 27% more than the reported antenna. \nThe DGS influences the surface current\
    \ density, which might result in better or worse results. The antenna's design\
    \ introduces \nresistance into the circuit, restricting its size but enhancing\
    \ its bandwidth. This study discusses 5G mid-band applications by \nresonating\
    \ the suggested structure at Sub-6 GHz, Sub-7 GHz/Vo5G, Wifi6, and 5GV2x-c. It\
    \ is quite difficult to cover as many bands \nin a single miniaturised patch antenna\
    \ without optimization. This intended result is obtained by the use of a combination\
    \ of two \noptimization strategies (i.e., slotting techniques techniques) \nIn\
    \ the early phases of fifth generation wireless communications, mmwaves over 24\
    \ GHz are the most dominant frequency band. \nThe frequency range between 1 GHz\
    \ and 7 GHz is now the most significant frequency band for 5G wireless communications,\
    \ and \nthis frequency band is termed the 5G mid-band applications. Because of\
    \ their wide penetration range and long distance coverage, \n5G midband frequencies\
    \ may easily reach high data rates and throughput values in wireless data transmission.\
    \ So, the suggested \nantenna's miniaturization is done by dividing the wavelength\
    \ (lambda) by four, which achieves miniaturization in the communication \nprocess\
    \ alone. That is why we picked a small miniaturized method in this case. Change\
    \ the half wavelength to a quarter wavelengths \nand proceed as before, according\
    \ to the transmission line formula. A circular slot is proposed in the radius\
    \ of the directed wavelength \nquarter value. The circular slots that have been\
    \ introduced are arranged in a sequence. The identical two port feeds are each\
    \ angled \nat 90 degrees to process equivalent distribution process principles.\

    \ Antenna \n \nFigure 4.1 depicts the predicted return loss vs. frequency plot\
    \ of the 5G midband antenna. Because the proposed antenna has two \nidentical\
    \ ports, we must validate the matrix results analysis. S11, S12, S22, and S21\
    \ are four sets of findings for the proposed \nantenna. \nThe most important parameters\
    \ to consider when calculating an antenna's efficiency are gain and directivity.\
    \ Figures 4.2 and 4.3 \ndepict the proposed antenna gain and directivity. \n \n\

    \ shows that the maximum overall gain of the RCGS-MIMO antenna geometry measured\
    \ is \n4.1 dB with whole 4G and 5G midband applications and directivity is 5.7\
    \ dB. \nThe suggested RCGS-MIMO's efficiency may be calculated using equation\

    \ size 2 port RCGS-MIMO antenna has a high gain profile at below 7GHz with a pinnacle\
    \ gain of 4.1dB. For two-\nport implementations, the execution of the suggested\
    \ antenna is further studied by finding the Return Loss, Gain and Directivity.\
    \ \nThe simulated results indicate that the suggested two-port antenna is a promising\
    \ candidate for the entire 5G Mid-band applications. \nThe quality of service\
    \ of communications can be increased by increasing the number of elements for\
    \ the proposed two-port antenna \nsystem; it is the easily extendable system.\

    \ comfort, and other factors. Smart \ndevices are capable of sensing their surroundings\

    \ digitalization, data and computer skills are now widely \navailable and those\
    \ technologies connects the working mother and child. This study \nsuggested super-smart\

    \ increases now a days. As a result, \nmany female professionals are often required\
    \ to work away from home. As a result, these \nmothers are now unable to care\
    \ for a newborn. Mother is constantly concerned about the \ninfant's well-being.India\
    \ and other industrialising countries, parents must work while also \nproviding\
    \ for their children, putting an additional burden on both parents. These families\
    \ \nwill benefit greatly from the development of a system that allows parents\
    \ to keep track of \n \n2 \ntheir children when they are ill or simply going about\
    \ their everyday lives, as they will be \nable to focus more on their work difficulties\
    \ and less on the baby. All the unusual activity \ntracked instantly, an alert\
    \ about the situation will also be sent out, and it to be addressed \nquickly.\
    \ A baby frequently cries when they are thirsty, ill, awakened from nap, or want\
    \ their \ndiaper changed.  \nIn our proposed prototype, we provide a cradle with\
    \ intelligence to monitor the \naforementioned acts, identify the cause, and alert\
    \ the parents. The Internet of Things (IoT) \nis a network of interconnected things\
    \ that can collect and communicate data over a wireless \nnetwork without human\
    \ interference. Because of this technology, devices can now \ncommunicate sensor\
    \ data over the Internet without requiring human intervention. Using this \nproposed\
    \ technology, parents would be informed of the infant's condition within the cradle,\
    \ \nallowing them to relax and worry less about the child's welfare while they\
    \ are away. Another \nadvantage is the ability of sensors to detect suspicious\
    \ behavior and send alert signals in \nsuch cases. \nA smart cradle based on Arduino\
    \ UNO and GSM was developed for baby \nmonitoring [1]. An Internet of Things (IoT)-based\
    \ smart programmed monitoring of infants \nbased on parameters such as temperature,\
    \ pulse rate, and gas molecules, as well as recording \nthe baby's movement and\
    \ position [2]. A video output-based baby intensive care system \nbased on a Raspberry\
    \ Pi B+ module and a pi camera has been proposed [3]. Using an \nArduino UNO,\
    \ a microcontroller, and a GSM module, an automated cradle system will send \n\
    an alarm message to the parent's mobile phone [4]. A smart infant cradle that\
    \ allows working \nmothers to keep an eye on their children was proposed [5].\
    \ A Smart Baby Cradle prototype, \nan IoT-based Cradle Management System, was\
    \ created in 2018. The cradle will be able to \ncommunicate with a smartphone\
    \ using this system [6]. An IoT-based Smart Cradle System \nBaby Monitoring Android\
    \ App with video monitoring includes an automated rotating toy \nfor the infant's\
    \ entertainment, which minimizes the possibility of a baby crying [7]. \nThe majority\
    \ of existing baby monitoring systems use a swinging cradle with a \nsound sensor\
    \ to detect crying.To help with ventilation, a small fan is attached to the cradle.\
    \ \nThe fan turn on automatically when the temperature reached 28 °C or higher.\
    \ To provide \nreal-time video monitoring, an Wi-Fi camera used on the cradle.\
    \ The primary goal of the \nsystem is to drown out distracting noises for the\
    \ baby by playing soothing music. The \narchitecture of the existing methods is\
    \ illustrated in Fig.1. The existing monitoring system \ndoes not utilize any\
    \ optimization algorithms. Secondly the data storage is not utilizes the \ncloud\
    \ platform.  \n \n2. METHODOLOGY \nOur idea is to create a super-intelligent cradle\
    \ system that sends an alarm message to the \nparent. When the parents are not\
    \ present, the cradle is monitored live via webcam using \nAlfred Camera software,\
    \ and the PIR sensor detects motion and sends an alarm to the parents \n \n3 \n\
    if there is too much motion. The Humidity Sensor detects whether the newborn has\
    \ peed \nand alerts the parents.  \n \nFig. 1. Architecture of Node MCE based\
    \ baby monitoring system \n \nFig.2 Architecture of the proposed system \n To\
    \ enable faster operation, we use the Arduino UNO R3. Twilio will keep the user\
    \ \ninformed about all operations. Twilio is a platform that is used thousands\
    \ of businesses and \nmillion developers all over the world to create unique,\
    \ personalized experiences for their \ncustomers. Everything displayed is saved\
    \ in the ThingSpeak server's webpage and \napplication, which functions as a cloud\
    \ service. ThingSpeak is open-source software that \nhelps users to connect with\
    \ internet-enabled devices. ThingSpeak was originally launched \nin 2010 by ioBridge\
    \ as a service to support IoT applications. The architecture of the proposed \n\
    system is illustrated in Fig. 2. The major advantage of the projected system is\
    \ that the Twilio \nis notified of any activity that occurs in the cradle. secondly\
    \ it requires no additional \nhardware or software knowledge, nor does it require\
    \ any human input to rock the \ncradle.Operation is made possible by RIS because\
    \ it minimizes the antenna's contact with \nits substrate [6]. \n \n4 \n3. OUTPUT\
    \ AND DISCUSSION \nIn our proposed system, the PIR motion sensor alerts the parents\
    \ if there is too much \nmovement detected. The humidity sensor determines whether\
    \ the baby has urinated or not. \nIf it detects any type of dampness, it will\
    \ notify the parents. The sound sensor detects \nwhether the infant is crying\
    \ or making other noises, and the temperature sensor determines \nthe child's\
    \ body temperature. If any of the above-mentioned sensors detects an abnormality,\
    \ \nan alarm is sent to the parents or other people responsible for the baby.\
    \ Twilio will keep the \nuser up to date on all actions. Fig. 3 depicts a sample\
    \ notification message on a mobile \nscreen. Fig. 4 depicts the live monitoring\
    \ of a baby via mobile using an Alfred camera. \n  \n \nFig.3. Sample message\

    \ is displayed, and as of July 6th, there were approximately 105 messages, with\
    \ 99 \npercent of them having the status \"ok.\" The 1 percent unsuccessful status\

    \ expected to bring about significant changes in the near future. We \nmitigated\
    \ the risks of the Smart Baby Monitoring Cradle by connecting it to IoT devices.\
    \ \nIoT and ThingSpeak can be used together until scalability issues are resolved.\
    \ Data from \nmultiple devices in an IoT network is stored in a centralized database,\
    \ making it vulnerable \nto security breaches. The proposed architecture creates\
    \ a Wi-Fi network to allow \nThingSpeak to spread to all end users while also\
    \ ensuring communication security. We \npresent an architecture that uses the\
    \ Arduino UNO Board to securely interact with \nThingSpeak and Twilio. Clinical\
    \ studies have shown that this Smart Cradle System is the \nleast harmful to newborns.\
    \ \nDeep Learning technology can be used to detect pests in real-time while monitoring\
    \ the \nchild's cradle. In the future, machine learning and deep learning algorithms\
    \ may be used \nto assess the baby's comfort based on facial expressions and crying\
    \ patterns. \nREFERENCES \n[1] A.Kumaravel, Ramesh S, Ramya,  M.Ranjani, “Smart\

    \ dimensional heat equations, Numerical \nexamples. \nINTRODUCTION \nThree- dimensional\
    \ partial differential equation has several applications in different branches\
    \ of \nsciences and engineering. Numerous numerical techniques have been developed\
    \ for solving such \nequations like wavelets method, Adomian decomposition method,\
    \ Homotopy perturbation \nmethod, Finite difference method and many more. In this\
    \ research, a classical technique has been \npresented for solving three- dimensional\
    \ heat equation. In literature, such technique has proven be \nan efficient technique\
    \ for solving various mathematical models. In [1], basic concept of homotopy \n\
    analysis method has been discussed. To find the solutions of nonlinear problems,\
    \ homotopy \nanalysis method has been presented in [2]. A comparison study of\
    \ homotopy analysis method and \nhomotopy perturbation method has been explained\
    \ in [3]. For the solutions of generalized second \ngrade fluid, homotopy based\
    \ technique has been discussed in [4]. Homotopy analysis method has \nbeen presented\
    \ in [5] for the solutions of boundary layer flow towards stretching sheet. In\
    \ [6], \nquadratic Riccati differential equation has been solved with the aid\
    \ of homotopy analysis method. \nFor the solutions of nonlinear equations produced\
    \ during heat transfer, homotopy analysis method \nhas been discussed in [7].\
    \ In [8], homotopy analysis method has been presented to find the \nsolutions\
    \ of generalized Hirota- Satsuma coupled with KdV equation. Analytical solutions\
    \ of \nLaplace equation with two types of boundary conditions such as Dirichlet\
    \ and Neumann boundary \nconditions have been presented in [9].  Analytical solutions\
    \ of BBMB equations have been \ndiscussed with the aid of homotopy analysis method\
    \ in [10]. Exact solutions of Emden-Fowler \ntype equations have been discussed\
    \ in [11] by using homotopy analysis method.  In [12], homotopy \nanalysis method\
    \ has been presented to find the solutions of Cauchy reaction-diffusion problems\
    \ \narising in various applications of sciences and engineering.  \nIn this study,\
    \ we have discussed the classical technique, known as Homotopy analysis method\
    \ \n(HAM), which has numerous applications in both science and engineering, for\
    \ the analytical \nsolutions of three-dimensional heat equations. \nThe most general\

    \ without a sensor network. Everywhere uses sensor networks to \ngather data for\

    \ strategies \nin this study, and the effectiveness of the ELEACH protocol will\
    \ be demonstrated by comparison with LEACH. \nThe procedures' energy efficiency\

    \ Adaptive Clustering \nHierarchy (LEACH) \nI. INTRODUCTION \nIn a wireless sensor\
    \ network, each node is put in a distinct location. Some nodes are far from human\
    \ access, \nmaking it difficult to change the node's battery on a regular basis.\
    \ This issue is fixed by energy-efficient routing \ntechniques, which also lengthen\
    \ network lifetime. The emphasis on algorithms, protocols, and physical circuitry\
    \ \nof sensor nodes can increase the lifetime of the sensor nodes. The three types\
    \ of most popular routing algorithms \ninclude cluster-based algorithms, hop-to-hop\
    \ transmission techniques, and direct transmission algorithms. Each \ntime a network's\
    \ sensor nodes access and process information, battery power is used. \nAd-hoc\
    \ networks are highly developed networks that allow for the installation of nodes\
    \ as needed. More \nadvancements were made with the multi-hop network's introduction.\
    \ The development age was the era of \nmachine-to-machine communication. The three\
    \ primary functions of all networks are sensing, computation, and \ndata transcription.\
    \ These activities drain the nodes' batteries. WSN needs an energy source to carry\
    \ out all of \nthese tasks. All sensor node modules come with their batteries\
    \ already fitted. \nEach sensor node in these wireless sensors' ad-hoc networks\
    \ takes part in routing by sending data to other sensor \nnodes via the closest\
    \ neighboring communication. Until the gateway is reached, without using a pre-defined\
    \ \ninfrastructure These gateways may be connected to other gateways through a\
    \ bridge, either to expand data \ntransmission to a region where sensor nodes\
    \ cannot easily reach it or to integrate networks like the Internet. \nII. RELATED-WORK\
    \ \n     Assembling of remote sensor hubs having adequate calculation and communicating/getting\
    \ abilities are \naccessible at this point. Subsequently many hubs can be sent\
    \ in an organization for any expected application. \nThese sensor hubs have a\
    \ restricted power which should be used in extremely exact way to expand hub's\
    \ life. \nPresumably effective circuit is important for productive utilization\
    \ of energy, nonetheless, directing convention \nrunning on the organization assumes\
    \ an imperative part in transmission capacity utilization, security and energy\
    \ \nprotections too (taking into account WSN's). To check with these requirements,\
    \ at first direct transmission \napproach [1] was talked about . In direct transmission,\
    \ a hub sense information from its current circumstance and \nsends it directly\
    \ to base station. Purpose for early expiry of closer hubs is directing of all\
    \ information traffic to \nbase station. Also, sending majority of detected information\
    \ from every hub utilize a lot of energy. To conquer \nthis issue, idea of Coordinated\
    \ Dispersion was presented that examine information handling and spread [2]. \n\
    Estrin et. al [3] worked on a hierarchical clustering mechanism dealing with asymmetric\
    \ communication for \npower saving in sensor nodes. M. Tahiret.al [21] [7, 8]\
    \ introduces connect quality measurement to isolate an \norganization into three\
    \ coherent bits bringing about lower directing above. Creators of [9, 10] states\
    \ that hubs \nhaving high starting energy will be chosen as bunch heads (if there\
    \ should be an occurrence of heterogeneous \nsensor organizations). While concurring\
    \ [11, 12, 13] any hub that exist in organization can be chosen as a group \n\
    head. PEGASIS [15] are noticeable directing procedures for remote sensor organizations.\
    \ Principal method of \nchoosing a group head was given by Filter and that is\
    \ additionally improved by SEP and DEEC. Q-LEACH [16] \nstreamline network life\
    \ season of homogenous remote sensor organization. [18] gives a de-followed examination\
    \ \non various variations of Filter as A-LEACH, S-LEACH and M-Filter regarding\
    \ energy effectiveness and \napplications. Creators of [17] upgrades SEP with\
    \ regards to heterogeneity. They proposed model that gives three \nlevel heterogeneity.\
    \ Though [19] gives another convention that works better compared to SEP as far\
    \ as \norganization security and life time having two level heterogeneity. T.N.\
    \ Qureshiet. Al [20] changed DEEC \nconvention as far as organization soundness,\
    \ throughput as well as organization life time. \n \nIII. PROPOSED WORK \nWireless\
    \ sensor network has gained popularity among the research community due to its\
    \ various features. It is \ndeployed in a wide range of applications such as industry,\
    \ medical domain, agriculture, etc. In [1], the author \nhad deployed a wireless\
    \ sensor network to enhance the fertility of the soil i.e. a WSN based irrigation\
    \ system was \ndeveloped. The author performs the irrigation related decision\
    \ by deploying various sensors in the field. Along \nwith this, the cluster head\
    \ selection scheme that was utilized evaluates the decision on the basis of the\
    \ energy of the \nnodes. It means that the energy was the only factor that was\
    \ considered for measuring the eligibility of a node \nfor becoming a CH. Thus,\
    \ on the basis of these observations, it is concluded that the traditional work\
    \ lacks at \nvarious points as follows: \n \nThe cluster head selection criteria\
    \ were not as efficient as only the energy of the nodes is considered for \nmeasuring\
    \ the eligibility of the nodes. \n \nThe sensed data was stored on the sink node\
    \ thus to operate the system by sitting far away was not \npossible enough. \n\
    In the current framework, a novel methodology is developed, with WSN serving as\
    \ the main innovation (Remote \nSensor Organization). The CH (Cluster Head) determination\
    \ conspire is additionally updated in the proposed work by \nincreasing the number\
    \ of boundaries. The factors taken into account include the hubs' energies, their\
    \ separation from \none another, and their distances from sink hubs. The energy\
    \ of the hubs is given a lot of weight, and this is done to \nincrease the organization's\
    \ precision and longevity. \n \n                                             \
    \      Figure 1: Proposed Frameworks \n \nStep 1. The First step is to initialize\
    \ the network by defining the various parameters such as the area of the \nnetwork,\
    \ initial energy of the nodes deployed in the network. on the basis of the defined\
    \ parameters, \nthe network is deployed. \nStep 2. In this step, the distance\
    \ from the candidate node to its adjacent nodes and from the candidate node to\
    \ \nthe sink node is evaluated. \nStep 3. On the basis of the evaluated weight\
    \ values, select the cluster head. \nStep 4. While initialization of the network,\
    \ simultaneously perform data collection from the sensors. \nStep 5. After collecting\
    \ the data, the collected data is transmitted to the server from sensors for further\
    \ processing. \nOn the server side, the received data is stored and maintained\
    \ properly for future use. Here, the remote \naccess to the data is provided to\
    \ the user in order to take the decisions regarding the irrigation of the \ncrops\
    \ in the field. \nStep 6. On the basis of the collected data from the sensors,\
    \ the communication takes place among deployed \nsensors and base station. \n\
    Step 7. The Last step in this process is to perform the evaluation of the proposed\
    \ work and network in terms of \nthe lifetime of the network. \n \nIV.    RESULTS\
    \ AND EXPERIMENTS \nMATLAB is a modelling environment with an undisputedly clear,\
    \ powerfully written language that supports \npractical, object-centered, and\
    \ event-coordinated models. It is crucial for computations involving several \n\
    numbers, explicit calculations involving network applications, and simple polynomial\
    \ math. Information \nperception has benefited greatly from MATLAB's short and\
    \ expressive punctuation, as well as the many \npredefined tools that create a\
    \ special environment ideal for rapid prototyping with little overhead. Be that\
    \ as it \nmay, MATLAB isn't simply a prearranging language for fast and messy\
    \ calculations. Most recent renditions \nhave inspected a power increment for\
    \ the help of huge scope, profoundly organized code to match the dialects \nlike\
    \ C++, Java and numerous others. \nV. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS \n \nThe comparison\
    \ investigation of LEACH and Extended LEACH is displayed in diagram. The examination\
    \ is \nfinished for network lifetime. The graph makes sense of that the organization\
    \ with high energy have more lifetime in \ncontrast with the network with lower\
    \ energy. As seen from the graph, when the underlying energy is set to 0.2 joule\
    \ \nthen the organization lifetime of LEACH is close to by 200 rounds though for\
    \ proposed work it ranges to the 1100 \nadjusts around. At the point when the\
    \ energy level is set to the most noteworthy for example 0.9 then the network\
    \ \nlifetime of the proposed component is higher for example it works till 4500\
    \ rounds though the LEACH exhaust after \n1500 rounds. The noticed raw numbers\
    \ are adjusted in table 1.1 \n \nTable 1.1 Proposed network lifetime concerning\

    \ \n \nFigure 2. Comparison analysis of network  lifetime in   terms of first\
    \ node dead \n \nAdditionally, the diagram in figure 2 makes the analysis of network\
    \ lifetime with relation to the network's final dead \nnodes clear. The diagram\
    \ makes it clear that the last node dead in the Extended LEACH approach is located\
    \ at 2000 \nrounds with a slower energy flow at the hubs, for instance 0.2. The\
    \ last hub to die is around 8200 adjustments away at \nthe moment where energy\
    \ levels increase to 0.5. The final dead hub is located near the end of 15000\

    \ \nAs we probably are aware WSN (wireless sensor network) plays a basic part\
    \ in different spaces where the getting of \ninformation from general conditions\
    \ is the significant errand. The simulation of the proposed work is finished based\
    \ \non the different measure of beginning energy of the sensors concerning the\
    \ primary hub dead and last hub dead. The \nresults imply that the suggested framework\
    \ is very easy to access because there is no need for a specific range, it \n\
    generates extraordinarily helpful yields, and it causes a reduction in water consumption.\
    \ The suggested work has \nbeen thoroughly examined using the conventional LEACH\
    \ protocol, and it has been determined that it is more \neffective than conventional\
    \ protocols in terms of network lifetime. \nFuture Scope \nWhile the performance\
    \ of the proposed work is very subjective yet at the same time changes are conceivable\
    \ in not so \ndistant future. These strategies can characterize the constant worth\
    \ in the climate. The more examination should be \npossible to diminish the information\
    \ blockage and energy utilization in the network. Alongside this improving the\
    \ \nframework's reliability is likewise system reliability. \n     References\

    \ and disturbing, what if that \ndisturbance could be used in a manner that generates\
    \ resources for us and our future \nneeds, the time is fast and in near future,\
    \ there would be a need for various \nrenewable energy resources as the current\
    \ ones are being used too much. \nThe data shows that currently, we use 90% of\
    \ electricity in our daily lives, the usage \nis mainly inour appliances and our\
    \ types of equipment for recharging their batteries, \ntheoretically there can\
    \ be a method using that disturbance of noise or technically the \nsound waves\
    \ into electromagnetic waves. The process of modulation and collecting \nit in\
    \ a channel to demodulate those input signals the process can be done. The \n\
    statistics show that India is a hub of mechanical factories with the types of\
    \ \nmachinery producing a lot of sound in the environment, even vehicles produce\
    \ a lot \nof sound for better functioning of those things’ silencers are being\
    \ used. \nPiezoelectricity is a technique using which we can store the sound waves\
    \ or the \nsound signals and further convert them into electrical signals, the\
    \ idea is to create a \nstorage unit using piezoelectric principles and store\
    \ the electric current, the current \nproduced would be direct current and can\
    \ directly be used to charge the devices like \nmobile phones, laptops; piezoelectricity\
    \ can be stored in super capacitors for various \npurposes and used in different\
    \ aspects in means of consumption, to have a secure\n2 \n \n               and\
    \ safe future there must be some unconventional ways generate renewable resources.\
    \ \n \n1. INTRODUCTION \nPiezoelectricity is the type of electric charge that\
    \ is generated in some very specific \nsolids like crystals, certain ceramics,\
    \ and biological matter. The word piezoelectric \nmeans the production of electricity\
    \ due to external factors like pressure and latent \nheat. \nThe piezoelectric\
    \ effect shows relativity to the electric dipole in solids. The induced \nions\
    \ on crystal lattice show asymmetrical charge dipole or can be held by molecular\
    \ \ngroups. Piezoelectric materials tend to produce the inverse effect, commonly\
    \ known \nas the converse piezoelectric effect. \n \nFigure 1.1 : Working of Piezoelectricity\
    \ \nPiezoelectric devices are consuming the industrial, manufacturing, and automotive\
    \ \nindustries. Demand for medical instruments and telecommunications devices\
    \ in the \nfield is increasing a lot. The piezoelectric crystals are used in various\
    \ ways; \n \n \n \nFigure 1.2: Direct & Converse Piezoelectric Effect \n \nHigh\
    \ Voltage and power sources - The piezoelectric devices produce a sufficient \n\
    3 \n \n \nhigh-voltage electric current. A piezoelectric transformer is an AC\
    \ voltage \nmultiplier, instead of the regular coupling between the input source\
    \ and output \nsource the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling (acoustic\
    \ coupling is an \ninterface device for electric signals by acoustical means,\
    \ in general, mobile phone \nsignals \nActuators - An actuator is a component\
    \ in any mechanism that could be made \nresponsible forthe movement of the particular\
    \ mechanism, in simple terms, it moves \nthe system and can be generalized as\
    \ a mover. There are piezo actuators and \nenhanced piezoelectric actuators, which\
    \ could be helpful in the conversion of sound \nwave to electrical signals. ex-\
    \ speakers; voltage is converted to mechanical \nmovement, piezoelectric motors,\
    \ etc. \nWhereas piezo elements present in the atmosphere are responsible for\
    \ the reduction \nof sound waves and vibrations in the surrounding by the process\
    \ of absorption and \ncan later be usedfor the conversion of one form of energy\
    \ to the other. Piezoelectric \ndevices can be used for infertility treatment,\
    \ surgeries (piezo-surgery), photovoltaic \ncells, etc. \n \nFigure 1.3 : Piezoelectric\
    \ effect \n \n2. \nWORKING: \nIn fig. iv(a) & fig. iv (b) it is visible about\
    \ the working of piezoelectric devices. Fig-iv(a) \nshows that the input is receiving\
    \ the electric signals on its one end and in return, it is \nproviding the sound\
    \ signals those sound signals are produced via the moving coil of the \nmicrophone.\
    \ Whereasin fig-iv(b) we can see that from the given flow diagram the input \n\
    source requires a source of sound that further is processed in the magnetic diaphragm\
    \ or \nthe coil and the produced energy through the coil must be stored in a supercapacitor\
    \ then \naccording to the requirement of the user one may or may not use the amplifier\
    \ or the \nmultiplier and finally have the output in the form of battery. \n \n\
    \ \nFig- 2.1(a): Piezoelectric effect working \n4 \n \n \n \n \nFig- 2.1(b): Piezoelectric\
    \ effect working \n \n3. \nLITERATURE SURVEY: \n \n \nThe piezoelectric devices\
    \ require the transducer which is of two types the input \ntransducer is a type\
    \ of sensor which sense the input sound wave and receive it for \nprocessing in\
    \ the magnetic coil and the output transducer is finally an actuator. The \nactuator\
    \ is used as the amplifier of the frequency signal used generally in the speakers.\
    \ The \ninput transducer, or in simple terms the sensor responds to every small\
    \ change in the \nsurroundings and converts it into a readable electrical signal.\
    \ \nThe piezoelectric material’s output is combined, rectified, and step up using\
    \ an accurate \ncircuit, so the energy can be utilized properly. The utilization\
    \ of energy is done via storing \nthem or harvesting them into batteries. The\
    \ fullest utilization is done while using them for \nLEDs, recharging the batteries,\
    \ fans, etc., the sources of input are majorly the engines \nproducing heavy sounds\
    \ such as airplanes or horns in trains or some other loud sound. To \nstore a\
    \ conventional amount of sound and reproduce a convincing number of electric \n\
    signals. The utmost motive behind is to produce and supply free electricity around\
    \ the \nglobe or at the cheapest possible price. \n \nThe piezoelectric effect\
    \ is useful and has options in applications that involve the \ndetection of high-frequency\
    \ sound waves and the production of an ample amount of \nelectric signal and vice-versa\
    \ as well. The non-acoustic piezoelectric devices include \nmotors and actuators.\
    \ Sensors, high voltage generators, etc., it is the basis of lots of \nscientific\
    \ instruments and instrumental techniques with atomic resolution, such as \nscanning\
    \ microscopes. \nThe level of noise pollution is increasing drastically day by\
    \ day which is harmful to our \nnature, it can be converted using piezoelectricity\
    \ and its concepts. A sound wave is a \nmechanical wave that is not capable of\
    \ transmitting its energy through a vacuum,according \nto this concept we can\
    \ convert the sound energy into electrical we have to convert our \nsound energy\
    \ to one piezoelectric plate as shown in the above fig. iv(b) to compensate the\
    \ \nlosses we’ll have a magnetic diaphragm and further stored in a supercapacitor\
    \ and used as \nthe input for the amplifier circuit and used as the output in\
    \ the battery. \nA piezoelectric generation device, includes some rectifying means\
    \ which would rectify \nthe signals to AC voltage and the voltage generated by\
    \ the vibration is of at least one \npiezoelectric \nplate\n5 \n \n          \
    \            The energy wave can be one of the biggest possible sources of potential\
    \ energy,         \nwhich could easily be used by piezoelectric devices. The coastal\
    \ areas have high tension of the \ncruises and the high-frequency water waves\
    \ and also somewhere the industry of crude oil and salt \nproduction that can\
    \ be used for harnessing the natural resources of the sea through the water-\n\
    breaking through piezoelectric means for the help in generation of power. \nThe\
    \ piezoelectric sensors use the piezoelectric effects are measures to pressure,\
    \ acceleration, and \nforce by changing them to an electrical signal. Whenever\
    \ pressure is applied to piezoelectric \ncrystals electricity can be developed\
    \ over the crystal lattice.The piezo-sensor converts mechanical \nenergy to electrical\
    \ energy and sends to AC ripple neutralizer to a unidirectional diode that would\
    \ \nonly allow to flow it in one direction and then stores into the battery which\
    \ is sent to the \ninverter that converts direct current to alternating current\
    \ and switch the circuit on the \nelectrical energy will flow through the circuit.\
    \ \nPiezoelectric materials are simple, light in weight, cost-efficient, and easy\
    \ to control as well. The \nadaptability in a vast range of applications in different\
    \ structures; piezoelectric materials which are \nmost commonly used in automotive\
    \ and aerospace engineering, some elements like; Lead \nZirconate Titanate (PZT),\
    \ Lead Titanate (LT), Sodium Potassium Niobate (SBN), etc. \nPower consumption\
    \ is now dominant in the present scenario when it comes to comparison with the\
    \ \npast data, it is hard to fulfill needs in terms of electricity of everyone.\
    \ The conversion of \nmechanical vibrations into electrical energy can be done\
    \ by piezoelectric elements and principles. \nThe converted electrical energy\
    \ is accumulated so that it could attain the required threshold value. \nThe energy\
    \ used provides feedback for avoiding the external charging in the circuit. \n\
    \ \n4. \nCONCLUSION: \nThe idea states the conversion of mechanical vibrations\
    \ or mechanical energy into electrical \nenergy, using piezoelectric means. The\
    \ piezoelectric designs are capable of self-charging using the \nsuperconductor,\
    \ they are much more effective when it comes to supplying the power for the \n\
    charging of electronic devices such as mobile phones, laptops, etc., without any\
    \ external charging \nequipment. \nThe piezoelectric energy device performance\
    \ depends on numerous factors such as type of \nconfiguration, the material selected,\
    \ the design of the circuit, etc. \n \n REFERENCES: \n \n[1] Bouzidy, f. Z. 2017.\

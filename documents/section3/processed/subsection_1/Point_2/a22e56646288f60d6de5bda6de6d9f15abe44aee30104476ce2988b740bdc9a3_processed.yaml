  description: Automated variable rate irrigation (VRI) is one of the frontiers for
    sustainable water use in agriculture. In this paper, we describe a planning procedure
    for self-propelled rain gun sprinklers, a type of equipment largely used in irrigation
    of open field crops thanks to its relatively low cost and easy deployment in multiple
    sites. The sprinkler is commanded by an information system which acquires data
    from remote sensors (satellite), processes vegetation indices and spatial maps
    describing the water need of the crop, and computes a VRI prescription map for
    a specific field, i.e. the water quantity to be supplied to each field sub-area.
    The VRI prescription map is used to compute the motion commands for a rain gun
    system pulled by a hose reel. The procedure is based on a sprinkler model, has
    been validated by simulation, and is fully automated. Experiments have shown the
    precision in water distribution achievable with software-controlled sprinklers
    and effective planning strategies.

    Precise, site-specific irrigation is a major challenge and critical task to achieve
    efficient use of water resources in farming as well as to meet sustainability
    goals. Advancement in technology has made viable variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    (Evans et al., 2020, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2019), with clear potential economic,
    environmental, and agronomic advantages. Yet, the widespread application of VRI
    is hindered by the complexity and cost associated with the deployment of new or
    upgraded irrigation equipment. Among the different irrigation techniques, sprinkler-based
    irrigation using self-propelled machines, either with linear motion or with center
    pivot, is a widespread practice, especially in massive production farming involving
    large-scale crops (Evans et al., 2020, Mostafa and Derbala, 2013). Indeed, sprinkler
    irrigation covers a significant fraction of irrigated land worldwide (e.g., above
    60% in Europe and above 40% in Northern America) (Pereira and Gonçalves, 2018).
    Mobile rain gun irrigation sprinklers, investigated in this work, are among the
    most widespread machines in open field irrigation, thanks to their relatively
    low cost and easy deployment by the farmer in multiple fields. The development
    of techniques enabling automatic monitoring, planning and control of machines
    equipped with VRI capabilities, including sprinkler-based machines, can have therefore
    a significant impact toward water use efficiency and sustainability (Abioye et
    al., 2020, Evans et al., 2020). In the last two decades, a number of Decision
    Support Systems (DDS) (Bergez et al., 2012, Moreira Barradas et al., 2012, Rinaldi
    and He, 2014, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015, Adeyemi et al., 2018) have been proposed
    to schedule VRI. These DSS are designed for different irrigation techniques, often
    targeting specific crops, and operate at different spatial resolution (e.g. entire
    field or site-specific). They cope with spatial and temporal variability using
    various amount and type of prior static knowledge (e.g. about soil variability)
    and sensor-acquired data (e.g., weather or vegetation information). The DSS in
    Bergez et al. (2012) and in Moreira Barradas et al. (2012) provide schemes for
    space decomposition at different scales, from regional to irrigation block to
    field partitions, but do not include automatic acquisition of sensor measurements
    from the crop nor support planning of VRI. Haghverdi et al. (2016) investigate
    the potential of site-specific irrigation with optimized water production functions
    and adapt the resulting irrigation prescriptions to large center pivot machines.
    However, the degree of automation of the data flow from the irrigation prescription
    to the programming of the machine is unclear. Moreover, the approach does not
    consider other types of irrigation equipment. Li et al. (2020) point out the importance
    of using a sensor network including remote sensing, in-site and IoT devices to
    enable precision irrigation with sprinklers. However, they do not provide the
    procedures and models to transform irrigation prescription maps into irrigation
    plans suitable for actual irrigation equipment, and specifically for self-propelled
    rain gun sprinklers. In general, DSS allow accurate assessment of the proper,
    site-specific water needed by the crop, and hence are a key step toward efficient
    use of water. Their main limitation lies in the lack of integration between the
    information system and the automated irrigation equipment available to the farmer.
    Full machine-to-machine operation requires to take into account the farming geometry
    and the actual differential irrigation capabilities of the machine. Studies dealing
    with physical modeling of linear sprinklers (Carrión et al., 2001, Li et al.,
    2015, Ouazaa et al., 2014, Ferreira Borges and Teixeira de Andrade, 2021, Hua
    et al., 2022) focus on water distribution patterns obtained with different shapes
    and sizes of the nozzle to improve water distribution uniformity in fixed position
    and do not investigate the effectiveness of irrigation in motion, nor they consider
    the application to VRI. While accurate sprinkler models are required to measure
    and improve machine performance, such analysis does not cope with water distribution
    on the farming field and has limited applicability in sprinkler motion planning.
    There are few works investigating the water distribution on farming fields achieved
    by irrigation systems like center pivot systems (McCarthy et al., 2010) or movable
    rain gun sprinklers (Ghinassi, 2010, Miodragovic et al., 2012), either through
    simulation or experimental assessment. Such studies enable prediction and even
    planning of the machine motion, often aimed at uniform water distribution rather
    than at informed and sensor-guided VRI. In this paper, we propose a planning procedure
    for the motion of a rain gun sprinkler enabling automated irrigation according
    to the best approximation of a VRI prescription map generated by a DSS. Indeed,
    the potential use of rain guns for VRI is deterred by the difficulty for the farmer
    of programming non-uniform water distributions. The automatic execution of irrigation
    through a programmable actuator better guarantees that the correct quantities
    of water are properly supplied to the crop. To our knowledge, there are no automated
    systems connecting high level prescription maps to rain gun actuators for VRI.
    Moreover, given the extensive use of movable rain gun sprinklers, this approach
    can have a beneficial impact toward widespread application of VRI. The planning
    procedure for rain gun sprinklers reported in this paper has been developed in
    the frame of project POSITIVE1 (Amoretti et al., 2020, Penzotti et al., 2022),
    whose information system and processing pipeline are described in the next section.
    The outcome has been assessed through both simulation and experiments. Simulation
    is based on a purposely-designed distribution model, reported in the paper, that
    abstracts from hydrodynamic aspects and allows offline prediction of water distribution.
    Field experiments have been performed in a farm using an advanced industrial rain
    gun, the Elektrorain system manufactured by the company SIME Srl, Italy.2 For
    this purpose, a software module has been developed to control the rotation speed
    and angle limits of the sprinkler head according to the planned motion, and the
    rain gun control unit has been directly interfaced to the POSITIVE information
    system. In summary, the contributions of this study are the following: 1. We illustrate
    a system for computation of a field-specific irrigation plan suitable for rain
    gun sprinklers starting from the prescription of an irrigation DSS. 2. We propose
    an algorithm as well as a system physical model for planning the motion of a rain
    gun sprinkler in order to achieve differential irrigation on field partitions.
    3. We report the implementation and testing of the planning algorithm with an
    actual sprinkler in a field experiment and in simulation. 2. Overview of the irrigation
    system 2.1. Approach to planning VRI with rain gun sprinklers Rain guns are usually
    connected to hose reels by a pipe and are moved by wrapping the hose while sprinkling
    water on the field. During the backward motion, the rain gun head rotates in order
    to distribute water in the desired directions. Recently, advanced rain guns and
    hose reels can be controlled through software interfaces in order to automate
    irrigation. The planning algorithm described in this paper controls the rotation
    speed and angle limits of the sprinkler and the reeling speed of the hose reel
    to which the rain gun is attached. The rain gun supplies water while pulled by
    the hose reel, thereby irrigating a pull area. Hence, the reported procedure allows
    differentiation of the water quantity distributed within each pull area by planning
    the sprinkler motion. The pull area can be partitioned both longways, into multiple
    segments, and crosswise, into left and right regions. Although VRI prescription
    maps can be obtained by feeding a DSS with remote (e.g. satellite-based vegetation
    maps) or local (e.g. distributed soil moisture data) sensor information, these
    maps do not translate directly into the differential irrigation which can be actually
    applied by available equipment. Hence, in this paper we develop a planning system
    to map a generic VRI map, possibly articulated into pixels corresponding to satellite-derived
    Vegetation Index (VI) maps, into a proper partitioning in sub-regions which can
    be applied by a specific irrigation machine, taking into account its features
    and constraints as well as its position and motion direction in the field (in
    general not aligned with satellite-based maps). The proposed planning algorithm
    computes the variable retraction velocity of the sprinkler and the rain gun orientation
    limits over the time so as to deliver water to the crop according to the most
    accurate, feasible approximation of the processed VRI prescription map. 2.2. POSITIVE
    information system Project POSITIVE (Amoretti et al., 2020, Penzotti et al., 2022)
    has tackled precision irrigation over large regions by transforming multispectral
    images from Copernicus satellites and data from field sensors into high resolution
    crop- and terrain-specific irrigation prescription maps. Planning actuation of
    the prescription map via a rain gun sprinkler is one of the open protocols developed
    within the project. In POSITIVE the irrigation prescription map for each registered
    plot is provided by the IRRIFRAME3 agronomic DSS (Mannini et al., 2013), and relies
    on a number of information flows and knowledge sources, including plot geometry
    (called polygon), soil structure and map, crop management information (crop type,
    seed or plant date, etc.), crop development model, history of precipitations and
    irrigations, data from sensors in the plot (if any), and weather forecasts. IRRIFRAME
    is available in most Italian regions and managed by the national association of
    water reclamation consortia under the technical guidance of CER (Canale Emiliano
    Romagnolo).4 The service is freely accessible by registered farmers and provides
    on a daily-basis updated agronomic advice for registered fields and crops. It
    provides an irrigation and fertigation calendar trading off crop requirements
    with sustainable management of water and other resources (e.g., pesticides and
    nutrients), thus reducing the impact of cultivation. IRRIFRAME maintains a data
    record of each registered field or plot and updates such record with any information
    provided by the user and with the measurements provided by on-field and remote
    sensing data. In POSITIVE, the IRRIFRAME data record of each registered plot has
    been enriched with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced
    Vegetation Index (EVI) maps (Huete et al., 2002), computed from Sentinel-2 products.
    Custom information services for data processing and storage have been implemented
    in POSITIVE to manage the flow of Sentinel-2 data to IRRIFRAME. An overall view
    of this process, repeated each time there is a valid Sentinel-2 sampling, is shown
    in Fig. 1. The water application depth is computed in IRRIFRAME via an evapotranspiration
    model based on crop coefficient. This default prescription has been enriched in
    POSITIVE using the NDVI and EVI maps, which enable a continuous recalibration
    of the prescription based on satellite revisit times (typically every 5 days).
    Moreover, for large-scale crops the basic irrigation prescription is generalized
    into a VRI prescription map at the resolution (10 m) of Copernicus multispectral
    imagery. Download : Download high-res image (238KB) Download : Download full-size

    DSS. (a) Satellite products are obtained for large areas via the Copernicus Hub
    API, cropping out the area of interest. (b) Pixels that carry information on the
    polygon are extracted; data verification and cleaning operations for presence
    of artifacts, edge effects and more are applied. (c) NDVI and EVI maps are computed
    from the cleaned images, formatted, and uploaded in IRRIFRAME. Although producing
    a valid irrigation map is the output of a complex DSS, in this paper we focus
    on the exploitation of satellite-based data and related VI to enable VRI where
    appropriate. In the pipeline encompassed by POSITIVE, irrigation machines like
    movable rain gun sprinklers, linear spray booms or center pivot systems are bound
    to execute the water application depth maps. 2.2.1. Data-driven irrigation Data-driven
    irrigation systems comprise two main modules: an information system and one or
    more actuators for irrigation. • Information System. The information system coordinates
    the acquisition of all data and information required to produce a valid irrigation
    prescription. A key component for smart irrigation is the specialized DSS. The
    final output of the information system is the irrigation prescription presented
    as a map, associating to each partition of a field the water supply required by
    the crop. The field surface can be partitioned in several ways: for example, satellites
    provide data about a field with a given surface resolution, whereas the same field
    is divided into tracks according to the physical characteristics of the specific
    irrigation equipment (e.g., the range of the rain gun sprinkler). Moreover, the
    irrigation equipment used in a field can change over time, so partitioning and
    mapping among partitions must be configurable. The map must be adapted to the
    required field partitioning when delivered to the farmer or to the irrigation
    system. • Actuators for Irrigation. The information system can automatically deliver
    a VRI water depth map to advanced irrigation machines equipped with a suitable
    control unit. There are different types of sprinkler-based irrigation machines
    that can receive and apply VRI maps. In this work, we focus on rain gun sprinklers
    towed by a hose reel winch. The components of the information system are described
    next according to the data flow shown in Fig. 2. VRI requires a differentiated
    irrigation prescription map for different areas of the plot based on the localized
    need of the crop. A standard approach (Brown, 2015) is to retrieve information
    from the remote sensing activities of the Copernicus program, chiefly the products
    made available by Sentinel-2 satellites. Sentinel-2 data are available in the
    form of multispectral images of large geographical areas, composed in 13 spectral
    bands and with different resolutions. Products are provided in Cartesian raster
    format, in which each pixel represents a square plot of land with a side equal
    to the resolution. Download : Download high-res image (455KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Data flow of the application for sprinkler-based VRI.
    The main activities are acquisition of remote sensing data (possibly integrated
    by local sensor data), acquisition of the water application map, actuation of
    data-driven irrigation. Data acquisition and model update are performed continuously.
    For the areas of interest, the information system retrieves and stores the products
    at each new transit of the satellites. These products are processed in terms of
    VI maps referred to a plot, and then delivered to IRRIFRAME, which provides site-specific
    agronomic information and irrigation and fertigation prescriptions for registered
    fields and crops (Mannini et al., 2013). In the experiment reported in this paper,
    the well-known NDVI computed from the Sentinel-2 products has been adopted. This
    approach is extensible to other appropriate VI or information derived from sensing
    activities. The spectral bands needed for computing the NDVI map are provided
    by Sentinel-2 products at the maximum resolution of . This resolution is adequate
    for many open field crops (corn, tomato, soybean, etc.) in medium–large plots,
    where the plot is covered by a high number of samples. Conversely, very small
    plots are too limited and unsuitable for VRI based on satellite data. Other operations
    required for computation of an NDVI map suitable for the DSS include verification
    and cleaning of the Sentinel-2 products, such as outlier removal, filtering around
    the edges of the plot for mitigation of artifacts in the images (e.g., roads and
    buildings), and coordinate system transformation. In addition to the processed
    NDVI map, IRRIFRAME exploits a wealth of information to compute the water irrigation
    prescription for the plot, including crop, soil, and weather information. At the
    end of the process, a spatially-variable water application map is available, i.e.
    a map that associates to each field cell the recommended water application to
    be supplied. Usually, the map is provided in the form of a tessellation of square
    cells , where the size of each is exploiting the resolution of Sentinel-2 images.
    The application depth of a cell is the quantity of water expressed in the form
    of the total water volume for the surface or as the average water application
    depth per surface point. The final step is transformation of the irrigation prescription
    map into irrigation machine commands. This operation is strongly dependent on
    the available actuators. Irrigation machines may be equipped with communication
    interfaces to receive commands and transmit data to the information system. In
    such case, the VRI process can be fully automated. In this paper, we report the
    interfacing of the POSITIVE information system with a movable rain gun sprinkler
    via a custom communication protocol defined by the manufacturer. The rain gun
    can receive commands in real-time and hence be driven by a software application.
    Special-purpose services have been implemented in order to translate the irrigation
    prescription map into low-level commands, as the Elektrorain rain gun is not natively
    configured to operate VRI. 2.2.2. Actuators for irrigation Electronically-controlled
    actuators are mandatory to achieve automatic irrigation according to the water
    application depth provided by the information system. Movable rain gun sprinklers
    comprise: • a self-winding towing machine (hose reel) positioned at one side of
    the plot and connected to the water supply via a pump; • a towed trolley with
    a rain gun or cannon, mounted as a rotating arm, which irrigates by sprinkling
    (see Fig. 3). Initially, the trolley is transported away from the reel on the
    other side of the irrigated plot by means of a tractor, unrolling the feeding-towing
    hose. During irrigation, the towing machine rolls up the hose, thereby drawing
    to itself the sprinkler trolley. We refer to this type of movement as a pull.
    To each pull corresponds a rectangular wet region at the end of the irrigation.
    The quantity of water delivered depends on the dimensional characteristics of
    the machines, on the pressure with which the system is fed, and on the speed commanded
    to the trolley, called retraction speed. In order to apply VRI as proposed in
    this paper, the actuators must implement advanced mechanical and electronic features
    as summarized below. Download : Download high-res image (322KB) Download : Download

    reel (1) and a rain gun cannon (2). The dynamics of the actuators are schematized
    by red arrows. Mechanical features. Both the hose reel and the rain gun must have
    the ability to differentiate the amount of water released along the pull, changing
    some of the parameters. • The hose reel must be able to modify the retraction
    speed during execution, thus slowing down the movement of the trolley where a
    larger supply of water is required. • The rain gun must be able to modify the
    rotation speed and/or the start and end stroke angles. Indeed, recent rain gun
    models provide such feature, even though it was designed to increase the uniformity
    of the sprinkled water or to avoid wetting unwanted areas on the edge or inside
    the plot. Through appropriate modeling and programming, as reported in this paper,
    the feature can be exploited to differentiate the quantity of water delivered
    transversely to the pull direction. Other parameters, such as the water flow,
    are difficult to modify and are usually considered non-changeable in real-time.
    Electronic features. The irrigation system must be able to receive and follow
    an irrigation plan, that is, to memorize and effect changes to the parameters
    described above on the basis of the different water application depths required
    along the pull. This programmability can be static or dynamic, i.e. it can be
    set only before irrigation or it can be continuously corrected based on real-time
    sensor feedback or commands. In this case, a remote communication capability on
    the part of the machines is required. The SIME Elektrorain rain gun sprinkler
    provides the mechanical, electronic and communication features described above
    and hence has been used as a reference and for the experiments reported in this
    paper. However, the proposed irrigation planning procedure is quite general and
    can be applied to any rain gun with the required features. 3. Model for sprinkler-based
    irrigation This section provides a simplified model for mobile rain gun sprinklers
    and for the irrigation process. The model will be used for planning irrigation
    according to a VRI prescription map. 3.1. Sprinkler state model Sprinkler irrigation
    is achieved by retracting the rain gun, which is commanded by reeling the hose,
    and by rotating the rain gun head during the retract motion. Assuming water flow
    approximately constant during irrigation, water distribution depends on the changes
    in position and orientation of the rain gun in the course of irrigation, in other
    words by the state of the sprinkler. The state variables represent the position
    and orientation of the modeled sprinkler in the world. Geographic information
    systems describe the position of irrigation machines and fields according to geographic
    spherical coordinate systems, but in this context a planar Euclidean reference
    system is more convenient. We assume that the reference frame local is placed
    on the ground surface that we approximate with a plane, and that the position
    and orientation of the sprinkler frame is given by pose vector representing the
    transformation matrix . Without losing generality, we assume that the pull direction
    is the same of axis of and, hence, . It is reasonable to assume the orientation
    of the sprinkler frame consistent with the wrapping direction, i.e. . The orientation
    of the rotating head of the sprinkler, which is responsible for the water flow
    direction, is described by angle . Thus, the state vector of the sprinkler is
    , which can be reduced to the components since for most problems and . It will
    be clear from context whether the symbol refers to the full or the reduced state
    vector. The evolution of the sprinkler state is described by the simple equations
    (1) (2) A single irrigation pull starts with the sprinkler in position , where
    is the length of the pull rectangle and is the range of the water flow. Then,
    it is pulled by the hose reel and moves with speed , where the retraction velocity
    is negative since the motion versus is contrary to the axis of frame . The rotating
    head of the sprinkler changes its orientation between two extreme angles and and
    the rotation speed is . In the case of uniform irrigation on all the field, the
    input is a step function for every sweeping cycle (3) where is the constant sweeping
    speed, is the sweeping time and the orientation in . The above command can be
    reformulated with respect to the sprinkler orientation as (4) This second form
    divides the interval according to another state variable and is more convenient
    in many computations. 3.2. Irrigation model The hydraulic model adopted here is
    simplified. We assume that the water pushed in the sprinkler has constant pressure
    ( ), constant volumetric flow rate ( ) and constant range ( ). The range is defined
    as the distance between the sprinkler center and the point where flowing water
    concentration is maximum. We will propose in Section 5 a distribution function
    for application rate that approximates a more accurate hydrodynamic model. However,
    this section avoids the choice of a specific distribution by reasoning on the
    average water spilled on a field area. The model assumes that the maximum range
    and the application rate distribution of the sprinkler rain gun are negligible
    compared with the longitudinal length of the field (or the longitudinal length
    of a field sector, if the field is split longitudinally). The irrigation area
    reached by the sprinkler in a single pull is abstractly defined as a pull rectangle.
    The length of the pull rectangle is equal to , which is the length of the path
    traveled by the sprinkler when pulled by the hose reel. Its width depends on the
    angle interval covered by the rotating head of the sprinkler (5) If and , then
    , i.e. the width is the double of the sprinkler range. On average, the water volume
    supplied in a time interval is distributed by the sprinkler retracting with wrapping
    speed on the surface with area equal to (6) The surface represents the area reached
    by the sprinkler jet, even though the water distribution is possibly uneven. On
    average, the water application depth is (7) The above equality is exact when both
    and are constant over interval , i.e. and . The supplied water per unit surface
    is an average value achieved through changes of the sprinkler position ( ) and
    sprinkler head orientation ( ). When modeling the instantaneous water distribution
    of a rain gun as in Section 5, we have to use the application rate, which is the
    time derivative of . This simple model can be used to specify the water volume
    supplied to different areas. For example, the pull rectangle can be split longitudinally
    along the pull direction and transversely along the orthogonal direction . The
    regions corresponding to the longitudinal partition of the pull rectangle are
    called sectors . Each sector is further partitioned into left and right sub-sectors
    with respect to the sprinkler retraction line. The total water volume supplied
    on sector depends on the retraction speed (i.e. on the time the sprinkler jet
    falls on the field with constant volumetric flow rate ), but the water supplied
    to each sector and can be diversified according to the time the sprinkler is directed
    on the left or on the right. The sprinkler state variables are illustrated in
    Fig. 4. We focus on the precision irrigation of the left and right sub-sectors
    that can be replicated separately on each sector under the hypothesis that longitudinal
    transition between contiguous sectors has negligible effect on irrigation. Download

    to visit twice the angle interval . The sweeping time is also the period of the
    system. Let and be the amount of s.t. the sprinkler is directed to respectively
    the left and the right sub-sectors, . The total volume of water is then split
    into and , and using Eq. (7) the water application depths on left and right are
    respectively (8) where the and are the widths of respectively the left and the
    right sectors, and . If symmetric angle values and are assigned, then . In such
    symmetric case, the ratio between left and right application depths depends straightforwardly
    on the left and right times as (9) There are different ways to control and and
    two of them are discussed in Section 4. The ratio of and only depends on the state
    variables of the rain gun like its rotation speed or the initial and final rotation
    angles. Conversely, the average water application rate is a function of retraction
    speed , which is controlled by the hose reel towing machine. In the symmetric
    case, the average application depth on a sector is . The pull speed needed to
    achieve the required average in a sector is derived from Eq. (7) as (10) Thus,
    the sprinkler commands for controlling the application depths on sub-sectors are
    computed from Eqs. (9), (10). The proposed model holds under the hypothesis that
    the target values of and as well as the retraction speed smoothly change in longitudinal
    direction. Moreover, full variable rate irrigation requires control and communication
    of both the rain gun sprinkler and the towing machine that often have different
    manufacturers. In this paper, we focus only on the former component. 4. Planning
    for precise irrigation This section presents two policies for computing irrigation
    commands to achieve different application rates and in left and right sub-sectors
    with respect to the pull direction of the sprinkler. The first method is based
    on differential angular speeds of the sprinkler. The second method is based on
    the manipulation of initial and final angles of the sprinkler. The second method
    is more consistent with the requirements of real irrigation scenarios and is therefore
    better described. Setting differentiated angular speeds. The total water volume
    can be split in the two sub-sectors according to the time the sprinkler is directed
    toward each of them according to Eq. (8). Such goal could be achieved by setting
    different rotation speeds and respectively on the left and on the right sectors
    (11) where . In each sweep, the time intervals in which the sprinkler is directed
    toward the left and right sectors are respectively and . The non-continuous staircase
    function in Eq. (11) is just a setpoint and the real speed depends on the dynamics
    of the system. It would be more realistic to set trapezoid or even parabolic command
    functions for transitions from to and vice versa, but this paper will not address
    this approach. In the symmetric case, the ratio of application depths of Eq. (9)
    is related to the angular speeds in the left and the right sub-sectors according
    to (12) Thus, different irrigation of the left and right sub-sectors can be achieved
    by setting different values of the rotation speed, and . However, setting non-uniform
    values of the gun rotation speed incurs several disadvantages from a crop perspective.
    The jet range slightly changes during rotation so that the adoption of different
    speeds may result into unequal coverage of irrigation areas. The transition between
    setpoints and is not immediate. Moreover, a slower rotation speed implies that
    the sprinkler jet falls for longer time on a specific area, i.e. it applies force
    on the same plant which could be excessive for some crops. Setting differentiated
    angular trajectories. An alternative modulation of water flows in the left and
    right sub-sectors is achieved by dynamically changing and , while keeping a constant
    value for . This approach should be preferred since it reduces uneven water distribution,
    accelerated drops, and potential damage of the crop. Let be the index of the sweeps
    of the sprinkler. For each sweep, the extreme angles and can be set. In the course
    of sweeps, the total sweeping times of the left and right sub-sectors are (13)
    For sake of uniformity, it would be convenient to have sweeps covering all the
    available angle interval, i.e. and . With the standard choice , at each sweep
    we may have a complete sweep covering both left and right, or a half-sweep either
    to the left or to the right. Let be the counters of left and right half-sweeps
    in a sequence of sweeps. Under these hypotheses, Eq. (13) has the simpler expression
    (14) If the times and depend on the integer counters and , the ratio of the application
    depths in Eq. (9) is also constrained by the feasible values of the discrete variables
    and . The total irrigation time of the sprinkler on a longitudinal sector of length
    is equal to , where is the pull speed set for the sector as in Eq. (10). Such
    sector time may not correspond exactly to the time required for sweeps given by
    the sum of and , since these times refer to complete half-sweeps on the left and
    right sub-sectors. Hence, there is a residual time spent during transition to
    the next sector. Thus, the total irrigation time on a sector of length is (15)
    The desired value is , but the chosen simplified control of sprinkler rotation
    makes and function of integer variables (the half-sweep counters) as discussed
    in the following. Both Eqs. (9), (15) constrain the times and and the desired
    application depths and . Eq. (9) can only be approximated, since and depend on
    discrete variables. Thus, the planning problem can be formulated as (16) (17)
    (18) The parameter (like ) is the compensation for the discrete values assumed
    by variables and . Since and are integers, it is not guaranteed that their ratio
    is equal to , and is the value of such discrepancy. The residual parameters and
    should be as small as possible. The solution is found by computing the maximum
    total number of half-sweeps from Eq. (17) (with ) and, then, by finding the best
    approximation of the left side of Eq. (16). Download : Download high-res image

    half-sweeps and , the half-sweeps must be distributed over time in sequences and
    . A criterion is to distribute the half-sweeps as equally as possible while the
    sprinkler is traversing the current sector. Algorithm 1 reports a simple procedure
    for the computation of the angle delimiters and . First, the number of half-sweeps
    is computed (line 1) based on Eq. (17). By choosing to be the nearest integer,
    we minimize the value of residual time . Then, the number of left and right half-sweeps

    2–11). Lines 12–27 evaluate the angle limits and of sprinkler orientation for
    each interval . The variables and count the number of executed left and right
    half-sweeps. A left half-sweep is executed when the ratio is less than . Similarly,
    a right half-sweep is executed when the reciprocal ratio satisfies the equivalent
    statement. 5. Simulation Simulation enables the assessment of expected results
    of a planned irrigation before its execution on the field. The planning method
    for sprinkler-based irrigation illustrated in Section 4 operates on average application
    rate over field sub-regions. However, the simulation of sprinkler water requires
    a more detailed distribution of water flow on the ground surface, while avoiding
    detailed fluid dynamic description. The standard model in literature (Ouazaa et
    al., 2014, Ferreira Borges and Teixeira de Andrade, 2021) focuses on uniform water
    distribution in all the directions of the sprinkler during irrigation. We propose
    to use probability density functions to describe the application rate of the sprinkler
    on a specific field point. Such probability functions are simply models and are
    used for deterministic analysis. Given the sprinkler state , our goal is to evaluate
    the instantaneous water flow on each point of the field at a given time instant
    . Direct observation (Ouazaa et al., 2014, Li et al., 2015) suggests that the
    water flow is concentrated around a point corresponding to the sprinkler range
    in direction , although water is distributed also on the distance interval . Moreover,
    the sprinkler flow is angularly concentrated around the direction with standard
    deviation. Instead of Cartesian coordinates, the distribution of application rate
    is better modeled in polar coordinates . The complete distribution is defined
    as the product of a direction distribution and a range distribution . The water
    flow is higher for close to the direction of the sprinkler gun. The von Mises
    distribution is a suitable central distribution for angles defined as (19) where
    is the concentration parameter, is the mean and mode of the distribution and is
    the modified Bessel function of order 0. Since the range is a non-negative quantity,
    we need a distribution defined on non-negative real domain . We propose to model
    the sprinkler range using the easily manageable biased Rayleigh (Lodi Rizzini
    et al., 2019) defined as (20) where is the mode, the width parameter, and the
    normalization constant. The values of and can be set s.t. the sprinkler range
    is equal to where is set to include most of the area of the distribution (in our
    simulation ). The application rate distribution is given by the product of the
    angular and range distributions (21) where is the constant water volume per time
    (in ) supplied by the sprinkler at constant pressure and nozzle size. Table 1
    provides the values of the distribution parameters enabling simulation of the
    Elektrorain sprinkler used in the experiments. The parameters have been either
    empirically measured, e.g. the range or , or derived from empirical quantities,
    e.g. is set to yield a field-of-view of approximately . Simulation uses the model
    of the application rate previously described to evaluate the water volume provided
    to each sub-region of the field. The flow distribution is sampled with desired
    resolution and its coordinates and are converted to Cartesian ones . A water volume
    is attributed to each sample and to the field sub-region where belongs to. Such
    simple procedure allows prediction of irrigation results. The Octave code of the
    simulation is publicly available.5 Table 1. Parameter values for simulation of
    the SIME Elektrorain sprinkler. Parameter Value 44.0 m 498.55 26.0 5 m 6. Experiments
    This section describes experiments carried out in summer 2021. We describe the
    experimental setup including devices, facilities, configuration parameters and
    deployment activities. Then, we present the quantitative results about controlled
    water distribution as measured by a set of water catch cans positioned in the
    ground. Finally, we discuss the outcome of the experiments. 6.1. Experimental
    irrigation system The irrigation setup used in the experiments exploits the POSITIVE
    information services described in Section 2, where a VRI prescription map is produced
    by the IRRIFRAME DSS. The SIme Elektrorain sprinkler is the main actuator operated
    in the experiment. The sprinkler was clasped and pulled by a hose reel towing
    machine (manufactured by RM S.r.l.). The whole system is shown in Fig. 5. The
    Elektrorain is equipped with a control unit that receives commands via a proprietary
    communication protocol. The hose reel machine is not remotely controllable and
    can only tow the sprinkler at uniform speed. Such system allows to test VRI between
    the left and right sub-sectors of the pulling area, while the average supplied
    water is constant according to Eq. (7). A fully controllable hose reel machine
    supporting variable retraction speed and application-level communication could
    modulate the value of in different segments of the field. The following Elektrorain
    features make it suitable for VRI: • Low latency remote control allowed by 3G
    connection with proprietary communication protocol. An authorized application
    can send messages to request the rain gun status or to control its motion, e.g.
    to change the angular limits or rotation speed. • Programmable irrigation parameters
    stored by the control unit. Parameters include the head rotation speed setpoint
    for a specific angle interval and the angle limits of the sweep motion. Through
    these parameters, the machine behavior can be programmed for differentiated irrigation
    during the retraction motion. • Controlled water distribution and angular speed
    for different angular sectors with 1 deg resolution. • Sensors reporting operating
    condition and machine state, including a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
    receiver returning the sprinkler position as well as water pressure and tilt sensors.
    For the purpose of the experiment, a control application has been developed to
    translate the VRI prescription map into low-medium level machine commands based
    on the Elektrorain custom protocol. The control application implements the discrete
    modeling defined in Section 3, which is updated by reading the status of the machine
    (last position returned by GNSS and current orientation angle) with a mechanism
    based on timed polling. The application can control the behavior of the machine
    both by changing parameters instantaneously (such as speed and direction of rotation)
    and by setting sections of programmed executions with their associated duration.
    The application also provides real-time monitoring of parameters such as the traveled
    distance and the number of half sweeps performed for each side. Download : Download

    have been carried out in a test field in Emilia-Romagna (latitude 44.570559, longitude
    11.533815) on August 2021 in the time frame 9:00-12:00. Temperature increased
    from 23° to 30° during the experiment, average humidity was 56%, wind was modest
    at about with south-east direction. The field width is about and its length about
    , corresponding to an usable agricultural surface of about . The plot was completely
    bare at the time of the experiment, since the crop had been harvested days before.
    Fig. 6 shows the plot overlaid with a schema of the actuators and water catch
    cans positions. Fig. 6 also displays a prescribed water application depth map,
    enhanced to highlight the difference between right and left sub-sectors. The different
    amounts of water prescribed have been chosen to stimulate the dynamics of the
    irrigation system and are not directly verifiable in the water catch cans due
    to the short transitions between sectors. An overall picture of the water catch
    cans distribution is given in Fig. 7. In farming practice, sprinkler irrigation
    often starts with the rain gun placed at the opposite side of the field and oriented
    toward the hose reel to supply water inside the field. After a sufficient area
    has been covered, the rain gun orientation is set to the standard side as represented
    in Fig. 6. The experiment avoided this maneuver, since the goal was to verify
    the correct variability in the general sprinkling of the water, without multi-phase
    operations. Indeed, the experiment considered only the first of the plot, just
    behind the initial position of the rain gun. The sprinkler model described in
    Section 3 has been adopted to program the irrigation behavior of the system. Some
    simplifications have been applied to match the constraints given by the available
    equipment, chiefly the need to program a fixed retraction speed of the towing
    machine during irrigation. Download : Download high-res image (648KB) Download

    Close-up of one of the cans. In the experiment, the sprinkler has been configured
    to supply an average water application depth of 15 mm across the whole field.
    As we have chosen to execute irrigation with constant rotation speed, the different
    prescribed water volumes are achieved by varying the number of times the rain
    gun irrigates each sub-sector. The rotation speed has been set to about ( to complete
    ). Global start and end angles have been set at and , where the reference angle
    0° corresponds to the center line in the direction opposite to the towed trolley.
    Beside the crosswise partition into left and right halves ( wide), the field has
    also been divided lengthwise into longitudinal sectors as listed in Table 2 and
    shown in Fig. 8. Sectors and have been added to stress the irrigation plan by
    completely avoiding water supply respectively on their left and right sides. The
    target of variable rate irrigation has been expressed by means of the right-to-left
    (R-L) ratio, i.e. the ratio of the sprinkler half-sweeps on the right and the
    left sub-sectors. Target R-L ratios of sectors and have been set to 1.25 and 0.7,
    respectively, but due to quantization the planner computed the values reported
    in Table 2. Table 2. Irrigation sectors: approximate length, number of half-sweeps

    the operating pressure measured at the hose reel machine was approximately whereas
    the average flow rate was about . Considering the average water need of 15 mm,
    the retraction speed of the rain gun was set to (about ). The initial position
    of the Elektrorain was about away from the hose reel, reaching approximately the
    beginning of the plot. The range of the sprinkler jet was empirically estimated
    as about . Fig. 8 shows the data flow required to obtain an irrigation prescription
    map, which is then translated into an operational plan for the available irrigation
    equipment. Download : Download high-res image (335KB) Download : Download full-size

    DSS (a). Using some pre-set parameters (b), based on the characteristics of the
    irrigation system and of the experiment, an operational irrigation map is computed
    (c). From the map, an operational plan (d) is derived, which is implemented by
    the control application and updated based on the feedback (e) of the actuators.
    6.3. Results The irrigation plan was executed as previously described. About halfway
    of the pull (namely, after the gun had traveled the distance of ) the system accomplished
    a change in the water applied (due to the change of sector). Fig. 9 shows the
    values of sprinkler orientation angle corresponding to the traveled path and the
    elapsed time from the initial configuration. The number of half sweeps of the
    rain gun was computed by the planning system and commanded in real-time to the
    sprinkler controller to achieve the desired balance of irrigation between the
    left and right sectors. The simulation model described in Section 5 has been used
    to compute the expected irrigation output. Fig. 10 shows the water quantities
    predicted by simulation for each squared portion of the field. The water quantity
    per sub-sector tends to be slightly overestimated, but it is proportional to the
    supplied water. Download : Download high-res image (456KB) Download : Download

    simulated irrigation using the proposed irrigation model. The resolution of the
    simulated field is . The proposed planning strategy delivers different average
    amount of water to left and right sectors under the assumption of indefinite longitudinal
    length of sectors. A catch can measures the amount of delivered water in a given
    point and collects the overall contribution every time the beam from sprinkler
    rain gun is directed toward the container. If there are no transitions between
    longitudinal sectors with different target values, the amount of water collected
    by the can corresponds to the desired average value for the sector. Otherwise,
    the collected amount depends on the contributions of multiple sectors. Fig. 11
    reports the water application depths collected in the water catch cans during
    the experiment, comparing these values with the expected ones. The collected amount
    of water generally increases from central catch cans (number 3, 4, 9 and 10) to
    the external ones (number 1, 6, 7 and 12), with the exception of the cans in the
    final row. This distribution is also discernible in the simulation results in
    Fig. 10. Histograms in Fig. 11 also provide the average depth of each left and
    right half-row of catch cans for comparison with the expected value of the corresponding
    sector. Water catch cans numbered from 1 to 6 predominantly received water from
    sprinkler in sector 1 and partially from sectors 2 and 3. Their measured water
    depths are close to the expected left and right values, in spite of the transitions
    between sectors 1 and 2 and between sectors 2 and 3. Water catch cans 7–12 predominantly
    received water from sprinkler in sector 3, without longitudinal transitions. Hence,
    their measured depths fairly accurately agree with prescribed left and right average
    depths, with a maximum error of about 1 mm. Finally, water catch cans numbered
    from 13 to 18 collected a lower quantity of water (about half of the target values),
    due to the fact that irrigation was interrupted a few minutes after the trolley
    had reached the hose reel. However, a partial effect of the longitudinal transition
    between sectors 3 and 4 can be observed in the lower values measured in catch
    cans 16–18 with respect to catch cans 13–15. In standard practice, irrigation
    is continued until the desired quantity of water is reached, even if retraction
    is complete and retraction speed is zero. As a general remark, the measured application
    depths values are consistent with the target values when the longitudinal dimension
    of field sectors is not less than the rain gun range and, thus, there are smooth
    longitudinal transitions. Download : Download high-res image (407KB) Download

    irrigation. 7. Conclusions This paper has reported a method to enable differential
    irrigation using software-controlled rain gun sprinklers, which can therefore
    be included among the equipment suitable for advanced VRI application. The proposed
    irrigation planning algorithm can differentiate the average water application
    depths supplied to transverse and longitudinal partitions of the field. A field
    experiment has shown that the application depths measured in specific positions
    after irrigation are consistent with the expected ones for the sector, under the
    hypothesis of uniform sprinkler irrigation for the sector and limited longitudinal
    transitions. Bringing differential irrigation capabilities to rain gun sprinklers,
    as proposed in this paper, expands the potential application of VRI, which can
    lead to major savings of water through the execution of prescription maps consistent
    with local requirements of the crop (Evans et al., 2020, O’Shaughnessy et al.,
    2015, O’Shaughnessy et al., 2019). The applicability of the reported planning
    algorithm is not bound to the specific machine used, as the underlying model abstracts
    the technological characteristics common to most rain gun sprinklers. Indeed,
    the algorithm does not imply particularly advanced machines, requiring only features
    such as the control of rotation to carry out the differential irrigation. In future
    work, we expect to achieve complete VRI capabilities for rain gun sprinklers through
    the integration of the towing hose reel into the controlled system, in order to
    exploit the potential of both machines. Furthermore, we plan to extend the model
    to fully support automated planning of VRI with other linear sprinkling systems
    such as advanced spray booms (e.g. wing-type booms) and with pivot irrigation
    systems. CRediT authorship contribution statement Gabriele Penzotti: Conceptualization,

    irrigationOptimisationImage analysisAPSIM 1. Introduction Irrigation is traditionally
    considered as uniform applications over entire fields; however, fields often have
    spatial variability in crop water requirements. This can lead to overwatering
    in some areas of a field and under-watering in other areas, and reduced yield
    over the field. Variable-rate irrigation (VRI) hardware is commercially available
    and enables site-specific application of irrigation by centre pivot and lateral
    move irrigation machines and costs $500-$1500/ha ($AU) depending on manufacturer
    and configuration. The commercial feasibility of VRI depends on field variability,
    crop type and potential water savings and yield improvements (El Chami et al.,
    2019, Sharma and Irmak, 2020). VRI can achieve water savings of up to 25% while
    maintaining yield (Hedley and Yule, 2009) through irrigation according to spatially
    variable water holding capacities, crop water use, or crop types; leaving capacity
    in the soil for capture of rainfall in soils with high water holding capacities
    and in regions with high in-season rainfall; and reducing or stopping irrigation
    in areas of fields that are uncropped or susceptible to overwatering or ponding
    (e.g. inner spans of the machine, areas in field prone to run-off, around water
    troughs, laneways, ditches) (Peters and Flury, 2017). In dairy (cattle) pastures,
    the reduced water in laneways would also reduce maintenance costs and cow lameness
    due to the drier laneways. Approaches have been developed to automate development
    of VRI prescription maps aiming to match the spatial irrigation requirements over
    the field’s cropped areas. Existing irrigation prescription map development processes
    available both commercially, and those developed in research, typically aim to
    fill the spatially variable soil-water profile. Commercial prescription map development
    processes may be: manual using software available with VRI hardware (e.g. Valley365,
    FieldNET); semi-automated using yield, elevation, or electrical conductivity maps
    through precision agriculture software (e.g. Precision Cropping Technologies);
    or automated using soil-water balance approaches from satellite imagery (e.g.
    Prospera). Research tools that automate prescription map development are based
    on soil-water sensors (El-Naggar et al., 2020); soil-water balance models using
    ETc from FAO56 (Barker et al., 2019) or biophysical models (Thorp et al., 2017);
    crop water stress indices from canopy thermometers (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2020,
    Vories et al., 2020) or satellite imagery (Veysi et al., 2017). Irrigating to
    fill the soil-profile may not maximise key grower targets (i.e. yield or profit,
    Cammarano et al., 2012). At the same time, irrigating to fill the soil-profile
    may not minimise environmental impacts, e.g. reduce runoff and drainage (Gillies
    and Smith, 2015), nutrient leaching (Vogeler et al., 2019), or greenhouse gas
    emissions (Li et al., 2022a). However, optimising yield is a consideration to
    improve efficiency and positively impact the environment through production on
    less land. Thorp et al. (2017) found that reducing early season irrigation led
    to increased yield, possibly by encouraging cotton root growth and increasing
    capacity for water uptake and resilience to water shortage during reproductive
    development. A yield-driven strategy for irrigation management may provide yield
    improvements in addition to reported water savings. Automated irrigation strategies
    are reported that combine control systems with yield predictions from biophysical
    models to determine irrigation requirements that maximise yield. For example,
    a ‘Model Predictive Control’ (MPC) approach is reported that uses iterative execution
    of a biophysical model for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with different irrigation
    depths and timings to identify the irrigation management that maximises yield
    using the software ‘VARIwise’ over a prediction horizon (McCarthy et al., 2010,
    McCarthy et al., 2014). This strategy has potential to be automatically parameterised
    from online weather and soil data sources based on geo-referenced information.
    This would enable the strategy to be implemented autonomously in the background
    without the need for a skilled model operator. The MPC strategy has potential
    to adapt irrigation application depths throughout the season to the temporal variations
    in crop water requirements caused by different crop growth stages. Simulation
    studies have reported little value in temporally adapting irrigation strategies
    for soybean crops (Kelly et al., 2023). However, there is potential for adaptive
    strategies to benefit other crops including cotton and grazed pasture. For example,
    cotton crops produce optimal yield under slight water stress during early stages,
    while grazed crops may require lower irrigation depths initially after grazing
    events. There is also potential to extend the strategies from cotton (Gossypium
    hirsutum L.) to grazed pasture. In Australia, VRI is most widely adopted in the
    pasture industry (e.g. perennial ryegrass (Lolium. perenne L.)) for reducing irrigation
    in laneways and existing water bodies in the field. Implementation of MPC would
    require use of a biophysical model that enabled ryegrass simulation. This may
    be achieved using the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM, Holzworth
    et al., 2014) which is modular in design and embeds models to simulate multiple
    crop types including cotton (OZCOT, Wells and Hearn, 1992) and pasture (AgPasture,
    Thornley, Johnson, 2000 as implemented in SGS/DairyMod/EcoMod, Johnson, 2008).
    The models predict final yield and daily values of crop height, cover, and fruiting
    or development parameters (e.g. open boll counts, dry matter). No studies have
    been reported on the performance of yield-driven model-based strategies in the
    field. The use of biophysical models for guiding management decisions requires
    that the model accurately reflect field conditions, particularly yield for cotton
    and pasture growth for ryegrass. The cotton model OZCOT in APSIM is generally
    reported to predict yield and fruiting parameters with strong correlations (R²=0.7–0.9;
    Yang et al., 2014, Shukr et al., 2021, Li et al., 2022b). Similarly, the pasture
    growth model AgPasture integrated in APSIM is reported to predict pasture growth
    with strong correlations (R²=0.7–0.8; Li et al., 2011). However, the models can
    have lower correlations if they do not adequately capture the complexity of the
    physiological or soil processes. For example, for newer cotton varieties not captured
    in biophysical models, the fruiting development predicted by OZCOT is reported
    to be delayed compared with field assessments (Richards et al., 2001, Yeates et
    al., 2009). The model accuracy may also be reduced if row configurations are not
    standard (Milroy et al., 2004). For example, 1 m row spacing is most common in
    Australian cotton but growers may use 1.5 m row spacing in seasons with limited
    water. In addition, low accuracies have been reported for the daily simulated
    soil-water from AgPasture model because the temporal dynamics simulated were not
    present in sensor measurements (R²=0.1 for APSIM; Harrison et al., 2018). This
    suggested that APSIM may be better suited for predicting parameters which have
    smaller fluctuations over time (e.g. yield). Crop biophysical models require parameterisation
    to accurately reflect field conditions. This includes soil properties (drained
    upper limit, lower limit, saturated and starting soil-water content, bulk density),
    daily weather data (maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation and rainfall)
    and crop variety features (e.g. leaf area growth rate and fruit size development
    rate relative to day degrees). The soil property drained upper limit is equivalent
    to the field capacity and crop lower limit is equivalent to the wilting point
    (Wigginton et al., 2012). APSIM uses these properties to calculate the plant available
    water capacity which is the maximum amount of water that can be stored in the
    soil profile and that is available to plants. This can be a major cause of spatial
    yield variability (He et al., 2022) due to irrigation mis-management. Apparent
    electrical conductivity from electromagnetic responses have been used to assess
    spatial variability and identify sampling locations for soil properties to parameterise
    APSIM. In addition, apparent electrical conductivity has been used to assess the
    spatial variability in soil texture, soil-water and salt content (e.g. Vories
    et al., 2020; Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2011; Hedley et al., 2013). In fields with
    large variations in topography, digital elevation models could be used to calculate
    Topographic Wetness Indices and assess spatial variability (Priori et al., 2013).
    Therefore, in a field trial electrical conductivity or elevation mapping could
    be conducted to identify sampling locations. However, some soil properties (i.e.
    soil texture) influential on crop development and productivity are not incorporated
    into APSIM (Vogeler et al., 2022). Soil texture can influence crop development
    and yield, for example due to rapid root penetration in soils with lighter soils
    with higher sand and silt content (Vories et al., 2020; Vories et al., 2021).
    Therefore, the soil properties could be compared with strategy performance to
    identify their influence. Soil water holding and texture properties can be estimated
    from online soil databases (e.g. APSoil in Australia) or assessed using infield
    soil sampling. Weather data from onsite weather stations are expected to be more
    accurate than regional weather information (e.g. Bureau of Meteorology stations
    and SILO simulations in Australia), particularly with significant spatial variations
    in rainfall over short distances in Australia, but can be expensive (∼AU$10 000).
    Crop variety parameters for a range of varieties are often included with the models,
    but can be calibrated if parameters for the planted variety are not available
    (e.g. Thorp et al., 2017). A validation of model performance is required to ensure
    the weather and soil inputs are sufficient for model parameterisation, to assess
    need for parameter calibration, and to provide recommendations for field data
    requirements. Field trials are required to compare MPC with uniform irrigation,
    and VRI using fixed historical maps and soil-water deficit, to evaluate yield
    and efficiency differences. Field trials that compare VRI strategies commonly
    involve small plot trials with at least two replicates of each strategy (e.g.
    different deficit treatments) across soil types (e.g. Hedley et al., 2011; Barker
    et al., 2018). Implementing VRI trials require catch-can data to ensure accurate
    applied irrigation depths. Plot-based trials provide accurate performance comparison
    between strategies as the replicates are within the same paddock and soil type.
    These can be assessed from yield, irrigation applied, and physiological indicators.
    Cotton physiological features that could be assessed include canopy cover and
    open boll counts, potentially measured at broad spatial scales using UAVs and
    image analysis algorithms. Existing image analysis algorithms involve segmentation
    to detect plant or open boll pixels based on colour thresholds, where canopy cover
    is estimated from the ratio between green and all pixels (Kumar and Miklavcic,
    2018), and open boll area is estimated from the ratio between white pixels and
    all pixels (Yeom et al., 2018). Ryegrass yield could be assessed using dry matter
    yield assessments. For example, a calibrated C-Dax Rapid Pasture Meter (Agricultural
    Solutions, Ltd, Palmerston North, New Zealand) is commonly used to assess paddocks
    at a commercial scale and as an alternative pasture biomass ground truth to cuts
    and plate meters (e.g. Insua et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2021). Potential efficiency
    improvements have been identified for VRI of cotton and grazed ryegrass pasture
    using MPC and biophysical modelling to meet temporal and spatial crop water requirements.
    This has not previously been evaluated for grazed pasture or in field trials.
    In this study, the objectives were to: (a) evaluate the ability of biophysical
    model APSIM to accurately predict yield in VRI cotton and grazed ryegrass pasture
    scenarios; and (b) investigate the field performance of automated VRI strategies
    for cotton and ryegrass that aim to maximise yield, as well as improve irrigation
    water use, compared with standard grower practices and strategies based on filling
    the soil-water profile. Performance was based on crop development parameters,
    yield and irrigation water use indices. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Irrigation
    control strategies Four irrigation control strategies were selected for evaluation
    in the field. The strategies were implemented on the days the grower was irrigating
    as detailed below: • Uniform – Flat irrigation rate with no sprinkler flowrate
    alterations. This represented a standard commercial practice to irrigate the field
    uniformly with the irrigation application depth set by the grower on the irrigation
    machine control panel. • VRI from fixed map (‘VRI-Fixed’) – Fixed variable-rate
    irrigation map with variability based on apparent electrical conductivity or elevation
    maps (Fig. 1). This represented a standard VRI practice where irrigation depths
    were scaled depending on underlying variability (e.g. from apparent electrical
    conductivity or elevation map) between 70% and 100%. Download : Download high-res

    the legend is for vertical apparent electrical conductivity (dS/m); and (b) ryegrass
    in 2020/21 and 2021/22 where the legend is for the Topographic Wetness Index,
    red lines indicate paddock boundaries and maroon areas indicate presence of laneways.
    The grey circular outlines indicate the locations of the centre pivot irrigation
    machines which were 404 m long at the cotton sites and 280 m long at the ryegrass
    site. The uniform irrigation (‘Uniform’) plots are white, variable-rate irrigation
    using fixed map (‘VRI-Fixed’) plots are light grey, variable-rate irrigation using
    soil-water sensors (‘VRI-SW’) plots are dark grey and variable-rate irrigation
    using Model Predictive Control (‘VRI-MPC’) plots are black. • VRI from soil-water
    (SW) sensors (‘VRI-SW’) – Apply irrigation depths to replenish the soil-water
    profile. These were calculated as the difference between the soil-water content
    at field capacity and averaged soil water content over the three sensors. The
    drained upper limit was measured from infield soil sampling. • VRI from MPC maximising
    yield (‘VRI-MPC’) – The MPC strategy of McCarthy et al. (2014) was implemented
    to maximise predicted final yield. The model was parameterised from on-site weather
    data, soil properties and management information. The MPC strategy was implemented
    in VARIwise to compare the predicted yield at multiple irrigation depths ranging
    from 0 mm (i.e. no irrigation) to the flat rate irrigation depth of the irrigation
    machine (i.e. the irrigation depth configured during commercial operations). Yields
    were predicted with multiple irrigation depths at intervals of 5 mm in this range.
    For example, for an irrigation machine with flat rate irrigation depth of 15 mm,
    with four irrigation depths were simulated: 0, 5, 10 and 15 mm. The irrigation
    depths implemented were those that produced the highest predicted yield (lint
    yield for cotton and dry matter for perennial ryegrass). If two irrigation depths
    produced the same predicted yield, the lower irrigation depth was selected to
    be applied. This trial focussed on comparing the performance of the irrigation
    strategies to determine spatial application depths, rather than determining the
    timing of the irrigation events, as the trials were conducted on commercial farms
    where the timing was controlled by the grower. Further trials may involve using
    the strategies to irrigate based on soil moisture, environmental impacts, rainfall
    forecast and estimated grazing dates for pasture. VARIwise was updated from programmatic
    execution of the cotton model OZCOT (McCarthy et al., 2010) to APSIM version 7.10
    build r4200. This involved developing software to generate an APSIM simulation
    file containing the soil and management parameters, calling the APSIM executable,
    and then reading the generated APSIM output file. 2.2. Field site selection Trial
    sites selected were: (a) a seven-span centre pivot irrigated cotton field with
    a deep epicalcareous self-mulching black vertosol (Anon, 2022) over four seasons
    near Yargullen, Queensland, Australia; and (b) a five-span centre pivot irrigated
    perennial ryegrass pasture field with a deep red mesotrophic haplic ferrosol (Masters,
    2012) over two seasons near Elliott, Tasmania, Australia (Table 1). Some paddocks
    in the ryegrass site were on steep slopes that contained slump features or hummocky
    patterns due to vegetation clearance and subsequent mass movement (Moreton, 1999).

    and cocksfoot and some variation between paddocks in elevation (‘slump’ features)
    and weeds (dock clumps) The seven-span centre pivot used for four consecutive
    cotton seasons was towed between cotton fields each season. At the cotton site
    a flat rate application depth of 15 mm was applied until early vegetative growth
    ceased, and 30 mm depth was applied for the rest of the season, while the ryegrass
    machine had a flat rate application depth of 15 mm. The irrigation machine at
    the cotton site always irrigated in a clockwise direction, while the irrigation
    machine at the perennial ryegrass site irrigated in both clockwise and anti-clockwise
    directions, as it was part-circle. The VRI hardware on the cotton machine was
    Valley VRI-iS® (Anon, 2022) which enabled individual sprinkler control, whilst
    the VRI hardware on the ryegrass machine was Valley VRI zone control which enabled
    control of 30 zones along the machine. AgSense® (AgSense, 2017) was installed
    on both machines to enable remote control of the machines and upload of the VRI
    maps. In this trial, the system was implemented to only reduce irrigation application
    depths such that the uniform irrigation strategy would apply the highest irrigation
    depth. The accuracy of the angular position of the irrigation machine was verified
    by monitoring the application from test VRI maps over landmarks in the field (flags
    of the cotton site and laneways and fences for the ryegrass site), and the angle
    was offset as required. This was conducted for both directions of machine travel
    for the ryegrass site. The irrigation machine uniformity and VRI performance were
    verified in catch can trials for both irrigation machines. This field process
    was used to identify uniformity in irrigation along the machine, and ensure the
    VRI hardware (nozzles and speed control) were accurately applying irrigation depths,
    and these depths were consistent in each direction of machine travel for the ryegrass
    site. At the cotton site, grids of catch cans were installed at the centre of
    Spans 2–7 with three rows of five catch cans along the machine at 1.5 m spacing,
    following the methodology of O''Shaughnessy et al., (2013). At the ryegrass site,
    grids of catch cans were installed in Span 5 with two rows of 20 catch cans at
    1.7 m spacing parallel with the machine, and two rows of 31 catch cans at 1.7 m
    spacing perpendicular with the machine. Fixed VRI prescription maps were uploaded
    for the VRI application. For the cotton site, the root mean square error (RMSE)
    between prescribed and measured applied depths was 2.6 mm with an average applied
    irrigation depth of 28.0 mm, whilst for the ryegrass site the RMSE between prescribed
    and measured applied depths was 2.7 mm with an average applied depth of 12.3 mm.
    This is consistent with the reported performance of VRI systems (e.g. RMSE <3.0 mm,mm,
    O''Shaughnessy et al., 2013). The variability in soil types was assessed in each
    field to select locations for replicates of treatments across the fields (four
    in the cotton trials and five in the ryegrass trials). The cotton fields were
    surveyed using a DUALEM-1S that records electromagnetic responses (i.e. electrical
    conductivity) to 50 cm and 150 cm depths (Fig. 1). The average measured electrical
    conductivity differed for each cotton field, potentially because of a difference
    in soil-water content each time the survey was conducted. The ryegrass field was
    surveyed using elevation mapping to determine a Topographic Wetness Index where
    smaller indices indicated steeper slope and higher indices indicated areas with
    potential for runoff (Fig. 1). Plot locations in ryegrass trials were positioned
    between machine towers, were contained within a paddock without laneways, and
    were approximately homogeneous with minimal overland flow to ensure water infiltrated
    where it was applied. Soil cores were collected in the sampling locations with
    results in Table 2, Table 3 for cotton and ryegrass, respectively. At the cotton
    site, two replicates of samples were collected using a 35 mm diameter hydraulic
    soil sampling rig. The cores were divided into 30 cm sections to a 90 cm depth.
    At the ryegrass site, three replicates of samples were collected using a steel
    ring with 72.5 mm internal diameter and 61 mm height which was hammered into the
    profile at each depth. These samples were analysed to characterise parameters
    required for APSIM (bulk density, drained upper limit, lower limit, saturated
    water content) using predicted van Genuchten soil water retention curve parameters
    with RETC (Schaap et al., 2001) a retention curve development software that quantifies
    the hydraulic functions of unsaturated soils (Simunek et al., 2007). Soil water
    characteristics from the online soil database APSoil (www.apsim.info) were also
    obtained for comparison. The plant available water capacity was calculated for
    each sampling location (Table 2) as the difference between drained upper limit
    and crop lower limit (Wigginton et al., 2012). Soil texture was assessed using
    the hydrometer analysis method of Gee and Bauder (1986). Table 2. Soil properties

    measured in the vertical (0–50 cm) and horizontal (50–150 cm) orientations, respectively.

    the underlying soil variability maps to ground truth the soil differences. Electrical
    conductivity and Topogaphic Wetness Indices were extracted from the maps for the
    cotton and ryegrass sites, respectively. This involved averaging measurements
    within 15 m of each sampling location for comparison with soil properties at the
    same sampling location. From Table 2, for each cotton season, the higher electrical
    conductivity corresponded with higher plant available water capacity, silt and
    clay content, and lower sand content and bulk density. Therefore, the electrical
    conductivity map indicated variation in water holding capacity and soil texture.
    From Table 3, for the ryegrass site, the higher Topographic Wetness Index corresponded
    with higher plant available water capacity, slump features and clay content, and
    lower sand and silt content. Trial plots were assigned in each site and replicated
    with dimensions of size and spacing to ensure that the irrigation strategies were
    applied independently without overlap from adjacent management zones. The plots
    were positioned to align with the VRI management zones and areas irrigated with
    each strategy were at least 20 m wide and 30 m considering sprinkler throw distance.
    If the management zones were larger than 20 m wide, the plots were the width of
    the management zone. Higgins et al. (2016) recommended a minimum management zone
    size of 23 m for the Valley section control VRI system used at their ryegrass
    site. VRI prescription maps were generated following the xml file format required
    for AgSense, and uploaded on days of irrigation. The dates of irrigation events
    were determined by the onsite managers and growers. The irrigation events were
    occasionally stopped before the whole field was irrigated because of rainfall.
    This would have led to variations in irrigation applied depths between the replicates
    of the plots in the uniform irrigation plots. For the cotton sites, soil nitrate
    and ammonium nitrogen tests were conducted before the initial nitrogen application
    each season. The grower applied approximately 250 N kg/ha before planting and
    60 N kg/ha as a side-dressing before flowering. Nitrogen would not have been a
    limiting factor for the irrigation sites as the average nitrogen requirement for
    cotton over a season to achieve high yields is about 250 N kg/ha (Smith and Welsh,
    2018), with 60–70% applied upfront and 30–40% applied as a side dressing prior
    to flowering (Baird, 2022). 2.3. Data collection Weather data was collected at
    each site and season to provide minimum and maximum daily temperature, rainfall
    and solar radiation for APSIM simulations. Automatic weather stations (AWS) were
    installed at the sites (Environdata Weathermaster 2000 at the cotton site, and
    Environdata Weather Maestro with Middleton solar sensors at the ryegrass site).
    Weather data were obtained from the closest Australian Government’s Bureau of
    Meteorology (BoM through ftp://ftp.bom.gov.au/) weather station (Oakey Airport
    for cotton site, and Wynyard Airport for ryegrass site). Interpolated regional
    weather station datasets from ‘SILO’, a Queensland Government database containing
    continuous daily climate data for Australia since 1889 (through https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/),
    were obtained for comparison with the onsite AWS data. Table 4 provides a summary
    of the weather data from on-site weather stations. There were large variations
    in rainfall between the weather stations, as expected, which were caused by the
    large spatial variation in rainfall. The solar radiation was lower from the SILO
    station than the AWS and BoM, which would lead to underestimation of the daily
    crop water use and yield. The temperature was generally lower from the AWS than
    BoM. At both cotton and ryegrass sites, this may have been caused by the BoM stations
    being located at airports which have differences in land use compared with the
    farm sites and enclosed conditions leading to microclimates (Johnston, 2020).

    0.0 0.0 0.0 Soil moisture was monitored at the centre of the VRI-SW plots using
    soil-water sensors. At the cotton sites, ICT International MP406 standing wave
    sensors which have an accuracy of ± 1% (Anon, 2022) were installed at depths of
    30, 60 and 90 cm. At the ryegrass site, EnviroPro EP100GL-04 capacitance probes
    which have an accuracy of ± 2% (EnviroPro, 2022) were installed with sensors at
    10 cm intervals to 40 cm. The soil-water measurement at each depth was logged
    every 15 minutes throughout the season. The soil-water sensor data was calibrated
    using the approach of Pendergast and Hare (2007) by: (i) scaling the data such
    that the change in soil moisture matched the known irrigation depth applied; and
    (ii) adjusting the soil-water curve such that the maximum soil-water content measured
    equalled the soil field capacity. Manual plant measurements were collected in
    the VRI-SW plots of the cotton site to assess the model accuracy. These measurements
    were for the same five plants in the centre of each plot. Plant stand was assessed
    in each replicate after emergence, and canopy width and square, green boll and
    open boll counts were measured weekly. Yield was assessed in all plots at harvest
    from lint collected by hand from 1 m² in the centre of each plot. The lint was
    weighed and a cotton turnout percentage was 40% from the same cultivar in previous
    commercial gin operations. For the ryegrass sites, grazing dates were required
    to record harvesting events in APSIM. Grazing dates were manually recorded by
    observing pasture in images collected by oblique cameras in the VRI-SW and VRI-MPC
    plots of each replicate. In the 2021/22 season, the grazing events were verified
    using GPS trackers on the cattle at the ryegrass site. The plots were monitored
    weekly to compare in-season crop growth patterns between irrigation strategies.
    The centre of each ryegrass plot was assessed weekly using a C-Dax Pasture Meter
    pulled by a quadbike to measure the height of pasture swards and estimate dry
    matter yield. The calibration provided by the onsite field staff to convert pasture
    height from the C-Dax to dry matter is shown in Eq. 1. This calibration was conducted
    with a rising plate meter at the site. (1) The centre of each cotton plot was
    monitored weekly using a DJI Phantom 4 UAV to assess canopy cover and open bolls.
    The UAV mission was developed using Litchi software. Top view images were captured
    approximately 3 m from the ground while the UAV was hovering so there was no thrust
    or propeller wind on the crop canopy (Fig. 2). Image analysis algorithms were
    implemented to extract fractional canopy cover using plant segmentation (Kumar
    and Miklavcic, 2018) and open boll area that extracts ratio of white pixels to
    all pixels (Yeom et al., 2018). Download : Download high-res image (940KB) Download

    of in-season growth and boll development differences in irrigation strategies
    using segmented plant and open bolls. Black pixels in segmented images indicate
    presence of detected plant or open boll pixels. The image analysis outputs for
    canopy cover and open boll area were compared with the measured canopy width and
    open boll counts, respectively, to verify accuracy for indicating in-season crop
    growth (Fig. 3). The open boll area analysis was focussed on the images collected
    at defoliation as these would be most correlated with the open boll counts. There
    were very strong correlations between the measured canopy width and canopy cover
    detected by UAV image analysis (R²=0.897), and the measured open bolls and open
    boll area detected by UAV image analysis (R²=0.718). The lower coefficient of
    determination for open boll area was expected, as not all open bolls were visible
    from the top view of the plant. Download : Download high-res image (176KB) Download

    figure for all seasons. 2.4. Model and irrigation performance evaluation The accuracy
    of APSIM with weather and soil data from different sources was evaluated to confirm
    whether on or off-field data sources were required. In APSIM, the weather source
    was programmatically updated by referring the APSIM model to a text file containing
    the weather data from the specified source, while the soil data source was programmatically
    updated in the APSIM xml file used to run the model. No other parameters were
    varied for this evaluation. Potential weather sources compared include regional
    weather stations BoM and SILO and the on-site automatic weather station (AWS).
    Potential soil data sources include infield core samples and soil-water characteristics
    obtained from online database APSoil. APSIM outputs from parameterised simulations
    were compared with field measurements using coefficients of determination (R²)
    and root mean square error (RMSE). Cotton field measurements compared include
    square counts, green and open boll counts (per m²), canopy cover (%), soil moisture
    (mm) and lint yield (kg/ha), whilst ryegrass field measurements compared include
    height (mm), dry matter (kg DM/ha) and soil moisture (mm). For both crops, soil
    moisture measurements were obtained from the infield sensors. For cotton, canopy
    cover was obtained from the daily infield camera images, and square and boll counts
    and lint yield were obtained from manual measurements, whilst for ryegrass, height
    and dry matter were obtained from weekly-fortnightly C-Dax sensor data. The irrigation
    strategies were implemented for each whole ryegrass season, and from approximately
    40 days after sowing for each cotton season. The irrigation strategies were evaluated
    from measured end of season yield, total irrigation applied, irrigation water
    use index (IWUI), gross production water use index (GPWUI) and weekly crop growth
    features. Yield was interpreted as lint yield for cotton and dry matter yield
    for ryegrass. Irrigation applied was calculated from applied irrigation depths
    in the VRI maps. IWUI was calculated as the ratio between yield and total irrigation
    applied. GPWUI was calculated as the ratio between yield and total water used
    by the crop, which was the sum of the soil moisture change, effective irrigation
    applied and effective rainfall. The soil moisture change was the difference between
    the start and end simulated soil moisture over the season. Effective irrigation
    applied was calculated assuming 90% efficiency in the irrigation application (Smith
    et al., 2014). Multiple approaches are reported for calculating effective rainfall
    (e.g. Ali and Mubarak, 2017). For this application, effective rainfall was calculated
    from the rainfall recorded by the onsite automatic weather station, where for
    ryegrass, the first 2 mm and over 25 mm were ineffective, and for cotton, the
    first 3 mm was ineffective and only 70% of the remaining rainfall was effective.
    The percentage differences in irrigation applied, yield and IWUI were compared
    with the uniform and VRI (fixed) irrigation strategies. Variations over fields
    were evaluated using standard deviations. Ryegrass yield was assessed from the
    average daily dry matter growth and dry matter yield. The average daily dry matter
    growth was calculated from a weighted average of positive changes in biomass between
    C-Dax samples. The dry matter yield was calculated by multiplying the average
    daily dry matter growth with the number of days between the first and last C-Dax
    samples in the irrigation season (155 days in 2020/21 and 133 days in 2021/22).
    The weekly crop growth was assessed using the UAV for cotton and C-Dax for ryegrass
    to compare with changes in irrigation depths applied. The differences for each
    strategy in irrigation application depths, yield, IWUI and growth parameters,
    were also compared with the plant available water capacity, soil texture and/or
    elevation parameters (for ryegrass) to identify impacts from soil or slope properties
    on the performance in each field and season. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Prediction
    accuracy Table 5 presents the accuracy of APSIM for cotton simulation using weather
    and soil data from different sources. APSIM most accurately predicted lint yield
    using weather data from on-site AWS and soil data from infield soil cores, with
    R²= 0.733 and RMSE= 153.9 kg/ha using infield cores and R²= 0.749 and RMSE= 191.9 kg/ha
    using APSoil. Weather data source had a greater influence on simulation accuracy
    of lint yield than soil data source, with input from BoM being slightly more accurate
    than from SILO. From Table 3, the largest difference in weather parameters between
    weather data sources was for rainfall which may have caused this variation in
    simulation performance. Table 5. Prediction accuracy (coefficient of determination,

    lint yield and canopy cover, and least accurately predicted soil-water content
    and fruiting parameters across weather and soil data inputs. The low accuracies
    in soil-water content may have been caused by the model not accurately reflecting
    the differences in water use or evaporation due to the row configuration being
    1.5 m rather than 1 m which is generally used for Australian cotton. In addition,
    soil-water was measured daily and the model may have been unable to accurately
    reflect daily fluctuations as measured. The lower prediction accuracies for square
    and boll counts may have been caused the delay in the APSIM-simulated fruit development
    compared with the field measurements as reported in the literature. The soil texture
    information not being incorporated into APSIM may have contributed to inaccurate
    rate of soil-water extraction which led to differences in fruit development. However,
    APSIM may have represented soil texture information through the soil water related
    parameters. Table 6 presents the accuracy of APSIM for grazed ryegrass pasture
    simulation using weather and soil data from different sources to evaluate the
    most suitable data source for parameterisation. APSIM was most accurate using
    AWS or BoM weather data and soil core information, with accuracy of dry matter
    being R²= 0.336–0.355 and RMSE= 295.3–331.1 kg/ha using infield cores and R²= 0.353–0.364
    and RMSE= 301.1–336.4 kg/ha using APSoil. For ryegrass, soil data source had a
    greater influence on simulation accuracy than weather data source, with similar
    performance across the different weather stations. This contrasts with cotton
    simulations where weather data source was more influential than soil data source.
    This may be caused by less variation in weather measurements, particularly solar
    radiation, between weather stations for the ryegrass site compared with the cotton
    site. APSIM could more accurately simulate height and dry matter than soil moisture.

    predicted dry matter and height and least accurately predicted soil-water content
    across weather and soil data inputs. As for the cotton simulations, the low accuracies
    in predicted soil-water content may have been caused by the highly fluctuating
    nature of soil-water data over short time spans that is not well represented in
    the model. Overall, the coefficients of determination were lower for ryegrass
    simulations (overall highest R²=0.366) compared with cotton simulations. This
    may be caused by slight variations in accuracy around grazing events. 3.2. Irrigation
    strategy performance – cotton Table 7 and Fig. 4 compare the performance of the
    uniform irrigation and VRI strategies in field trials for cotton, whilst Fig.
    5 compares the irrigation applied by each strategy. During the 2018/19 season,
    the irrigation machine had insufficient system capacity to deliver the crop’s
    water requirements because of high temperatures and low rainfall. This led to
    the uniform irrigation strategy producing the highest yield in 2018/19. During
    the 2021/22 season, the crop yield was significantly lower because of two flood
    events and cooler temperatures, leading to similar performance across all strategies.
    Table 7. Average and standard deviation of yield of cotton, total irrigation applied,
    irrigation water use index, gross production water use index and maximum canopy
    cover and open boll area of irrigation strategies over each season. The strategies
    compared are uniform irrigation (‘Uniform’), variable-rate irrigation using fixed
    map (‘VRI-Fixed’), variable-rate irrigation using soil-water sensors (‘VRI-SW’)
    and variable-rate irrigation using Model Predictive Control (‘VRI-MPC’). The days
    after sowing that the maximum canopy cover and open boll area occurred are also
    shown. The average and standard deviation of these values over the four replicates
    are shown. The effective rainfall was 196, 229, 228 and 396 mm for the 2018/19,
    2019/20, 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons, respectively. Strategy Season Yield (kg/ha)

    produced 2.6 % more yield with 4.9 % less water. The difference in irrigation
    application between the Uniform and the VRI-Fixed plots was significant at the
    0.05 level. Overall, the strategies had a larger impact on irrigation applied
    rather than cotton yield. This suggests that with the water available, weather
    and management used from the trial site, the approximate maximum yield was achieved
    with all strategies. However, the VRI-MPC strategy reduced the irrigation applied
    to obtain this yield. This also indicates that the model optimisation used in
    VRI-MPC strategy can identify irrigation water savings without impacting yield.
    There is potential for different strategies to be applied depending on the market
    value of cotton and water. There is also potential for a similar model-based irrigation
    strategy to include consideration of environmental impacts. From Fig. 5, in all
    seasons, similar irrigation depths were applied by all strategies until flowering.
    In the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons, irrigation applications were reduced after
    80–100 days after sowing which was after peak bloom. Water stress during peak
    bloom to open bolls can cause young boll shedding but has less impact on yield
    than loss of early season bolls. In the 2018/19 and 2019/20 seasons, the VRI-MPC
    strategy also reduced irrigation applications at approximately 120 days after
    sowing, which coincided with boll opening. Less water applied during peak boll
    opening may hasten boll opening, improving defoliation and reducing regrowth leading
    to increased yield and fibre quality. From Table 7, the maximum cotton canopy
    cover and open boll area were similar across all strategies. There was less variation
    in the date of maximum boll area than maximum canopy cover. The VRI-Fixed strategy
    produced the highest maximum canopy cover which occurred slightly later than the
    other strategies. The VRI-SW strategy produced the highest maximum open boll area
    which occurred slightly later than the other irrigation strategies. Fig. 6, Fig.
    7 compare the irrigation, cotton lint yield and maximum canopy cover and open
    boll area in each plot and strategy with the plant available water content and
    silt content, respectively. These show the yield and maximum canopy cover and
    open boll area being positively correlated with the plant available water capacity
    and silt content. This is because silty soils hold the most available water to
    plants, and soils with higher capacity store water and enable extraction of water
    better by crops during dry growing seasons. No strong correlations were observed
    between irrigation, yield or cotton development and bulk density, sand or clay

    the accuracy of APSIM. In particular, the delay in the simulated physiological
    responses may have led to the irrigation strategy inaccurately assessing growth
    stage and corresponding irrigation requirement. In addition, APSIM did not consider
    soil texture which was found to be highly influential on yield. There is potential
    for improvements in the performance of model-based management decisions with further
    development of the crop and soil prediction components in APSIM. The benefit of
    MPC may be larger in fields with more variation in soil properties which could
    be verified in further trials. There is potential for further work to identify
    guidelines for field selection with sufficient variability to implement the system.
    3.3. Irrigation strategy performance - ryegrass Table 8 and Fig. 8 compare the
    performance of the uniform irrigation and VRI strategies in field trials for ryegrass,
    while Fig. 9 compares the irrigation applied by each strategy. From Table 8, the
    highest IWUI and GPWUI for ryegrass and lowest irrigation applied were achieved
    using the VRI-MPC approach, followed by VRI-SW, VRI-Fixed and uniform irrigation.
    From Fig. 8, compared with VRI-Fixed, VRI-MPC produced 8.5% more dry matter yield
    with 5.4% less water, VRI-SW produced 7.4% less dry matter yield with 2.9% more
    water and uniform irrigation produced 6.2% more yield with 14.4% more water. The
    VRI-MPC strategy resulted in the highest water use efficiency, whilst the uniform
    irrigation strategy applied the most water. Compared with uniform irrigation,
    VRI-MPC produced 9.0% more dry matter yield with 16.9% less water, VRI-SW produced
    9.2% less dry matter yield with 9.9% less water and VRI-Fixed produced 4.5% more
    dry matter yield with 12.4% less water. All VRI strategies increased yield and
    applied less water than the uniform strategy, and VRI-MPC and VRI-SW strategies
    produced the largest yield improvements. There was no statistical difference in
    irrigation or yield between the strategies. The difference in irrigation application
    between the Uniform and the VRI-Fixed plots was significant at the 0.05 level.

    2021/22 since: (c) start of irrigation season; and (d) grazing where there were
    no irrigation events after 36 days after grazing. The strategies compared are
    uniform irrigation (‘Uniform’), variable-rate irrigation using fixed map (‘VRI-Fixed’),
    variable-rate irrigation using soil-water sensors (‘VRI-SW’) and variable-rate
    irrigation using Model Predictive Control (‘VRI-MPC’). From Fig. 9, the uniform
    strategy applied more water across all pasture growth stages. The VRI strategies
    applied lower irrigation depths from up to 5 days after grazing, after which the
    VRI-MPC strategy applied slightly less water compared with the other VRI strategies.
    It is expected the water savings using VRI-MPC occurred because water applications
    were reduced to coincide with the lower ryegrass water requirement after grazing.
    This reduced irrigation application, while still meeting the pasture’s needs,
    may have led to less water saturation resulting in improved growth. It is also
    noted that the VRI-MPC could meet the crop’s water needs despite the lower accuracies
    of APSIM simulations of ryegrass yield compared with cotton lint yield. This indicates
    that the model could extract relative rather than absolute yield responses to
    different volume water. There were larger variations in responses between plots
    in the ryegrass than cotton trials. At the same time, the pasture grown slightly
    increased with higher Topographic Wetness Indices and slump features, potentially
    because in these locations the pasture was more protected which led to improved
    pasture cover. The pasture grown slightly decreased with higher sand and silt
    content, potentially because of the reduced water holding capacity of these soils
    which may have impacted the crop during dry periods of the season. However, thess
    trend were only slight because of low spatial variation in plant available water
    capacity between replicates. This suggests that the variations between plots were
    due to pasture compositions between paddocks (e.g. dock clumps) and/or slump features
    rather than water capacity. From Table 8, the highest dry matter yield was achieved
    using the VRI-MPC strategy, followed by VRI-SW, Uniform irrigation and VRI-Fixed.
    The uniform irrigation strategy had the highest average daily pasture growth rate,
    possibly caused by rapid growth after grazing from the higher irrigation depths,
    but then a reduction in growth caused by overwatering in later stages leading
    to reduced harvested herbage. The reported trial focussed on using the VRI techniques
    to adjust irrigation volumes on days of irrigation events at the commercial sites.
    There is potential for further productivity improvements if the strategies were
    applied to determine when to start irrigating, potentially based on soil moisture
    status, forecast rainfall and grazing events for pasture. In addition, the VRI-MPC
    strategy could be adapted to economic and environmental impact optimisation by
    linking with water, production costs, run-off or leaching parameters. The performance
    of MPC may have been limited by the accuracy of APSIM for predicting daily soil
    dynamics over short time spans. This may have influenced the ryegrass simulations
    more than the cotton simulations because of the shorter seasons. This is because
    the grazed pasture had a harvest event at each grazing which was optimised, whilst
    the cotton had only one harvest event and target for optimisation. In a commercial
    field implementation, the system may be limited by the need for daily grazing
    information. This would require either cattle trackers, infield pasture sensors
    or manual data input which are not standard in current systems. 4. Conclusions
    Field trials have been conducted over four cotton seasons and two perennial ryegrass
    seasons to evaluate the accuracy of the yield prediction of a biophysical model,
    and compare field performance of uniform and variable-rate irrigation strategies.
    The predicted yield from the biophysical crop model was most accurate using on-site
    weather data and soil core information with R² = 0.733 and RMSE = 153.9 kg/ha
    for cotton, and RMSE = 127.4 kg/ha for ryegrass for all season. From the cotton
    field trials, variable-rate irrigation strategies had a larger impact on irrigation
    applied rather than yield, with Model Predictive Control led to 4.9% more yield
    with 5.6% reduced water application compared with standard VRI. Water savings
    occurred through reduced water after peak bloom and/or open boll physiological
    stages. For grazed ryegrass, the Model Predictive Control strategy led to 8.5%
    more yield with 5.4% reduced water application compared with standard VRI, potentially
    caused by reduced application after grazing events. The performance of all strategies
    was affected by plant available water capacity for cotton and slope for ryegrass.
    There is potential for the strategy performance to improve with more accurate
    models for new varieties, soil texture and short time span dynamics (e.g. soil
    moisture). Further work includes evaluating the Model Predictive Control strategy
    with economic and/or environmental impact optimisation, controlling irrigation
    event timing, and under a broader range of soil properties and weather conditions
    to identify conditions that provide economic return using the strategy. Funding

  limitations: This paper reported field trials conducted over four cotton seasons
    and two perennial ryegrass seasons to evaluate the accuracy of the yield prediction
    of a biophysical model, and compare field performance of uniform and variable-rate
    irrigation strategies. The reported trial focussed on using the VRI techniques
    to adjust irrigation volumes on days of irrigation events at the commercial sites.
    There is potential for further productivity improvements if the strategies were
    applied to determine when to start irrigating, potentially based on soil moisture
    status, forecast rainfall and grazing events for pasture. In addition, the VRI-MPC
    strategy could be adapted to economic and environmental impact optimisation by
    linking with water, production costs, run-off or leaching parameters.

    12 Nov 2020 1 Introduction Global water consumption has increased at an unprecedented
    rate during the last century, with many countries turning to groundwater as either
    an additional or primary source of supply to meet growing agricultural and other
    sectoral demands (FAO, 2015; Famiglietti, 2014). In arid and semi-arid regions
    in particular, groundwater is routinely the major water source driving such expansions
    in irrigated agriculture (Siebert et al., 2010). Unfortunately, these expansions
    have come with a number of associated costs related to sustainability of aquifer
    systems, degrading water quality, and over-exploitation. Indeed, global monitoring
    efforts targeting major aquifer systems around the world have identified strong
    depletion trends (Wada et al., 2012; Famiglietti, 2014), making the prospect of
    meeting future water and food security demands even more challenging (Dalin et
    al., 2017). While these relatively recent estimates of groundwater depletion (Famiglietti
    et al., 2011; Voss et al, 2013; Rodell et al., 2018) have been obtained through
    satellite systems such as the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE;
    Tapley et al., 2004), their value as a monitoring and management tool is limited
    due to the coarse observation scale (Alley and Konikow, 2015; Miro and Famiglietti,
    2018). In order to provide the granularity of information needed to monitor groundwater
    abstractions at the field scale (∼50 ha), a combination of higher-resolution data
    and modeling is needed. Despite its extreme arid environment (Kenawy and McCabe,
    2016), Saudi Arabia has quite an extensive agricultural sector. Like most national
    efforts to monitor and manage agricultural water use, agencies in Saudi Arabia
    have relied on farmer surveys to estimate agricultural land and water extraction.
    In common with other national efforts, there is also a lack of regular and consistent
    field metering to provide measurements of agricultural water use. Nevertheless,
    historical estimates from early national studies indicate an agricultural extent
    of about 12 135 km2 in 2005, with associated water use of 21 billion cubic meters
    (BCM) within the kingdom (FAO, 2008a). While this may be relatively small compared
    to other national accounts (Döll and Siebert, 2002; FAO, 2008b; Wisser et al.,
    2008), agricultural water use in Saudi Arabia has been estimated to represent
    more than 80 % of the total national water consumption (FAO, 2008a; Chowdhury
    and Al-Zahrani, 2015). Indeed, it is thought that less than 20 % of the agricultural
    water use comes from renewable sources, with rain-fed agriculture present only
    in southwestern regions such as Jizan and Aseer. Local alluvial aquifers (e.g.,
    wadis) that are occasionally recharged during storm events provide another source
    of water that has been used for more traditional agriculture in Saudi Arabia (Missimer
    et al., 2012), but these do not represent a suitable source for large commercial-scale
    applications. The primary origin of water that has driven the dramatic expansion
    of irrigated agriculture in Saudi Arabia is non-renewable groundwater from deep
    fossil aquifer systems. Although agriculture has featured throughout the nation''s
    history, significant extraction from groundwater resources really only commenced
    during the 1970s, when subsidies directed towards increasing food security incentivized
    farmers (FAO, 2008a; Al-Rumkhani et al., 2004). These incentives, together with
    the relatively inexpensive access to diesel fuel required for extraction via pumping
    wells, combined to rapidly develop this sector of the economy. Center-pivot irrigation,
    where water is pumped from a well and sprayed using a rotating arm with nozzles,
    became the predominant method of irrigation nation-wide and is typically applied
    on a daily and continuous basis for prolonged periods. The rapid expansion in
    agricultural land use, especially from center-pivot irrigation fields, has thus
    rendered ground-survey-based monitoring impractical and increasingly unreliable.
    With regular coverage from Earth-observing satellites, remote sensing offers a
    capacity to monitor the Earth across a range of spatial and temporal scales (McCabe
    et al., 2017a). While moderate-resolution images (e.g., O∼250 m–1 km) have been
    used for observing processes such as evaporation (Mu et al., 2011), these techniques
    lack the capacity to delineate individual fields. Typical center-pivot fields
    with dimensions approaching 50 ha (800 m diameter) are generally densely vegetated,
    and crops with different growing seasons are often located adjacent to each other
    or even within the same field. In such a case, platforms such as the MODerate
    resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) would only capture a heterogeneous
    mix of vegetated and bare desert soil, let alone be able to differentiate between
    crops (Kustas et al., 2004; McCabe et al., 2006; Wardlow et al., 2007; Guindin-Garcia
    et al., 2012). Landsat 8 data, on the other hand, have a spatial resolution of
    30 m, allowing them to map individual fields with a revisit time of 16 d. Whether
    this temporal resolution is sufficient to capture the seasonality of different
    crops is certainly a question to be explored, although it should be noted that
    new satellite platforms such as Sentinel 2 (Drusch et al., 2012) and even CubeSats
    (McCabe et al., 2017b) provide a much higher orbital repeat cycle. Regardless,
    a satellite-driven framework would provide a singular opportunity for improving
    agricultural water management and monitoring (Brocca et al., 2018; Jalilvand et
    al., 2019). Quantifying crop water use via evaporation is a fundamental step towards
    estimating agricultural water use. In the absence of within-field flow metering
    or a surface flux monitoring system (Baldocchi et al., 2001), a remote-sensing-based
    approach to estimate land surface evaporation provides a suitable alternative.
    A comprehensive body of research has been dedicated to developing and intercomparing
    techniques (Kalma et al., 2008; Fisher et al., 2017) and exploring the application
    of these from local (Allen et al., 2007; Anderson et al., 2011) to regional and
    global scales (Miralles et al., 2016; McCabe et al., 2016). Most of these models
    combine available meteorological data with satellite-based vegetation retrievals
    or with vegetation and thermal infrared measurements to estimate the surface evaporation.
    For example, Song et al. (2016) and Li et al. (2017) used the two-source energy
    balance (TSEB; Norman et al. 1995) and surface energy balance (SEBS; Su, 2002)
    models, respectively, to map evaporation from semi-arid irrigated sites. Aragón
    et al. (2018) applied the Priestley–Taylor JPL (PT-JPL; Fisher et al., 2008) model
    with ultra-high-resolution vegetation data from CubeSats to map evaporation over
    irrigated fields. Anderson et al. (2012) demonstrated and discussed the ability
    of Landsat thermal imagery (e.g., with TSEB) to monitor evaporation and its application
    for water resource management. TSEB has also been used as part of the Atmosphere-Land
    Exchange Inverse (ALEXI; Anderson et al., 1997) model and its associated disaggregation
    scheme (DisALEXI; Norman et al., 2003) to generate high-resolution maps of agricultural
    water use. As it currently stands, there remains no single retrieval technique
    that has been identified as the best-performing evaporation model across all biomes
    and scales (Ershadi et al., 2014; Michel et al., 2016; McCabe et al., 2016), with
    model selection ultimately based on past performance and expert knowledge. While
    there have been sustained efforts towards estimating agricultural water use through
    evaporation modeling, there have been relatively few studies aimed at retrieving
    actual irrigation amounts for monitoring purposes. For example, Folhes et al.
    (2009) combined known irrigation values from 40 selected fields with satellite-based
    evaporation estimates in order to derive an irrigation efficiency. They then used
    this information to estimate the total water use in a semi-arid irrigated agricultural
    region in Brazil. Santos et al. (2008) integrated satellite-based evaporation
    estimates into a water balance model in order to provide improved irrigation guidelines
    to reduce water use. Another approach that has been explored is to use satellite-based
    evaporation estimates to constrain the irrigation input into a land surface model
    (LSM) by way of inverse modeling. Droogers et al. (2010) used synthetic model
    runs to determine whether this approach could be employed to retrieve irrigation
    amounts. Importantly, they explored the effects of satellite retrieval frequency
    on the estimated irrigation, demonstrating that while RMSE increased with larger
    observation intervals, Landsat data could potentially be used for this purpose.
    Huang et al. (2015) used a similar approach by assimilating temporal variations
    of MODIS-derived Leaf Area Index (LAI) and evaporation data into the soil water
    atmosphere plant (SWAP) model to derive irrigation depth. They found that assimilating
    both variables resulted in the least relative error of the resulting crop yields
    compared to official county statistics. López (2018) also used evaporation estimates
    and an LSM in an inverse modeling approach to retrieve irrigation rates from 40
    center-pivot fields, demonstrating the potential for obtaining seasonal irrigation
    rates for individual fields. More recently, Jalilvand et al. (2019) explored the
    possibility of using an approach designed to retrieve rainfall from satellite-based
    soil moisture data in order to infer irrigation amounts, expanding upon the work
    of Brocca et al. (2018). However, this approach is limited by the scale at which
    soil moisture can currently be retrieved (e.g., 0.25∘) as well as by the uncertainty
    of the techniques used to obtain the actual rainfall amounts that need to be removed
    (Jalilvand et al., 2019). To date, the potential of coupling a land surface model
    with satellite estimates (via evaporation) has yet to be fully exploited for operational
    field-scale irrigation monitoring. While estimates of evaporation represent the
    main loss of water from agricultural systems (through soil evaporation and vegetation
    transpiration), losses through deep drainage are not generally accounted for in
    evaporation models. LSMs can account for such hydrology, simulating the exchanges
    of water and heat between the land surface and the atmosphere and providing a
    detailed water balance that is beyond standard evaporation process models. One
    simple method to incorporate irrigation into an LSM is to directly add the irrigation
    rate to the rainfall component (e.g., Ozdogan et al., 2010), but this requires
    the values of the irrigation rates to be known (or assumed) a priori. However,
    satellite-based evaporation estimates could be used to constrain the irrigation
    value needed to reproduce the observed water use. In this study, the idea of combining
    satellite-based evaporation estimates with LSM simulations to indirectly obtain
    irrigation rates, and consequently groundwater extraction amounts, was applied
    over two distinct irrigated agricultural regions. As in the soil moisture-based
    approach of Brocca et al. (2018) and Jalilvand et al. (2019), rainfall is not
    explicitly considered in this water balance. The application of this inverse modeling
    approach can be simplified in arid environments, as irrigation rates are typically
    not modified when short-duration sporadic rainfall events occur, since the amounts
    that can be captured by the crops are limited. Indeed, over the growth cycle of
    a typical crop, the applied irrigation volume is at least an order of magnitude
    greater than any rainfall component (Kenawy and McCabe, 2016). The present study
    details the first large-scale implementation of this framework, focusing on quantifying
    groundwater abstractions for a single year to illustrate the feasibility of larger-scale
    and longer-term implementation. The integrated satellite data and modeling approach
    is designed to map the extent and distribution of fields, estimate crop water
    use, and infer groundwater abstraction rates. To do this, the framework exploits
    an object-based image classification technique (Johansen et al., 2010) for mapping
    individual fields, where one field is defined as the area covered by a single
    center-pivot rotating arm. The latter is an important aspect that was required
    in order to apply the data-modeling framework in parallel, i.e., to effectively
    obtain irrigation rates over a large region containing thousands of fields. Naturally,
    this allows the display and aggregation of groundwater abstraction rates and other
    relevant information over arbitrary delineations, such as management zones or
    farms, and represents a novel aspect of this work. To date, there have been no
    comparable efforts attempting the retrieval of individual irrigation rates for
    a large number (thousands) of fields, and thus this study represents an effort
    that moves closer towards big-data-driven operational monitoring of individual
    fields. Our framework provides a novel water accounting system for agricultural
    management in Saudi Arabia and offers an independent benchmark for water loss
    over a region that is routinely omitted in global (and even regional-scale) evaporation
    products (Mu et al., 2011; Miralles et al., 2011). Covering one of the largest
    agricultural regions in Saudi Arabia, the study provides a benchmark against which
    the impact of water policy changes can be evaluated in the future and demonstrates
    the potential of broader-scale application elsewhere. 2 Description of study regions
    The study focused on two different agricultural areas in Saudi Arabia, which enabled
    an evaluation of the proposed groundwater abstraction estimation framework (Sect.
    3) and subsequent larger-scale application to be explored. To evaluate the performance
    at the individual field scale, the strategy was first applied to 40 center pivots
    located on a small farm (Sect. 2.1) southeast of Riyadh. For this site, available
    irrigation data for the year 2015 were obtained directly from the farm management
    (Sect. 3.5) based on in-house field reporting. To assess the large-scale application
    of our groundwater abstraction estimation strategy, it was then applied to thousands
    of center-pivot fields in Al Jawf (Sect. 2.2), one of the largest agricultural
    regions in Saudi Arabia. With no individual field data available for comparison
    on this region, the total groundwater abstraction estimates were compared with
    some previous regional-scale estimates. 2.1 The Tawdeehiya experimental farm The
    Tawdeehiya farm (Fig. 1) is a medium-sized commercial agricultural facility that
    consists of approximately 40 center-pivot fields, each with an extent of approximately
    50 ha, n.b., within the average field size of those found in the larger Al Jawf
    region (see Fig. 1 and Sect. 4.2). The farm is located about 200 km southeast
    of Riyadh and exhibits similar environmental and climatic conditions to the Al
    Jawf study area (i.e., low rainfall and high daytime summer temperatures exceeding
    40 ∘C). Crops grown in this farm during 2015 included a range of vegetables, alfalfa,
    Rhodes grass, and maize, with a total area under cultivation of more than 2000 ha.
    While one Landsat tile (path/row 165/43) is enough to observe the entire farm,
    the adjacent tile (164/43) offers additional coverage of fields on the eastern
    side of the farm. Additional details of the site and data can be found in López
    (2018) as well as some related remote-sensing-based studies that provide further
    description (Aragón et al., 2018; Houborg and McCabe, 2018b). Figure 1Location
    of the two study regions. Left: the Tawdeehiya farm in Al Kharj (southeast of
    Riyadh). A false color Landsat 8 image (9 June 2015) is shown to highlight active
    center-pivot fields over the desert environment. Right: the Al Jawf agricultural
    region in the northwest of Saudi Arabia spans two Landsat 8 tiles. Two false color
    images are shown: 9 June 2015 for path/row 172/39 (left) and 19 June 2015 for
    path/row 171/39 (right). Center-pivot fields are densely packed and largely uniform
    in size in the main area (30∘ N, 38.25∘ E), while in other areas they are sparser
    and less uniform (for example, the image on the right). 2.2 The Al Jawf agricultural
    region The Al Jawf province is located in the north of Saudi Arabia (29∘–32∘ N,
    36∘–41∘ E) and is one of the top five agricultural regions in terms of both agricultural
    area and water use (FAO, 2013; Chowdhury et al., 2016). Most of the agricultural
    area is managed by large commercial farms, the majority employing center-pivot
    irrigation (Fig. 1). The irrigated area in Al Jawf has increased significantly
    over the last 3 decades, from being practically non-existent in the 1980s to covering
    more than 1500 km2 by 2005 (FAO, 2013), with more than 90 % estimated to be irrigated
    using groundwater delivered via center-pivot systems (Al-Rhumikhani and Din, 2004).
    The Saudi Statistical Yearbook (SSYB, 2010) reported a decline in acreage in Al
    Jawf from 1600 km2 in 2007 to 1200 km2 in 2009. However, newer versions of this
    report (SSYB, 2013) do not offer a regional disaggregation of agricultural area.
    Under the Ninth Development Plan from the Ministry of Economy and Planning (MEP,
    2010), it was reported that there was a 2.5 % annual decrease in agricultural
    water use in the kingdom, from 17.5 BCM in 2004 to 15.4 BCM in 2009, which was
    attributed to regulations to rationalize water consumption and cultivation of
    water-intensive crops (MEP, 2010). In Al Jawf, the same report forecasts a continued
    decline in groundwater abstraction from 1.5 BCM in 2009 to 1.2 BCM in 2014. Although
    other sources include more recent estimates for the total agricultural water demand
    in the kingdom (MEWA, 2019), these are not available on a regional basis. The
    majority of crops grown in Al Jawf in 2009 (SSYB, 2010) were cereals (60 % in
    area, with wheat being the most predominant), followed by fruits (24 %, consisting
    of dates, grapes, and citrus), fodder (11 %, mostly clover), and vegetables (4 %,
    mostly potatoes and tomatoes). Unfortunately, the same level of detail is not
    available from more recent reports (SSYB, 2013), but we note that cereal production
    is no longer supported to any significant extent. One of the challenges for attributing
    water use to crop type in this region is the lack of available ground-based land
    cover data. Al-Rhumikhani and Din (2004) used a dataset from one agricultural
    site in 2001 that cultivated alfalfa, potatoes, tomato, and wheat to classify
    crops in Al Jawf from Landsat imagery. To our knowledge, no other recent crop
    classification efforts have been made in the region. Although rain-fed agriculture
    represents about 10 % of the cultivated area within Saudi Arabia, this is limited
    to the southwestern regions of Jizan, Baha, Aseer, and Makkah (FAO, 2008a). Annual
    rainfall values in Al Jawf are, as in most of Saudi Arabia, less than 50 mm yr−1
    (Kenawy et al., 2016), and consequently there is insufficient water to support
    rain-fed irrigation. Indeed, agriculture in Al Jawf is entirely supported by groundwater
    extraction (Al-Rhumikhani and Din, 2004; MEP, 2010; Chowdhury et al., 2016). In
    2015, average wind speeds in this region were relatively low (less than 5 m s−1)
    throughout the year but reached maximum speeds up to 16 m s−1 (the meteorological
    data used in this study are described in Sect. 3.4.3). Average temperatures ranged
    from about 10 ∘C in January and December up to 32 ∘C in July and August and were
    consistently higher than 25 ∘C from May to October. Maximum temperatures of up
    to 44 ∘C occurred in August, while the minimum temperature reached was −1 ∘C and
    occurred in January. Relative humidity ranged from about 25 % from May to September
    and around 55 % during January, November, and December. 3 Pivot-based groundwater
    abstraction framework A key output of this study is the estimation of groundwater
    abstraction from thousands of individually delineated center-pivot fields. At
    the core of the methodology is the indirect estimation of the volume of irrigation
    that needs to be applied to a field in order to reproduce the satellite-observed
    crop water use. Figure 2 presents a schematic of the methodology with the necessary
    inputs, intermediate processes, and relevant outputs. In this approach, the first
    step is an automated processing framework (Sect. 3.1) that performs Landsat image
    acquisition, cloud and cloud shadow detection, regionally optimized atmospheric
    correction, and finally higher-level product generation of albedo, Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), LAI, and land surface temperature (LST). This
    procedure was based on recent efforts in combining machine-learning techniques
    with physically based model inversion results (Houborg and McCabe, 2018a), which
    have made the automatic estimation of these parameters over large arid regions
    possible. The data obtained in this crucial first step were then directed into
    both the evaporation and land surface models (see Sect. 3.4). The next step uses
    a geographical object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) procedure (Johansen et al.,
    2010) to detect and map individual center-pivot fields based on NDVI data (Sect.
    3.2). Meteorological data were retrieved from a reanalysis performed using the
    Advanced Research WRF (ARW; Skamarock et al., 2008) model over the Arabian Peninsula.
    Details of this dataset are described in Langodan et al. (2014), Viswanadhapalli
    et al. (2017, 2019), and Dasari et al. (2019), so only a brief description is
    provided in Sect. 3.4.3. To provide needed estimates of crop water use (via evaporation),
    the TSEB model (see Sect. 3.4.1) was run over two Landsat tiles in each study
    region (172/39 and 171/39 for Al Jawf; 165/43 and 164/43 for the Tawdeehiya farm)
    using the WRF data together with the Landsat-based vegetation and biophysical
    parameters (at 30 m spatial resolution and at a 16 d frequency) obtained in the
    first step. Figure 2Flow chart outlining the main inputs (dashed-dotted), processes
    (solid), and outputs (dashed) of the groundwater abstraction monitoring framework.
    Download Up to this point, all processes involved use of the entire Landsat tiles.
    The following steps in the framework were performed independently over each separately
    delineated center-pivot field (herein simply referred to as “field”). These operations
    were performed in parallel using hundreds of CPUs on a high-performance computing
    cluster (see https://www.hpc.kaust.edu.sa/ibex, last access: 10 January 2020,
    for further details). To do this, data were first extracted for each field using
    Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) tools. Next, LAI spatio-temporal information
    was used to detect the seasonal activity of each field. This included the possibility
    that one field actually contained two different crops with different growing periods,
    a practice that was recognized by analysing the images, as well as on-site observations.
    Details of the automated detection capability developed within this framework
    are provided in Sect. 3.3. After this analysis, a “field temporal use index” was
    computed, defined here as the percentage of time that the field was used to grow
    a crop within the year of study. This index, referred to as field use (%), is
    required to compare irrigation practices among different farms and/or regions.
    The Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange model (CABLE; Kowalczyk et al.,
    2006; Sect. 3.4.2) was used as an offline land surface hydrology model to indirectly
    estimate the irrigation rate applied over each season, for any particular field,
    for the study year of 2015. As rainfall is limited in this region, implementing
    CABLE simulations without an irrigation component leads to an almost complete
    lack of evaporation signal. TSEB information on evaporation was used to infer
    the irrigation amount that would be needed in CABLE to reproduce the estimated
    evaporation. In this sense, TSEB improves the estimation of CABLE by providing
    the missing irrigation component in this region. The procedure is done as follows:
    for each active season identified in a field, an ensemble of CABLE runs was performed
    under different irrigation amounts. Denoting Esat as the remotely sensed estimates
    of evaporation (obtained using TSEB; see Sect. 3.4.1) and ELSM as the output evaporation
    from the CABLE land surface model, a cost function that was proportional to the
    difference between ELSM and Esat was accumulated during each available observation
    of Esat: where H is an operator that maps the land surface model space X(ti) to
    the observation space Y(ti); n.b., the satellite estimates need not be available
    at the same resolution as the model or might be incomplete (e.g., due to the presence
    of clouds). López (2018) used a stochastic optimization approach (Spall, 1998)
    that iteratively updates the irrigation rates to minimize the objective function.
    That method required tuning of two parameters that control the speed at which
    the update occurs, a process that was initially performed by trial and error.
    Importantly, the number of fields that were evaluated in López (2018) was significantly
    smaller (40) than the present study (more than 5000). Unfortunately, the transferability
    of the optimization parameters to a larger number of fields was limited, as the
    optimized irrigation rates either diverged or the values did not update at all
    due to improper scaling of the gradient of the cost function. Under the rationale
    that the search space is relatively small, i.e., by constraining the irrigation
    rate to realistic values (e.g., 1.1–3 times the observed evaporation rates), a
    simple exhaustive search (brute force) was implemented in this study. This removed
    the need for a trial-and-error approach for optimization of parameters as well
    as the need to compute a gradient (which requires at least two model runs for
    each step), i.e., trading off precision for improvements in computation. The latter
    was a key consideration to efficiently apply this methodology to thousands of
    fields. At the end of the process, the irrigation rate that produced the most
    accurate evaporation estimate (compared to TSEB estimates) was the one used to
    calculate the total groundwater abstraction over the field. The irrigation rate
    (Irr) applied to CABLE is the actual amount of water reaching the ground, and
    it was assumed to be a constant fraction (1−Closs) of groundwater abstraction
    (Gw) as in Eq. (2): The loss term was calculated using the following rationale.
    The amount of water pumped out of the well (Gw) is sprayed by nozzles positioned
    on a rotating arm irrigating the field. A fraction of this water (Closs) is lost
    due to wind carrying moisture out of the field to the desert soil or to other
    fields. Under similar conditions (hyper-arid irrigated fields), this fraction
    has been estimated to be between 12 % and 20 % (Steiner et al., 1983; Sadeghi
    et al., 2017). Without frequent on-site measurement of this loss value across
    the whole field, it is not possible to incorporate it directly into the model.
    In this study, the aim was to provide an estimate of the irrigation amount (Irr)
    as an approximation of the groundwater abstraction (Gw). Efforts to translate
    this into actual groundwater abstraction on a regular basis for large areas are
    necessary but will require ground observations or further model improvement. For
    this study, a conservative value (in time and throughout the fields) of 20 % (Closs=0.2),
    and thus a factor of 1.25, i.e., , was used to scale irrigation to abstracted
    groundwater. In terms of the overall field water balance, the approach employed
    in this study was simplified by the fact that rainfall in this region does not
    represent a significant source that can be used by crops. As such, the rainfall
    component in CABLE was replaced by the irrigation rate that is being estimated
    in the iterative procedure. The validity of this assumption and thus the applicability
    of this model are certainly reasonable in most of the major agricultural regions
    of Saudi Arabia, with the exception of regions with significant rain-fed agriculture,
    such as those in Jizan and Baha. However, even in those regions, the annual rainfall
    rarely exceeds 300 mm and occurs within a relatively well-defined period of the
    year. For example, coffee production is an important economic activity in Jizan,
    occurring mainly at high altitudes within the Fifa mountains, and farmers there
    regularly require groundwater as an additional source to meet the water needs
    of coffee trees, especially during extended periods of drought (Al-Abdulkader
    et al., 2018; Sayed et al., 2019). In other regions, the contribution of rainfall
    might be proportionally higher and thus need to be removed before obtaining the
    irrigated amount. 3.1 Vegetation indices and biophysical parameters retrieved
    from satellite data NDVI is a widely used metric describing surface greenness
    (Tucker, 1979; Beck et al., 2011) and is computed herein directly from the Landsat
    near-infrared (851–879 nm) and red bands (636–673 nm). Prior to computing NDVI,
    Landsat images for the year 2015 (between 20 and 22 scenes were acquired for each
    of the tiles used in this study) were atmospherically corrected to surface reflectances
    using a regionally optimized Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the
    Solar Spectrum (6S; Kotchenova et al., 2006)-based approach (Houborg and McCabe,
    2017). Cloud and cloud shadow detection was performed using the Function of mask
    (Fmask) algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2012). Another biophysical indicator for
    vegetation growth monitoring is the LAI, defined as the projected area of leaves
    over a unit of land area. LAI is a key parameter that has been used to improve
    water and energy flux modeling over agricultural fields (Aragón et al., 2018).
    However, as opposed to NDVI, LAI cannot be computed directly from satellite data.
    While simple relationships between LAI and other vegetation indices (including
    NDVI) have been used (Turner et al., 1999; Colombo et al., 2003; Fan et al., 2009),
    the applicability of such relationships for regions other than where they were
    developed (using ground measurements) has been brought into question (Wang et
    al., 2005; Atzberger et al., 2015; Kang et al., 2016). Houborg and McCabe (2018a)
    used a machine-learning approach to develop relationships between LAI and several
    vegetation indices over a desert agriculture site in Saudi Arabia (Tawdeehiya
    farm; Sect. 2.1). They used a combination of in situ measurements and physically
    based model inversion results as a hybrid training dataset, with retrievals showing
    good performance compared to the in situ LAI measurements. In our study, a coupled
    leaf-canopy model (PROSAIL) produced forward runs over a wide range of realizations,
    and these were used as a training dataset to develop estimates of LAI using a
    random forest (RF) approach. The inversion of the forward runs needed to derive
    LAI was based on the REGularized canopy reflectance model (REGFLEC; Houborg et
    al., 2015), which has been shown to be suitable for largely automated applications
    (Houborg and McCabe, 2016). The configuration of REGFLEC in this study followed
    Houborg and McCabe (2018a) but using only the model inversion results (e.g., PROSAIL)
    due to a lack of in situ LAI data in the larger region of Al Jawf. PROSAIL combines
    a leaf optical properties model (PROSPECT; Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990) with a
    canopy bidirectional reflectance model (SAIL; Verhoef, 1984) and has been used
    to retrieve LAI for a wide range of crops (Jacquemoud et al., 2009; Vohland et
    al., 2010; Rivera et al., 2013). The RF ensemble-based decision tree technique
    was used to learn the complex non-linear associations between the spectral data
    and the target biophysical property (i.e., LAI). In this study, the “ranger” RF
    package in R was used for model training and prediction. This package is optimized
    for efficient memory usage with large and high-dimensional datasets, a critical
    aspect for working with Landsat tile domains. Figure 3 shows the resulting NDVI
    and LAI maps for one Landsat tile (path/row 172/39) on 23 April 2015, demonstrating
    the high contrast between the bare desert soil and irrigated agriculture and the
    within-field variability that can be observed at these high resolutions. Most
    of the agricultural fields in Al Jawf (95 %) were located within this Landsat
    domain; however, the adjoining path/row 171/39 was also included to give a complete
    account of agriculture in Al Jawf (see Fig. 1). The Tawdeehiya farm is located
    on the eastern edge of path/row 165/43 and hence some fields can also be observed
    by path/row 164/43. Figure 3Example of the full Landsat tile (path/row 172/39)
    NDVI (left) and LAI (right) estimation, demonstrating the footprint from center-pivot-irrigated
    fields in this region (high contrast with the bare desert soil). 3.2 Semi-automatic
    delineation of center-pivot irrigation fields using Landsat imagery A GEOBIA approach
    was developed in the eCognition Developer 9.3 software to delineate individual
    fields for the study sites. As seasonal crop cycles prevent all active fields
    within a specific year from being detected at a single point in time, the full
    Landsat image time series was used for 2015. Two layers based on the annual image
    time series (20–22 images) were produced: (1) a maximum NDVI layer and (2) a minimum
    panchromatic layer. NDVI was first calculated for all images in the time series,
    and the maximum NDVI value for each pixel in the time series was assigned to the
    final maximum NDVI layer. Similarly, all the panchromatic images within the time
    series were used to produce a single panchromatic layer, representing the minimum
    value within the time series. To detect all active fields in 2015, a multi-threshold
    segmentation was applied to cluster all pixels with a maximum NDVI value of >0.20
    together and classify these objects as “vegetation”. Unclassified pixels surrounded
    by “vegetation” objects were first merged with the respective “vegetation” objects,
    and these objects were then classified as center pivots if the object length was
    ≤1200 m, length / width ratio ≤1.1, and elliptic fit ≥0.90. The length∕width ratio
    and elliptic fit features were used to identify round objects, while the length
    feature ensured that neighboring fields merged together were not initially classified
    as fields before they had been separated into objects, representing an individual
    field. The minimum panchromatic layer was subjected to an edge-extraction Lee
    sigma filter. This filtering process produced another layer, highlighting bright
    edges in the imagery, i.e., areas with large contrast in panchromatic pixel values,
    such as the edges between center pivots and surrounding sandy soil. Separating
    adjoining fields required several processing steps to first identify pixels with
    high edge-filtering values and the use of region-growing algorithms to grow these
    high-value edge-filtered pixels into neighboring pixels with lower values. This
    allowed most of the adjoined fields to be separated. Some refining of the delineation
    results was then performed to ensure the fields were extended to their perimeter,
    which was done using a number of object shape criteria and an NDVI threshold of
    0.20. While most of the fields (approximately 85 %) were correctly classified
    at this stage, there were still several half or “Pac-man”-shaped fields remaining
    to be classified. These remaining fields were manually delineated, followed by
    an object-growing and object-shrinking process to refine the manually delineated
    field edges. 3.3 Irrigation activity detection using LAI LAI time series were
    used as an indication of vegetation growth to estimate periods of active irrigation,
    which were then used to constrain the start and end dates of CABLE model runs.
    However, upon visual analysis of multiple fields within the study regions, we
    observed that fields are often divided into two halves, each with its own crop
    and potentially different irrigation amounts. Therefore, prior to obtaining a
    representative LAI time series for analysis, it was necessary to further delineate
    the two sections of the field if it was indeed divided. To achieve this, the k-means
    clustering algorithm was employed. In general, the idea of clustering is to identify
    groups of objects that are similar to one another and different from those in
    other groups (Jain and Dubes, 1988; Jain et al., 1999). The k-means algorithm
    (MacQueen, 1967) is a partitioning clustering method (i.e., there is no overlap
    between the groups) that has been widely used in remote sensing studies. For this
    purpose, let X={xi}, be a set of n-dimensional points to be clustered into a set
    of K clusters C={ck}, (in our study, K is set to 2). The squared error between
    the mean of each cluster and the points within the cluster can be computed by
    Eq. (3): The aim of the K-means algorithm is to minimize the sum of J(ck) for
    . Four main steps are followed iteratively to minimize this sum: (1) select K
    points as the initial centroids, (2) form K clusters by assigning all points to
    the closest centroid, (3) re-compute the centroid of each cluster, and (4) repeat
    (2) and (3) until there is no significant change in the centroids within consecutive
    iterations. To speed up convergence, the “k-means ” (Arthur and Vassilvitskii,
    2007) algorithm was used to select the initial cluster centers. A more detailed
    description of the k-means algorithm is provided by Jain (2010). Prior to applying
    the clustering algorithm, it was more efficient to extract the features to represent
    the characteristics of the time series. To do this, the discrete wavelet transform
    (DWT) was employed, which is an efficient procedure used to separate deterministic
    from stochastic components of a signal (Heil and Walnut, 1989). The DWT has been
    used to analyze satellite images in the context of noise reduction as well as
    change detection (Zhu and Yang, 1998; Wang and Paliwal, 2006; Martínez and Gilabert,
    2009). The main idea behind application of the DWT is that the signal is represented
    as a combination of approximation and detail coefficients (Heil and Walnut, 1989):
    where AJ(t) and Dj(t) are, respectively, the approximation and detail coefficients,
    and J is the decomposition level. The detail coefficients are generated by projecting
    the original signal x(t) using a set of wavelet basis functions defined as , ,
    where k is the shift parameter and is the base function. In other words, the detailed
    signal Dj(t) at level j is generated by the detailed signal Dj(t) at scale j and
    can be obtained by applying a high-pass filter (g) on the original and scaled
    signals. In a similar way, the approximation coefficients are generated by projecting
    the signal onto a set of orthonormal scaling functions given by , . Similarly,
    the scale signals are computed by applying a low-pass filter (h) on the original
    and scaled signals. Gao and Yan (2010) provide a more detailed description of
    the DWT. In our study, LAI time series were first transformed into DWT components
    by level-1 decomposition of the basis function “haar”. Then, to establish whether
    the field is divided into two parts or not, two threshold values were used. Both
    values relate to the “cosine similarity” (Eq. 5), which measures the similarity
    among pixels of the same field: where Ai and Bi are components of vectors A and
    B, respectively (i.e., one vector represents the time series of one pixel). The
    cosine similarity values of two vectors range from −1 to 1. The closer the value
    approaches 1, the closer the direction of the two vectors. On the other hand,
    the closer the value gets to −1, the more the two vectors go in the opposite direction.
    For each pair of pixels, the cosine similarity of DWT components of time series
    was first computed, and then the time series of the two pixels were determined
    to be similar or not by using a threshold of the cosine similarity (tcs). The
    second threshold used was based on the fraction of pairs where the value of cosine
    similarity was higher than tcs, i.e., defining nTcs as the number of pair values
    with similarity higher than tcs and N as the total number of pairs; the ratio
    to use as the second threshold was . Upon an exploratory analysis based on a representative
    sample of a few hundred fields, the appropriate values for these two thresholds
    were determined as tcs=0.75 and tpcs=0.8. Hence, a field was classified as partitioned
    when the tpcs value was exceeded and was thus further processed by the k-means
    algorithm for clustering. Next, a number of representative pixels within the field
    (or sub-field if partitioned) were selected and used to determine the start and
    end dates for each season within the land surface hydrology model runs. The pixels
    were selected based on a criterion that the daily LAI values, obtained by linearly
    interpolating from the 16 d LAI time series, were consistently within the interquartile
    range (e.g., 25 % and 75 %). This was done to remove the influence of outlier
    pixels. Finally, the mean value over these pixels each day was taken as the mean
    LAI time series (mLAI). Using this mean LAI time series, crop growing seasons
    were then selected based on the start and end dates of the first season, defined
    by the period where mLAI is higher than a threshold tLAI (in m2 m−2). A value
    of provided a reasonable delineation of growing seasons for a large number of
    fields. Furthermore, to remove noise that could result from the interpolation
    of the LAI time series, only seasons that were at least 30 d in duration were
    processed, which is the approximate length of the shortest crop growing seasons
    observed for alfalfa crops and also ensures that it includes at least one Landsat
    scene. Upon analysis of the shape of mLAI, in terms of the number of peaks as
    a measure of the oscillatory nature of the time series, fields were then classified
    into two possible categories: seasonal or perennial. A “seasonal” field had clearly
    defined growing cycles that were separated by inactive periods. Figure 4a shows
    a field that was active for only 3 months, with clear start and end dates obtained
    by computing the dates at which the mean seasonal pixels in the LAI time series
    intersected with 0.3 m2 m−2. Perennial fields had vegetation patterns that reflected
    long periods (up to year-round) of vegetation above the LAI threshold but with
    intermittent cut and re-growth periods. This is typical of a field growing alfalfa
    or grass, where the production is continuous throughout most of the year. An example
    of a perennial field is shown in Fig. 4b. This field was active from April to
    December 2015 but with intermittent cut/re-growth cycles. For this second category
    of crops, it was not straightforward to select clear periods for retrieving irrigation,
    due to Landsat''s temporal resolution of 16 d. To ensure that there would be enough
    satellite evaporation estimates for constraining the land surface model runs,
    the process for these types of pivots was performed on a quarterly basis. Figure
    4Example of two types of crops identified for this study based on an LAI threshold
    of 0.3 m2 m−2. (a) Images of the six scenes when the field was identified as active
    are shown on top, which correspond to the six dates marked as diamonds inside
    the dashed lines in the bottom plot. The season start and end dates (10 February
    and 21 May) correspond to dates when the mean LAI crosses the threshold of 0.3 m2 m−2.
    (b) This particular field was inactive during the first 3 months of the year,
    followed by large LAI oscillations, indicating repeat cut/re-growth activities.
    Landsat scenes for this field are shown on top, increasing in date to the right
    and bottom, while the dates are marked as diamonds in the LAI time series plot.
    Download 3.4 Models and ancillary data 3.4.1 Satellite evaporation estimation
    using TSEB The TSEB model (Norman et al., 1995) was used to obtain the satellite-based
    estimates of evaporation that constrain the land surface hydrology model runs.
    TSEB was selected based on its proven utility in the estimation of evaporation
    over irrigated crops in semi-arid and arid regions (e.g., Colaizzi et al., 2012;
    Zhuang and Wu, 2015; Nieto et al., 2019). TSEB is based on the energy balance
    ( ), where Rn is the net radiation reaching the crop canopy and soil surface,
    H is the sensible heat flux (i.e., the energy transformed to heat and released
    into the atmosphere), G is the soil heat flux, and LE is the latent heat flux
    of evaporation, which is the key link between the energy and water balance equations.
    In TSEB, the LE term is obtained as a residual of the energy balance equation
    and along with H and Rn is divided into separate components for the soil and canopy
    at each pixel. The model for sensible heat flux in TSEB is based on a network
    of temperature gradient–transport resistances between the air, canopy boundary
    layer, canopy, and soil. In this study, the “in-series” resistance scheme (Shuttleworth,
    1985) for the sensible heat flux was used. The in-series scheme was selected as
    it has been demonstrated to estimate heat fluxes of densely vegetated areas more
    accurately than the parallel or patch schemes (Kustas et al., 1999; Colaizzi et
    al., 2012). In center-pivot fields, the crops are not structured in rows, and
    at maturity the canopy covers the entirety of the soil surface (with the exception
    of the beam tracks of the pivot), and thus the area was considered to be densely
    vegetated. The in-series approach accounts for the coupling between soil and canopy
    heat fluxes. The sensible heat flux is defined below for canopy (Hc) and soil
    (Hs) in Eq. (6): where Tc is the canopy temperature, Ts is the soil temperature,
    TAC is the temperature of the canopy-air space, rx is the canopy boundary-layer
    resistance, rs is the resistance of air between the soil surface and source height,
    ρ is the density of water, and cp is the specific heat of water. The calculation
    of the two resistances rs and rx was done following the methods of Sauer et al.
    (1995) and McNaughton (1995), respectively. The LE fluxes for the canopy and soil
    are determined based on initial estimates for Tc and Ts, which are then iteratively
    refined until LEs is positive (or after a maximum number of iterations). An initial
    estimate of LEc (canopy latent heat flux) is required in order to obtain the values
    of Tc and Ts. This is done by using the Priestley–Taylor equation and then solving
    for Tc: where Ta is the air temperature from the WRF data and rah is the aerodynamic
    resistance to heat transport. The value of rah depends on atmospheric stability
    parameters, wind speed, and measurement heights for temperature and wind speed,
    which is set to WRF''s near-surface level (2 m in this study). The aerodynamic
    roughness length for heat and momentum transport were defined as and , where the
    (i.e., ln (z0M∕z0H)) parameter was set to 2 as in Norman et al. (1995). Without
    detailed in situ information describing land cover and crop development stage,
    canopy height was prescribed to a constant value of 0.3 m, a reasonable assumption
    based on the typical crops such as alfalfa, wheat, and vegetables being grown
    in this region. The net radiation is computed by Eq. (8): where α is the albedo
    (computed from Landsat data as in Liang, 2001), Sdn and Ldn are the incoming shortwave
    and longwave radiation components (derived from WRF data), is the surface emissivity
    with fφ described in Eq. (11), εveg=0.98 and εgrd=0.93 are the canopy and soil
    emissivities, respectively, and σb is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. The net radiation
    that reaches the canopy Rnc is modeled as where φz is the solar zenith angle.
    This simple parameterization for Rnc was developed based on the Cupid model for
    dense canopies as described in Zhuang and Wu (2015). The initial soil temperature
    is then given by Eq. (10) and is updated iteratively as described in Norman et
    al. (1995): In this study, the radiometric temperature (Tr) is the LST derived
    from Landsat''s thermal infrared sensor data, with atmospheric correction of the
    at-sensor brightness surface temperature performed using MODTRAN (Berk et al.,
    2005; Rosas et al., 2017). In this process, atmospheric profile data from MERRA2
    (Gelaro et al., 2017) were used and emissivity fields were based on the methods
    of French et al. (2005) using estimates of vegetation fraction (Anderson et al.,
    2007). A data mining sharpener (DMS) technique based on regression tree analysis
    (Gao et al., 2012) was used to perform spatial sharpening of LST to 30 m resolution.
    The vegetation fraction at the sensor view angle φ (0 for Landsat) is The vegetation
    fraction assumes a spherical leaf angle distribution, which is a good approximation
    for general plant canopies, spreading the leaf area uniformly across solar zenith
    angles (Campbell and Norman, 1998). For Saudi Arabia, at the Landsat overpass
    time, the extension coefficient Kb is approximately equal to 0.5. For pixels with
    low LAI values (LAI<1), i.e., where the soil component is dominant, the canopy
    component was omitted by applying a simpler, one-source energy balance (OSEB).
    In the OSEB, the sensible heat flux is estimated by using a one-layer circuit
    network. Although this can lead to a sharp transition in evapotranspiration (ET)
    for values around LAI=1, this was done in order to reduce the influence of high
    bare soil evaporation values using TSEB, which would cause an overestimation of
    water use in fallow or inactive fields and where the surface can be modeled as
    a single layer. In OSEB, H is simply given by The soil heat flux (G) model of
    Santanello and Friedl (2003) was used in this study. This model includes a simple
    relation describing the covariation between daytime ground heat flux and net radiation
    (Rn): where A represents the maximum ratio of G∕Rns, B is a constant that minimizes
    the divergence of the equation to that of measured values, and t is the number
    of seconds between the satellite overpass time and solar noon. The values of A
    and B were left as in the original parameterization, with A=0.31 and B=74 000 s.
    The use of TSEB to estimate evaporation has been validated in similar arid regions
    (Colaizzi et al., 2012; Zhuang and Wu, 2015; Nieto et al., 2019). With a lack
    of sufficient ground-based measurements in our study regions, we did not attempt
    to provide a new validation dataset for TSEB. However, we used data from one eddy-covariance
    tower installed in 2016 on a center-pivot-irrigated field in Tawdeehiya farm (Fig.
    1; Sect. 2.1), which showed good estimation for operational purposes in this data-limited
    region (Fig. S1 in the Supplement). 3.4.2 CABLE CABLE was used as a stand-alone
    (offline) land surface hydrology model to estimate irrigation rates based on the
    evaporation estimates obtained with TSEB. CABLE was selected given its application
    in other dryland environments and as the land surface scheme for regional and
    global climate models (Zhang et al., 2009; Haverd et al., 2013; Hirsch et al.,
    2019), but the approach described in this study is not limited to any particular
    scheme. Energy and water interactions are modeled in CABLE across six layers of
    soil (with thickness from the surface to bottom layer of 2.2, 5.8, 15.4, 40.9,
    108.5, and 287.2 cm), the canopy layer, and the atmosphere. Similar to TSEB, the
    heat fluxes in CABLE are modeled by a network of aerodynamic resistances. The
    sensible and latent heat fluxes are also partitioned into a flux from the soil
    to the canopy and from the canopy to the atmosphere. However, in CABLE, the canopy
    layer is further divided (two-leaf canopy model) between sunlit and shaded leaves,
    using an approach developed by Leuning et al. (1995). Another feature of CABLE
    is that the canopy transpiration as well as root water extraction both depend
    on whether the canopy is wet, dry, or partially wet (Lai and Katul, 2000). A coupling
    between the root water extraction and stomatal conductance was added by Haverd
    et al. (2016), enabling a “root shut-down” that tests for over-extraction in each
    soil layer, which would otherwise result in high water use efficiencies under
    drying conditions. Hydraulic redistribution (Ryel et al., 2002) was also added
    to CABLE in order to improve the representation of the water flux between soil
    layers. This component involves redistribution of water by roots and depends on
    the root density and the rhizosphere conductivity. This term was added as an additional
    term in Richard''s equation, which describes the soil moisture (θ) flux and is
    based on the one-dimensional conservation equation and Darcy''s law: where K is
    the hydraulic conductivity, D is diffusivity, and Fw(z) includes water lost due
    to soil evaporation and root extraction or water gained or lost in a layer by
    hydraulic redistribution (Ryel et al., 2002). In this study, CABLE version 2.3.4
    was used. This version of CABLE is freely available at http://trac.nci.org.au/trac/cable
    (last access: 20 November 2019) after registration. Detailed descriptions of the
    model are available in Kowalzcyk et al. (2006), Wang et al. (2011), Kowalzcyk
    (2013), and Haverd et al. (2016). To support the generality of our approach, the
    offline global simulations in this application of CABLE use look-up tables for
    soil and vegetation classification. By default, CABLE includes a soil classification
    table derived from Zobler (1999) and vegetation types defined by the International
    Geosphere and Biosphere Program (Loveland et al., 2000). CABLE auxiliary files
    also include monthly LAI data derived from MODIS data averaged from 2002 to 2009
    (Gao et al., 2008; Ganguly et al., 2008), as specified in the CABLE user guide
    (Srbinovsky et al., 2012). In this study, the default soil texture was used and
    assumed to be uniform across the study region (the soil corresponds to sandy loam
    soil in the irrigated regions explored here). However, LAI data in this study
    were derived as described in Sect. 3.1, as the coarse-scale MODIS-derived dataset
    is not representative of the actual crop-growing patterns. The possibility of
    different crops and crop rotation in the same field within the year was considered,
    as explained in Sect. 3.3, using the clustering technique based on LAI data. One
    limitation of the framework is the lack of a crop identification module, which
    would improve the definition of vegetation characteristics. Here, vegetation parameters
    were assigned based on the default CABLE cropland vegetation class, as currently
    no crop identification strategy was implemented other than the delineation and
    clustering technique. Finally, CABLE was forced with hourly meteorological data
    from a WRF reanalysis (Sect. 3.4.3). Under basin-scale water budget studies, a
    spin-up of the model is generally required to achieve a realistic initial soil
    moisture state. This is normally done by running a representative year of meteorological
    data several times or running several years prior to the start of the study period
    (Ajami et al., 2014, 2015) and assuming that the spin-up period is representative
    of the “normal” conditions. This assumption does not hold in our simulations because
    we are aiming to retrieve irrigated amounts, which could change from one year
    to the other as different crops are grown. Therefore, this posed a challenge for
    representing the initial state of irrigated agricultural fields at the start of
    our simulations. In our study, the spin-up for each field was performed as follows:
    after estimation of the irrigation amount for one season, the model is run using
    this irrigation amount, and the final state is saved as the initial state for
    the next iterative process. However, the problem still lies with the spin-up of
    the first period. To solve this, we started by first running the groundwater abstraction
    strategy for a 3-month period prior to the start of the study period, thus generating
    an initial state for the actual period of study. 3.4.3 Meteorological data The
    meteorological data required to drive the TSEB and CABLE models were derived from
    a numerical weather prediction simulation of the Weather Research and Forecasting
    (WRF) model, specifically, the Advanced Research WRF (ARW; Skamarock et al., 2008)
    model version 3.7.0. The regional simulation, performed over the entire Arabian
    Peninsula and neighboring regions, used dynamical downscaling of global analysis
    data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dynamical
    downscaling refers to a method to generate a higher spatial and temporal resolution
    regional climatic model by assimilating available regional datasets and initialized
    from coarser reanalysis data (Giorgi and Mearns, 1991; Wilby and Wigley, 1997;
    Viswanadhapalli et al., 2017, 2019; Dasari et al., 2019). This is typically done
    by nesting a high spatial resolution domain within a coarser domain. Observational
    data used in this regional climate model included quality-controlled data from
    the NCEP Atmospheric Data Project (ADP), such as surface station data, wind data
    from the Quick Scatterometer (QSCAT) and WindSat and ASCAT scatterometers, and
    atmospheric motion vectors from geostationary satellites. The methodology, model
    parameters, and model physics followed a similar approach to that described in
    Jiang et al. (2009), Langodan et al. (2014, 2016), Viswanadhapalli et al. (2017),
    and Dasari et al. (2019). The simulations were performed over a 5-year period
    (2011–2015) at an hourly time step and with the internal model domain with a spatial
    resolution of 3 km covering the Arabian Peninsula. 3.5 Evaluation of model performance
    To evaluate the modeling approach across thousands of individual field sites would
    require the provision of an extensive dataset of on-ground water use measurements,
    ideally collected from numerous pivots and over an extensive period of time. However,
    detailed abstraction, irrigation, and crop water use data in such quantities rarely
    exist in even the most well-monitored sites, let alone for developing country
    applications. Although we could not collate comprehensive and spatially distributed
    evaluation data for the Al Jawf study region, we utilize data from the smaller-scale
    Tawdeehiya farm to provide farm-reported data for the year 2015. The available
    evaluation data consisted of monthly values of total irrigation application time
    (in hours) and a single value of flow rate in gallons per minute for each field.
    To convert to groundwater abstraction (GWA), the flow rate was multiplied by the
    number of minutes irrigated in each month and converted to units of millions of
    cubic meters (MCM). The model''s performance to quantify field groundwater abstraction
    was evaluated using the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, given by Eq. (15): where O
    represents the observations (farm data) and S our estimations, both in MCM for
    the year 2015. NSE values can be negative (from −∞) or a value from 0 to 1, where
    1 represents a perfect match between estimates and observations and a value of
    0 shows that the estimates are as good as the mean of the observed values ( ).
    4 Results The strategy as described in this study (Sect. 3) was applied to two
    study regions. Section 4.1 presents the results of GWA of 40 fields at the Tawdeehiya
    farm and evaluates the performance based on farm data for these fields. Next,
    Sect. 4.2 and 4.3 focus on the larger-scale application of the methodology across
    the Al Jawf region, demonstrating the framework''s capability in terms of information
    it can reveal at a regional level. First, Sect. 4.2 explores patterns of irrigation
    activity, e.g., for how much time these fields are active throughout the year;
    whether there is a preference for seasonal or perennial types of fields (as defined
    in Sect. 3.3); and the spatial distribution of yearly groundwater abstraction
    and field use within the region. Finally, Sect. 4.3 demonstrates the range of
    monthly to annual water use in the region, i.e., irrigation rates and derived
    groundwater abstraction values. A comparison of evaporation estimated by CABLE
    (with inferred irrigation based on our approach) and TSEB is shown in Fig. S2
    in the Supplement. As a result of this work, a first of its kind spatially distributed
    map of field-based groundwater abstraction was created as a key output of the
    monitoring strategy. 4.1 Pivot-based framework performance at the Tawdeehiya farm
    In order to evaluate the performance of the approach, the pivot-based water accounting
    methodology (described in Sect. 3) was first applied to the 40 active fields at
    the Tawdeehiya farm (Fig. 1). Seventeen fields were identified as following a
    perennial planting pattern, with yearly field use values around 86 %. Twenty-three
    fields were classified as seasonal fields, with average field use vales of 57 %.
    The performance evaluation was based on a comparison of the estimated yearly groundwater
    abstraction rates and farm-based data reports of flow rates delivered to the irrigation
    booms. Upon examination of the estimated monthly irrigation rates from the seasonal
    fields, a systematic mismatch was observed during periods where fields were identified
    as being “inactive”. From knowledge of the local farm-based operations, it is
    not unusual that fields required a significant amount of pre-planting irrigation
    (likely to reduce the salt load in the soil and in preparation for seeding), but
    during this period, the LAI would be below the threshold used to define an “active”
    season (Sect. 3.3), and thus water accounting in the model would not be triggered.
    Lowering the LAI threshold would not help in identifying this pre-planting stage,
    because it is already essentially zero when vegetation is not present. Reducing
    it further to arbitrarily low values would defeat the purpose of seasonal activity
    detection. As an alternative, the season can be extended to include a pre-planting
    stage of a pre-defined amount of time. However, this parameter would depend on
    a variety of factors, such as the type of crop being planted and other farm management
    practices. Without a sufficient amount of data with which to derive strategies
    to account for irrigation during this pre-planting stage, the groundwater abstraction
    values for seasonal fields in this study can only be interpreted as a lower bound.
    Figure 5 presents the groundwater abstraction estimates calculated for the center-pivot
    fields compared against farm-reported flow rates (multiplied by irrigation duration).
    As can be seen, there is a significant amount of variability between the pivot
    results, largely a consequence of seasonal versus perennial fields. However, for
    a number of the seasonal fields, there was a clear and defined underestimate of
    groundwater abstraction relative to the reported flow-rate extrapolations (identified
    by the gray dots). Indeed, 11 fields had an unrealistically long pre-planting
    stage of more than 2 months, based on the reported flow-rate data. It is extremely
    unlikely that these reflect real farming practices and are almost certainly a
    result of local reporting errors. Taking into account the uncertainty of the farm
    data for these 11 pivots, the yearly groundwater abstraction values were re-calculated
    to estimate only when fields were determined to be active, i.e., based on the
    satellite-derived LAI values. Using this assessment threshold, the NSE value was
    0.38 with an R2 of 0.61 for all 40 pivot fields, with a linear regression described
    by the blue line in Fig. 5 (slope of 0.62, intercept of 0.51). For reference,
    the 11 gray dots (not included in the NSE calculation) present the original data
    that include the “inactive” period, i.e., with the long pre-planting stage. Figure
    5Comparison of annual groundwater estimates to farm data. The blue line shows
    the regression based on the black and green dots (adjusted to include only active
    seasons for 11 seasonal fields). The gray points show the original farm data with
    long pre-planting stages for those same 11 seasonal fields. Download Further exploring
    the relationship between monthly groundwater abstraction and its relation to the
    level of a field''s activity (based on LAI data), Fig. 6 shows the results for
    two different fields and their spatial and temporal changes in LAI. The first
    field (Fig. 6c and d) presents a 6-month period when LAI is above the defined
    threshold (0.3 m2 m−2) and a long inactive period (August–December) which would
    be designated as low-to-no estimated irrigation. For the period of activity (January–July,
    excluding a planting stage in March) the agreement between reported flow rate
    and estimated groundwater abstraction is good. However, for the August–December
    period, when the LAI imagery shows low LAI to bare soil conditions, the farm data
    report a varying amount of irrigation based on the fixed flow rate records. For
    the second field (Fig. 6e and f), the monthly variations in groundwater abstraction
    are in good agreement with farm data for the majority of the year, with the exception
    of a 3-month period (January to March), which was identified as inactive, but
    where farm-reported data again indicate irrigation is active. Figure 6Estimated
    groundwater abstraction in million cubic meters (MCM) for two fields in the Tawdeehiya
    farm along with a comparison based on available flow rates from farm data. (a,
    b) show the spatial maps of LAI data (m2 m−2) using the methodology described
    in Sect. 3.1. Two fields from two different periods are delineated either in black
    (corresponding to c, d) or white (e, f). (c, e) show a spatiotemporal map of LAI
    for the two fields, while (d, f) show a comparison of groundwater abstraction
    obtained using the framework described in Sect. 3 and available farm data. The
    field marked with black is one of the 11 fields identified as having a large abstraction
    discrepancy; i.e., the farm data indicate ongoing periods of irrigation, while
    the LAI data indicate inactivity. Download While undertaking a field-based assessment
    of the strategy is obviously an area of importance, it is tempered by the reality
    of using data that is often of less than “high quality”. However, by combining
    independent observation available from satellite platforms, we can further discriminate
    these spurious data points, and refine the assessment process. These types of
    analyses highlight the need for forensic assessment of ground-based (and satellite)
    observations and the value of establishing consistency between available datasets
    (McCabe et al., 2008; López et al., 2017). Indeed, in this case, the proposed
    model–satellite fusion approach correctly identifies errors in “ground-based”
    data and provides a clear example of the observation and monitoring challenge
    in this and many other regions. 4.2 Irrigation activity detection in Al Jawf Given
    the quite different application scale of the pivot-based groundwater estimation
    approach when performed over the Al Jawf region (compared to Tawdeehiya), overview
    and analysis of intermediate processing steps are warranted. The object-based
    image analysis approach (see Sect. 3.2) produced a map containing 5567 individually
    delineated fields, covering a total area of 2494 km2, i.e., more than 60 % higher
    than previous reporting (FAO, 2013). The majority of the delineated fields (81 %)
    were identified as “perennial” (see Fig. 4b), with less than 1.5 % recognized
    as inactive using the LAI-based approach. Examples of these delineations are shown
    in Fig. 1 (top; outlined in black). On average, the sizes of the fields were 45 ha
    (0.45 km2), with no observable distinction in acreage between perennial and seasonal
    fields. Figure 7 displays the distribution of size (in hectares) for all fields
    (first quartile of 25.54 ha, third quartile of 66.05 ha). The field sizes do not
    follow a normal distribution but form clusters (e.g., around 82, 67, and 50 ha;
    see inset in Fig. 7), which is expected as center-pivot irrigation systems are
    installed in standard sizes. The largest fields (e.g., >60 ha) were concentrated
    around the central region (30∘ N, 38.25∘ E), which is where the largest commercial-scale
    farms operate. In more remote areas to the north and east of Al Jawf, a larger
    variation of smaller fields can be identified that are likely owned by smaller,
    independent farms. Figure 7Spatial distribution and statistics of individual field
    areas. Clusters of large fields (those >60 ha) can be found in the main agricultural
    zone (30∘ N, 38.25∘ E), corresponding to the location of several large commercial-scale
    farms. The figure''s inset on the left shows a violin plot of the field sizes
    in Al Jawf: in a given field area (y axis), the plot outline (in black) is wider
    when there is a larger number of fields of that given size. The black horizontal
    lines inside the plot show the first quartile, median, and third quartile, while
    the black diamond shows the average value. The background in the inset shows colored
    dots (horizontal positions are given randomly for visualization purposes) to distinguish
    perennial and seasonal fields. Download The annual field use (%), calculated as
    the ratio between the number of active days and total days in the year, is shown
    in Fig. 8. As expected, perennial fields have a higher field use (average, first
    and third quartiles: 86 %, 77 % and 100 %, respectively) than seasonal fields
    (average, first and third quartiles: 35 %, 24 % and 46 %, respectively). In contrast
    with the area distribution (Fig. 7), the majority of fields had high annual field
    values, meaning they were active throughout most of the year, independent of their
    location (small or large commercial-scale farms). This is consistent with the
    fact that most fields were identified as perennial, and indicates a preference
    towards forage crops (i.e., grass and alfalfa) during this year, regardless of
    the scale of operation. Figure 8Spatial distribution and statistics of the annual
    field use, defined as the ratio of active irrigation days to total number of days
    in the year. Most fields had high values of annual use (>80 %). The inset on the
    left shows the distribution of annual field use among all fields in the region
    as a violin plot. The two black diamonds show the average value grouped by the
    type of field (seasonal or perennial), while the black square represents the average
    of all fields. The background shows colored dots (horizontal positions are given
    randomly for visualization purposes) to distinguish perennial and seasonal fields.
    Download The field use (%) was also calculated on a monthly basis as the ratio
    of number of days active to number of days in each month in Fig. 9, with the distribution
    of values among all fields shown as violin plots for perennial and seasonal fields
    separately. Most perennial fields were consistently active throughout the year
    (monthly field use above 80 %), but for any given month there were fields that
    were inactive (i.e., with less than 5 % monthly use). For example, the largest
    number of inactive perennial fields was 958 in January, followed by 913 in December,
    with the smallest being 353 in March. Because perennial fields are, by definition,
    expected to be active throughout most of the year, the violin plots (Fig. 9) show
    a consistent pattern with a wide top (i.e., high y values) and otherwise thin
    body. Seasonal fields on the other hand, had a more variable range of irrigation
    activity. Most fields were irrigated from February to May, with more than 46 %
    of the fields with a monthly field use value larger than 50 %. This was followed
    by July and August, where more than 33 % of fields exceeded the 50 % monthly field
    use. Irrigation activities were lowest during January, June and from September
    to December, where less than 30 % of fields had monthly field use values larger
    than 50 %. This suggests an overall trend for seasonal crops either being used
    for one growing season (from February to May), or two seasons (February to May
    and July to August). Figure 9Monthly center-pivot field use for perennial (a)
    and seasonal (b) fields. The black squares show the average monthly field use
    (% days irrigated during each month). A larger width at a given level of use indicates
    a larger number of fields. Horizontal lines show the 25 %, 50 % (median), and
    75 % quantiles. Download 4.3 Monthly and annual irrigation and groundwater abstraction
    The irrigation rates for each field were determined using the inverse modeling
    approach, i.e., running the CABLE model iteratively to determine the rate needed
    to reproduce the TSEB-based satellite-observed crop water use (see Sect. 3). Figure
    10 presents the derived monthly irrigation estimates. Results were generally higher
    for perennial fields compared to seasonal fields, with average values ranging
    from 122 to 152 mm in January, February, and from October to December and the
    highest values occurring from April to September (210–234 mm). The monthly maximum
    value for a perennial field was 407 mm and occurred in August. Average yearly
    irrigation values for the perennial fields reached 2007 mm, with first and third
    quartile values of 1347 and 2799 mm for the fields within the Al Jawf region.
    Average monthly irrigation values for seasonal fields were lowest in November
    and December (50–58 mm) and highest during March to April (165–171 mm), indicating
    the production of spring crops. A second peak, indicative of a second season (as
    mentioned in the monthly field use analysis), was also evident in the monthly
    irrigation profile, with average values of 145 and 131 mm in July and August,
    following a lower value of 109 mm in June. The highest monthly irrigation value
    for a seasonal field was 348 mm during July. On average, seasonal fields had a
    total annual irrigation value of 675 mm, with the first and third quartiles at
    299 and 1041 mm. Figure 10Monthly irrigation statistics (mm) for perennial (a)
    and seasonal (b) fields. The black squares show the average values of monthly
    irrigation among the same types of fields in the region (4509 perennial fields;
    974 seasonal fields). The violin plots show the distribution of monthly irrigation
    values, which range from 0 (no irrigation) up to 406 mm month−1 (i.e., 13.5 mm d−1).
    Horizontal lines show the 25 %, 50 % (median), and 75 % quantiles. Download The
    irrigation values were converted to groundwater abstraction by multiplying monthly
    irrigation amount by the area covered by pixels that were actively irrigated in
    each season, and then by a factor of 1.25 (i.e., ) to account for irrigation losses
    (as described in Sect. 3). Figure 11 shows a map of annual groundwater abstraction
    in the region, in MCM. The total annual groundwater consumption in 2015 for the
    Al Jawf agricultural region was estimated at 5.56 billion cubic meters (BCM).
    Clusters of fields with high abstraction (>3 MCM yr−1; shown in blue) are mostly
    centered in the main commercial region (38.25∘ E, 30∘ N), where fields were generally
    larger (>60 ha; Fig. 7) and irrigated throughout most of the year (>80 %; Fig.
    8). The first quartile, mean and third quartile of groundwater abstraction among
    all fields in Al Jawf was 0.24, 1.0 and 1.59 MCM, respectively. The corresponding
    values were larger, as expected, for perennial fields: 0.43, 1.16, and 1.74 MCM,
    and significantly smaller for seasonal fields: 0.06, 0.34, and 0.5 MCM. Figure
    11Map of annual groundwater abstraction in MCM for the Al Jawf agricultural region.
    Values were obtained for individual fields, as seen in the examples shown at top
    featuring one zone with high levels of abstractions (top-left) and another zone
    with a smaller density of fields and lower values of abstraction (top-right).
    The background shows the same Landsat 8 images as in Fig. 2. 5 Discussion 5.1 Historical
    efforts towards quantifying agriculture water use Quantifying the water use of
    individual agricultural fields has been a research objective for many decades
    (Jackson et al., 1987; Rana and Katerji, 2000; Kalma et al., 2008), with numerous
    efforts directed towards improving process-based modeling approaches to characterize
    the evaporative response (Ershadi et al., 2014; Anderson et al., 2018; McCabe
    et al., 2019). The challenge has often been related to the availability of data
    with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to observe fields in adequate
    detail as well as a lack of knowledge on the dynamics of the underlying crop type
    and condition. In addition, most efforts have tended to focus on monitoring for
    relatively short periods, or perhaps a single growing season, rather than providing
    a basis for long-term retrospective or ongoing monitoring. Recent developments
    exploiting constellations of CubeSats have enabled high resolution in space and
    time retrievals of key land surface parameters (Houborg and McCabe, 2018c), providing
    enhanced estimates of crop water use and crop development and overcoming the spatiotemporal
    constraint (Aragón et al., 2018; McCabe et al., 2017b). However, while crop water
    use is an important variable in delivering insights into water allocation and
    management, regulators are often most interested in determining the source and
    volumes of water actually being extracted from reservoirs to supply this agricultural
    need, not just the net use. This has represented a much more challenging task,
    as in situ data on these systems are often non-existent and not easily inferred
    through remote measurement, at least at the scales at which local and regional
    management needs to be performed. In many regions of the world, existing or historical
    groundwater monitoring networks help to inform regional groundwater depletion
    trends (Shamsudduha et al., 2012; Scanlon et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2013) and
    offer insights into related environmental impacts (Lee and Song, 2007; Erban et
    al., 2014). Satellite-based gravimetry measurements from GRACE have informed on
    water storage depletion trends around the world (Rodell et al., 2018), with particular
    benefit to data scarce regions where the quantification of aquifer depletion would
    not otherwise be possible (Lezzaik and Milewski, 2018). However, while GRACE data
    provide an excellent source of large-scale information on aquifer response (Voss
    et al., 2013; Famiglietti, 2014), it is not suited to attribute to any particular
    use at the scales required for resource management. For example, the Al Jawf agricultural
    region as defined in this study (mapped agricultural area of about 2500 km2) is
    small compared to the scale of the Saq aquifer system that feeds it (about 500 000 km2)
    and the recommended minimal size for GRACE studies (>200 000 km2; Famiglietti,
    2014; Long et al., 2015; Richey et al., 2015). Moreover, even in regions where
    groundwater monitoring networks do exist, there is a need to bridge the gap between
    a regional assessment and practical farm-scale monitoring. In this context, our
    study demonstrates new capability, using a satellite data-modeling framework to
    provide an unprecedented level of information for water management. The approach
    represents a dramatic improvement on more traditional farmer-based surveys, which
    are time-consuming to collect, can often be unreliable and unrepresentative, and
    lack the spatial and temporal detail needed to provide accurate water accounting
    at the regional scale. While a number of studies have attempted to estimate irrigation
    by incorporating an irrigation module into a water balance model, these approaches
    have often been based on “adding” the necessary irrigation depth to maintain the
    soil moisture above a threshold value (Santos et al., 2008; Ozdogan et al., 2010;
    Pokrhel et al., 2012), which may not reflect the actual irrigation volume being
    applied. Here we developed a data-modeling approach to automatically retrieve
    seasonal irrigation rates for individual center-pivot fields, focusing on fields
    irrigated by center-pivot infrastructure: consistent with the type of infrastructure
    that supports the majority of irrigated fields in Saudi Arabia and in other cereal
    crop production areas worldwide. The developed approach is based on constraining
    a land surface hydrology model with evaporation estimates, and then “inferring”
    the irrigation rate, an idea explored conceptually by Droogers et al. (2010) and
    applied in a real-world case study by López (2018). As the first large-scale demonstration
    of this framework at the regional scale, the present study represents an effort
    towards more effective water use monitoring in both Saudi Arabia and other arid
    countries (e.g., in the MENA region) that rely heavily on groundwater abstraction
    for agricultural production. 5.2 Demonstrating the capability of the pivot-based
    groundwater abstraction estimation framework The framework offers a unique monitoring
    and modeling effort in terms of scale and granularity, as it demonstrated a capacity
    to obtain agricultural water use estimates from the scale of a single pivot to
    more than 5000 individual fields. Importantly, the approach is scalable and can
    be applied to other domains and locations. The mapping activities used in producing
    our water use estimates for the year 2015 indicate a much larger extent of agriculture
    (2494 km2) in the region than has previously been reported (1200 km2 for the year
    2009; SSYB, 2010). Consequently, a much higher groundwater abstraction was also
    estimated (5.56 BCM) than that forecast for the year 2014 (1.2 BCM; MEP, 2010).
    However, it is important to note that these prior estimates were obtained by incorporating
    information from various private and public sources, including on-site interviews,
    and are subject to significant uncertainties. These include possible misrepresentation
    due to the absence of metering in farms (i.e., self underreporting) and possible
    omission of fields located in remote areas. Regardless, our estimates are proportionally
    consistent (in terms of area) with more recent reports of nationwide groundwater
    abstraction for the year 2015 (20.8 BCM; MEWA, 2019). That is, both the estimates
    of area and of groundwater abstraction for the Al Jawf region represent about
    one-quarter of irrigated agriculture in the kingdom. Ultimately, our study is
    a demonstration of using the best available data and tools to undertake an analysis
    in a data-limited region. The lack of data is very much a developing world problem,
    but there are numerous “developed” world cases where data to inform model set-up
    and evaluation is absent. Using the strategy proposed here, we were able to provide
    results that reflect expectations when compared to the limited available datasets
    (both at farm and regional scale), i.e., a positive outcome given the scenario
    where independent data are not available to inform decision makers. 5.3 Limitations,
    potential extensions, and applications The goal of this study was to provide a
    first approximation of regional groundwater abstraction independent of self-reported
    data, and for this, we have used a specific choice of models (i.e., TSEB and CABLE).
    Other remote sensing approaches for evaporation estimation could be used. For
    example, the use of ALEXI/DisALEXI (Norman et al., 2003) could be explored to
    mitigate the sensitivity to the accuracy of LST retrieval, but the trade-off between
    higher ET accuracy and the impact on computational effort should be evaluated.
    Likewise, our approach is not limited to any particular land surface model. Further
    investigation is required to determine the uncertainties of the models used as
    well as from other inputs such as LAI and how these propagate through our groundwater
    abstraction framework. One approach that could help mitigate biases within specific
    models is to explore the use of multi-model estimates, which would also help provide
    ranges of groundwater abstraction. Because this study was aimed to retrieve estimates
    for the year 2015, a key reference year that will be used to evaluate the impact
    of policy changes in Saudi Arabia, Landsat 8 imagery was the primary source of
    satellite data. With a sun-synchronous return frequency of 16 d, this means that
    for a 90-day season, the method is based on between four and six images. Given
    this low number of observations, our study aimed at retrieving seasonal irrigation
    amounts; i.e., we do not estimate irrigation amounts in different crop developmental
    stages. Added to this limitation, cloud cover can be an important factor in the
    uncertainty of the irrigation activity detection. While this is not a major issue
    in the current setting (high percentage of “blue-sky” days throughout the year),
    it may be pertinent to applications in other geographic locations. For more recent
    years, data from newer satellites with higher temporal resolution, such as Sentinel-2
    (Ferrant et al., 2017; Veloso et al., 2017) and CubeSats (McCabe et al., 2017b;
    Houborg and McCabe, 2018b), could be employed to support improved estimates, as
    active irrigation seasons would be more accurately defined, and irrigation estimates
    could be obtained on a sub-seasonal basis (e.g., being able to differentiate between
    crop stages). The higher spatial resolution available (e.g., 3 m in the case of
    Planet data) can also benefit the model, especially for the detection of partially
    irrigated or partitioned (two-crop) fields, and avoid the edge overlap in some
    fields that hinders the automated capability of the delineation procedure. However,
    the increased computational cost of using higher-resolution data, particularly
    with the LSM runs, is an important consideration (Wood et al., 2011; Bierkens
    et al., 2015), especially when seeking to apply the methodology over a larger
    number of fields (e.g., at a national scale). Detecting periods of active irrigation
    is a crucial step of the framework, and ensures that the model is able to retrieve
    irrigation values for the appropriate periods. Ideally, the more often that satellite
    information is available, the better the prediction of active irrigation seasons
    will become. This is especially important for perennial fields, which undergo
    fast response to cut and re-growth cycles that could be missed by the 16 d revisit
    interval of Landsat (Houborg and McCabe, 2018b). However, an aspect that requires
    further investigation is how to retrieve irrigation rates during the pre-planting
    stage. One way to tackle this challenge would be to use high-resolution soil moisture
    products to track the change in soil water content (Sánchez-Ruiz et al., 2014).
    Although this was an unexplored aspect in this study, the obtained estimates can
    be interpreted as a lower bound for seasonal fields, which comprised less than
    20 % of the fields identified in the Al Jawf region. As this study focused only
    on center-pivot irrigation, the total quantity of abstracted water used for agricultural
    production in Al Jawf will be marginally higher than the reported 5.56 BCM. This
    value represents a first-order estimate that can be further refined by adding
    the contribution of other irrigated crops and fields, e.g., date palms and more
    recently agricultural shifts to planting of olive trees. In parallel with additional
    crop mapping and identification activities, efforts are also being directed towards
    strategies that monitor water use from other types of irrigation (e.g., drip and
    flood irrigation), in order to obtain a more comprehensive estimate of groundwater
    abstraction in this region and beyond. As a first step, using the object-based
    image analysis procedure, we delineated and estimated an area of about 31 km2
    of irrigated fields in the Al Jawf region that were not classified as center-pivot
    fields. This represents about 1.22 % of the total irrigated area, and depending
    on the type of irrigation (e.g., drip irrigation), represents a relatively small
    fraction of the total groundwater abstraction. One approach to incorporate the
    agricultural water use from these remaining fields would be to first implement
    an advanced crop classification scheme (Cai et al., 2018; Piedelobo et al., 2019)
    and then calculate irrigation requirements for each crop (Castaño et al., 2010;
    Kirby et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2019). The reason for using other approaches
    with these remaining irrigated fields, is that the framework relies on the assumption
    of relatively uniform irrigation application, which simplified the effort to translate
    irrigation rates into abstracted groundwater. Additional improvements to the methodology
    would also include better quantifying the spray-loss component of the center-pivot
    system. For example, information derived from wind speed and direction, humidity
    and air temperature could be used to refine spray loss estimates over each field
    (Abo-Ghobar 1992; Sadhegi et al., 2015, 2017) with a dynamic, rather than fixed
    value. The methodology is being further developed to run both retrospectively
    and up to current periods in order to monitor change in agricultural activities
    across the kingdom and to quantify this sector''s corresponding water use. Such
    data will enable responses to policy changes and management implementations to
    be identified, and can act to facilitate optimization practices for agricultural
    water use and groundwater abstraction in other data-sparse regions. 6 Conclusions
    An automated approach to estimate agricultural-driven groundwater abstraction
    based on integrating satellite data and land surface modeling was developed, with
    its functionality demonstrated over several thousand center-pivot fields in an
    arid region of Saudi Arabia. The monitoring framework provided an unprecedented
    level of information capturing water use behavior at the individual field scale
    and included information metrics such as geospatial location, distribution of
    cultivated areas, irrigation activity patterns, crop water use, and ultimately
    the abstracted groundwater used to grow the agriculture product. Monthly to yearly
    estimates of abstracted groundwater were obtained for more than 5000 center-pivot
    fields, covering an area of approximately 2500 km2, with a total groundwater use
    estimated at 5.56 BCM. Individual field use ranged from 0.24 MCM to more than
    3 MCM annual abstractions for those areas operating at more than 80 % capacity.
    The annual total abstraction value represents about one-quarter of the total groundwater
    abstraction used for agriculture in the kingdom (20.8 BCM; MEWA, 2019). In terms
    of agricultural area, the 2,500 km2 also represent about one-quarter of the kingdom''s
    center-pivot-based irrigation capacity (∼10 029 km2; FAO, 2008a). With the development
    of this novel water accounting approach, changes and trends in agricultural patterns
    from regional to national scales can now be monitored, providing information on
    crop type (perennial or seasonal), changes in the cultivated areas, and volumes
    of water being used over time. Such information is needed for improved water management,
    to inform the development of water related regulations, and to assess the impact
    of policies on water conservation. The approach is currently being deployed retrospectively
    to monitor all center-pivot infrastructure across Saudi Arabia for the years 2011–2015,
    and then to expand this forward in time to allow near-real-time monitoring. Future
    work will focus on the inclusion of other types of agriculture (e.g., date palms,
    orchards, and olive trees) for a more complete accounting of water abstraction
    for agricultural use. In parallel, a classification of crop types grown within
    individual center-pivot fields is being performed to better identify potential
    water-saving and irrigation optimization techniques at the individual field scale.
    The availability of new and emerging sources of remote sensing information presents
    an opportunity to further advance our precision agricultural capacity and will
    be incorporated into the future versions of this modeling framework, providing
    enhanced assessment on crop growth and field condition. Code and data availability

    phenotyping has recently attracted substantial interest because of its importance
    in: (1) closing the gap between plant genotyping and phenotyping, (2) accelerating
    the cycle of breeding for crop improvement, and (3) meeting the global demands
    of food, fiber and fuel that can be produced from agricultural sectors (Furbank
    and Tester, 2011, White et al., 2012). It is anticipated that appropriately deployed
    field phenotyping technologies will enable us the collection of high volume, multifaceted
    plant phenotypic data. These field measured data, together with the co-measured
    environmental variables, will enable an accelerated pace of scientific discovery,
    from understanding complex interactions between genotype and environment to identifying
    the best performers among thousands of candidate genotypes as part of crop improvement
    efforts (Araus and Cairns, 2013). Field-based plant phenotyping platforms include
    manually operated carts (White and Conley, 2013, Bai et al., 2016), tractor-based
    vehicles (Andrade-Sanchez et al., 2014, Jiang et al., 2018) and field robotics
    (Underwood et al., 2017), and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) (Sankaran et al.,
    2015, Shi et al., 2016). Each platform has its own merits and limitations. For
    example, manually operated carts are light weight and flexible, but have lower
    measurement throughput and have difficulty scaling to the mature height of some
    crops (e.g., maize). Tractor-based platforms can be heavy and create undesired
    compaction in soil. Ground-based platforms could also cause mechanical damage
    to crops particularly in late growing season. UAVs, on the other hand, are suitable
    for tall crops, but have limited sensor payload capacity and measurement duration.
    A fixed framework (such as a sensor platform supported by a gantry or cable-suspension
    system) over a large-sized field for high throughput plant phenotyping combines
    the merits of both vehicle-based and UAV-based platforms. It could easily measure
    tall crops and would not be limited by the sensor payload or battery capacity
    (meaning long measurement hours with multiple sensing modalities are possible).
    It would support measurements under the conditions of wet soil (not possible with
    vehicle-type) and mild to strong winds (not possible with UAV). Furthermore, the
    system can position and orient sensors to a particular plot with high accuracy
    and repeatability, which enhance the quality of field data for precision phenotyping.
    Virlet et al. (2017) reported an overhead gantry system (Field Scanalyzer) for
    plant phenotyping research developed at Rothamsted Research, U.K. This system
    has a rectangular sensing area of 0.12 ha (116 × 11 m) and a height of 4.1 m.
    It has a sensor payload capacity of 500 kg. Sensors employed on this system comprise
    high-resolution visible, chlorophyll fluorescence and thermal infrared cameras,
    two hyperspectral imagers and dual 3D laser scanners. However, it was highlighted
    in this publication that processing of images from hyperspectral imagers and laser
    scanners was still challenging. Kirchgessner et al. (2017) reported a cable-suspended
    field phenotyping system at ETH Zurich. It covered 1 ha of experimental field
    with a maximum sensor height of 6 m. The control system could be programmed to
    move the sensor platform to locations by inputting XYZ coordinates. The system
    was more compact and the cables minimized the shadow problem that could bias the
    measurement and increase the complexity of image processing. The authors demonstrated
    the use of multiple sensor modules to measure various crop traits, including ground
    cover, plant height, canopy temperature and spectral reflectance. In this paper,
    we reported a large-scale, cable-driven, integrated sensing and robotic platform
    for high-precision, field-based plant phenotyping research developed at University
    of Nebraska, U.S. (NU-Spidercam). We described the design and development of the
    system in terms of: (1) hardware integration of various imaging, ranging and spectroscopic
    sensors, and (2) software development for task planning, motion control, and automated
    measurements. The system was tested in 2017 and 2018 growing season. We also reported
    the system performance and provided examples of novel phenotypic data enabled
    by the system. 2. Design and development of NU-Spidercam facility 2.1. Facility
    overview The NU-Spidercam facility is located at Eastern Nebraska Research and
    Extension Center of the University of Nebraska, Mead, NE, U.S. (41°08′44.4″ N,
    96°26′20.6″ W, 369 m above sea level). The field is approximately 2.0 ha, with
    a core imaging area of ∼ 0.4 ha (60 × 67 m, Fig. 1A and B). The two soil types
    are Yutan silty clay loam and Filbert silt loam. The core imaging area is divided
    into 128 zones. Each zone is 4.6 × 6.1 m (Fig. 1B) and contains six crop rows
    with a row spacing of 0.76 m. A variable-rate, subsurface drip irrigation (SDI)
    system was installed 0.25 m below the surface, which can apply different amounts
    of irrigation water to each zone (Fig. 1C). A two-story observation and control
    building was built on the site to house main electric, electronic, communication,
    monitoring and control devices for the facility (Fig. 1D). Download : Download

    field phenotyping facility. A – Bird view of the facility; B – the 128 zones in
    the core imaging area; C – the control valves of the variable-rate subsurface
    drip irrigation system; D – the control and observation building; E – a close-up
    view of the sensor platform. The sensor platform (Fig. 1E) is suspended and driven
    by eight Kelvar cables from four poles at the corners of the core imaging area.
    The cables are pulled by four winches to position the sensor platform in the imaging
    area via a proprietary algorithm (Spidercam GmbH, Austria). The positioning accuracy
    is ± 5 cm in XYZ directions. The poles are 27 m high; and the designed height
    range of the sensor platform is 0–9 m (from the ground). This allows researchers
    to collect phenotypic data on tall crops such as maize and biomass sorghum throughout
    the growing season. The sensor platform can move at a maximum speed of 2 m/s.
    This means it can move between any two plots in the imaging area within 45 s.
    The sensor platform has a payload capacity of 30 kg (in addition to the mass of
    the battery and the controlling computer). Other major components that support
    the operation of the facility include an SDI control room, an electric building,
    and four winch houses where the winches are operated. Fig. 1 provides an overview
    of the NU-Spidercam facility, the field layout, and its major components. 2.2.
    Integration of plant sensors onto the sensor platform A number of plant sensors
    are integrated on the sensor platform to capture multi-modal plant traits. The
    plant sensors include a four-band RGB-NIR (multispectral) camera, a thermal IR
    camera, a 3D scanning LiDAR, and a VNIR portable spectrometer. A fanless embedded
    computer (NDiS B535, Nexcom) which controls all sensor modules, takes sensor readings,
    and stores the measurements is integrated into the sensor platform. Table 1 provides
    detailed information regarding the sensors, their connection and communication
    with the computer, and the plant parameters measured. Table 1. Plant sensors onboard

    12 VDC No special driver needed Canopy height The portable VNIR spectrometer is
    connected to two optical fibers via a bifurcated optical fiber and two electronic
    shutters (INLINE-TTL, OceanOptics). One optical fiber is aimed down to measure
    reflected solar energy from crop canopy (upwelling), and the other fiber (to which
    a cosine corrector is attached) is pointed to the sky to measure incoming solar
    irradiance (downwelling). The shutters are triggered by TTL (Transistor-Transistor-Logic)
    signals from the computer to activate the two optical fibers sequentially. Each
    measurement therefore is consisted of two sets of spectrometer readings: one set
    corresponding to when the upwelling (again looking at the surface) fiber is activated
    and the other set the downwelling (again looking at the sky) fiber activated.
    This dual optical fiber design effectively accounts for varying sky condition
    due to solar elevation and clouds and allows accurate measurements of crop canopy
    reflectance. The RGB-NIR camera, thermal IR camera, LiDAR and upwelling optical
    fiber are mounted on a pan/tilt unit at the bottom of the sensor platform (Fig.
    2A). They are placed such that they share a common field of view on the ground,
    which ensures the measurements from different sensors cover the same area and
    can be related. Fig. 2B illustrates the field of view of each sensor when the
    sensor platform is approximately 5 m above the ground (or canopy). Although all
    measurements reported in this paper were from a nadir view, the pan/tilt unit
    does allow the sensors and cameras to take measurements at slanted angles (Supplemental
    Fig. 1), which can be of great value for multi-angle imaging and remote sensing
    research. Download : Download high-res image (664KB) Download : Download full-size

    colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this
    article.) An anemometer, a GPS receiver, and the downwelling optical fiber are
    mounted on the upper part of the sensor platform (Fig. 3). GPS was currently not
    used for positioning, because NU-Spidercam itself has a positioning system that
    is more precise. The controlling computer, spectrometer, batteries, and all supporting
    components (such as Ethernet cable switches, wires, voltage converter, etc.) are
    also mounted on the upper part of the platform and are protected by a cover from
    rain and direct sun light during operation. Download : Download high-res image

    with the anemometer, downwelling optical fiber cable, GPS, spectrometer, electronic
    shutters, computer, battery, and other supporting electronics. The sensor platform
    is powered by two batteries supplying unregulated 48 VDC. A power conversion block
    is used to convert 48 V to regulated 12 and 24 V to power the computer and various
    sensor modules (Table 1). When fully charged, the battery can support 6–8 h of
    operation. 2.3. Software development The program for the sensor platform task
    planning, motion control and data collection was developed using LabVIEW (Version
    2016, National Instruments, Austin, Texas, U.S.). Fig. 4 shows the initialization
    Graphic User Interface (GUI) of the program. During initialization, the program
    checks the current status of the sensor platform and ensures it is ready for motion.
    Sensor modules can be individually selected or de-selected to meet the need of
    each measurement campaign. The option of “hyperspectral camera” is reserved for
    future integration. Download : Download high-res image (934KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Graphic User Interface (GUI) of the NU-Spidercam program
    developed with LabVIEW: (A) the initialization page for sensor selection and mission
    planning; and (B) the measurement page providing real time update of sensor data
    and images being captured. For task planning, researchers upload a ‘Way-Point
    Map’, which is a TXT file with a set of predefined locations (for example, the
    center of each zone or plot) in the core imaging area. Each line of the TXT file
    contains the XYZ coordinates of a location and Pan/Tilt angles of sensor orientation,
    and a desired driving speed for the sensor platform (Supplemental Fig. 2). The
    program will also check to ensure the locations are in acceptable ranges, and
    display them in “Graph Display of Map File” of the GUI (Fig. 4A). The program
    then generates a custom XML-based command for each line of the TXT file (Supplemental
    Fig. 3), and sends them sequentially to a computer that is dedicated for winch
    control and cable feeding. There are two modes of motion control for the sensor
    platform in the program. The first one is “stop-measure-go”. In this mode, the
    sensor platform is driven to a location, stopped to stabilize and take measurements,
    and then driven to the next location. Because the platform is operated only a
    few meters above crop canopy, this pattern ensures best image quality with minimum
    image blurring caused by the relative motion between the imaging sensors and plants.
    The second mode is “continuous”, where the sensor platform traverses through target
    locations without stopping. The program uses a separate control loop to trigger
    the sensors continuously. In this mode, images are captured with significant overlap
    that allow the mosaic of the entire imaging area (similar to UAV imaging). This
    mode is also necessary for push-broom type hyperspectral imaging system. Fig.
    5 provides a high-level flow chart diagram for automated measurement using the
    “stop-measure-go” mode. Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download

    using the “stop-measure-go” mode. The program provides a live update of the multispectral
    image, thermal IR image, and downwelling and upwelling spectra of the current
    plot being measured (Fig. 4B). Measurement data and experimental metadata are
    stored in the controlling computer with a two-level file directory system. At
    the first level, data are organized by “Date”. Within a “Date” folder, measurements
    from each location is stored in a subfolder (second level) and the subfolder name
    is “Location ID_Serpentine number_Genotype_Irrigation level_Time stamp_XYZ”. In
    this manner each measurement is unambiguously linked to a location (or plot) and
    measurement time. Inside the second level folders, measurement data including
    the multispectral image, thermal IR image, spectral data, and LiDAR point cloud
    are saved. The metadata including the XYZ coordinates, pan-tilt angles, and speed
    of the sensor platform are also saved in the folder. 2.4. Variable rate SDI and
    onsite weather station The variable rate SDI for the NU-Spidercam facility is
    unique in the sense that it controls the 128 zones (Fig. 1B and C) which can be
    irrigated and fertigated independently with high water application uniformity
    (Christiansen Uniformity Coefficient of >98%). Water can be applied with a precision
    of 0.04 L each zone, enabled by state-of-the-art pressure compensating emitters
    which compensate changes in operating pressure and provide constant (and targeted)
    flow rate. The irrigation events can be automatically triggered based on predetermined
    soil moisture threshold in the crop root zone or crop water use. This level of
    precision, uniformity, and automation with the SDI is highly desirable for studying
    plant traits related to irrigation response, stomatal conductance, water use,
    and nitrogen use. An automated weather station was emplaced approximately 30 m
    west of the NU-Spidercam facility. The weather station collects weather and environmental
    parameters, including air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity (2 m above the
    ground), precipitation, wind speed and direction (3 m above the ground), photosynthetically
    active radiation (PAR), and total shortwave radiation. These variables are recorded
    at one minute interval. These data are used together with plant measurements from
    NU-Spidercam to help elucidate the interaction between genotypes and environment.
    3. Field experiment to test the NU-Spidercam facility The NU-Spidercam facility
    was tested for two years during the 2017 and 2018 growing season. In 2017, soybean
    with different genotypes was planted on the east half of the field while maize
    was planted on the west half of the field. The 180 two-row maize plots included
    162 maize hybrids constructed from crossing maize inbreds developed by major seed
    companies and released following the expiration of plant variety patents, plus
    a repeated modern check line. The expired plant variety patent maize hybrids were
    selected to match those being grown and phenotyped at several dozen locations
    across the U.S. and Canada as part of the Genomes to Fields project (Gage et al.,
    2017). The experiment in 2018 was similar, except that soybean was planted on
    the west half and maize on the east half to mimic a maize-soybean rotation commonly
    employed in the region. In 2017, the sensor platform was operated at 9 m above
    the ground. At this height, the multispectral camera covered 10 rows of crop and
    thermal IR camera covered 6 rows. In 2018, the sensor platform was operated at
    5 m above the ground. At this height, the multispectral camera covered 4 rows
    of crop and thermal IR camera covered 2 rows. Primary motion control mode was
    “stop-measure-go”. Continuous motion mode was conducted a number of times to evaluate
    the performance of image mosaicking like UAV. The purposes of the experiment were
    three fold. Firstly, we evaluated the functionalities and robustness of hardware
    and software components of the system during actual field operations. Secondly,
    we validated the sensor measurements with the ground truth measurements. In particular,
    we validated the LiDAR measurements against manual measurement (using a yardstick)
    of plot heights, and crop thermal IR images against canopy temperature measured
    by a handheld IR radiometer (Omega Engineering, Norwalk, Connecticut, U.S.). More
    information regarding ground truth measurement is in Supplemental Fig. 4. Thirdly,
    we demonstrated the usefulness of the facility for high-precision plant phenotyping
    research by collecting relevant plot-level plant trait data from genotypes for
    which extensive conventional field phenotyping data exists. We extracted crop
    coverage from four-band RGB-NIR multispectral images. An NDVI image was calculated
    using NIR and R bands of the image: (NIR-R)/(NIR + R). The NDVI image was effective
    to segment crop pixels from soil background by setting a single threshold. Crop
    coverage was calculated as the number of crop pixels divided by the total number
    of pixels. An affine transformation was developed that allowed the overlay of
    the thermal IR image to the RGB-NIR image. Because the relative position of the
    thermal camera and the multispectral camera was fixed, one affine transformation
    could apply to all the image sets captured by the system. After the overlay, we
    used the binary image (derived from the NDVI image) as a mask to segment the thermal
    IR image into crop and soil fractions. This procedure was more accurate than a
    direct segmentation of the thermal IR image using an automatic threshold method
    (such as Otsu method). Average crop canopy temperature (Tc) was calculated by
    averaging the temperature of all plant pixels. Similarly, average soil temperature
    (Ts) was calculated by averaging the temperature of all soil pixels (Fig. 6).

    Fig. 6. Joint analysis of multispectral image and thermal IR image to extract
    plot-level canopy cover, canopy temperature, and soil temperature. Crop height
    at the plot level was extracted from LiDAR data. Raw LiDAR points were filtered
    to remove points that fell outside the targeted plot. The distance between the
    soil and the LiDAR sensor (D1) was determined using data from the earliest date
    of the year (when soil exposure was the greatest) and the maximum distance (or
    100 percentile) was used. The distance between plot canopy and the LiDAR sensor
    (D2) was determined using the 10 percentile distance of the filtered LiDAR points.
    Average canopy height was then calculated by subtracting D2 from D1. Note this
    method assumed D1 was constant over the time. This assumption was realistic because
    the sensor platform could be driven to the same location with high precision.
    Eq. (1) was used to convert the raw spectral readings to canopy reflectance. (1)

    factor (also wavelength dependent), which is derived by scanning three reflectance
    tarps of known spectral reflectance. The tarps are 1.62 × 1.62 m in dimension
    (nominal reflectance values of 5, 45, and 75%) and set up inside the imaging area
    during the operation for spectral calibration (Supplemental Fig. 5). 4. Results
    and discussion 4.1. Functionality and robustness of NU-Spidercam In 2017, operations
    were carried out on 13 days between 7/12 and 9/28. Each day the system was run
    5–6 h on average. There were two problems in 2017. Firstly, the motion control
    and sensor trigger part of the program were not well integrated, and in several
    occasions, the sensor platform was driven to measurement locations manually via
    a joystick. Secondly, frequent exceptions occurred for one winch that fed the
    Kelvar cables. Both problems reduced the measurement throughput significantly
    and were addressed after 2017 growing season. In 2018, operations were carried
    out on 20 days between 7/9 and 9/14. In most of these days, the system was set
    to take plot-level measurement with full automation (without operator’s intervention).
    All desired functions of the system regarding task planning, motion control, and
    automated data collection were realized. The system also exhibited outstanding
    robustness in the weather conditions of no rain nor strong wind (>10 m s−1). For
    most days, the system was run continuously without hardware or software errors.
    It took ∼4 h to cover the entire 360 two-row plots with the “stop-measure-go”
    mode. Note that this measurement throughput can be improved by: (1) increasing
    the moving speed of the sensor platform, and (2) shortening the waiting time to
    allow the sensor platform to stabilize. It is feasible to go over the entire field
    twice (720 two-row plots) in a day. A time-lapse video showing the operation of
    NU-Spidercam in a typical day is provided in the Supplemental Material. 4.2. Quality
    of sensor data in comparison to ground truth data Fig. 7 compares crop canopy
    temperature and height measured by the sensor platform vs. the ground truth measurements
    in selected soybean plots. For canopy temperature, the two sets exhibited strong
    linear correlation (R2 = 0.931). Root mean squared error (RMSE) was 1.84 °C. The
    temperature measured by the sensor platform was consistently higher, as indicated
    by a unity slope but non-zero intercept of 1.67 °C. Because the thermal IR camera
    and the handheld IR radiometer were not cross-calibrated, this systematic bias
    could be due to the discrepancy in calibration between the two devices. Another
    factor that would introduce random error was the fact that the thermal IR camera
    and the IR radiometer measured the same canopy at slightly different time (roughly
    two minutes difference). Canopy temperature is a dynamic trait that can change
    rapidly in a short time, especially under varying clouds and intermittent winds.
    This random error therefore could indicate the real canopy temperature differences
    measured at slightly different times. Download : Download high-res image (115KB)

    from the NU-Spidercam sensor platform against the ground truth measurements. Canopy
    height measured by the LiDAR and yardstick exhibited strong linear correlation
    (R2 = 0.965) and RMSE was 0.03 m in selected soybean plots (Fig. 8). The slope
    of the regression line was close to 1 and the intercept was close to 0, indicating
    LiDAR measurements were not biased. With this ground truth validation, LiDAR appeared
    be a reliable method for canopy height measurements. This level of performance
    was also consistent with other studies that used LiDAR as a high throughput tool
    for plant height measurements (Madec et al., 2017, Jimenez-Berni et al., 2018).

    enabled by NU-Spidercam Fig. 9 shows canopy height and vegetation cover of the
    soybean crop (180 plots) in 2018 between Jul/10 and Aug/15. The average height
    increased steadily from 0.4 m to over 1.0 m on 8/10. On 8/15 overall height decreased
    slightly. This is because a portion of the plots started to lodge when entering
    late reproductive stage. Average canopy cover also showed a steady increase from
    ∼35% to 80% on 7/26. Thereafter, the increase slowed down and average canopy cover
    approached ∼100% around 8/07. This kind of information is desirable for high throughput
    phenotyping platform, because it allows the measurement of key growth parameters
    multiple times along the growing season. Further processing can be done to fit
    the functional growth curves and analyze growth patterns. Download : Download

    of plant height (extracted from LiDAR) and canopy cover (extracted from multispectral
    images) of soybean (180 two-row plots) in 2018. Although the stop-measure-go motion
    mode was predominantly used, we did collect images with continuous motion mode
    to demonstrate the feasibility of image mosaicking similar to UAV. The sensor
    platform was driven from the left side of Fig. 10A to the right side with a constant
    speed of 0.5 m/s. The multispectral camera was set to capture images at 0.25 s
    interval. The two consecutive images had an offset of 0.125 m, equivalent to a
    ∼96% image overlap. There was a total of 214 images in this pass (covering 18
    2-row soybean plots), and they were successfully mosaicked using Pix4D software
    (Lausanne, Switzerland). Contrasting canopy characteristics caused by the different
    maturation in the soybean genotypes (again in 2-row plots) can be clearly identified
    in Fig. 10A. In addition, we also derived a maize canopy image (Fig. 10B) with
    the same imaging setting but the images were mosaicked manually using the photo
    merge function in Photoshop. Similarly, large phenotypic variation among the maize
    genotypes can be clearly seen from the mosaicked image. Download : Download high-res

    not easy to obtain with other phenotyping platforms. For instance, Fig. 11 shows
    the thermal IR images (pseudo color-coded to enhance contrast) of a two-row soybean
    plot (imaged repeatedly 12 times in a day between 12:00 and 6:00 PM local time).
    This time-series images shows a number of interesting patterns regarding the temperature
    dynamics of crop canopy versus soil. First, soil exhibited higher temperature
    than crop canopy. Second, at some time points the canopy had a more uniform temperature
    distribution (e.g., T2 and T3 in Fig. 11) while other times it was quite heterogeneous.
    Sun lit part of the canopy had higher temperature than the shaded part. Download

    of thermal IR image time-series of a soybean plot captured during a day. We further
    processed the time-series thermal IR images to segment crop from soil and extracted
    the average temperatures of crop vs. soil. In addition, we also extracted air
    temperature and PAR radiation from the weather station at the time when each plot
    was measured. Fig. 12 shows the result from this analysis for all 36 plots we
    tracked that day (7/19/2018). It can be seen that temperature of crop and soil
    increased and peaked at ∼3:00 and ∼2:00 PM respectively local time, and then decreased
    in late afternoon. The maximum temperature difference of soil vs. crop was about
    8.35 °C at 13:38PM. Interestingly, air temperature continued to rise till the
    end of measurement (∼5:30 PM). The local solar noon was around 1:30 PM; which
    coincided with peak PAR. There was large variation of canopy and soil temperature
    among the different plots (scatters around the fitting line). This is likely caused
    by genetic factor and the differences in vegetation cover among the plots. Download

    Temporal dynamics of plot-level canopy temperature (Tc) and soil temperature (Ts)
    in contrast to air temperature (Ta) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).
    Fig. 11, Fig. 12 revealed complex spatial and temporal patterns of crop canopy
    vs. soil temperature within a day. To the best of our knowledge, this type of
    information has not been reported in the literature. Although thermal imaging
    is common in satellite and aerial remote sensing, thermal images from these platforms
    are coarse in spatial resolution and not able to provide this level of spatial
    granularity. Capturing the temporal dynamics of canopy temperature for different
    plots as shown in Fig. 12 is even more challenging for the conventional phenotyping
    platforms including UAVs and ground-based phenocarts, as it may not be practical
    to go over the field multiple times in a day using these platforms. Canopy temperature
    is a critical variable and is widely used to relate leaf stomatal conductance
    or water stress (Li et al., 2014) and for determining the irrigation timing and
    yield vs. crop water stress relationships (Irmak et al., 2000, Payero and Irmak,
    2006). Non-imaging infrared radiometers are often employed in the field for this
    purpose. One of the potential problems with the non-imaging sensor is the mix
    of canopy and soil within sensor’s field of view, which would bias the measurement.
    Furthermore, the degree of bias depends on: (1) the percent of vegetation cover
    and (2) the time of measurement during a day. It would be challenging to decouple
    these two confounding factors for the non-imaging sensor. Another important challenge
    with using non-imaging infrared thermometers is that multiple measurements from
    E-W and N-S directions must be taken into account for sun angle impact on canopy
    temperature, which also requires additional time. Since the measurements are taken
    directly above the crop canopy with the Spidercam thermal IR imagery, this challenge
    is minimized. Therefore, we expect this type of measurements from NU-Spidercam
    will allow us to better utilize thermal IR images as a tool for drought and water
    use related phenotyping. Fig. 13 shows canopy reflectance of selected soybean
    and maize plots at 7/21, 7/26, 8/10, and 9/11 in 2018 with corresponding RGB images.
    The RGB images below the spectral reflectance figures indicate the canopy development
    in the FOV of the spectral measurement. The increase of the spectral reflectance
    in NIR was found in the soybean plot until 8/10, clearly due to the canopy development.
    Soybean leaves started yellowing on 9/11 and the reflectance at the NIR region
    decreased. For the maize plot, canopy growth was not noticeable from RGB images
    and the tassels were already established on 7/21. On 9/11, most of the maize plant
    leaves were yellow with few green leaves left. The spectral reflectance showed
    distinctive pattern comparing to that from green vegetation. Download : Download

    of the selected soybean and maize plot on 7/21, 7/26, 8/10 and 9/11. The insets
    are the reflectance around the O2-A band (760 nm) showing potential of retrieving
    solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) signals from spectral data. From
    the spectral data, we could calculate a number of vegetation indices from the
    canopy reflectance spectra in the future study, including NDVI (Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index), NDRE (Normalized Difference Red Edge Index), PRI (Photochemical
    Reflectance Index), and CCI (Canopy Chlorophyll Index). These vegetation indices
    are commonly used as proxies to infer structural and biochemical properties of
    crops in both remote sensing and field phenotyping. One application with great
    potential of the spectral data from our NU-Spidercam system is the measurement
    of solar induced fluorescence (SIF) signals from chlorophyll. SIF could be manifested
    as a small bump riding on the reflectance signal at ∼760 nm (O2-A band) (Meroni
    et al., 2009). ‘Spectral bump’ near 760 nm could be observed in the insets of
    Fig. 13. For the spectral reflectance of the corn plot on 9/11, ‘spectral bump’
    disappeared as there was low leaf chlorophyll content for senescent maize. SIF
    has been reported in the remote sensing literature for broad-scale vegetation
    monitoring (Guanter et al., 2014), and shown to be correlated with photosynthesis
    and primary productivity (Sun et al., 2017). Radiometric calibration has not been
    carried out in this study but we will work on the retrieval of SIF signals from
    the spectral measurement which might lead to novel means of SIF for plant phenotyping
    research. 4.4. Future development Although the NU-Spidercam has been successfully
    developed and tested, there are still many aspects regarding hardware, software,
    and operation that need to be improved. In the near term, we will incorporate
    a push-broom hyperspectral camera into the sensor platform and develop a continuous
    motion mode suitable for hyperspectral image acquisition along with all other
    sensor modules. We will also look into the control of the pan/tilt unit of the
    sensor platform which will make non-nadir measurement (i.e., multi-angle imaging)
    possible. In the long run, we also aim at developing a data infrastructure that
    will store the phenotyping data into a database and send the data into University
    of Nebraska’s High Performance Computing Center in a real time fashion. 5. Concluding
    remarks NU-Spidercam is one of three key investments in advanced phenotyping infrastructure
    at the University of Nebraska for phenotyping and transformational plant biology
    research. The other two systems are a Lab Scanalyzer HTS (LemnaTec GmbH) for Arabidopsis
    and a Greenhouse Scanalyzer for plants of agriculture importance (maize, sorghum,
    soybean, etc., Ge et al., 2016, Pandey et al., 2017, Liang et al., 2018). It is
    envisioned that these three research facilities will complement and amplify each
    other for plant genomics-phenomics discovery pipelines. Forward phenomics can
    be performed where potential new genotypes can first be fully characterized in
    the lab or greenhouse and then tested under NU-Spidercam for their field relevance.
    Alternatively, backward phenomics can be performed where a large number of candidate
    genotypes can go to the field first, and a few lines exhibiting superiority in
    targeted traits can be imaged in greater details in the lab or greenhouse to dissect
    their genetic basis. In either case, NU-Spidercam will play a critical role to
    provide high precision field phenotyping and relevant environmental data for the
    transformational plant biology research. Although NU-Spidercam has a number of
    advantages (such as large instrument payload, high measurement resolution and
    flexibility, and less weather dependent), it is capital-intensive. The cost for
    developing such a facility is high and may not be affordable to individual research
    group. On the other hand, technologies like UAVs and phenocarts are low in deployment
    cost and widely adopted in field phenotyping research. The intention of NU-Spidercam
    is not to replace other field phenotyping devices such as phenocarts or UAVs.
    Rather, these systems can work synergistically to increase the overall efficiency
    of plant phenotyping and the overall rate of trait discovery. NU-Spidercam is
    flexible and can position the sensor platform over crop plots precisely. Phenotyping
    data from NU-Spidercam is therefore of better quality and with greater spatial
    and temporal resolution. Knowledge gained from NU-Spidercam can inform the implementation
    of other phenotyping systems. For example, high quality hyperspectral imagery
    can be obtained with NU-Spidercam to determine the best three or four spectral
    bands to measure certain traits (e.g., chlorophyll content or water content) of
    a crop. Then a lower-cost, light weight multispectral camera dedicated to image
    those bands can be developed and launched on UAVs to measure these traits in different
    environments and broader areas. NU-Spidercam is more than an advanced field phenotyping
    tool. Due to its motion flexibility and sensor positioning/orientation accuracy,
    it can measure bidirectional reflectance distribution function of plant canopy,
    which is fundamental but notoriously difficult to measure in vegetation remote
    sensing. Combination of multispectral and thermal IR images along with the weather
    station data potentially allows inference of energy balance at the plot scale,
    and enables the calculation of evapotranspiration of different genetic lines to
    be tested. Finally, by varying agronomic inputs such as fertilizer or planting
    density, their relationships with plant growth, structural, and spectral characteristics
    can be rigorously quantified for various crops by NU-Spidercam. These are fundamental
    knowledge that have broad implications in agronomy and crop modeling research.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction
    The progressive enlargement in wireless intuiting element networks is exploited
    in inspecting varied considerations in cultivation. Because of uneven natural
    distribution of rain water it’s dreadfully troublesome for farmers to perceive
    and management the propagation of water to cultivation field within the entire
    farm or as per the obligation of the crop. Most of the papers implies the utilization
    of wireless sensing element network that amasses the information from differing
    kinds of sensors then send it to main server exploitation wireless protocol. [3].
    There are varieties of alternative factors embodying attack of insects and pests
    which might be controlled by spraying the crop with correct insect powder and
    pesticides. Secondly, attack of untamed animals and birds once the crop grows
    up. [1] There’s conjointly chance of thefts once crop is at the stage of harvest.
    Even once harvest, farmers conjointly face issues in storage of harvested crop.
    So, as to supply solutions to any or all such issues, it’s necessary to develop
    assimilated system which can be sure of all factors poignant the productivity
    in each phases like; cultivation, harvest and post-harvest storage. This paper
    so proposes a system that is helpful in watching the sphere knowledge also as
    dominant the sphere operations that provides the pliability. The paper aims at
    creating cultivation good maneuver automation and IoT technologies. Additionally
    to the standalone watching station, Wireless sensing element based mostly watching
    system been developed that consists of range of wireless sensing element nodes
    and an entry. This method here provides a novel, wireless and simple resolution
    with higher spatial and temporal resolutions. [2]Recently “Machine to machine
    (M2M)” communiqué is a rising technology that authorizations devices, objects
    etc. to express among one another and send knowledge to Server or Cloud through
    the Core Network. The organization of paper is as follows section 2 discusses
    about the Challenges and Issues of IoT and Section 3 discusses gives an detailed
    analysis on the survey on different IoT methodologies used in cultivation and
    their merits and demerits. Section 4 discusses about system Implementation. Section
    5 depicts the system results. Section 6 discusses about Conclusion of the paper
    followed by reference. SECTION II. Challenges and Issues in Iot There are numerous
    of dialogue relating the web of Things (IoT) but what ISOC’s whitepaper offers
    might even be helpful to assist people traverse the opposing dialogue encompassing
    the IoT. It should promote any, marked discussion on the 5 issues the whitepaper
    identifies as high challenges to the IoT, as summarized below to contemplate.
    A. Security Security is one amongst the pillars of the online and one that ISOC
    notices to be uniformly necessary and thus most essential dispute for the IoT.
    B. Standards Lack of standards and documented best practices have a much bigger
    impact than merely limiting the potential of IoT appliances. Whereas not limitations
    to guide manufacturers, makers typically vogue merchandise that operates in turbulent
    ways in which on the online whereas not plenty of reference to their impact. C.
    Regulation Like privacy, there’s an outside variable of outlined and legal queries
    encompassing the IoT that need thoughtful thought. Legal issues with IoT appliances
    embody cross border intelligence flow; conflict between social control police
    investigation and civil rights. D. Development The broad scope of IoT dares won’t
    be extraordinary to industrial countries. By2025; McKinsey International Institute
    comes that the maximum amount as thirty eight of almanac fiscal impact of the
    IoT applications can derive from minimum matured provinces. SECTION III. Survey
    of Iot Table 1 Survey Based On Various Research Paper of IOT In Cultivation Field
    Owing to the atmospheric phenomenon, water level increasing Ranchers get heap
    of distractions that isn’t sensible for Food production. This paper designates
    the expertise helps in grouping info concerning conditions like weather, moisture
    and fertility of soil, crop on-line observance. This enables ranchers to induce
    connected to their farm from anyplace at any time. Wireless sensing element networks
    are used for inspecting the farm circumstances as well microcontrollers plays
    a vital role in order to monitor and automize the farm progressions. A sensible
    phone empowers rancher to stay updated with the continued conditions in any place
    of the cultivation region. Water level is managed by means of ranchers in automated
    fashion exploitation through mobile application. It will build more leisurely
    to ranchers. The system allows effective soil maintenance and pump dominant mechanism.
    This overcomes those manual operations required to observe and maintain these
    cultivated farms in each automatic and manual modes. In order to enlighten prospects
    of this paper includes water management during automated modes also everyone can
    analyze this information that are keep and displayed in a mobile. The alert SMS
    and notification is direct to the user supported this fastened criteria. Through
    dominant of those operations by a mobile that is connected to web and it will
    offer higher performed by interfacing sensors, local area network etc. SECTION
    IV. System Implementation Extended research on Soil wetness sensors gives the
    status of humidity in land at anytime and anywhere. Several of the controllers
    have a way of setting the regularity of sprinkling, the beginning time, and also
    the period of sprinkling. So, by specializing in this higherthan issues we have
    an orientation to square measure which establishing the new scope within the Cultivation
    that’s Automation in Cultivation. Wireless sensor network technology is very suitable
    for distributed data collecting and monitoring in threatening environments such
    as greenhouse or cropland. The main aim of this paper is to propose a wireless
    sensor technology in cultivation, which can show the path to the rural farming
    communal to switch some of the traditional techniques. Traditional instrumentation
    based on wired and discrete solutions, presents many complications on measuring
    and control systems particularly over the enormous geographical areas. The conservatory
    based modern cultivation is the contemporary requirement in every part of cultivation
    in India. In this technology, the humidity of plants is precisely controlled.
    This paper describes the design and implementation of a mercurial, occasion obsessed
    network for eco-friendly monitoring of soil moisture and appraises its effectiveness.
    An innovative feature of our solution is its reactivity to the environment. When
    rain falls and soil moisture is changing rapidly, measurements are collected frequently,
    whereas during dry periods, between rainfalls, measurements are collected fewer
    often. Field trajectories signifying the reactivity, robustness, and permanency
    of the network are presented and appraised and future enhancements proposed. In
    this project we have used a moisture sensors guided by Arduino placed in different
    parts in the field, which will sense the moisture glassy of the soil. This data
    will be paralleled to the preset threshold moisture level, which will indicate
    whether the field needs irrigation or not. As per the indication of Arduino a
    GSM Module placed will instruct the relay to switch on or off and the siphon stimulus
    begins and stopsconsequently. The use of GSM can also enable the controlling of
    the supply of water through smartphone. A modest instruction can be sent from
    phone to turn the tap on and off from a different location through Wi-Fi service
    of GSM. This makes our device highly efficient and easy to use. No special commands
    are needed to run the device and hence can be easily used by the farmers to irrigate
    their field. In this way we can strictly limit the amount of water fed to the
    fields for irrigation, conserving the sample amount of water wasted to the drains
    including the topmost fertile layer of the soil. In this way, we will be able
    to not only save water, but also raise the quality of harvest by providing right
    amount of water needed by the crops in the cultivation land Figure 1: GSM (SIM
    9000) Show All GSM is used to enlighten the user about the meticulous field condition.
    Wireless sensor network technology can provide optimum and assimilated solution
    to disseminated data collection, distribution and exploration in farmland. Figure
    2: This diagram illustrates the architecture and working of our system. It also
    focuses on working of Arduino sensor in detail. Show All The main target of this
    paper was to supply water to the plants or to any cultivation land mechanically
    via microcontroller (Arduino Uno). The method could be a composed of both the
    hardware and software. Figure 3: This diagram illustrates the Arduino board Show
    All The main part of the architecture diagram is Arduino Uno. It acts as a heart
    of the working system. The Sensor principles rely on the resistance of the land.
    The LM393 Driver is anidentical differential comparator which parallels the sensor
    voltage with static quantityvoltage. Theconsequence of this sensor converge starting
    0-1023. 0 indicates most wet circumstance and 1023 indicates terribly dry circumstance.
    The LM35 is a fastidiousness integrated-circuit which is a Malaise Sensor, whose
    output voltage is linearly comparative to the Celsius gradation. The LM35 is performs
    at range in between −55°C and +120°C. The Prominence of land (Dry, Moist, and
    Soggy), the interpretation and the prominence of Pump is exhibited on the LCD
    Monitor. Figure 4: Soil Moisture Sensor Connected with Arduino Show All Authorizations
    for the accessibility of water concluded sensor. A demonstrative soil moisture
    sensing element accommodates two elements. A two leg like Lead, that goes into
    the soil or anyplace else wherever water content needs to be measured. This has
    two header pins that connect with associate degree amplifier/A-D circuit (Analog
    to Digital circuit) that is successively connected to the Arduino. The electronic
    equipment that is the amplifier incorporatesa Vin, the Gnd, Analog and Digital
    information Pins. This proposes that you simply will get the values in each Analog
    and Digital forms.Furthermost soil moisture sensors are designed to estimate soil
    volumetrically water content supported the dielectric constant (soil bulk permittivity)
    of the soil. The dielectric constant is thought of because the soil’s ability
    to transmit electricity. The dielectric constant of soil will increase because
    the water content of the soil will increase. This response is because of the very
    fact that the dielectric constant of water is far larger than the opposite soil
    elements, as well as air. Thus, measuring of the dielectric constant offers a
    certain estimation of water content. Connect the two pins from the sensing element
    to the two pins on the electronic equipment circuit via attach wires. Connect
    the Vcc from the electronic equipment to the three.3V pin on the Arduino and also
    the Gnd pin to the Gnd pin on the Arduino.Now connect the Analog information Pin
    to the A0 pin on the Arduino. If the water is acquired;the Pump is turned on and
    is spontaneously turned off when satisfactory quantity of water is well-appointed.
    Relay driver circuit is recycled to drive the pump. Improbably the Water is Inaccessible;
    you will be conveyed with an encyclopedic. Reed-Magnetic Shiftrestricted in the
    water glassy button which is surrounded by a fluctuatingelectromagnet. When water
    is obtained, it comportments. TheArduino declaims the prominence of the land determined
    Sensor. If the Land is dry it does the consequential Operations. The High temperature

    aims to extend the productivity, to attenuate the waste. Initially involves the
    process and viewing of gathered information to realize insights into however harvest
    maybe expeditiously augmented. It also involves sends alerting message to the
    farmer whereas wetness Level increase or decrease. The IoT connected devices stream
    live knowledge on the land permitting data-informed selections on coming up with
    the resources and gather of crops. Trailing the condition of farming equipment’s.
    Setting the automobile degree for space for storing for mapping condition of individual
    or batch of merchandise. The main motto of this paper reducing wastage of water,
    sense wetness level in land, and crop management. It also focuses on avoid delay
    of time, money Associate in power of farmer with a conditioned saturation method.
    Human intervention may be reduced with the automated technology SECTION V. Simulation
    Results A. Analysis Result for Various Crops The stumpyprice of apparatus and
    the modestmethods of our process are momentous when paralleled other methods.
    One of the peculiar feature of our proposed method is measuring soil wetness along
    the depth can help in determining the appropriate time of water supply to reach
    crop roots which be able toprogresspricecompetence and water source management.
    Figure5: Moisture contented, water requirement, optimum Temperature for various
    crops Show All Table 2 Table of Analysis For Various Crops, their Water Requirement
    and Moisture Level B. Estimating Soil Volumetric Water Contented Furthermost soil
    moisture sensors are considered to guesstimate soil volumetric water contentedentrust
    on the nonconductorpersistent (soil substanceconstant) of the soil. The insulator
    persistent can be supposed of as the soil’s capability to deportment electricity.
    The stuff constant of soil upsurges as the water gratified of the soil intensifications.
    This response is due to the fact that the dielectric continual of water is considerablegrander
    than the other soil apparatuses, comprising air. Thus, dimension of the non-insulatingmonochromatic
    gives a foreseeableapproximation of water contented. The outputsensor a signal
    centered on two coreinfluences: the moisture level of the soil and the input voltage.
    It has a duty to be curved up to an analog pin in track to deliver the signal
    appropriately. The moisture contented of the soil (VWC = Volumetric Water Contented)
    is indomitable by measuring the monochromaticfunction with a soil moisture sensor.
    This physical property of the soil divergesprominently depending on the water
    contented and is predictable worldwide as the standard for measuring the moisture
    in the soil and in other materials. The conductor permittivity is unhurriedby
    means of capacitive frequency province technology at anoccurrence of 80 MHz Figure6:
    Various stages of planting. This graph illustrates the irrigation conscience during
    planting in the land Show All The graph shows the analysis of the soil moisture
    sensor at different strategies such as air, water, wet soil, and dry soil. The
    ranges of the moisture contented are discussed for the convenience to show the
    analysis as the graphical representation of the volumetric analysis. The output
    can be an analog signal and so we will get a value between 0 and 1023. The voltage
    where the sensor outputs vagariesconsequently to the water gratified in the soil.
    Figure7: Soil Moisture Sensor Readings at different strategies. This graph explains
    the volumetric contented of soil at different strategies. Show All When the soil
    is: MISTY: the output voltage shrinkages, DESICCATED: the output voltage rises.
    [13] Soil Moisture reading from 825 to 833 is when the soil moisture sensor was
    dipped in water. Soil Moisture reading from 463 to190 – 1023 is when soil moisture
    sensor was in air. Soil moisture reading from 604 to last 921 is when soil moisture
    is in soil. The soil is wet and the reading for the dry soil ranges from 972 to
    1015 is the values sensed by the soil moisture sensor. The soil moisture gratified
    may be articulated by weight as the ratio of the physique of water contemporary
    to the dry to the dry weight of the soil sample, or by capacity as ratio of capacity
    of water to the overall volume of the soil illustration. To determine any [10]
    of these ratios for a particular soil sample, the water mass must be strong-minded
    by drying the soil to continuous weight and measuring the soil sample mass after
    and before drying. The water physique (or weight) is the metamorphosis between
    the heaviness of the wet and oven dry samples. The principle for a dry soil illustration
    is the soil facsimile that has been desiccated to constant weight in oven at temperature
    between 100 – 110 °C (105 °C is typical). It gives the impression that this temperature
    assortment has been founded on water scorching temperature and does not deliberate
    the soil physical and chemical physical characteristics. The moisture satisfied
    is articulated in wet mass basis that is defined as the ratio between water physique
    and the physique of wet soil (θw) . SECTION VI. Conclusion and Future Enhancement
    As an essential principal part of the IoT, a sensor network enables us to interact
    with the real world objects. In this venture we are commerce with the sensor network
    scheme that permitsconcerningcultivation to the IoT. The connection sets up the
    links among agronomists, farms, and thus improves theaccuracy. The applications
    of IoT have been further extended to various areas in order to manage people’s
    production andproduction and living more accurately and dynamically and improve
    the relationship between human and environment. One of the most drastic situations
    ever faced is of scarcity of water that is drought. Hence if we are able to predict
    the drought situationmuch before it occurs, we will be able to save the damage
    before it occurs. The project thus described has a lot of scope in future. [12]The
    moisture sensor used here can also be used to detect the drought situation much
    before it occurs. The real time observing of the agricultural field was not done
    in the existing system where the labor cost was high, so real time monitoring
    of the cultivation field can be done using the IoT where the process can be viewed
    from anywhere and thus this increases the monitoring of the field at any instant
    with more Hence if the length of the sensor is increased to a specific height,
    then it can detect the drought situation much before it occurs. And this message
    can be given to all the nearby farmers so that they can take required measures
    well before facing the drastic consequences. The measures may be alternative sources
    of water such as water harvesting, reusing waste water in the fields rather than
    letting it water in the drains directly. In this way we can lead our country into
    a brighter future, hence our main motive to do good to the society and bring about
    a change can be achieved. Our future work will be focusing on interfacing various
    sensors with the proposed sensor network and the result will be stored in the
    cloud. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This Weighted

    Conference Location: Singapore SECTION I. Introduction Sustaining agricultural
    productivity, guaranteeing food-security, and enhancing economic growth in the
    face of climate variability, diminishing labour force, and changing soil conditions
    requires innovation in agriculture. In India, agriculture contributes 18% of the
    country''s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs more than 50% of the population
    [1]. Notwithstanding these contributions, the sector is under stress and the recent
    economic survey of the Indian government has pointed out the need to extract “more
    crop per drop” which indicates exploiting technology and good practices to enhance
    productivity per drop of water. While this is largely dependent on the irrigation
    system, recent developments in technology are being touted as solutions [2]. The
    real-time environmental parameters such as temperature, soil moisture, humidity,
    evapotranspiration, cropping cycles, and others influence the crop lifecycle.
    Resource utilization can be optimized by real-time monitoring of these parameters
    and taking corrective actions based on sensed information. In this backdrop, the
    Internet of Things (IoT) with has emerged as an enabler of agriculture automation
    [3]–[5]. The IoT uses recent advances in sensing, networking, and computing technologies
    to enable novel applications and services. The use of IoT for crop monitoring
    has been studied in [6]–[9]. Fusing crop statistical information and agricultural
    environmental information was studied in [10]. However, control functionalities
    were not studied in these investigation. The investigations in [11] and [12] proposed
    a framework with limited control functions. The role of IoT for controlling the
    water consumption in irrigation has been studied by many scientists as well. A
    simple irrigation system was studied in [13]. An advanced system was proposed
    in [14] that aims to transform traditional farming to modern one. The investigation
    in [15] proposed using wireless sensor networks for managing irrigation in agricultural
    farms. The framework proposed allowed user to interact with the data and consult
    in a comfortable way. An IoT based smart farm irrigation system was proposed in
    [16] wherein Zigbee was used for communication between sensor nodes and base station.
    While data was collected and processed in these investigation, combining cloud
    computing with IoT was not fully explored. This provides additional opportunities
    due to the service delivery models of the cloud. Recently significant efforts
    have been devoted to combine IoT and cloud computing [17], [19], [20] showed that
    the IoT benefits can be enhanced by combining it with cloud computing. The role
    of cloud-based IoT scheme for precision agriculture was studied in [18]. However,
    the final control aspect has not been considered. Similarly, optimization models
    for irrigation have been studied in [21] without discussions on monitoring and
    control. A review of the literature reveals that existing approaches on using
    IoT are restricted to monitoring and data-aggregation. Final control including
    optimization of resources has not been studied in the literature to our best knowledge.
    In this paper, we combine the IoT sensing and networking capability with cloud
    interfaces, use the data to study the optimal irrigation rates, and finally implement
    the computed flow rates by commanding a solenoid valve. Consequently, a comprehensive
    solution including sensing, networking, control, and optimization is proposed.
    Such a methodology has not been proposed for agricultural irrigation purposes
    to our best knowledge. The main contributions of the paper are: A smart irrigation
    system that uses IoT and cloud-connectivity to aggregate and store information,
    an optimization model to compute the optimal irrigation parameters, and final
    control implemented using solenoid valves. Design aspects of IoT hardware, software,
    and their integration along with networking as well as cloud connectivity are
    discussed. Demonstrate the control methodology and hardware using experiments/simulations.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the system
    architecture and design which describes the various components of the system.
    The optimization model for irrigation control is presented in Section III. Results
    and observations are presented in Section IV. Conclusions are drawn from the obtained
    results and analysis in Section V. SECTION II. System Architecture and Design
    Fig. 1: IoT architecture of the smart irrigation system Show All The IoT architecture
    used for implementing the precision irrigation system is shown in Fig. 1. The
    components of the architecture are listed in Tab. I. The components are selected
    based on cost-reliability analysis. While the low-cost sensors lead to reliability
    issues, they perform reasonably well for the application considered. In this work
    low cost soil moisture and flow sensors are used. The sensors send the data to
    the WEMOS D1 controller and the controller controls the flow using sensed information.
    The controller controls the solenoid valve through which the field is irrigated.
    The controller also controls the DC motor on/off state since the motor has to
    be on only when any one of the valve is in open state. The controller is connected
    to the internet through the GSM GPRS module. The internet connectivity is provided
    through GSM as broadband is not feasible in many rural agricultural areas, whereas
    more than 70% of the land in India is feasible with GSM based cellular network.
    The information retrieved from the field is used to control the irrigation system,
    and it is also stored in the cloud (Thingspeak) for further analysis. Remote monitoring
    of the field was provided through web interface and mobile interface. The farm
    is split into several sectors as depicted in Fig. 2, the water flows through different
    valves for each sector which are deployed with a set of sensors for monitoring
    and a solenoid valve as an actuator. The sectors are sort of control regimes for
    which the water can be irrigated. This helps organizing the irrigation and monitoring
    to meet the needs of the individual sectors, thereby better management can be
    achieved. Having described the architecture, we provide a succinct description
    of the different components used in the hardware. Fig. 2: Organization of agriculture
    land as sectors Show All Table I: Components of the architecture 1) WEMOS D1 Controller
    The D1 is an ESP8266 (Wi-Fi) based controller which is compatible with the Arduino
    IDE. The functions are same as the Arduino Uno controller, whereas the WEMOS has
    the ESP8266 module by default on the board hence reducing the complexity of interfacing
    an ESP8266 with Arduino Uno. ADCs(Analog to Digital convertors) were used to interface
    multiple analog sensors to the controller. 2) Solenoid Valve The traditional valves
    are replaced with solenoid valves to control the flow. The valve is operated either
    in ON/OFF mode and a pulse-width modulation approach is used to control the flow,
    i.e., the amount of flow is proportional to the time-period for which the valve
    remains in ON state over a given time period. A 24 V relay is used to turn ON/OFF
    the solenoid valve. 3) Soil Moisture Sensor In our design, YL69 series soil moisture
    sensor or probe measures the volumetric water content in the soil. Determining
    soil moisture is considered as an important task in agriculture to assist farmers
    manage the irrigation systems more effectively. Compared to other low cost sensor
    such as gypsum block sensors, these probes tender a rapid response time. Due to
    this reason the sensor is chosen and used in the proposed design. Placing the
    soil moisture sensor in the right place is very important, since a sector''s irrigation
    is controlled by the value of the soil moisture sensor deployed for that sector.
    The soil moisture sensor works between 3.3V and 5V power supply. The output value
    of the sensor is between 0 ohms to 1000 ohms. Based on the sensor reading the
    soil can be classified into Dry, Humid and wet. The soil moisture sensor used
    is connected to the analog pin of the controller through wire. The sensor range
    for determining the soil type is shown in Tab. II. Table II: Resistance range
    of soil moisture sensor 4) Flow Sensor In this system flow sensor (YF-201) is
    used to measure the amount of water utilized in the process of irrigation. The
    amount of water utilized has to be measured in the experimental setup for the
    traditional and automated irrigation methods so that comparison can be easily
    carried out. The water flow sensor is aligned in parallel with the water line,
    and a pinwheel inside the sensor is used for measuring the water irrigated through
    it. The water flow is measured in litres/second. 5) Data Transmission Transferring
    the collected information from the farm to the Internet is a major issue as internet
    connectivity through broadband to agricultural area is still an infeasible solution
    in more than 50% of the agricultural lands across India. In this work the data
    is transmitted using the GPRS internet connectivity available through the cellular
    network providers. The cellular network covers majority of the agricultural lands
    in India and with the emergence of 3G and 4G technology it is possible to transmit
    data quickly. Instead of using a GPRS module along with the controller, we have
    used a Wi-Fi hotspot device for data transmission from the controller to the internet
    as the transmission speed is high when using hot spot as compared with a GSM GPRS
    module of the controller. The use of WEMOS controller has reduced the complexity
    in interfacing an ESP8266 when compared to Arduino. The GSM module is used to
    send messages from the controller regarding the status of the field. Fig. 3: ThingSpeak
    web interface Show All Table III: Sample data stored in thingspeak A. Cloud-Based
    Remote Monitoring The Irrigation system is initiated based on the soil moisture
    sensor value. The field is irrigated automatically using the solenoid valve or
    sprinkler. The solenoid valve and the sprinkler were connected to the controller
    using relay switch. The data from the controller is transmitted to the Thingspeak
    cloud, and the data can be viewed using Thingspeak website. The user interface
    is a simple monitoring interface which shows the readings from the sensor, the
    solenoid valve status and the amount of water used. The screen shot of the ThingSpeak
    web interface is shown in Fig. 4 and the snippet of the data displayed is shown
    in Table III. Similarly the PH value of the soil, Humidity and temperature were
    also stored in cloud. Thingspeak cloud service is an easy to access service and
    has inbuilt lab view functions. Fig. 4 shows the Thingspeak Cloud Service Interface
    for a smart phone wherein the data are represented in charts. The data feeds can
    be stored in the Thingspeak along with the timestamp for further analysis and
    for providing real-time data visualization. Fig. 4: ThingSpeak interface for smart
    phone Show All SECTION III. Optimization Model Computing the minimum irrigation
    rates based on sensed information is a decision making problem requiring help
    of optimization tools. Therefore, we model the optimal irrigation problem as an
    optimization problem. We define the following: Definition 1 The difference between
    the planting and harvesting time is denoted as the irrigation period. Definition
    2 Maximal rainfall over the irrigation period denoted by R max is the upper bound
    on the rainfall during the period. Our objective is to minimize the irrigation
    of the water over a 24 hour horizon which is given by I= ∑ t =QΔt where Q denotes
    the flow and Δ unit time step used in the analysis. In addition, we aim to exploit
    the use of rain water, and soil moisture content. the objective is modelled as:

    problem and can be solved with open source solvers such as Gnu Linear Programming
    Kit on single-board computers such as BeagleBone Black. However, in our analysis,

    IV. Results A. Real-Time Experiments In our experiments, a pilot having four land
    sectors each 2×2 square feet were taken to test the method. One sector was irrigated
    using traditional method in which the water flow was controlled manually, and
    the other three (Automated Irrigation, Drip Irrigation, Sprinkler Irrigation)
    were irrigated with the automated method using sensors and actuators (solenoid
    valve, sprinkler, and Drip). The spinach named Amaranthus tricolor seeds was sown
    in even quantity and grown in the entire four land sector. Water flow sensor,
    soil moisture sensor, soil PH sensor, was installed in all the sectors. Weather
    sensors like humidity, temperature Sensor and rain sensor were deployed in common
    for all the four sectors. The actuators were connected to the controller using
    wired connection. The input to the sprinkler was given using a low pressure water
    pipe as the land sector taken for irrigation is small. The irrigation was done
    based on the moisture sensor value. Different moisture values are set for different
    crops, in the experimental set up the value was set to less than 300 ohms to 950
    ohms, if the value drops below 300 ohms then the solenoid valves were opened and
    the field is irrigated and if the value was greater than 950 ohms then the solenoid
    valves were closed. For drip irrigation automation, the solenoid valves were used
    to supply water to the drip irrigation tube. In the sprinkler irrigation system
    sprinkler is supplied with a low pressure water input as the experimental prototype
    is for demonstration purpose. The soil moisture metric used to automate the irrigation
    makes sure that the land is not dry at any point of time. The data is uploaded
    to the things speak cloud using write API key. The experiments were conducted
    for a period of 3 weeks. To test the effectiveness of the optimization approach,
    we first propose a moisture based control as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5: Moisture-based
    control Show All The following two scenarios were compared: Flow control based
    on moisture level with valve control, sprinkler control, and drip irrigation;
    Flow control using optimization approach with valve irrigation, sprinkler control,
    and drip irrigation; In the optimization model, the change in irrigation conditions
    correlate to change in the limits of the flow-rates Q(t) . B. Results with Heuristic
    Control The flows for a period of 3 weeks were used to study the effectiveness
    of the flow-based control. The results of all three automated irrigation methods
    were compared with conventional method. In Drip irrigation method the system is
    highly efficient saving around 24%, compared to 20% in sprinkler and 16% in Solenoid
    valve based automated irrigation. In this experimental prototype, deficient watering
    condition was eliminated as the water resources were sufficient throughout the
    experiment. Water deficit might occur when the system is implemented in the real
    agricultural field due to water scarcity. The data is stored in cloud with ease
    using the API funtions in thingspeak. The flow control over for a period of six
    days with flow-based control is shown in Fig. 6 shows that the drip irrigation
    the flow is relatively lower than other irrigation systems. C. Simulation Results
    with Optimization Based Control The flows for a period of 1 week with optimization
    based control was used to study the effectiveness of optimization based control
    for the three irrigation schemes. In drip irrigation method the method provided
    31.2% over conventional method and an increase in 7% savings over flow-based control.
    Similarly, in sprinkler irrigation, the savings were 26% and 22% in solenoid valve
    based control. Our simulations shows that optimization based control outperforms
    the flow-based control in terms of water savings. Fig. 6: Automated versus manual
    control with sprinkler system for flow-based control Show All Fig. 7: Automated
    versus manual control with sprinkler system for optimization-based control Show
    All D. Observations It was observed that the pH value of the soil decreases with
    an increase in moisture levels. The IoT and cloud-connectivity enhanced the data-aggregation
    and visualization capability significantly. Combining IoT, cloud-connectivity,
    and optimization models will help enhance water efficiency of the agriculture
    systems. The irrigation system was automated by connecting solenoid values which
    helped increase the agility of the control. SECTION V. Conclusions This investigation
    presented an automated irrigation system to reduce water utilization in agriculture
    by combining Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and optimization. The
    automated irrigation system is realized by deploying low-cost sensors to sense
    variables of interest such as pH, temperature, humidity, soil type and weather
    conditions. The data is stored in Thingspeak cloud service for monitoring and
    storage. Then an optimization model for reducing the water usage was proposed
    and constraints modelling the physical conditions were included. The optimal flow
    rate was determined solving the optimization model and it was shown that the flow
    rate can be automated using solenoid valves. The optimization-based control was
    compared with flow-based control and our results demonstrated that optimization
    models help in reducing the water consumption. Improving the optimization models
    and enhancing the IoT prototype are future course of this investigation. Authors

  description: Tracing the enantiomers of dinotefuran and its metabolite in bee products
    and relevant environmental matrices is vital because of the high toxicity of their
    racemates to bees. In this study, a statistical optimization strategy using three-dimensional
    response surface methodology for the enantioseparation of dinotefuran and its
    metabolite UF was developed by a novel supercritical fluid chromatography/tandem
    mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) technique. After direct evaluation of the chromatographic
    variables - co-solvent content, mobile phase flow rate, automated backpressure
    regulator pressure (ABPR), and column temperature - involved in the separation
    mechanism and assessment of the interactions among these variables, the optimal
    SFC-MS/MS working conditions were selected as a CO2/2% formic acid-methanol mobile
    phase, 1.9mL/min flow rate, 2009.8psi ABPR, and 26.0°C column temperature using
    an amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) chiral stationary phase under electrospray
    ionization positive mode. Baseline resolution, favorable retention, and high sensitivity
    of the two pairs of enantiomers were achieved in pollen, honey, water, and soil
    matrices within 4.5min. Additionally, the parameters affecting the dispersive
    solid-phase extraction procedure, such as the type and content of extractant or
    purification sorbents, were systematically screened to obtain better extraction
    yields of the enantiomers. Mean recoveries were between 78.3% and 100.2% with
    relative standard deviations lower than 8.0% in all matrices. The limits of quantification
    ranged from 1.0μg/kg to 12.5μg/kg for the dinotefuran and UF enantiomers. Furthermore,
    the developed method was effectively applied to authentic samples from a market,
    an irrigation canal, and a trial field, and the enantioselective dissipation of
    dinotefuran and UF in soil was demonstrated.

    spectrometry 1. Introduction There is growing evidence for declines in bee diversity
    and distribution due to extensive exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides, which
    has aroused great concern worldwide [1], [2], [3]. Dinotefuran, (EZ)-(RS)-1-methyl-2-nitro-3-(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl)
    guanidine, is a typical third generation neonicotinoid. It has been increasingly
    utilized in more than 20 countries, such as Japan, the United States, Korea, the
    European Union, and China [4]. The extraordinary insecticidal potency of this
    compound has been demonstrated toward both sucking pests, such as whiteflies,
    mealybugs, and plant hoppers in vegetables, fruit, turf, and rice crops, and disease
    vectors, especially in areas where mosquitoes are resistant to insecticides [5],
    [6]. However, dinotefuran is highly toxic to bees with a contact acute LD50 at
    48 h of more than 0.023 μg/bee and is highly potential to bioconcentration [7].
    The European Union has issued a temporary ban on neonicotinoid insecticides [8],
    and the United States has stated that new bee data must be provided for outdoor
    usage of neonicotinoids [9]. Oregon further restricted the application of dinotefuran
    to prevent a large killing of bees in July 2013 [10]. More interestingly, the
    molecular structure of dinotefuran contains an asymmetrically stereogenic center
    leading to a pair of enantiomers, (+)-dinotefuran and (–)-dinotefuran (Fig. 1A).
    It is the first chiral neonicotinoid insecticide and the existing toxicological
    characteristics only reflect the characteristics of the racemate. Accordingly,
    a solution to the issue of high toxicity to bees may lie at the enantiomer level
    because significant differences in biological activity have been verified between
    (+)-dinotefuran and (−)-dinotefuran [9], [10]. Furthermore, its metabolite UF
    ((RS)-1-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl) urea, Fig. 1B), which consists of
    a pair of enantiomers, (+)-UF and (–)-UF, also have chronic toxicity to bees [11].
    The sum of dinotefuran and UF was also recommended for the estimation of dietary
    intake and for compliance with the maximum residue limits in animals by the joint
    FAO/WHO meeting on pesticide residues [12]. It is generally known that bee products
    (e.g., pollen and honey) are important parts of our daily diet, and their safety
    is closely related to surrounding environmental matrices (e.g., water and soil).
    Until now, the detectability and residue levels of the two pairs of enantiomers
    in pollen, honey, water, and soil were unknown. Hardly any work has been performed
    on the chiral profiles of the dinotefuran and UF enantiomers likely due to the
    lack of the efficient and sensitive enantioseparation methods. A high performance
    liquid chromatographic method coupled with diode array detection was developed
    for the chiral separation and degradation of the parent in greenhouse vegetables
    in our earlier study [13], [14]. However, it still did not meet the requirements
    of fast separations, high resolution, high sensitivity and low solvent load for
    modern analytical chemistry. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Chemical
    structures of the enantiomers of dinotefuran (A) and UF (B). Here, dinotefuran
    and its chiral metabolite UF were chosen as “chiral probes” to develop a green,
    rapid and sensitive enantioseparation method in pollen, honey, water, and soil
    by eco-friendly SFC–MS/MS based on a three-dimensional response surface methodology.
    The supercritical fluid CO2, which is nontoxic and has low viscosity and high
    diffusivity, contributed greatly to improving the separation efficiency and reducing
    the organic solvent usage. The tandem MS spectrometer overcame the traditional
    incompatibility, offering high resolution and narrow peaks. A central composite
    design for the SFC–MS/MS working parameters took the place of the conventional
    one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) process, which invariably failed to obtain exact
    conclusions because the interactions between factors were not taken into account
    [15], [16]. The optimum experimental conditions were finally identified using
    response surface profiles with Derringer''s desirability function given from mathematical
    models. As a consequence, the developed method was applied to authentic samples
    from a market, an irrigation canal, and our trial field. The current report challengingly
    applied the response surface methodology to develop an SFC–MS/MS method for the
    chiral analysis of dinotefuran and UF in pollen, honey, water, and soil; this
    approach not only provided a novel reference for the development of chiral resolution
    but also offered basic data on potential solutions to the high toxicity of racemic
    dinotefuran to pollinators. 2. Experimental 2.1. Chemicals and reagents Standards
    of dinotefuran racemate (100% purity) and UF (99.5% purity) were obtained from
    Mitsui Chemicals Agro (Tokyo, Japan). Single enantiomers of dinotefuran and UF
    (>97.9% optical purity) were prepared in our laboratory. Analytical grade acetonitrile,
    acetic acid, triethylamine, ammonium formate, ammonium acetate, ammonium hydroxide,
    sodium acetate and anhydrous magnesium sulfate were purchased from Beihua Fine
    Chemicals (Beijing, China). Chromatographic grade methanol, acetonitrile, iso-propanol,
    ethanol, n-butanol, and n-hexane were obtained from Honeywell International (Morristown,
    NJ, USA). Mass grade formic acid was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham,
    MA, USA). Ultrapure water was prepared from a Milli-Q system (Bedford, MA, USA).
    CO2 (99.999% purity), N2 (99.95% purity) and Ar (99.999% purity) were acquired
    from Haike Yuanchang Gas (Beijing, China). Primary/secondary amines (PSA, 40–60
    μm), C18 (40–60 μm), and graphitized carbon black (GCB, 120–400 Mesh) were purchased
    from Bonna-Agela Technologies (Tianjin, China). Multi-walled carbon nanotubes
    (MWCNTs) with mean external diameters of <8 nm, 10–20 nm, and 20–30 nm were purchased
    from Boyu Technologies (Beijing, China). 2.2. Instrumentation and calculation
    An ACQUITY UltraPerformance Convergence Chromatography (UPC2) system (Waters,
    Milford, MA, USA) equipped with an ACQUITY UPC2 convergence manager, an ACQUITY
    UPC2 binary solvent manager, an ACQUITY UPC2 sample manager-FL, and an ACQUITY
    UPC2 column manager was used for the enantioseparation of the dinotefuran and
    UF enantiomers. Amylose-based chiral Trefoil AMY1_2.1 (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.5 μm,
    Waters) and AMY1_3.0 (150 mm × 3.0 mm, 2.5 μm, Waters) columns; Chiralpak IA-3
    (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm, Daicel, Tokyo, Japan), IA-5 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Daicel),
    ID-3 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm, Daicel), IE-3 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm, Daicel), and
    IF-3 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm, Daicel) columns; a Lux Amylose-2 (150 mm × 2 mm,
    3 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) column; cellulose-based chiral Trefoil CEL1_2.1
    (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 2.1 μm, Daicel), CEL1_3.0 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3.0 μm, Daicel),
    CEL2_2.1 (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.5 μm, Waters), and CEL2_3.0 (150 mm × 3.0 mm, 2.5
    μm, Waters) columns; Chiralpak IB-3 (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm, Daicel) and IC-3 (150
    mm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm, Daicel) columns; and Lux cellulose-1 (150 mm × 2 mm, 3 μm,
    Phenomenex) and cellulose-2 (150 mm × 2 mm, 3 μm, Phenomenex) columns were each
    evaluated individually in different types of specifications. The two pairs of
    enantiomers were ultimately separated on Trefoil AMY1_3.0 chiral column coated
    with amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) with a 3 mm particle size. Gradient
    elution was used from 2% to 11.9% methanol/formic acid (88/2, v/v, co-solvent
    B) in CO2 (primary solvent A) over 0.2 min, held at 11.9% B for 3.3 min, and then
    equilibrated by 2% B for 1 min, providing a total analysis time of 4.5 min. The
    pressure of the automated backpressure regulator (ABPR), the column temperature,
    the sample manager temperature, and the injection volume were set at 2009.8 psi,
    26 °C, 4 °C, and 1 μL, respectively. A triple quadrupole Xevo-TQD mass spectrometer
    (Waters) equipped with an electrospray ionization source was adopted to quantify
    the enantiomers of dinotefuran and UF. Higher sensitivity was obtained in positive
    mode with a 3500 V capillary voltage, 150 °C source temperature, and 500 °C desolvation
    temperature. The nebulizer gas was N2, and the collision gas was Ar with 2 × 10−3
    mbar in the T-wave cell. Cone and desolvation flows (N2) of 50 and 1000 L/h were
    applied, respectively. MS detection was conducted in multiple reactions monitoring
    (MRM) mode by measuring the transition of the precursor to product ions for the
    dinotefuran and UF enantiomers. A dwell time of 163 ms per ion pair was selected
    to maintain the high sensitivity. For dinotefuran, the cone voltage was 16 V.
    The transitions m/z 203.2 → 129.1 and m/z 203.2 → 157.1 were used for quantification
    and confirmation when the collision energies were set at 10 and 9 V, respectively.
    The ion ratio was 1.5. For UF, and the cone voltage, quantitative and qualitative
    transitions, and ion ratio were 24 V, m/z 159.1 → 102.0 (collision energy, 10
    V) and m/z 159.1 → 67.1 (collision energy, 16 V), and 5.8, respectively [11].
    Masslynx NT v.4.1 SCN 882 was used for instrument scontrol and data acquisition
    and processing. The resolution (Rs) and retention factor (k) of the enantiomers
    were calculated using Empower 2 chromatography data software (Waters). 2.3. Sample
    preparation 2.3.1. Bee products Pollen and honey from Brassica napus Linn. were
    obtained from the Bee Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
    Science (Beijing, China) without application history of dinotefuran. Representative
    portions of 2 ± 0.1 g were weighed into a 50 mL PTFE centrifuge tube with working
    solution mixtures of dinotefuran and UF enantiomers for the recovery assay. The
    tubes were vortexed for 3 min, capped, and stored for 2 h at room temperature
    to distribute the pesticide evenly. Five milliliters of ultrapure water was added,
    followed by 5 mL of acetonitrile/acetic acid (99/1, v/v). The tubes were vortexed
    vigorously with an XW-80A Vortex (Kirin Medical Instrument, Haimen, China) for
    5 min at maximum speed. Four grams of anhydrous magnesium sulfate and 1.5 g of
    sodium acetate were added to the mixture, which was subsequently vortexed for
    another 1 min. The tube was centrifuged for 5 min at 2810 × g relative centrifugal
    force (RCF) using a SIGMA 3–15 centrifuge (SIGMA Laborzentrifugen GmbH, Osterode,
    Germany). Then, 1 mL of the supernatant was transferred into a single-use centrifuge
    tube, which contained 50 mg PSA, 50 mg C18, 10 mg GCB and 150 mg anhydrous magnesium
    sulfate for pollen and 50 mg PSA, 50 mg C18 and 150 mg anhydrous magnesium sulfate
    for honey samples. The samples were vortexed again for 30 s and centrifuged for
    5 min at 3290 × g RCF using a SIGMA 1–15 centrifuge (SIGMA Laborzentrifugen GmbH).
    The resulting acetonitrile layer was filtered through a 0.22 μm nylon syringe
    filter into an autosampler vial for SFC–MS/MS injection. 2.3.2. Environmental
    samples Water and soil that contained none of the target enantiomers were obtained
    from the surrounding areas of the bee products place of origin. The water samples
    were collected from surface water, and the floating debris was filtered out. The
    soil samples were collected at depths of 0–15 cm, air-dried, and passed through
    a 2 mm sieve before analysis. Blank samples (5 ± 0.1 g) were weighed into 50 mL
    centrifuge tubes. Then, 5 mL of acetonitrile/acetic acid (99/1, v/v) was added
    before 5 mL of ultrapure water was added to the soil. After the tubes were vortexed
    for 5 min, 4 g of sodium acetate was added to the water samples, and 1.5 g of
    sodium acetate and 6 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate were added to the soil.
    The vortex step was repeated for 1 min, and followed by centrifugation for 5 min.
    For the water samples, 1.5 mL of the acetonitrile layer was withdrawn, filtered
    through a 0.22 μm filter and injected directly. For soil, 1.5 mL of the supernatant
    was transferred into a single-use tube, and 50 mg of C18 and 150 mg of anhydrous
    magnesium sulfate were added. Afterwards, the tubes were vortexed for another
    30 s and centrifuged for 5 min. The supernatant was finally passed through a filter
    for SFC–MS/MS analysis. 2.4. Experimental design A second-order central composite
    design was implemented to optimize the SFC–MS/MS working parameters, which consisted
    of four independent variables: co-solvent content, mobile phase flow rate, ABPR,
    and column temperature; accordingly, the resolution (Rsd and RsU), retention factors
    (kd and kU, mean value of k of each enantiomers pair), and signal-to-noise ratio
    (SNRd and SNRU, mean value of SNR of each enantiomers pair) of the dinotefuran
    and UF enantiomers were established as response criteria. The first step was to
    confirm the number of experiments. A total of 27 randomized combinations were
    carried out to estimate the model coefficients and the experimental error of the
    models. Specifically, 16 factorial runs (2x, x is the number of studied variables),
    8 axial runs (2x, on axes at a distance of ±α from the center), and three replicates
    for the central point were assessed [17], [18]. Each run was on the basis of the
    mean value of three replicates obtained on different days with the same instrument.
    The second step was to find a suitable approximation for the true functional relationship
    between each of the responses and the set of independent variables. As shown in
    Eq. (1), the quadratic polynomial model is the most current and frequently used
    [19], [20]: (1) where x represents the independent variables and y refers to the
    response. Each y was assessed as a function of x1 (co-solvent content), x2 (flow
    rate of mobile phase), x3 (ABPR), and x4 (column temperature) and was calculated
    as the sum of a constant, the four first-order effects terms (x1, x2, x3 and x4),
    six interaction effects terms (x1x2, x1x3, x1x4, x2x3, x2x4, and x3x4) and four
    second-order effects terms ( , , and ) in the mathematical model. The regression
    coefficients b are the parameters of the model that were iteratively optimized
    in the subsequent study. The third step was the analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
    the determination of the significant factors with Rsd, RsU, kd, kU, SNRd and SNRU.
    The validation of the mathematical model was assessed by the lack of fit (LOF)
    and the coefficient of determination and its statistical significance, which was
    determined using the F-test at a 95% probability and p < 0.05 [21]. For the graphical
    interpretation of the interactions, three-dimensional response surface plots were
    highly recommended within the statistical design [22]. Variables giving interaction
    terms with significant contributions to the fitted models were chosen for the
    axes of the response surface plots to account for the curvature of the surfaces.
    Searching for the specific values of the four variables required the commonly
    used technique of Derringer''s desirability function (Eq. (2)), which can convert
    multiple response optimizations into a single-response one [23], [24]: (2) where
    n is the number of responses and di is the partial desirability function of each
    response. The statistical design and data processing of the results were performed
    using Statistica 10.0 (StatSoft, Tulsa, USA). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. SFC–MS/MS
    optimization using statistical analysis 3.1.1. CSPs and CO2-based mobile phase
    composition In total, sixteen chiral columns – Trefoil CEL1_2.1, CEL1_3.0, CEL2_2.1,
    CEL2_3.0, AMY1_2.1, and AMY1_3.0; Chiralpak IA-3, IA-5, IB-3, IC-3, ID-3, IE-3,
    and IF-3; Lux cellulose-1, cellulose-2, and amylose-2 – were evaluated in terms
    of the enantioseparation of dinotefuran and UF. The central point of the central
    composite design with the co-solvent methanol was employed as the initial chromatographic
    conditions (Table S1). As shown in Fig. 2, the amylose-based chiral columns (Fig.
    2A–H) were better than the cellulose-based chiral columns (Fig. 2I–P) overall
    for the separation of the dinotefuran and UF enantiomers. Trefoil CEL1_2.1 and
    CEL1_3.0, Chiralpak IB-3 and IC-3, and Lux cellulose-1 and amylose-2 showed no
    separation indication of any of the dinotefuran and UF enantiomers. Chiralpak
    ID-3, IE-3, and IF-3 were only enantioselective for the enantiomers of dinotefuran,
    and Trefoil CEL2_2.1 and CEL2_3.0 and Lux cellulose-2 preferred the UF enantiomers.
    Trefoil AMY1_3.0, which consisted of amylose tris-(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate)
    coated onto 2.5 μm silica gel beads, exhibited the optimal selectivity for the
    two pairs of enantiomers of dinotefuran and UF. Better k values were achieved
    on the Trefoil AMY1_3.0 column featuring a 3 mm internal diameter compared to
    the AMY1_2.1 column (2.1 mm internal diameter) with which a negative resolution
    was observed, similar to the other two Trefoil columns CEL1 and CEL2. The decrease
    in resolution obtained with Chiralpak IA-3 to IA-5 indicated that a positive correlation
    between smaller particle size and column efficiency existed. These results confirmed
    that the type of CSPs had the strongest influence on the enantioseparation of
    dinotefuran and UF. Electron-donating methyl groups on the phenyl ring of the
    carbamate derivative, steric repulsion and electronegative atoms (N and O) in
    the analyte molecules also facilitated the enantioselective interactions [25],
    [26], [27]. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Effects of chiral stationary

    °C column temperature under the same MS detection). Five of the other co-solvents
    including acetonitrile, iso-propanol, ethanol, n-butanol, and n-hexane were investigated
    individually with Trefoil AMY1_3.0 for the resolution and retention of the dinotefuran
    and UF enantiomers under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, one or both
    unfavorable values of Rs and SNR of the two pairs of enantiomers were obtained
    except with methanol and ethanol. Of the two, the former (Fig. 3A) had better
    resolution and shorter retention times than the latter (Fig. 3B), especially for
    the dinotefuran enantiomers. The elution strength of the six co-solvents were
    in the following order: methanol > ethanol > isopropanol > n-butanol > acetonitrile
    > n-hexane. On this basis, various additives in methanol were also investigated:
    formic acid (0.1%, v/v), ammonium formate (10 mM), ammonium acetate (10 mM), ammonium
    hydroxide (0.1%, v/v), and a combination of formic acid (0.1%) and ammonium acetate
    (10 mM). Hardly any change in the resolution of the dinotefuran and UF enantiomers
    were observed due to the additives, and a higher SNR for the enantiomers was obtained
    using 0.1% formic acid in methanol. Furthermore, different proportions of formic
    acid (0%, 0.2%, and 0.3%, v/v) in methanol were studied, and the best signal response
    was achieved with a 0.2% content. Considering the above results, the Trefoil AMY1_3.0
    chiral column and a 0.2% formic acid–methanol co-solvent, along with the remaining
    SFC–MS/MS variables, were examined using the central composite design procedure.

    respectively. Chromatographic conditions: 2.8 mL/min flow rate; gradient from
    2% to 11.9% B over 0.2 min, held at 11.9% B for 3.3 min, and equilibrated at 2%
    B for 1 min; 2000 psi ABPR; and 30 °C column temperature under the same MS detection).
    3.1.2. Mobile phase percentage, flow rate, ABPR, and column temperature The central
    composite design allowed the optimization of the effects of the co-solvent percentage,
    mobile phase flow rate, ABPR, and column temperature with an alpha for rotatability
    (α = 2.0). As outlined in Table S1, the co-solvent percentage was varied from
    5% to 25%, and the mobile phase flow rate was ranged from 1.0 mL/min to 3.0 mL/min;
    1500–2500 psi and 20–40 °C were used for the ABPR and column temperature, respectively.
    An ANOVA summary provided sufficient data to fit to the mathematical relationship
    between each response and the four variables within a level of confidence of 95%.
    None of the LOF values were significant at p > 0.05, indicating that mathematical
    models fit the responses well. High coefficients of determination were 0.9311,
    0.9761, 0.9918, 0.9949, 0.9278, and 0.9443 for Rsd, RsU, kd, kU, SNRd and SNRU,
    respectively, ensuring a satisfactory adjustment of the quadratic regression model
    with the experimental data. According to Eq. (1), the quadratic polynomial can
    be clarified as follows, where only terms found statistically significant (p <
    0.05) were included: Obviously, the co-solvent content (x1), flow rate (x2), ABPR
    (x3), and column temperature (x4) affected the Rsd, kd, SNRd, and SNRU values
    significantly, except x4 for kd, x3 for SNRd, and x2 for SNRU. The percentage
    of co-solvent and flow rate of the mobile phase were also significant first-order
    factors of RsU and kU. For the second-order effects terms, the square of the co-solvent
    percentage ( ), flow rate ( ), ABPR ( ), and column temperature ( ) were significant
    for SNRd and SNRU, whereas they were not significant for Rsd, except , and for
    RsU, except and . The square of the co-solvent content and mobile phase flow rate
    also had significant quadratic correlations with both kd and kU. The interaction-terms
    showed no significant effect on any of the responses, except x1x2 and x1x3 for
    kd and x1x2 for RsU and kU. The visible trends in x1x2 and x1x3 to locate the
    optimum conditions of RsU, kd and kU were finally assessed by the three-dimensional
    response surface plots (Fig. 4). Thereafter, the optimum variables values for
    the SFC–MS/MS working conditions were identified by the overall results and calculated
    from the Derringer''s desirability function given in Eq. (2). The promising enantioseparation
    of the dinotefuran (Rsd = 3.5, td1 = 2.7 min, td2 = 3.2 min) and UF (RsU = 1.9,
    tU1 = 1.9 min, tU2 = 2.1 min) enantiomers was achieved with the following experimental
    conditions: 11.9 percentage of 0.2% formic acid–methanol in CO2 (v/v), 1.9 mL/min
    flow rate of the mobile phase, 2009.8 psi ABPR and 26.0 °C column temperature.

    (%) versus the flow rate (mL/min) and of kd (B) by plotting the interaction of
    the co-solvent (%) versus the ABPR (psi). 3.1.3. Post-column compensation A post-column
    compensation of 0.1% formic acid in methanol (v/v) was added by an auxiliary pump
    (Waters 515 pump) to obtain higher ionization efficiency in the electrospray ionization
    source without poor peak shape of the pre-column additive for chiral separation
    [28]. Different flow rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mL/min were evaluated. The
    flow rate had little, if any, effect on the peak shapes of the dinotefuran and
    UF enantiomers, and the highest SNR for the four enantiomers was achieved at 0.1
    mL/min. These results are in agreement with those found in our previous studies
    [29], [30]. This can be explained by the fact that the attenuation of the target
    enantiomers from the compensation solvent at high flow rates outweighed the ionization
    enhancement effect from formic acid. 3.2. Elution order of the dinotefuran and
    UF enantiomers As shown in Fig. S1, the elution order of the dinotefuran and UF
    enantiomers was identified as (–)-UF (1.9 min), (+)-UF (2.1 min), (+)-dinotefuran
    (2.7 min), and (–)-dinotefuran (3.2 min). The measure details can be found in
    the supplementary material. 3.3. Extraction and purification development Polar
    enantiomers are always difficult to recover, which is more challenging if their
    metabolites are present. Acetonitrile with 2% (v/v) triethylamine or acetic acid
    added had positive extraction efficiencies toward the dinotefuran and UF racemates
    [11], [31]. In the current study, the effects of 2% triethylamine-acetonitrile,
    2% acetic acid-acetonitrile, and pure acetonitrile were investigated on the extraction
    yields of the dinotefuran and UF enantiomers in water at fortifications of 10-fold
    LOQ. In addition, different contents (1%, 2% and 3%, v/v) of acetic acid in acetonitrile
    were evaluated before the improved recoveries were obtained using 2% acetic acid
    in acetonitrile. The best recoveries of the assay ranged from 88.2% to 93.8% in
    water when 1% acetic acid–acetonitrile were used simultaneously without any purifying
    agents (Fig. 5A). Satisfactory recoveries were maintained for the other three
    matrices with the same extractant. Accordingly, 1% acetic acid–acetonitrile and
    nine single or double purification sorbents from either conventional sources (50
    mg PSA, 50 mg C18, 10 mg GCB, 50 mg PSA + 50 mg C18, 50 mg PSA + 10 mg GCB, 50
    mg PSA + 50 mg C18 + 10 mg GCB) or MWCNTs (5 mg < 8 nm, 10–20 nm, and 20–30 nm)
    were assessed systematically in pollen, honey, and soil, respectively. As shown
    in Fig. 5B, 50 mg PSA, 50 mg C18 and 10 mg GCB gave the best recoveries of 89.4–89.9%
    and 80.3–81.1% for the enantiomers of dinotefuran and UF, respectively, in pollen
    at a tenfold LOQ spiking level. For honey, 50 mg of PSA and C18 gave suitable
    recoveries of 85.2–87.6% for dinotefuran enantiomers and 84.4–86.1% for UF enantiomers,
    whereas 50 mg of C18 was selected for soil with recoveries of 92.2–93.7% and 87.1–88.0%
    for the enantiomers of dinotefuran and UF at the same spiking level. Download

    using different additives in acetonitrile in water (A) and 1% acetic acid-acetonitrile
    with different purification sorbents in pollen (B) at tenfold LOQ fortification.
    The extraction efficiency increased from using pure acetonitrile to the addition
    of 1–3% acetic acid. However, a decrease was observed using the additive triethylamine.
    These results were in contrast to those found by Kamel, possibly due to the usage
    of C18 solid-phase extraction cartridges as the cleanup procedure [11]. The strong
    affinities of PSA for carbohydrates, C18 for apolar compounds, and GCB for pigments
    facilitated the cleanup of interferences in the studied matrices [32]. 3.4. Analytical
    performance Blank assays of honey, pollen, water, and soil samples were conducted
    to verify the specificity of the method, and no interferences occurred at the
    retention times of the target enantiomers (Fig. S2). Linearity was evaluated by
    standard solutions and matrix-matched calibration curves, which were diluted using
    methanol and blank sample extracts, respectively, with the same concentrations
    gradient at 5, 10, 50, 100, 200, 350, and 500 μg/L for racemic dinotefuran (2.5,
    5, 25, 50, 100, 175, and 250 μg/L of each dinotefuran enantiomer) and at 1, 2,
    10, 20, 40, 70, and 100 μg/L for racemic UF (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 35, and 50 μg/L
    of each UF enantiomer). Good linearity was observed with mean correlation coefficients
    between 0.9962 and 0.9999 (Table 1). Matrix effects (MEs) were evaluated using
    Eq. (3) [33]: (3) where Sm and Ss are the slopes of the calibration curves obtained
    in matrix and in solvent, respectively. Significant signal suppression (≤−10%,
    using acetonitrile as the reference) was observed for the enantiomers of dinotefuran
    and UF in all of the matrices, except dinotefuran enantiomers in honey (+25% to
    +28%) and soil (−7% to −9%). Consequently, the external matrix-matched standards
    were selected for the accurate quantitation of the two pairs of enantiomers in
    different samples. Table 1. Linear regression parameters and recoveries for the

    −27 1.0 81.0 ± 5.4 87.1 ± 3.1 92.6 ± 3.2 a The calibration range was 2.5–250 μg/L
    for dinotefuran enantiomers and 0.5–50 μg/L for UF enantiomers. The LODs of the
    dinotefuran and UF enantiomers, determined at SNR = 3 under the above conditions,
    ranged from 0.5 μg/kg to 2.5 μg/kg in pollen and honey and 0.3–1.8 μg/kg in water
    and soil. The LOQs, which were taken as the lowest concentrations level validated
    with satisfactory recoveries between 70% and 120% and relative standard deviations
    (RSD) less than 20%, were estimated to be 5.0–12.5 μg/kg for the dinotefuran enantiomers
    and 1.0–2.5 μg/kg for the UF enantiomers in the four matrices. The recovery study
    was carried out to investigate the trueness and precision of the described method
    in spiked samples at three concentration levels (LOQ, 10-fold LOQ, and 50-fold
    LOQ) in five replications. Mean recoveries ranged from 79.2% to 88.9% with RSD
    ≤ 8.0% in pollen and from 80.5% to 90.6% with RSD ≤ 6.2% in honey, whereas they
    were between 78.3% and 100.2% with RSDs of 1.9–4.7% in water and between 81.0%
    and 98.1% with RSDs of 2.8–6.3% in soil. These results demonstrated that this
    method could achieve satisfactory precision and trueness for the enantioselective
    analysis of dinotefuran and UF enantiomers in pollen, honey, water, and soil matrices.
    Fig. S2A–D shows typical SFC–MS/MS (MRM) chromatograms of the minimum fortifications
    in different matrices. The stability of stock standard and matrix-matched solutions
    of the dinotefuran and UF enantiomers were also tested weekly. No significant
    differences (p > 0.05, 95% confidence limit, SPSS v20) were observed over six
    months using Student''s paired t-test. 3.5. Practical application Ten pollen and
    honey samples were purchased from a local market (Beijing, China). Five water
    samples were collected from the Jingmi irrigation canal (Beijing, China). Soil
    samples were taken from a trial field (Shandong, China) at a specified time after
    treatment with a 20% dinotefuran soluble powder at the recommended dosage of 225
    g a.i./ha (gram of active ingredient per hectare) according to “Guidelines for
    Pesticide Residue Field Trials” (NY/T 788-2004) issued by the Ministry of Agriculture,
    People''s Republic of China [34]. All of the samples were prepared with the streamlined
    procedure specified in Section 2.3 and analyzed under the same SFC–MS/MS conditions.
    The results showed that neither of the enantiomers was detected in pollen or honey.
    Two positive water samples containing enantiomers of dinotefuran at 6.1–10.5 μg/L
    and 7.4–8.5 μg/L were detected. As shown in Table 2, the dinotefuran and UF enantiomers
    were detected at 519.7–603.3 and 1.3–1.4 μg/kg after double application and 718.0–794.7
    and 2.9–3.1 μg/kg were detected after triplicate application in soil, respectively.
    More interestingly, the enantiomer fractions (EF) of dinotefuran and UF ranged
    from 0.53 to 0.54 and 0.52, respectively, indicating that the disposition and
    biotransformation of the parent to its metabolite may be enantioselective in soil
    and need to be verified in follow-up studies. Table 2. Field-incurred residue

    analytical method was developed for the simultaneous separation and determination
    of dinotefuran and its metabolite UF enantiomers in pollen, honey, water, and
    soil through the application of a three-dimensional response surface methodology.
    By investigating the main and interaction effects of the independent variables
    on chromatographic parameters, the two pairs of enantiomers were qualified and
    quantified with good resolution (Rs ≥ 1.9) and efficiency (in 4.5 min). The LOQs
    of the enantiomers of dinotefuran and UF were as low as 5.0 and 1.0 μg/kg, respectively,
    demonstrating the high sensitivity of the method. Typical response surfaces drawn
    from the significant regression models helped visualize the tendencies of the
    optimum conditions inside the design. Satisfactory validation criteria and application
    to real samples of a market, irrigation canal and trail field indicated that the
    proposed methodology could be a suitable alternative to trace these isomers in
    bee products and relevant environmental matrices. Acknowledgment This work was

    Introduction Stockpile or heap leaching for metal recovery from low-grade ore
    deposits, such as copper, nickel, zinc, uranium, gold and silver ores, increases
    in importance at a time when demand for metals is continuing to rise. As available
    metal head values degrade, efficient leaching of large quantities of low-grade
    metal deposits becomes increasingly essential. In today’s operations, expanding
    heap leach practices see the size of heaps grow larger, increasing lift heights
    to reduce the amount of land impacted by mining, leaching of run-of-mine ore and
    crushed ore and leach solution rates designed to optimize metal recovery and chemical
    consumption. Recovery of the target metal can range from approximately 30% for
    some difficult to leach sulfide copper ores to over 90% for easier oxide gold
    ores. Thus, a computational tool to support operational analysis by the engineer
    to reduce operational costs and maximize recovery is increasingly appealing. Building
    a computational model that incorporates the physics and chemistry involved in
    the heap leach process, with stockpiles of width and depth of hundreds of meters
    and timescales that may be months and years, offers a considerable challenge.
    The basic process, applying a reactive solution to a stockpile of low-grade ore
    and collecting the dissolved metal in the recovered leach solution, is simple
    in concept. However, leach systems are very complex physically and chemically,
    and the variability between different ores and between samples (i.e., mineral
    concentrations, local blockages, and impurities) makes it difficult to accurately
    predict the behavior of a particular system unless the model is calibrated against
    each specific ore. Once the model is calibrated for a specific ore type, then
    it is possible to determine trends and indicators towards improving leaching at
    the industrial scale. Computational models have the advantage of being repeatable
    and fast – simulations of hundreds of days of column tests can take place in a
    few minutes, whilst years of whole heap leach can be delivered within hours. A
    helpful general description of leach modeling requirements has recently been given
    by Petersen (2010). Developing computational tools that allow different leach
    strategies to be explored and optimized is a challenging task. There has been
    an enduring interest for over 30 years in the development of mathematical models
    of heap leach processes to provide effective engineering management tools (Bartlett,
    1998). In the past few years, several models based on computational fluid dynamic
    (CFD) platforms have been reported in the literature, including Leahy et al.,
    2005, Leahy et al., 2006, Leahy et al., 2007, Leahy and Schwarz, 2009. Flow models
    have been developed by Cariaga et al., 2005, Cariaga et al., 2007 and an analytical
    model developed by Mellado and Cisternas, 2008, Mellado et al., 2011a, Mellado
    et al., 2011b. Heap bioleaching has been considered by Bouffard, 2008, Bouffard
    and Dixon, 2009, Petersen and Dixon, 2007 amongst others. This paper builds upon
    a CFD based model that combines true heap geometry with all aspects of the various
    physical, chemical and biological processes present in a heap as a series of sub
    models to provide a comprehensive solution (Bennett et al., 2006, Bennett et al.,
    2008a, Bennett et al., 2008b, Bennett et al., 2012b, Cross et al., 2006, McBride
    et al., 2006, McBride et al., 2012a, McBride et al., 2012b). Over the past years
    there has been much interest in developing models of all or part of a heap leaching
    system to enable the design and optimization of the leaching process. Due to the
    highly non-linear and complex suite of reactions occurring during the leach process,
    the influence of small changes in operating parameters can lead to high uncertainty
    in the effect on recovery. Many modeling approaches have been applied to the heap
    leaching process and process sensitivity analysis performed to investigate the
    effect of changing operation variables. Dixon and Hendrix (1993), developed a
    mathematical model for use in the design and scale up of heap leaching processes.
    Mellado et al., 2011a, Mellado et al., 2011b, Mellado et al., 2012 presented analytical
    models to investigated optimal flow rates and investigates sensitivity of input
    parameters to the response of the process in applications where scale-up is necessary.
    One of the key challenges when modeling heap leach scenarios is characterization
    of the ores and parameterization of the model in order to utilize the model as
    an investigative tool. Although a computational model can simulate days, months
    of leaching in minutes, the calibration of the model can be a lengthy process
    requiring many simulation runs. The focus of this paper is to show how the model
    can be employed, with characterized and calibrated ore data, to understand which
    process parameters affect the recovery and to what extent. The paper also details
    an optimization tool that has been incorporated into the CFD model to allow automated
    searching for multiple ‘best fit’ parameter values, thus reducing the calibration
    times and optimizing the ‘fit’ of the model. The optimizer tool is a simple automated
    ‘best fit’ search, which makes small changes to each parameter and determines
    if the change improves or worsens the quality of fit of the variables under investigation.
    The advantage of this type of optimizer is that it is extremely robust for a highly
    non-linear system but the disadvantage is that it requires many automated simulation
    runs. Examples of model calibrated and predicted results are shown for sulfide
    ore and for a multi-material oxide ore. In any practical investigation, there
    are really two essential components – one concerns the calibration of the ore
    complex (for which the above mentioned tools are devised) and the sensitivity
    analysis of the target commercial heap – what influences the effectiveness of
    its operation. In the final part of this paper, sensitivity analysis on process
    operational parameters on a commercial copper sulfide leach heap, for which adequate
    data is in the public domain, is presented to show how the calibrated simulation
    tools might be employed. 2. Heap leach model The general heap leach model is implemented
    within a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) multi-physics software framework.
    A detailed description of the mathematical models and algorithms is given by (Bennett
    et al., 2012b) for copper sulfide ores and for oxide ore (McBride et al., 2012b).
    The host code, PHYSICA, provides a three-dimensional finite volume unstructured
    mesh modular framework for multi-physics modeling (Croft et al., 1995). The framework
    supplies generic routines to discretise a general transport equation over a solution
    domain using cell-centred approximations over an arbitrarily complex three dimensional
    mesh comprised of a mix of tetrahedral, wedge and hexahedral elements. 2.1. Liquid–gas-thermal
    transport Flow through variably saturated porous media is typically characterized
    by the Richards’ equation. Saturated and unsaturated liquid flow have individually
    been well described but modeling systems containing both saturated and unsaturated
    regions offers considerable challenges. A computational procedure for handling
    both saturated and unsaturated conditions in the same environment has been developed
    (McBride et al., 2006). The procedure is based on a transformation method and
    is fully integrated into the unstructured context within the PHYSICA code. In
    addition to the liquid solution flow, air may be circulated through the heap.
    The model solves the gas phase transport and makes the assumption that the liquid
    flow influences the gas flow but the gas flow does not directly influence the
    fluid flow. Gas flow is primarily driven by boundary conditions such as gas injection
    through air lines and wind pressure against the sides of heaps. Temperature gradients
    can also be very important in driving gas flow and buoyancy forces are also accounted
    for in the model. In addition oxygen liquid–gas mass transfer can occur due to
    a number of factors, typically temperature, liquid and gas composition and liquid–gas
    interfacial area. In the model, oxygen is transported between the liquid and gas
    phases according to Henry’s law. The details of the CFD flow module that is used
    to calculate the fluxes of chemical species, gas and liquid flows, and heat balance
    are given by Bennett et al. (2012b). 2.2. Mineral reaction chemistry The reactions
    module solves the solid–liquid mineral reactions by explicitly solving a shrinking
    core algorithm, tracking the residual grades and the production and consumption
    of species from solid to liquid state. The solid fraction of ore is defined by
    a size distribution of representative particle sizes, each with their own mineral
    properties, replicating measured data for the properties of a specific ore type.
    The overall chemistry balance is determined by summing the reaction products for
    each particle size fraction and scaling according to availability of reactants.
    Typically in mineral leaching, the chemical reactions occur between raffinate
    species (commonly, ferric ions and/or acid for copper sulfides, cyanide for gold
    oxides) and reactive minerals in the solid phase. The general equation employed
    to calculate the rate of dissolution of a given mineral is: (1) where ro is the
    initial particle radius, rm is the current mineral radius, Am comes from the kinetic
    rate equation for the current mineral. Deff is the effective rock diffusion coefficient,
    Co is the concentration of reactant at the ore particle surface, εp is the rock
    voidage, ρore is the ore density, Mi is the molecular weight of the mineral, xi
    is the mass fraction of the mineral. The value of Am comes from the general expression
    for the kinetic rate equations, which takes the general form; (2) where β is the
    fraction of mineral reacted, A and B are functions of the individual kinetic rate
    equation. R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin This approach
    allows minerals to react at different rates in an individual particle size, and
    although it requires the assumption that the minerals can be treated relatively
    independently, this is not unreasonable given the low concentration of reactive
    minerals present. Each mineral in each particle size fraction can be modeled using
    a single characteristic radius, which indicates how much of the mineral has reacted.
    This allows the model to deal with multiple particle sizes and multiple minerals
    over large meshes without excessive memory usage in the overall CFD model framework.
    The advantage of this approach is that it can easily be related to experimental
    analysis of ore, which is commonly given as mineral content by size classification,
    making validation easier. It also easily allows for different minerals to dominate
    the reactions at different stages of the leach cycle. The general kinetic rate
    Eq. (2) can be modified to incorporate a rate constant, RA, thus: (3) This allows
    the model to be tuned to a given ore using experimental column data. The rate
    constants in effect combine to cover factors in the reactions that are not otherwise
    specified for in any particular ore complex. These can include particular distributions
    of mineral grains and interactions between different minerals that can be difficult
    to quantify but may be characteristic of a particular ore body. The rate constants
    are unrelated to particle size and therefore allow the model to scale from small
    to large particle size distributions (e.g., from experimental column to heap).
    As well as the standard dissolution reactions for minerals, as described previously
    for copper sulfides (Bennett et al., 2012b) and oxide minerals (McBride et al.,
    2012b), tracking of gangue minerals has been added to the model and reported in
    Gebhardt et al. (2012). The dissolution of these gangue species was implemented
    using simple first order reaction within the shrinking core model for individual
    particle reactions. 2.3. Solution reaction chemistry In addition to the solid–liquid
    mineral reactions, other liquid–liquid or liquid–solid reactions may take place,
    such as the oxidation of ferrous ions to ferric and the precipitation of salts
    and other compounds. In the case of copper sulfide heap leaching, ferrous ion
    oxidation is modeled using an algorithm based on a population of ferrous-oxidizing
    bacteria. An equilibrium relationship is used to determine the ferric ion concentration,
    [Fe3+], based on the concentrations of ferrous ions, [Fe2+], dissolved oxygen,
    [O2], and free acid, [H+], and an equilibrium constant, K. Concentrations here
    are in moles/litre. The ratio of ferric ions to ferrous is therefore given by:
    (4) Once in the solution phase, the solubility and precipitation of several species
    can be affected by the local chemical environment. For a copper sulfide material,
    some important precipitates are hydronium and potassium jarosite, ferric hydroxide,
    alunite, and gypsum. An equilibrium algorithm is included in the model based on
    the solubility of several species where the solubility and equilibrium constant
    can be adjusted. The precipitation equations accounted for in the model, default
    solubilities and relationships are detailed in Gebhardt et al. (2012). 3. Parameter
    optimization The parameterisation of the reaction kinetics for a given set of
    minerals for a particular ore type is achieved by calibration of the reaction
    rate, RA in Eq. (3), for each species. The reaction rates are essentially tuned
    to enable the best fit possible for the data on small column tests. These reaction
    rates are material specific so will require tuning for each ore type. These reaction
    parameters can then be used to predict the bulk behavior, from large column leach
    tests to multi-material large scale heaps. So the data from the small scale column
    can be used to parameterize the model for a specific ore and then the model used
    to predict the behavior of a large-scale column leach thus providing a validation
    test for the parameterized model. It is worth noting that it is not too difficult
    to ‘tune’ model parameters so that a reliable match can be obtained for the overall
    extraction of a metal. It is, however, much more challenging to enable the model
    to match the behavior of both the species concentrations and pH within the pregnant
    leach solution, and the dissolution in the column by particle size fraction. This
    requires that the formation of the model capture all the key details of the extraction
    process. The calibration and parameterization of the model can be a lengthy process.
    Each mineral has its own characteristic reaction rate for each material and there
    are inevitably other unknown ore properties, such as particle effective diffusivity,
    that will require ‘fitting’ to experimental data. The calibration and parameterization
    of the model is often the most time consuming part of the modeling process, requiring
    study results from multiple sets of simulations, many simulation runs and an experienced
    operational modeler. An optimization and sensitivity analysis tool has been incorporated
    into the model to allow automated searching for multiple ‘best fit’ parameter
    values and to determine sensitivity. The optimizer determines how the parameters
    should change by using an error function that compares data sets from simulation
    and experiment. The error function determines the variance between matched pairs
    of values. The optimizer tool finds the best values for selected control parameters
    to fit the model to a set of experimental results. Typically, it will be used
    to calibrate the model to new column test data. A sensitivity analysis tool enables
    data to be easily generated to show model behavior against variations in selected
    parameter values. 3.1. Parameter optimization Applying the heap leach model to
    a new mineral or ore body requires control parameters, such as mineral reaction
    rates and particle diffusion, to be optimized. The optimization algorithm, incorporated
    into the model, automates this process of generating model control parameters
    (e.g., reaction rate parameters, particle diffusion coefficients, bacteria growth
    parameters and others). The optimization algorithm is designed for the case where
    there are multiple dependant control parameters and it is difficult to generate
    values from physical data. When the set of input data is simple, it may be possible
    to do a more direct optimization to determine the best values, but this becomes
    increasingly hard with a large number of input parameters. The algorithm optimizes
    the parameters to give a ‘best fit’ to experimental data by running the same data
    set repeatedly and minimizing an error function. The ‘best fit’ is determined
    by comparing model output data to a given data set or sets that may contain multiple
    records. The user can set the error function to a weighted combination of fits
    to multiple data, such as copper recovery, and PLS concentrations of acid and
    ferric. The user can select and weight the most important data. The data sets
    can be modified by time to allow features that are difficult to model precisely
    in the PLS recovery, such as start up and rest periods, to be discounted. The
    algorithm also allows a fit to individual point values and utilizes multiple experimental
    and simulation data files to build the error function. 3.2. Error estimation The
    error function is a weighted combination of fits of different data sets and fixed
    points. A data set consists of a set of experimental and simulated values between
    a set of defined time ranges. Defining a set of time ranges allows features, such
    as start up and rest periods, to be ignored for the purposes of fitting. Linear
    interpolation is applied to experimental data to achieve experimental values that
    correspond in time. For data set j the measure of fit is calculated according
    to the formula (5) In (5) the summation is over the defined time range, and are
    the simulated and experimental values at a given time t within data set j respectively
    and jsim and jexp are the mean of the simulated and experimental of the data sets
    respectively. Experience has shown that the individual data points contain a level
    of experimental noise that is damped when calculating the mean values. In the
    measure of fit equation small errors in the estimation of the individual data
    reduce the value of the measure by a very small amount due to the squaring of
    the deviation. For the mean values a linear function is used due to improved confidence
    in the experimental value and therefore a greater need to penalize even small
    variations between the simulated and experimental values. Fixed points are taken
    at a set time from an available data set. An example of a fixed point that might
    be used is copper recovery at the end of the simulation, or another example might
    be residual particle grade. The quality of fit Ri for the named point i is calculated
    using the formula (6) The total fit is calculated using the equation (7) 3.3.
    Optimizer algorithm The algorithm minimizes the error function for all parameters
    on a stepwise basis. The step size for each increase or decrease in a parameter
    is defined initially as a fixed value or as a multiplier of the starting value.
    This reflects the fact that some parameters may vary by orders of magnitude. At
    the start, the optimizer determines the ‘best strategy’ and starting search direction
    for each parameter by measuring the quality of fit and ranking all parameters
    by the degree of sensitivity of the quality of fit. When the optimizer is required
    to change the search direction, it assumes that it has gone past a local minima
    and the size of the step is reduced. The parameters are evaluated during the optimization
    phase in order of the largest effect on fit, positive or negative. The ordering
    of parameters is redone at the end of each sweep, allowing parameters that become
    insensitive to be ignored in subsequent sweeps. Sensitivity analysis can be performed
    with selected parameters varying over a defined range to determine sensitivity
    to key parameters without having to set up and run large numbers of separate simulations
    thus reducing the user input required and managing the simulation data. A schematic
    of the algorithm is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    1. Schematic for optimization algorithm. The optimizer algorithm makes small changes
    to each parameter and determines if the change improves or worsens the quality
    of fit of the variables under investigation. Initially, the optimizer ranks the
    parameters in order of sensitivity. An initial learning stage determines the degree
    of sensitivity of the quality of fit to a small change in the parameter value.
    The algorithm then loops through all the parameters in order of rank. Each parameter
    is adjusted by its present step size and a new simulation is run. A new error
    is calculated for each variable under investigation. The parameter error function
    is a weighted combination of the error in each variable, where weights have been
    defined by the user, else equal weighting is applied. If the error function of
    the parameter under investigation is below 10−4 or a user defined tolerance, the
    algorithm loops to the next parameter. When all the parameters have been investigated,
    the global error is calculated to determine the quality of fit for the new set
    of parameter values. If the global error is more than 10−4 or a user defined tolerance,
    the algorithm loops through all the parameters again. 4. Calibration and forecast
    results The optimizer tool has been employed to calibrate the model to a varying
    range of ore types. The leach tests reported here utilize the optimization tool
    to obtain reactivity parameters for both oxide and sulfide minerals. 4.1. Calibration
    result An example of a weighted combination of fits of different data sets and
    fixed point calibration is the optimization of reaction parameters, which are
    mineral dependent, and diffusivities, which are particle dependent, to fit PLS
    concentration over time and particle residual grades at the simulation end. Fig.
    2, shows the calibrated fits for a chalcocite-type ore, 0.32% copper mass fraction
    and 2.8% pyrite mass fraction, for copper recovery and residual particle grades.

    and copper residual in particle distribution. Large-scale leach forecasts illustrate
    the model’s ability to predict large-scale leaching scenarios once the model has
    been calibrated to a particular ore type and parameters have been optimized. In
    the following column leach test, the model is calibrated against a small column
    leach test and the parameters are used to predict a large column leach test of
    the same copper sulfide material. In the multiple-material case, the model is
    calibrated against multiple column oxide leach tests to obtain a range of optimum
    parameters for different ore types, and the model is used to predict the gold
    recovery in a full-scale heap leach comprised of these different materials. 4.2.
    Column leach tests The model was calibrated against a chalcocite-type ore, 0.59%
    copper mass fraction and 2.15% pyrite mass fraction, small scale, 1.8-m tall,
    ½-inch crush, column leach test. The reaction rates, RA, for the chalcocite and
    pyrite reactions were optimized together with particle diffusivities and the ferrous
    to ferric equilibrium ratio in the ferrous oxidation reaction. The column was
    leached with a raffinate solution containing 4.08 gpl ferric at an application
    rate of 3.6 × 10−7 m/s. The column temperature was approximately 25 °C and air
    was injected into the column at 8.64 × 10−5 m/s. The optimized model was employed
    to predict species concentration and pH in the recovered pregnant solution on
    a large scale, 6.1-m tall, 1 ½-inch crush, column leach test of the same material.
    The raffinate solution contained 3.5 gpl ferric at an application rate of 1.58
    × 10−6 m/s. All other properties were the same. The graphs in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 show
    the calibrated model results on the small column leach and the model predicted
    results, employing the optimized parameters obtained from the small column, against
    measured data on the large scale column leach test. Fig. 3 shows the copper recovered
    during the leach period, and as can be seen, the model calibrated and predicted
    results are in good agreement with measured data. Fig. 4 shows the pH of the recovered
    solution during the leach period, the model predicted pH is slightly lower than
    measured but the general pH trend is captured. Download : Download full-size image

    The same parameter optimization strategy can be applied within the context of
    a multi-material ore body as well, such as that characterized by a gold oxide
    system, where the ore body consists of a gold–copper–silver oxide complex. Here
    the model was calibrated against several 2-m high column leach tests to obtain
    reaction and diffusivity parameters for three base ore types. The oxide ores contained
    a mixture of gold, silver, copper and a gangue-type mineral, which acted as a
    cyanide consumer. Fig. 5 shows the particle size distribution and gold grade for
    each ore type. A leach solution of 50 ppm cyanide was applied to the ore at a
    rate of 10 l/h/m2. The gold recovered over the leach period is shown for the different
    ore types in Fig. 6. The calibrated model predicted results give a good match
    with measured data. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Particle size

    gold recovered over leach period. The different ore types were stockpiled and
    leached with a 50 ppm cyanide leach solution. The heap was built up over a year
    with new ore being added on a monthly basis. The composition of material added
    each month is shown in Fig. 7. The reaction parameters for each ore type were
    obtained from the column test model calibration study, shown in Fig. 6. The ore
    specific rate parameters were applied to the stockpile material, but it is also
    worth noting that the mineral recovery from the ore is also influenced by the
    solution flow path and available cyanide. As the leaching solution travels through
    the heap, the available reactant is consumed hence limiting the mineral reactions.

    Once the model has been parameterized for an ore body, the next natural stage
    in any simulation based investigation is to set up a model of the commercial heap
    operation and then to perform a process sensitivity analysis to enable a detailed
    understanding of which and to what extent operating parameters can affect the
    rate of as well as the ultimate recovery from a heap. A process sensitivity analysis
    was performed on a copper sulfide ore from published operating data (Bouffard
    and Flores Godoy, 2007) in order to explore the possible impact of operational
    changes at the Zaldivar mine in Chile. Bouffard’s paper details a number of strategies
    that have been used to optimize leaching from copper sulfide ores on a dynamic
    leach pad. There is sufficient information in the paper combined with existing
    knowledge of similar ores to build a computational model that should respond to
    the different strategies appropriately and to investigate the extent to which
    the model supports the analysis and its conclusions. The model utilized in this
    paper has been calibrated to published data on the ore body and a detailed analysis
    of the effect of changing a wide range of process parameters and model assumptions
    is given in the paper by Bennett et al. (2012a). The basic material investigated
    is a mixture of chalcocite, 1% copper, pyrite content of 2% and no acid consuming
    gangue. The ore is a p80 0.5-inch crush, agglomerated and treated to reduce fines.
    The dominant reactions are therefore the oxidation of the copper and iron minerals
    with ferric iron and the subsequent oxidation of ferrous iron with gaseous oxygen
    to regenerate the ferric. The base heap is modeled as a one dimensional column
    with a height of 10 m. The leach cycle is 375 days with a constant flow rate of
    8 l/h/m2. Total iron in the raffinate is 1 g/l, which is almost entirely ferric.
    The pH is 1.6 and the copper content is 0.24 g/l. A gas flow rate of 1 × 10−5
    m/s/m2 from the base is assumed. Although temperature is allowed to vary, the
    ambient temperature is set to 25 °C and there is little thermal variation in the
    PLS. Healthy populations of bacteria are assumed to exist in the heap and therefore
    do not limit the ferrous oxidation process. Precipitation of iron (III) hydroxide
    is relatively high. Generally copper recovery to the PLS is about 50%. The model
    was used to simulate raffinate flow rate varying from 5 to 8 l/h/m2. Overall recovery
    varies only slightly with the different levels of solution applied. Generally
    the lower flow rates slow the initial recovery but the long leach period allows
    for only a slight reduction in the final copper recovery, as shown in Fig. 9.
    Generally there are low iron levels in all the simulations, any iron in the raffinate
    is rapidly consumed and ferrous oxidation tends to consume the available acid.
    Measurable levels of ferric do not appear until after 100 days, see Fig. 10. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Copper recovery for various application rates.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Ferric in PLS for various application
    rates. The acidity in the raffinate was varied between a pH of 2–0.5, equivalent
    to varying sulphuric acid content from 0.49 to 15.5 g/l. Generally there is little
    impact on recovery. The overall pH levels drop with increased raffinate acidity.
    However, there is a considerable increase in recovery in the early part of the
    leach period with higher acidity, see Fig. 11. This is due to higher availability
    of ferric ions, Fig. 12, for reaction due to reduced precipitation. The main acid
    consumer in this system is the reaction for oxidation of ferrous to ferric ions.
    Low levels of acidity reduce ferrous oxidation, the most obvious result being
    the absence of ferric in the PLS until 100 days or later at a pH of 1 or higher.

    of raffinate. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Ferric in PLS for different
    acidity of raffinate. The head grade can be varied per particle size in the model,
    but in this simulation was assumed constant over all particle sizes. The copper
    head grades investigated were 0.3%, 0.8%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2% chalcocite. The different
    grades gave considerable variation in recovery rates. This is driven by the availability
    of the ferric reagent inside the heap, which in turn is driven by regeneration
    of ferrous that depends on bacteria and acidity. It takes considerably longer
    for significant acidity to appear in the PLS, see Fig. 13, while leaching higher
    grades of copper due to its consumption by the oxidation of ferrous. Fig. 14 shows
    that there is some general improvement in leach behavior with poorer copper grades.

    grades. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Copper recovery for a range
    of ore grades. The key result of all the simulations is that there is very little
    overall variation in copper recovery between the different leaching scenarios
    for the same mineralogy over the time span. What differences there are, tend to
    occur during the initial leach period. The simulations are all consistent with
    the analysis of (Bouffard and Flores Godoy, 2007) except that Bouffard and Flores
    Godoy (2007) recommended that the irrigation rate should be increased to 8 l/m2/h
    whilst the simulation here indicates that overall the recovery is insensitive
    to the flow rate. However, the available copper will be recovered faster at higher
    irrigation rates. High flow rates also tend to lead to lower average PLS grades.
    6. Conclusion The comprehensive heap leach model has been shown to capture the
    reactive dissolution kinetics of oxide and sulfide minerals in low grade ores
    once the model has been parameterized for a particular ore type. The calibration
    and parameterization of the model is often the most time consuming part of the
    modeling process, requiring study results from multiple sets of simulations, many
    simulation runs and an experienced operational modeler. The optimization tool,
    incorporated into the model, reduces user input enabling automated searching for
    multiple ‘best fit’ parameter values. Thus, ore parameter data can be easily generated
    to allow large scale recovery predictions of multiple materials. One of the key
    activities in the simulation based analysis of commercial heaps is a sensitivity
    analysis to understand which process parameters affect the recovery and to what
    extent. Such a sensitivity study on characterized and calibrated data can give
    insight into the effect of operational process changes and, therefore, provide
    a useful tool for heap operation optimization. The example provided demonstrated
    a sensitivity analysis investigation performed by the heap leach model and compared
    the results to a substantial operational analysis by Bouffard and Flores Godoy
    (2007) for the Zaldivar mine in Chile. The laudable efforts of Bouffard and Flores
    Godoy demonstrate how challenging such sensitivity analysis is on industrial scale
    operations. The work reported here may allow ultimately more insightful conclusions
    to be reached through suitably parameterized and comprehensive simulation studies
    with heap leach models. References Bartlett, 1998 R.W. Bartlett Solution Mining

  title: Optimization of a CFD - Heap leach model and sensitivity analysis of process
    operation
  verbatim_quote1: '"Building a computational model that incorporates the physics
    and chemistry involved in the heap leach process, with stockpiles of width and
    depth of hundreds of meters and timescales that may be months and years, offers
    a considerable challenge. The basic process, applying a reactive solution to a
    stockpile of low-grade ore and collecting the dissolved metal in the recovered
    leach solution, is simple in concept. However, leach systems are very complex
    physically and chemically, and the variability between different ores and between
    samples (i.e., mineral concentrations, local blockages, and impurities) makes
    it difficult to accurately predict the behavior of a particular system unless
    the model is calibrated against each specific ore."'

    This paper presents the need, value, and concept of flexible irrigation water
    supply systems that can deliver water with flexibility in frequency, rate, and
    duration under the control of the farmer at the point of application using a limited
    rate arranged-demand or other schedule. It introduces the needed terminology including
    “congestion”—how much reserve time and capacity is required to assure water delivery
    at the frequency and rate desired. An illustrative design procedure for the necessary
    pipeline and reservoir capacities is illustrated. The techniques discussed emphasize
    the conversion of the economical steady supply canal flows to flexible on-farm
    usage through the use of service area reservoirs located between the secondary
    and tertiary systems, and of semiclosed pipelines and/or level-top canals as automated
    distribution systems which facilitates the farmers’ need for daytime only variable
    on-farm deliveries to permit optimization of on-farm water management. This improved
    management is the ultimate source of increased food production after improved
    crop, land, and water resources have reached their maximum. The coordinated use
    of return flow systems is described. Introduction In areas where irrigation is
    essential for crop production, the effective and responsible management of water
    resources is critical. The on-farm problems created by the use of a rigid rotation
    schedule that permits a canal to operate continuously at a constant flow rate
    (an engineer’s dream but a farmer’s nightmare) are beginning to be acknowledged
    in planning. The rigid rotation supply forces wasteful water use such as improper
    timing, over irrigation and runoff, prevents effective use of rainfall, requires
    inconvenient and excessive labor, creates conflicts over water, and inhibits good
    farm management. It may be associated with subsurface drainage, high water table
    caused salinity, and reduced production problems. A flexible irrigation supply
    permits a farmer to manage his land, water, weather, and labor resources as one
    integrated unit within his total farming program. Flexibility is essential to
    optimizing farming operations and maintaining sustainable irrigated agriculture.
    The value to widely utilized surface irrigation methods of large variable flow
    rates and daytime only sets, and half or less as much labor conveniently and more
    effectively used, must be considered in the economics of projects (Merriam and
    Freeman 2002). The engineer often considers adequate scheduling as delivering
    water on the day the farmer needs it (or in a set rotation) with a volume as needed
    but with a fixed rate and duration such as 24 h . These restraints have no correlation
    with soil intake rate or consideration of farmer labor or its convenience. The
    convenience of irrigating when and with the flow rate desired has value to a farmer
    and he is willing to pay a higher water charge for the improved service. “It is
    not just the volume of water delivered, but the way it is delivered to make it
    usable,” that is important. “The engineer must learn to think like an educated
    farmer.” Educated on-farm control of irrigation water deliveries permits appreciable
    reduction in drainage and salinity problems caused by excess and nonuniform application
    (Styles 1997). A limited rate arranged-demand schedule (ASCE 1984) is the desired
    practical schedule. The farmer on an arranged day, and as desired (demand) can
    take a variable flow up to the system’s design limit, use it as long as needed
    to infiltrate to the desired depth, and then shut off the irrigation when he is
    finished. To obtain flexibility requires flow rate changes of appreciable magnitude.
    The lateral and distribution systems must be able to transmit variable flows.
    Daytime only irrigation at least doubles a continuous flow rate requirement and
    for eight hour days will need triple capacity. It will require no flow at night
    in the distribution system. Having the reserve capacity to permit choice of irrigation
    frequency at the lower end of a lateral may double lateral (but not distributor)
    capacity requirements again. However, only some of the farmers on a particular
    lateral will want to irrigate on any given day, so the averaging affect of many
    users may mean the upper portion of the system requires only a small increase
    in capacity. The flow if left in a main canal at night becomes the next day’s
    supply further downstream, or it can be placed in a re-regulating reservoir system.
    Operational spillage may be practical where the spillage is reused. The large
    capital-intensive main water supply system operates most effectively at or near
    capacity and continuously. The essential storage for fluctuating flows may be
    obtained from: (1) initial supply reservoirs; (2) in-canal storage; (3) in-the-canal
    reservoirs; (4) beside-the-canal reservoirs filled and/or emptied by pumping or
    gravity; (5) service area reservoirs close to the point of use which are emphasized
    in this paper for new or rehabilitated projects; and (6) of course by combinations
    supplemented by canal operations. The number and size of the farms, the desired
    duration and maximum flow rate, and the control of frequency of the delivery have
    impact on the size of the storage capacity needed, and great impact on the interconnecting
    conveyance and delivery capacity. Almost all distribution systems to fields or
    farms operate intermittently. At field levels the intervals typically create one
    to several weeks of non-use. To reconcile these extremes requires storage and
    scheduling. The most economical location for a large part of this storage is close
    to the point of distribution between the secondary and tertiary systems so that
    the capital-intensive continuous use area is above this point. The essence of
    the concept of a flexible water supply is to provide the farmer with management
    control of the frequency, rate and duration of irrigation water delivery. He can
    then effectively manage the entire farm program as a unit without restraints created
    by the usual water supply system. It is important to realize that this management
    capability is the potential source of the ultimate increment of food production
    after the land and water resources and crop improvement have reached their limit.
    It permits a good farmer to become an excellent farmer. Terminology A new essentially
    replacement terminology is needed for flexible irrigation systems. Its consistent
    use will assist in comprehension by farmers, engineers, irrigation professionals,
    financiers, and project planners. The term watercourse is widely used to describe
    ditches. Earth ditches often present maintenance problems of weeds and silt, have
    seepage losses, are not easily crossed over, are restricted as to location, and
    cannot be farmed. The term watercourse must not be used in flexible irrigation
    supply vocabulary. It will be replaced by farm distribution pipeline or distributor
    (tertiary) on which the farm outlets are placed within pipeline distribution areas.
    The great difference in the capabilities of ditches and pipelines as to right-of-way,
    maintenance procedures, and delivery capability (upstream versus downstream control)
    prevent interchangeable use. Though their location and basic objectives are similar,
    their utilization is not. Ditches are not capable of truly flexible operation.
    A lateral (secondary) system will supply the distribution area. It consists of
    a lateral or conveyance pipeline and/or a level-top canal operating under downstream
    control in response to farm demands. The pipelines will almost invariably and
    economically be low pressure semiclosed pipelines with the many advantages of
    pipelines over ditches (Van Bentum and Smout 1994; Merriam 1987a,b). A level-top
    canal essentially acts as a an extension of a reservoir but at a constant lower
    level maintained by a Neyrtec or Waterman float controlled gate regardless of
    the flow rate (Goussard 1987). To automate the pipelines, (Merriam 1987a) semiclosed,
    Harris float valve controlled pipelines are nearly essential (Merriam 1987b).
    By responding to downstream variable demands the float valves provide a stable
    minimum and maximum low pressure in the lines for engineering purposes and importantly,
    they also provide a stable pressure and flow rate at the farm turnout as lateral
    and distributor flow rates are changed. A closed pipeline cannot do this. Branch
    or main pipelines or canals (primary), or a reservoir will supply the laterals.
    They can be upstream or downstream controlled. In most cases, the main and branch
    canals will receive water from rivers or primary reservoirs at fairly stable rates
    and operate with manual controls or under some degree of automatic upstream or
    downstream control as is prevalent on most current projects. The flexible supply
    system design provides a way to convert the fairly steady canal flows to the farmer-needed
    variable flows. They may become a no-flow condition at night. The economical balance
    of costs between canal sizing, in-canal storage, canal operation, and the essential
    reservoir capacity for night and operational storage for the delivery system,
    will almost always involve a service area reservoir. Conceptually, a service area
    is a group of farms on a lateral supplied at one point from a main or branch.
    Below this point automation is essential to provide a flexible supply. However,
    at this point manual canal turnout controls are practical with a planned operation
    program using the service area reservoir to convert steady canal and turnout flows
    into variable flows at the farm. The service area reservoir for daytime operation
    ( 10 – 14 h ) is most effectively located near but above the center of the service
    area, although it may be at the canal turnout. The area needed is seldom as much
    as 1% of the service area. If all the withdrawals were to be within eight hour
    periods, two reservoirs at about third points storing for about sixteen hours
    would be practical. The design of a flexible supply system is facilitated by the
    use of the terms: Irrigated farm (or field), unit farm area, and unit farm stream.
    The irrigated farm is the unit farm (or field) that will be irrigated on the arranged
    day. Importantly, it requires an arranged day regardless of size. The unit farm
    (or field) area is the selected representative-for-design numerical area that
    can be irrigated in one day ( 10 – 14 h ) by an irrigator having a large, flexible
    unit farm stream and good equipment. In locations with small land holdings, its
    size is selected in the upper range of ownership sizes, often at about 1 – 3 ha
    ( 3 – 8 acre ) . The size can be varied in different parts of large projects.
    In the United States, unit farm sizes may be 4, 8, or even 16 ha (10, 20, or even
    40 acre ). The unit farm stream is selected as the probable near maximum (not
    average) stream size needed to apply an irrigation using good equipment in one
    or more sets in the daytime (ten to fourteen hours) to a unit farm area at good
    efficiency ( 75 % ± ) . Usually this concerns the large initial stream for a furrow
    irrigated field which is cutback. Startup times for irrigated farms can be staggered
    by arrangement. Furrow advance ratios (AR) (time of advance/time of infiltration
    at the lower end) should be between 0.5 and 1.0 for good distribution uniformity
    (DU) (Merriam 1988). Border-strip and basins easily conform (Merriam 1978; Merriam
    and Clemmens 1985). This unit farm stream size must be carefully selected based
    on evaluation (if possible) of actual field conditions and soil infiltration range
    of values. It must be done with consideration of present and future conditions
    and methods. Its size affects application efficiency and hours spent irrigating
    (a farmer cost) and capital investment as to pipe capacities needed (a project
    cost). “The farm and the project are one financial unit.” Congestion is the fundamental
    expression of how flexible a system is—how much reserve capacity does it have
    available for management, how much of the time is it in use, how is planning and
    neighbor use restricted? It is the percent ratio of the number of days a line
    would need to cover an area with one or several streams continuously used, to
    the number of days planned for use (e.g., the number of days needed to the number
    of days available to cover an area at peak demand). For this presentation based
    on experience that farmers do not often willingly and effectively irrigate at
    night, capacities are based on daytime only use, though some night use may actually
    be arranged Congestion ( % ) = number of irrigated farms × number of irrigation
    days per farm number unit streams × irrigation cycle days 100 (1) For example,
    if there were ten irrigated farms each requiring one day (daytime only) to irrigate
    on a distributor of one stream capacity, and the cycles (frequency) were ten days,
    the congestion would be 100%, used every day and no reserve (except at night).
    If two streams were available, it could be used only 50% of the time, lots of
    reserve capacity. This flexibility might be obtained by converting from using
    only 200 mm ( 8 in. ) (one stream) diameter pipe for the whole length, to using
    250 mm ( 10 in. ) (two stream) diameter for the upper half and 200 mm ( 8 in.
    ) for the lower half. The increase in the distribution pipeline cost would only
    be about 7% for double the capacity. Acceptable Congestion is a variable. It is
    a matter of judgment within an acceptable range. If the distributors have a lower
    congestion and there is lots of reserve time, the laterals can have a little more
    congestion. The total number of irrigated farms, not the area, requiring a day
    of use, enters into the consideration. A whole pipeline distribution area in a
    developing country having ten farms requiring two streams for 50% congestion,
    may be only one field in the United States utilizing a large unit farm stream
    for only one day. The larger the number of farms on a distributor, or pipeline
    distributors on a lateral, or laterals on a branch or main canal, the more nearly
    the operation will approach an average use rate. Congestion can be increased with
    more intensive use, but reserve for unusual weather or other conditions must be
    retained. Consideration may be given to variations in cropping pattern and amount
    of land fallow at peak periods over the life of the project. “Do not limit the
    future by what is built now.” Table 1 presents congestion values based on personal
    experience. Local experience to refine these values should be developed. Table
    1. Practical Congestion Ranges (%) Distributor Lowerlateral Upperliteral Branch
    Main 50–60 60–70 65–80 70–85 85 Illustrative Design The following design procedure
    illustrates the concepts of flexibility based on an operation plan utilizing a
    limited rate arranged-demand schedule though it may be less effectively used with
    other schedules. Use of a limited rate arranged-demand schedule requires the farmer
    to apply in advance to arrange for a day upon which he is permitted the use of
    the system. An assured minimum and a maximum rate (limit) are set in the design
    procedure by the pipeline or turnout capacity. The farmer’s actual rate is seldom
    the maximum rate. The requirement of scheduling arranged days prevents overloading.
    A reasonable congestion limit provides assurance of availability under most conditions.
    Implicit in this design procedure is that usually the farm will be irrigated only
    during the daytime. This condition is a very high priority among the educated
    (experienced) farmers using a flexible supply system. During the arranged day,
    the irrigator can take water as he wishes as to rate and duration (demand) up
    to the system limiting rate, and at night if so arranged if the system supply
    volume is adequate. In the design procedure a base map is needed at a workable
    scale showing topography, ownership or subdivision boundaries, and a soil survey
    map (a GIS one is helpful). A tentative irrigation layout of distributors, laterals,
    branches (and main) is superimposed. Under some conditions, it may be reasonable
    to modify field boundaries to facilitate irrigation methods. For example, prior
    to designing the irrigation layout, the top and bottom property lines can be relocated
    if necessary to make them parallel or to approximate a contour so reasonable cross
    slope irrigation grades will not leave odd shaped pieces of land. In addition,
    long, narrow repeatedly subdivided fields (by inheritance) can be consolidated
    into shorter wider units with farmer concurrence. The unit farm area value is
    selected with consideration of present and future actual farm boundaries. It is
    usually a bit larger than a majority of nearly all of the farms or fields presently
    used. If an actual ownership is much larger, two days and possibly two outlets
    can be arranged and considered when reviewing the congestion. Two small areas
    needing small streams, after consultation with the owners, could be allocated
    half days or half streams if soils and methods permitted. There is considerable
    leeway and judgment at this point in selecting the pipeline distribution areas
    and in laying out the distributor and lateral pipelines related to the actual
    farm boundaries. Pipelines provide much more freedom as to location than do ditches.
    They can go across fields and up and down. Structures should be placed at field
    edges. The size of the unit farm stream is not pertinent at this stage. The procedure
    is to select the number of streams (congestion and days of use) needed at various
    locations which can later be converted to flow rates and pipe sizes. Pipeline
    distribution areas should be small enough to require only one or two unit farm
    streams. More than three is undesirable as it creates more flow variation, and
    difficulty in metering if that is desired. For farmer utilization of upgraded
    irrigation systems and methods, some simple mathematical processes are convenient
    for management and also for design. Evapotranspiration of a crop is given in mm/day
    (or in./day), rainfall is mm/day (or in./day), soil moisture deficiency in the
    root zone depth is in mm (or in.). Ordered or applied water needs to be convertible
    into comparable depth units. In the British system a flow rate of 1.0 cfs for
    1.0 h applies 1.0 in. on 1.0 acre (a cfs h equals an ac in.). A comparable metric
    flow unit applying 1.0 cm on 1.0 ha in 1.0 h is one basic stream, which is 100
    m 3 ∕ h or 27.78 lps ( 0.98 cfs ) [1.0 basic stream hour equals 1.0 ha cm ]. This
    is a very practical sized stream, and easily visualized by an irrigator. Its use
    rather than “lps” is easier and facilitates upgraded management. It is far easier
    for a farmer to compute the need and arrange for 1, 1 1 ∕ 2 , or 2 streams rather
    than to request 28, 37, or 56 lps . For design purposes, the selected irrigation
    cycle length (interval) is related to crop, climate, soil variations and management
    allowable deficiency (MAD) (Merriam 1966). Moderate variations in the design cycle
    length with an acceptable effect upon congestion are of little consequence. The
    magnitude of the irrigation cycle must be representative of the actual conditions
    under peak use plus a little reserve. Its precise value is not important, but
    a design value must be selected. It is a key value in considering congestion and
    it must be a practical whole number. It is similar to rotation cycles which are
    often 7, 10, or 14 days for farmer rotation convenience, but the design cycle
    is not so impacted. It is the increment of days in which a distribution area or
    a service area needs to be covered with a continuously (daytime only) flowing
    supply of planned size. Using the map, note at each distributor turnout from the
    lateral the required number of streams needed for the distributor for acceptable
    distribution congestion, typically 1 or 2, seldom 3. Moving up the lateral, the
    cumulative number of streams should be noted for each lateral reach. These items
    can be tabulated along with other helpful information. This is illustrated in
    Table 2 for a 10 - day irrigation cycle and 10 distributors on a lateral for farms
    requiring one day of irrigation with one stream each. It illustrates an arbitrary
    percent reduction related to probability to decrease the number of streams on
    the lateral to conform to an acceptable congestion value (see Table 1). Table

    day with one stream. A presentation of design scheduling impact is presented by
    Clemmens (1987) but for 24 h durations rather than daytime only ( 12 h ) . The
    use of the arbitrary reduction percent procedure selected to obtain a chosen congestion
    at the inlet and starting with zero at the lower end, is a representation of probability.
    It is practical to assign reasonable congestion percents and work backwards to
    obtain the number of streams (whole numbers). It should be supplemented with site-affected
    judgment. At distributor 4, the number of streams was reduced from 8 to 7 even
    though the indicated arbitrary percent reduction of 5% would not justify it. The
    rounded values of percent are intentionally shown to emphasize that theoretically
    refined precision is not justified when answers are in whole numbers, but judgment
    should be used. The important follow-up questions are; “What is the difference
    in the annual project cost per unit of water delivered to use a pipeline for 8
    streams with a congestion of 58% over one conveying 7 for this reach at a congestion
    of 66%?” and “Will this saving create practical problems?” The final congestion
    numbers imply reasonable reserve (see Table 1). The next design step is to select
    the unit farm stream size. Its value is representative in a large area so it will
    not have an exact value, but it must be practical and fully adequate. Whether
    it is 100 or 110 lps is not of concern. With a flexible schedule, adequate education
    and pipelines, the application efficiency can be at least 75%. Select a stream
    size value using judgment. It must be adequate to supply the unit farm requirement
    ( MAD ∕ E a ) in one 12 h day, daytime only, while considering soil intake rate
    and initial stream options. Thinking like a farmer, select the largest one since
    it will save time and labor, and then thinking like a cost-minded engineer, select
    the smallest. As a design engineer select the economical one considering the farm
    and the project as one financial unit, and then make it a bit larger and round
    it off. “Do not limit the future by what is built now.” On the map for each reach,
    note the flow rate (number of streams x unit stream flow rate). Then for the available
    gradient note a trial pipe size for each reach. Hydraulic design then follows
    with consideration of minimum head on farm turnouts, minor losses, Harris float
    valve losses (Merriam 1987b), needed pressure at the inlet, etc. (Van Bentum and
    Smout 1994). Designing flow to the far end of a reach provides conservative conditions.
    For distributors with two streams, the upper reach may be 0.6 to possibly 0.7
    of the length. These conditions are site specific and the upper and larger portion
    should be made adequately long, not just halfway. Probability of where the two
    streams may simultaneously be used must be considered. For three streams more
    than thirds is reasonable. Make a synthetic operation plan to visualize onsite
    potentials. Arranged scheduling can control where and when on a line water is
    taken out. The engineer should think of the farmers as the clients to be satisfied
    and who generate the wealth to pay for the project. “The farm and the project
    are one financial unit.” The Harris float valves have two function in a semiclosed
    pipeline system. First is to break line pressure into steps in conformance with
    pipe and joint capabilities to resist pressure, usually about 5 to 6 m . This
    will permit the use of lower cost low pressure pipe. Concrete 1.0 m length nonreinforced
    tongue and groove mortar joint irrigation class pipe (ASAE S261 1989) frequently
    proves to be the most economical with a maximum head of about 6 m . Gravity farm
    turnout heads desirably are less than this. In developing countries concrete usually
    does not require foreign exchange. It can often be made locally. The second function
    is pertinent to flexible system operation—maintain a stable flow condition at
    the farm turnout as flow conditions are changed in the pipeline system creating
    an unstable pressure condition. Many times the distributor can be stabilized from
    the float valve stand on the lateral, or alternately with a beside-the-line stand
    when lateral pressure variations are undesirably large. As the several lateral
    lines join the branch (or main) (Table 1), the process is repeated with higher
    values of congestion as the additional farms tend to approach a more nearly average
    flow. In Table 2, a distributor having ten farms and two streams, would average
    one farm a day but could have two or zero on some days. A lateral with 120 farms
    and 16 streams averaging 12 farms a day may range for 8–16, but seldom go to zero
    unless it rains and could be restricted to 16 maximum. The arranged schedule provides
    adequate restraint on the number of users and where. A representative service
    area on most projects will range from perhaps 100 to a 1,000 ha ( 250 – 2,500
    acre ) . A lateral pipeline would take off from a branch or main canal which flows
    continuously at a fairly stable average rate varied by seasons and schedules.
    The essential on-farm flexibility of rate and duration would be created by some
    canal operations but mostly by a service area reservoir. It would be located near
    the center of the service area. A bit above would be preferable, as it would more
    nearly equalize the daytime flow with its needed operational spillage with the
    night flows for the lower area. If it were capable of storing just the overnight
    unused flow for the service area it impractically would be done only in conjunction
    with appreciable farmer restraints and canal operation. Better, a full day’s storage
    would require only moderate canal coordination and would greatly reduce the need
    for precise canal operation permitting mismatches to be adjusted a day later and
    would cost only a little more. It probably would reduce new canal capital costs
    and certainly the operation costs and possibly adsorb operational spillage from
    the main canal. It could be compatible with simple manual canal operations to
    upgrade an old canal and generally would be the most practical size. An operation
    plan at peak conditions should be developed. The larger the reservoir, the simpler
    and less precise the operation becomes. It may be practical to pump up into or
    from a reservoir to create the essential head on a pipeline system. Pumping is
    done for the Imperial Irrigation District interceptor systems and for almost all
    of Egyptian irrigation. Consideration must be given with a flexible supply system
    to the potential for rapid drawdown problems in canals and reservoirs. Comments
    on Capacities Stream Sizes The design unit farm stream size (not the illustrated
    average) as well as the irrigation unit farm area must be carefully determined
    and be adequate for future conditions and any practical method. The decision on
    the size of the unit farm stream appreciably affects the cost of the distributor
    and the laterals, and less so on the branch canals or pipelines and negligibly
    so on the main canal—the same volume of water is delivered in a day. Changing
    pipe sizes from 200 mm to 250 and 300 mm ( 8 in. to 10 and 12 in. ) increases
    the flow capacity by two and three times, respectively, however, costs increase
    only about 15% and 40% and project total costs perhaps only 2–5% with corresponding
    small increases in water rate charges. This increase in pipeline cost must be
    weighed against the major benefits the additional flow capacity will have on farm
    management, irrigation labor and efficiency. It is seldom truly economical to
    be very restrictive in this choice. The desired delivery capability to provide
    an application of say 125 – 150 mm ( 5.0 – 6.0 in. ) including losses, per work
    day is controlled by soil intake rate limitations and method. If a unit field
    for one irrigation set in the United States were about 8.0 ha ( 20 acre ) for
    a 6.0 h furrow infiltration time and 4.0 h advance time resulting in a set time
    of 10.0 h applying 125 mm ( 5.0 in. ) , the flow average rate would be 0.125 m
    × 8.0 ha × 10 , 000 ∕ 10 h = 1000 m 3 ∕ h = 280 lps ( 10 cfs ) per 8.0 ha ( 20
    acre ) field If basins were used, a larger flow rate of 1500 m 3 ∕ h for 6.7 h
    might be desirable at the farm level but might be uneconomically large for the
    project and so require a compromise between the farm and project benefits. The
    actual flows taken would seldom be the maximum design limiting flow which should
    be appreciably larger than the average one to remove farm restraints, possibly
    1,300 m 3 ∕ h . “Do not limit the future by what is built now.” Make evaluations
    to gain actual experience. In a developing country where 1.0 ha ( 2.5 acre ) might
    be an irrigation unit farm area and the duration remaining the same at 10 h being
    related to soil and method, the average flow rate would be about 0.125 m × 1.0
    ha × 10 , 000 ∕ 10 h = 125 m 3 ∕ h = 35.0 lps ( 1.3 cfs ) per 1.0 ha ( 2.5 acre
    ) field This average flow is too small a stream to be very efficient and a larger
    stream should be made available, soil intake rates and methods permitting. Two
    streams arranged for a half-day each but still covering two farms or one stream
    divided between two farms for two days may be practical for some soils. This might
    be arranged under the arranged demand schedule. Let the farmer operate the flexible
    system flexibly. Project benefits are appreciable. For example, the Orange Cove
    Irrigation District, Calif., reduced its field crew by one-half (Chandler et al.
    1990; Merriam et al. 1990). System Costs. System Pipe Capacities System capacity
    needs to be at least doubled for a flexible daytime only operation relative to
    a 24 h or rotational system needs to be increased. The increased costs are invariably
    more than compensated for by on-farm tangible and intangible benefits such as:
    (1) reduced and more convenient labor; (2) increased yields; (3) more efficient
    irrigation and water conservation; (4) reduced potential drainage and salinity;
    and (5) reduced inter-farmer (top ender/low ender) conflicts. If relative pipe
    costs were 1.00 for 200 mm diameter for one stream, 1.13 for 250 mm for two streams,
    1.41 for 300 mm for three streams, and 1.78 for 350 mm for 4.5 streams, to double
    from a small stream for 24 h to daytime only would cost 13% more for pipe, with
    twice the flow rate. To make possible the use of two large daytime only streams
    with low congestion on a distributor using tapered size would increase distributor
    pipe cost about 45%. Lateral costs would increase less, and the major project
    costs might decrease. If the annual costs of just the distributor pipelines were
    as much as one-fourth of the project annual costs, the 45% increase to obtain
    an optimum flexible distribution would only be ( 1 ∕ 4 × 45 % ) about 11% of project
    cost, and the resulting increased water charges would be easily compensated by
    the many benefits. The lateral would be negligibly more (see Table 4) not needing
    to be increased in the upper portion. Flexible Operation Capacities To directly
    supply a single small pilot or demonstration area without a service area reservoir
    but using a downstream controlled lateral, the branch canal can function either
    with upstream or downstream control. The canal must provide through operation
    or in-canal storage for: The rejected overnight flow; for the lesser changes caused
    by on-farm irrigation operations such as initial and cutback furrows flows or
    early or late turn-on and turnoffs; different set sizes, etc. This is difficult
    on a project scale except for very large canals or with operational spillage but
    is practical for pilot or demonstration projects (Merriam 1991). For distributor
    deliveries of two streams, the upper reach should be longer than half lengths
    to allow for the probability that two streams would be needed in the lower half.
    Such need could be constrained by arrangement. It is more desirable to extend
    the double capacity of the upper part of the pipeline 0.6 to 0.7 of the length
    to provide better service with less congestion. Also, since the flow rate is to
    be arranged in the section is site specific and related to this specific area
    and not to a day of availability, it may vary from the unit farm stream size.
    The design flow rate may cautiously be reconsidered. Where main or branch canals
    have inadequate capabilities to handle the major changes resulting from the flexible
    schedules, additional storage capacity must be developed. The service area reservoir
    is usually the most practical procedure. With such a mid-area reservoir the lateral
    above the reservoir can operate under upstream control. It may be on open or semiclosed
    pipeline, or a sloping (existing?) canal if offtakes have adequate head to function.
    The lateral capacity in the upper half above the reservoir need only be a bit
    larger than the average 24 h flow rate. This is one of the benefits derived from
    having a service area reservoir. If the lateral were operated in downstream control
    mode, without storage the lateral must have more than twice full capacity to supply
    all the service area demands in the daytime (see Table 3). Table 3. Relative Lateral
    Capacities with and without Midpoint Reservoir, Flexible Schedule, 80% Congestion,

    91 Pipe Capacity Design Illustrations Flow Rate and Unit Farm Stream For illustration
    of reservoir and pipeline capacities, assume ET is 8.0 mm ∕ day ( 0.33 ipd ) on
    a 200 ha area served by a lateral, and 60% application efficiency. Then for this
    illustration the daily volume (average) would be 0.008 m ∕ per day × 200 ha ∕
    60 % = 2.67 ha m ∕ day and the application interval for a management allowed deficiency
    (MAD) (Merriam 1966) of 75 – 100 mm [a (f) of crop and soil] would range from
    75 mm ∕ 8.0 mm per day = 10 days to 100 mm ∕ 8.0 mm per day = 13 days The average
    24 h continuous supply flow rate to the 200 ha service area at 60% application
    efficiency for a rotation schedule (100% congestion) would be 2.67 ha m × 10,000
    ∕ 24 h = 1,110 m 3 ∕ h = 310 lps ( 10.9 cfs ) steady flow For a 12 h delivery,
    the rate would be twice as great ( 620 lps ) , and even larger for 10 or 9 h durations
    required by different soils, but the needed daily volume remains the same. For
    a 1.0 ha farm for a 12 h set in a 10 - day irrigation cycle, applying 80 mm at
    60% efficiency ( 133 mm ) the average flow rate for a farm turnout would be (
    80 mm ∕ 60 % ) ( 1.0 ha × 10,000 ) ∕ ( 12.0 h × 3600 s ) = 30.8 lps ( 1.1 cfs
    ) This average rate is too small to be practical. For 10 h or shorter sets and
    an increase for on-farm variations, the practical flow rate limit for the initial
    stream (unit farm stream) might be 45 lps ( 1.6 cfs ) (50% greater), which could
    be cutback. For a 13 - day cycle ( 100 mm ) and a 12 h set, the average flow rate
    is 40 lps so the design limit might better be 55 lps (unit farm stream). This
    limiting figure is a key value and must be set with judgment as not all farmers
    will use it. With increased labor nighttime hours can be used, but should be avoided.
    “The engineer must learn to think like an educated farmer.” Evaluation experience
    is very helpful. The actual soil intake rate and needed duration are critical.
    Illustrating the use of the simple “basic stream” for practical on-farm use (1.0
    basic stream for 1.0 h on 1.0 ha applies 1.0 cm ) an 80 mm soil moisture deficiency
    at 60% efficiency requires a 8.0 cm ∕ 60 % = 13.3 cm irrigation. To apply this
    to 1.0 ha in 12 h requires 13.3 × 1.0 ∕ 12.0 = 1.10 basic stream ( 30.8 lps )
    . Number of Farms per Day In the United States the representative average number
    of 8.0 ha unit farms per day for a 10 - day cycle in a 25 farms, 200 ha service
    area would be ( 200 ha ∕ 8.0 ha ) ∕ 10 days = 2.5 farms ∕ day ( not a real value
    — it is either 2 or 3 ) and in a developing country with 1.0 ha unit farms ( 200
    ha ∕ 1.0 ha ) ∕ 10 days = 20 farms ∕ day The supply and conveyance capacity and
    the needed reservoir capacity to operate this area with a flexible schedule and
    acceptable congestion is related to probability and an economically acceptable
    congestion—the degree of assurance of delivering water on the date first requested
    under a limited rate arranged-demand schedule. For example, on the arranged date
    for up to the illustrated limiting flow rate of 45 lps varied as desired for as
    long as needed on that day, what capacity will be needed? These limiting conditions
    must be determined with great care to not appreciably restrict on-farm operations.
    For this illustration, in the USA the “average” of the 25 farms would be either
    two or three unit streams. With a flexible schedule four or one or even none might
    be arranged. With three streams used as a design limit to determine the “limiting”
    pipeline capacity rate, the congestion would be 25 ∕ 3 × 10 = 83 % , which is
    rather restrictive of the choice of day. It probably will not stress the crop.
    Flexibility involves both frequency (congestion) and volume of water. With four
    streams it would be 25 ∕ 4 × 10 = 62 % and could cover the 25 farms in six days
    out of a ten day cycle, which is adequate reserve. Consider using four streams.
    For a developing country with many small units to be covered in 10 days , a higher
    level of congestion would cause negligible problems with the 200 farms. An 80%
    congestion level resulting in irrigating up to 25 farms per day might be questionably
    acceptable. With 1000 farms the usual daily request would approach nearer to the
    average (but a reserve for weather and holidays is still needed) and so 80% may
    be acceptable. In humid areas with frequent rainfall more reserve may be essential
    to provide for simultaneous startup requests. With the United States example with
    only 25 unit area farms, it is very likely that on some days that one or four
    stream(s) would be requested (a wide range). However, with the developing country
    situation with 200 farms with an average 20 farms per day there would be low probability
    that 10 or 30 would request water on any day. The acceptable level of congestion
    affects the needed reservoir storage and system capacity. The canal turnout peak
    capacity for the United States example is either three or four streams of 250
    lps average. The peaking capacity should be perhaps 30% greater so four 375 lps
    streams ( 1,500 lps ) would be acceptable for flexibility. Allowing for the probability
    that not all four farms would simultaneously take peak flow, a flow of 1,300 lps
    could be acceptable, but would it really save much on meter charges over the 1,500
    lps capacity? A pipe cost study would show very little difference in annual costs
    so use the larger one. Relative Flow Rates and Pipe Diameters For the developing
    country condition, an illustration for a rigid rotation schedule and also as a
    basis for comparison is presented in Table 4 for a lateral pipeline taking off
    from a canal to deliver water to distributor lines for the 200 1.0 ha farms. This
    table shows (1) for 100% congestion (20 farms per day but for daytime only); and
    then (2) for 80% congestions (averaging 20 farms per day but allowing up to 25)
    in a ten day irrigation cycle, the flow rates and relative pipe diameters needed
    at the beginning and at the midpoint of a lateral for a rigid rate and duration
    schedule without a service area reservoir. Table 4. Relative Lateral Capacities,
    Variable Frequency (Congestion), Rigid Rate and Duration, Pipe Diameter Reduces
    with Length (a) 100% congestion, cover all 200 farms in rotation in ten days with
    20 streams of 31 lps fixed flow, 12 h duration (daytime only) Flow at canal 620
    lps Relative pipe diameter 100 Flow at midpoint 310 lps Relative pipe diameter
    77 (b) 80% congestion, cover all 200 farms in eight days out of ten with up to
    25 streams of 31 lps fixed flow, 12 h duration (daytime only) Flow at canal 775
    lps Relative pipe diameter 108 Flow at midpoint 340 lps Relative pipe diameter
    83 The 80% congestion allows some flexibility in frequency but not for rate and
    duration though that can be arranged. This is commonly done in the United States
    with 24 h durations. This restricted (rigid rate and duration) arranged schedule
    is not a good one but is simple for illustration purposes. Overnight unused flow
    will be absorbed in the canal or a reservoir or operation. Pipe capacities and
    relative sizes shown in Table 4 for schedules with rigid rate and duration, show
    that to provide for 80% congestions (moderate flexibility in frequency), lateral
    capacity is increased from 620 to 775 lps , a 25% increase. Pipe diameter is increased
    from 100 to 108, only an 8% increase. If pipe costs are about comparable to diameter,
    an 8–10% increase in lateral (not distribution) pipe costs may be anticipated.
    If lateral pipe costs alone are about 20% of total project costs, an appreciable
    degree of flexibility in frequency can be obtained for only about 2% increase
    in project costs and corresponding water charges. In Table 3, a good flexible
    limited rate arranged-demand schedule with 80% congestion allowing moderate flexibility
    in frequency, with up to a 30% increase over average flow rate, and durations
    as needed to match soil intakes and farm conditions, is illustrated (1) without;
    and (2) with a mid-area service reservoir. Arranged scheduling will limit deliveries
    to only 25 farms on any one day even though more might be requested, or permit
    night time irrigation. The illustration of a satisfactory flexible schedule of
    adequate frequency, rate and duration in Table 3, shows that without a service
    area reservoir, with all the flexibility supplied by the main canal for daytime
    only usage, that for the 60% ( 620 – 1000 lps ) increase in off-take capacity
    only a 19% increase in initial pipe diameter would be required. However, by using
    a service reservoir, Table 3 shows that almost all of the project flow variables
    can be absorbed by the reservoir. This will also permit the main canal to have
    very steady flows and appreciably reduce its cost. This alternate, by using the
    upper portion of the service area lateral 24 h per day rather than 12 h as in
    Table 3, reduces the capacity to 500 lps (50%) and the pipe diameter to 91% for
    its entire length in the upper half (some practical modifications are necessary).
    These are the essential benefits of service area reservoirs. They make possible
    the many on-farm benefits from flexibility without appreciably changing the usual
    canal operations even with silt. This makes upgrading of many existing systems
    possible and greatly reduces canal operation problems, costs and operational spillage.
    The cost of the reservoir even with retaining some silt is compensated for by
    reduced pipe costs and the many on-farm benefits. “The farm and the project are
    one financial unit.” Reservoir and Pipeline Capacity and Operation Using the Project
    Supply and Storage Reservoir and Canal Storage Where a service area lateral pipeline
    (an automated elevated level-top canal may be cheaper on very nearly level ground)
    can be closely connected to the project supply reservoir (or equivalent), flexibility
    can be obtained by having adequate capacity in the lateral pipeline, or level-top
    canal, without a supplemental reservoir as in Table 3, but the supply canal will
    have large day to night and daily fluctuations. Such lateral capacity would need
    to be large enough in the upper initial reaches to supply all anticipated streams.
    From the introductory illustration in the United States (similar to Table 3) this
    would be four 375 lps ( 1,500 lps ) streams reducing to three and then two near
    the lower end and one in the last reach. It would be used essentially only in
    the daytime. It would utilize the existing in-canal storage capacity or canal
    operations so the fluctuating off-takes would be satisfied. If a closed or semiclosed
    pipeline were used, it would be a fully automated system, as used on the Orange
    Cove Irrigation District (Chandler et al. 1990) with appreciable but acceptable
    canal fluctuations. Using a Service Area Reservoir If the 200 ha United States
    illustration was not located near the storage reservoir but did take off from
    a main or branch canal on which it was desired to maintain a nearly stable rate,
    a service area reservoir of 2 or 3 ha m or more capacity would be located near
    the center of the service area as presented in Table 3. The conceptual illustration
    of operation under a flexible schedule with a rigid 12 h daytime only supply shows
    the value of a service area reservoir. With the midpoint location, the stream
    size in the upper portion would average 1 1 ∕ 4 streams full flow rate needed
    for a 24 h run desired to stabilize canal flow rather than the full 2 1 ∕ 2 stream
    needed for 12 h . The overnight unused flow at this same rate then flows into
    the service area reservoir to provide the flow needed the next day in the lower
    area. In practice the probability is that in the United States example, three
    and occasionally four 375 lps ( 1,500 lps ) streams (daytime only) could be needed
    at times in the total area. This would increase the required practical design
    capacity to two streams rather than the 1 1 ∕ 4 average flow rate. It would be
    limited by arrangement to only two each in the upper and lower portions. An operation
    program should be made for maximum conditions. With many outlets for the developing
    country illustration, the incremental upper half increase would be less. Additionally,
    since the variable farm turnout flow rates in practice are usually taken for less
    than 12 h , the actual rate must be larger than the average 12 h flow rate illustrated,
    though the needed volume remains about the same. This practical condition requires
    that a larger than average flow be planned from the canal during the daytime period
    to satisfy the actual upper portion farm needs which are taken for less than 12
    h , plus some operational reserve. For the few hours practical increment of time
    difference, this larger flow will bypass into the service area reservoir with
    its large operational storage. For the rest of the 24 h , the needed smaller overnight
    flow, which is not reduced by off-takes in the upper portion, may be controlled
    by a valve on a semiclosed pipeline system where it outlets into the reservoir.
    The use of the arranged schedule permits these two daily flow rates to be anticipated
    and taken from the canal and the reservoir absorbs the inevitable small mismatches.
    If the lower area is about 55% of the total area rather than half, the day and
    night flows can be more nearly equal with adjustments made the following day.
    If the reservoir is appreciably larger, only one morning flow adjustment may be
    needed. If the service area lateral is a closed or semiclosed pipeline, operations
    can be automated. If the upper area line is closed at the outlet into the reservoir
    during the day, or a moderate outflow is set and the line has adequate capacity,
    upper area farm off-takes can be made as desired and the inflow into the pipeline
    from the canal equates exactly and automatically. The canal supplies this fluctuation
    from planned scheduled flow or in-canal storage. With pipeline canal off-takes,
    a constant head at the canal is not essential and in-canal storage fluctuations
    are acceptable as done at the Orange Cove, Id. At night all flow would go into
    the reservoir at the desired rate to balance canal conditions with a float valve
    preventing the reservoir from overflowing. It is noted that flow changes into
    the reservoir can be made at the outlet end of a semiclosed or closed pipeline.
    If open pipelines or canals are used in the upper portion, controls are set at
    the canal and flows are stable with fluctuations absorbed in the reservoir. Irrigation
    below the service area reservoir starts with a nearly full reservoir. A little
    space is left for mismatches and variable startup times from the reservoir the
    next morning. Off-takes through closed or semiclosed distributor pipelines are
    taken by the farmers as desired and about as scheduled. They are automatically
    supplied from the reservoir storage. Most operations will require only morning
    and evening reservoir adjustments. All farm turnout adjustments are made by the
    farmer at his valve with the reservoir absorbing all modifications in the lower
    area. This technique may be the simplest to upgrade existing systems as very little
    change is needed in the canal system and the lateral above the reservoir. It may
    be done in small units as each service area is independent. It is to be emphasized
    that while construction of service area reservoirs in addition to major storage
    reservoirs, has been common knowledge for a long time, their use as a tool to
    facilitate upgraded on-farm use of water and labor and resulting improved on-farm
    management has not. The resulting flexibility in supply in conjunction with an
    adequately large pipeline distribution system (Merriam 1987c) can accomplish the
    basic on-farm objective of overcoming common management restrictions. An educated
    farmer can then perform at the optimum level (Merriam 1991; Merriam 1999; Merriam
    and Freeman 2002). Silt Load In locations where there is a silt problem, the flexible
    supply technique leaves the supply system-main, branch, and lateral canals—operating
    at a steady flow regime condition, which transports the silt. In the typical flexible
    supply layout with the service area reservoir near the center of the service area,
    the portion of the service area above the reservoir is essentially served directly
    through the pipeline distribution system conveying the silt-laden water directly
    to the field. The nighttime flow essentially delivered through the service area
    reservoir for daytime usage in the lower service area will drop most of its silt,
    which must ultimately be removed mechanically or hydraulically with a small portable
    dredge and desirably spread on the lower farm fields. Coordinated Return Flow
    System The moving water surface irrigation methods involve runoff or blocked ends.
    Furrows have a higher distribution uniformity (DU) when using larger initial streams
    but with increased runoff. Cutback streams reduce runoff and return flow systems
    eliminate it. Both can be facilitated with flexible supply systems, which can
    result in high application efficiencies (AE). With the flexible supply system,
    the usual large return flow runoff storage reservoir at the lower end of a field
    and the large pump can simply and economically be replaced. A smaller cycling
    pump taking water from a small sump can return flow directly to the farm system
    at a point between the project farm supply turnout valve, which is operated fully
    open or closed, and the field control gate. The return flow surge at this point
    must be considered. The return flow is reapplied to the field from which it runs
    off. The supply flow is automatically reduced by the return flow to a net combined
    flow that just matches the soil intake rate. Pipeline Project Supply to the Farm
    If the project supply system is a pipeline, the farm turnout gate, which is operated
    wide open or closed, releases flow through a Harris float valve into a farm standpipe
    in which the downstream water level is maintained nearly constant by the Harris
    float valve on the project supply regardless of a variable farm outtake rate or
    supply pressure or rate variation. The outlet gate from the standpipe to the field
    distribution system is operated to control flow to the usual sloping field head
    ditch at any desired easily varied rate. If the head ditch function is done by
    a pipeline, the farm outlet gate is operated wide open sand control is at the
    outlet in the field—gated pipe, alfalfa valves, etc., stabilized by the Harris
    float valve. Large streams can be set in small sequential subsets for convenience
    of labor. If the head ditch function is done by a level-top ditch stabilized by
    a Neyrtec or Waterman downstream float control gate, it can function as flexibly
    as a pipeline distributor. If the ditch float gate is omitted, flows must be modified
    manually as subsets are made. In-ditch storage having small changing head variations
    on outlets make this practical—inflow matches taken outflow at some level. With
    these systems, cutbacks are made for the entire set at the one gate in the field
    supply standpipe. The farm outtake variations are absorbed by the project flexible
    supply system. Field outlet cutbacks will not be uniform and may need re-regulation
    especially for pipeline systems. Cutbacks do not save water but do save power.
    They are not essential. The larger initial furrow stream and fast advance ratio
    (AR) provide uniformity and do save water (Merriam 1988). Canal Project Supply
    to the Farm In the unusual condition where farm outtakes are from flexible project
    laterals which are level-top canals or sloping canals with flexibility obtained
    by operational spillage over constant level gates or long-crested weirs, farm
    turnout to level-top or sloping field head ditches can “float” on the project
    supply lateral canal at a constant level regardless of outtake rates. For the
    return flow systems to a level-top head ditch, the return may be made to any place
    and the supply flow will be slowly reduced to match. The return to a sloping head
    ditch must be made between the project turnout and the farm control gate as for
    the pipeline supply procedure. The operation of the head ditch is as described
    above and the return flow surge must be considered. Summarizing, flexible supply
    systems facilitate the installation of runoff return flow systems where required
    or desired. The elimination of low side storage reservoirs and the use of small
    cycling return flow pumps is possible. Such systems facilitate the use of proper
    sized initial streams, reduce labor and the needed precision of flow sets, and
    economically eliminate runoff allowing moving water surface irrigation methods
    to have high application efficiencies. The equivalent program for all cases can
    be obtained from individual on-farm reservoirs as the flexible source (Merriam
    1987c). Conclusions Flexible on-farm management of an irrigation water supply
    is essential for the farm manager to obtain optimum use of land, water, crops,
    weather, and labor resources. Irrigation must be coordinated with other aspects
    of the farming operation. Supply restraints on the control of flexibility of frequency,
    rate and duration must be economically minimized. Daytime only irrigation is nearly
    essential. A partially flexible system is of limited value. For the mechanical
    pressurized irrigation methods, rate is selected and remains fixed. Management
    controls are through variations of frequency and duration. For surface methods,
    rate must also be varied to correspond to variable soil intake conditions. The
    large capital-intensive main water supply portion of a project system operates
    most effectively near capacity and continuously, but almost all on-farm distribution
    systems operate intermittently. At field levels the irrigation intervals for surface
    methods are large, typically one to several weeks of nonuse. To reconcile these
    extremes requires storage. Such storage is best located between the secondary
    and tertiary systems as close to the point of application as practical to permit
    the steady flow supply system area to be as large as is economical. This favors
    the use of centrally located service area reservoirs and requires the use of pipelines
    to permit local control while allowing supply canal operations to be upstream
    controlled. Essential items are farmer and operator education, Water User Associations,
    limited rate arranged-demand schedule, and adequate post-construction guidance
    and funding. Bibliography The reports or papers are obtainable upon request to

  verbatim_quote1: '"This paper presents the need, value, and concept of flexible
    irrigation water supply systems that can deliver water with flexibility in frequency,
    rate, and duration under the control of the farmer at the point of application
    using a limited rate arranged-demand or other schedule."'
  verbatim_quote2: '"An illustrative design procedure for the necessary pipeline and
    reservoir capacities is illustrated. The techniques discussed emphasize the conversion
    of the economical steady supply canal flows to flexible on-farm usage through
    the use of service area reservoirs located between the secondary and tertiary
    systems, and of semiclosed pipelines and/or level-top canals as automated distribution
    systems which facilitates the farmers'' need for daytime only variable on-farm
    deliveries to permit optimization of on-farm water management."'

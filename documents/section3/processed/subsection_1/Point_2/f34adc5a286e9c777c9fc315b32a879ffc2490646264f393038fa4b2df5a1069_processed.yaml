    \ a novel \"anchor-based void detouring routing (AVDR)\" protocol to address the\
    \ void node problem in 3D wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The point of interest\
    \ in the review is the discussion of void node recovery techniques in geographical\
    \ routing protocols for WSNs, with a specific focus on 3D networks. The paper\
    \ is highly relevant to this point, as it proposes a new protocol that specifically\
    \ targets the void node problem in 3D WSNs.\n\n### Insight 1: The paper provides\
    \ a novel and efficient method for solving the void node problem in 3D WSNs. \n\
    The proposed AVDR protocol utilizes anchor nodes to bypass void regions and establish\
    \ direct paths between source and destination nodes, effectively reducing path\
    \ length and improving routing performance.\n\n### Insight 2: The paper provides\
    \ a comprehensive analysis of the proposed AVDR protocol, evaluating its performance\
    \ in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, routing stretch, and network\
    \ overhead. \nThe results demonstrate that the AVDR protocol outperforms existing\
    \ void recovery techniques, particularly in 3D network scenarios.\n\n### Insight\
    \ 3: The paper provides a detailed description of the proposed AVDR protocol,\
    \ including the anchor discovery process, anchor advertisement mechanism, and\
    \ path selection algorithm. \nThis information is essential for understanding\
    \ the operation of the protocol and its applicability to different 3D WSN scenarios.\n\
    \n## Evaluation of the Paper's Technical Merits\n\n### Strengths\n\n- **Novelty\
    \ and Significance**: The proposed AVDR protocol is a novel approach to void node\
    \ recovery in 3D WSNs, addressing a critical challenge in geographical routing\
    \ protocols for these networks.\n\n- **Analytical and Experimental Evaluation**:\
    \ The paper provides both analytical and experimental evaluations of the AVDR\
    \ protocol, demonstrating its effectiveness and performance advantages over existing\
    \ techniques.\n\n### Limitations\n\n- **Scalability**: The paper does not discuss\
    \ the scalability of the AVDR protocol in large-scale 3D WSNs. It would be valuable\
    \ to evaluate the protocol's performance in scenarios with a high number of nodes\
    \ and a large network area.\n\n- **Energy Efficiency**: While the paper mentions\
    \ energy efficiency as a consideration in the design of the AVDR protocol, it\
    \ does not provide a detailed analysis of the protocol's energy consumption. A\
    \ more thorough evaluation of energy efficiency would strengthen the paper's contribution.\n\
    \n### Scope**: The proposed method focuses on finding anchor node(s) in four directions.\
    \ The number of anchors may vary according to network structure, position or size\
    \ of the void. The extension to cope with coordinates needs considering more planes\
    \ where we choose four directions, i.e., top-left, top-right, bottom-left and\
    \ bottom-right, for packet forwarding to discover the anchor nodes on the occurrence\
    \ of void node. All nodes (towards the source node) that lies within the scope\
    \ of anchor nodes will be candidate for advertisement of anchor nodes’ information,\
    \ i.e., node numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,\
    \ 29, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 are supposed to be user of anchor nodes. First of\
    \ all void node collects the information of anchor nodes. Then, it starts advertising\
    \ this information to the nodes between these two lines. Anchor advertisement\
    \ procedure is summarized as Algorithm 3. In case void node receives aerr message\
    \ from all directions, it means network is disconnected and communication is not\
    \ possible. This message is forwarded to all connected nodes and stop routing\
    \ process for disconnected segment.\n\n### Timeliness**: The paper is timely,\
    \ as the void node problem in 3D WSNs is an active research area and the proposed\
    \ AVDR protocol offers a promising solution.\n\n### Overall Assessment**: Overall,\
    \ the paper presents a novel and technically sound approach to void node recovery\
    \ in 3D WSNs. The proposed AVDR protocol shows promising performance improvements\
    \ compared to existing techniques, and the paper provides a comprehensive evaluation\
    \ of its effectiveness. While there are some limitations to address, the paper\
    \ makes a valuable contribution to the field of geographical routing in WSNs."

  description: In recent years, several applications of Internet of Things (IoT) have
    been observed in various areas including environmental monitoring, healthcare
    systems, cognitive smart agriculture, industrial control, smart homes, intelligent
    transportation systems, and traffic management. For such applications, wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs) are generally deployed to gather the sensed data from the
    targeted application field. In order to transfer the sensor node data to the gateway
    (sink node), novel routing protocols need to be developed, leading to reduced
    data transmission delay, high data throughput, and improved energy efficiency
    across the network. In this context, geographical routing protocol has been considered
    as a promising approach for the path selection in WSNs. This approach is full
    of scalability and multi-hop routing is performed using local decisions. However,
    geographical routing protocols suffer from the void node problem (VNP) i.e., a
    region where active nodes are not available in the direction closer to the destination.
    Numerous protocols have been designed to get recovery from VNP in 2D networks
    which cannot be directly applied to 3D networks. The 3D routing includes the networks
    deployed in the hilly area, high buildings, airborne region, underground, underwater
    and so forth. On applying the 2D routing protocols on complex 3D topology, the
    network may face additional problems like packet looping, routing failure, ambiguity,
    or increased data latency due to longer path. Further, the majority of geographical
    routing protocols follow the boundary of void which leads to a longer path. In
    order to address the aforementioned challenges, this paper presents a novel anchor-based
    void detouring routing (AVDR) protocol where anchor node is treated as a sub-destination
    which provides the direct smaller path between source and gateway nodes. The proposed
    method bypasses the void boundaries and directly connects source to anchor, anchor
    to destination, or two successive anchors. Further, anchor information is distributed
    to the desired region to reduce the periodic anchor advertisement process. The
    effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested over both, real field data
    set and simulated testbed with OMNET++ simulator. The results obtained over real
    field data set claim that the proposed method takes only 29.09 ms (ms) for transferring
    the data on an average. However, this value is 32.37 ms, 34.32 ms, 33.61 ms, 37.20
    ms, and 38.73 ms, respectively, using A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D, BSMH, and RPL methods.
    Moreover, it is also noted that the proposed method achieves an improvement of
    8.2%, 7.54%, 7.66%, 8.49%, and 8.22%, in routing stretch when compared to aforementioned
    methods, respectively. This improvement with respect to network overhead is 30.25%,
    57.45%, 51.05%, 75.56%, and 58.89% using the proposed method.

    in industries, the transformation of the business system has increased through
    the use of the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT solutions offer connectivity
    anytime and anywhere through a huge network of IoT devices containing sensors
    or softwares. Sensors are crucial part of IoT network where a large number of
    sensing devices are responsible for monitoring the application field [1]. The
    IoT network is a network of several connected IoT devices where each device is
    composed of a mandatory sensing unit, processing unit, communication unit and
    an optional positioning unit. It is responsible for sensing, processing, collecting
    and delivering the sensed data to the gateway (sink node) for further processing.
    The gateway provides connectivity between local sensor network and global network
    (Internet). In order to achieve the vision of interconnecting the devices, there
    is a requirement for a suitable routing approach to enable communication among
    sensing devices. The routing protocol is responsible for communication between
    gateway and sensing devices where gateway may not be available in the direct transmission
    range of the current sensor [2], [3]. Location based protocols are shown as promising
    approaches for efficiently handling such types of conditions. Geographical routing
    protocols (GRPs) consider the geographic locations of wireless nodes where location
    is supported by global positioning system (GPS) or location-aware protocols [4],
    [5], [6]. The GRPs rely on local geographic information and perform multi-hop
    routing with the help of local decisions. These protocols are also known as position-based,
    location-based or geometric routing protocols. GRPs start with greedy mode and
    switch to recovery mode on the occurrence of void node problem (VNP) [7], [8],
    [9]. The VNP is a big issue of geographic routing schemes where a node cannot
    find a neighbor that is closer to the destination. The face routing based approach
    provides a deterministic path toward the destination in connected 2D networks.
    This approach follows a longer path through boundary nodes to detour the network
    void region [10], [11]. However, most existing geographical route selection schemes
    are designed for two dimensional networks, but these schemes cannot be directly
    employed in practical three-dimensional networks. While going through the communication
    from source to the sink that has a void in the intermediate path, it has been
    observed that each packet is required to travel a longer path, i.e., following
    the path around the void. However, for communication from another source, it is
    again required to search the path even if another source is nearer to the previous
    one. The communication with longer distance searched path incurs a noticeable
    amount of search time overhead, which may suffer multiple backtracking. As a result,
    it consumes a lot of energy. This observation can be seen in the example given
    in Fig. 1. Consider the case where node 1 wants to send the data to the sink node.
    Here, communication starts from node 1 and the packet is stuck at node 5. There
    is no directly focused forwarding node available towards the sink. As a result,
    it has to select node 12 and start following the path around boundary. Further,
    it can be seen that while communicating from node 5 to node 7, it is moving toward
    the source. Node 7 is closer to the source and can be reached from source node
    1 via node numbers 6, 8 requiring length 3 hop count. Thus, there is a need for
    direct communication between a source node and node 7 for next time without following
    the longer path. It will avoid additional searching time for node 7 via node 5.
    Further, for the source node 23, the packet is required to backtrack then, forwarding
    the packet to node 16. Here, node 16 can be reached from node 23 via node 29 with
    the length of 2 hop count. Further, previously gathered information can be used
    to get the path without involvement of new searching. In this case, node number
    7 and node 16 can be used to avoid searching for a particular segment. These nodes
    may act as intermediate nodes for a group of source nodes and their information
    is available in each node of the group. Another case is shown in Fig. 2 where
    real field data is taken from of testbed available at FIT-IoT Lab [12], Strasbourg,
    France. This network considers 3D topology where source node 74 transfers data
    packet to sink node 47. Fig. 2(a) represents the problem caused by the void in
    the network. Here, packet is stuck at void node 19 and starts following the void
    boundary nodes through node 18 or node 56. In both of the cases packet has to
    travel the longer path. However, the path length may be minimized through utilizing
    the concept of anchor nodes. The concept of anchor node is presented in Fig. 2(b)
    where node 18 and node 56 are considered as anchor nodes. The source node directly
    approaches the anchor nodes which reduces the path length between source and sink
    pair. Thus, it is observed that direct approaching the anchor nodes will be more
    effective for reducing the route length in case of void in IoT network. Download

    Route with following boundary nodes of void region and backtracking in case no
    other local alternative. The current trend of IoT networks is not limited to the
    territory, these networks are also required at high buildings, hilly areas, underground
    or underwater [5], [13], [14]. In such networks, the location of nodes is represented
    by a three-dimensional (3D) coordinate system. Traditional 3D GRPs also have provision
    to get a recovered path from VNP problem, but the packets have to follow the boundary
    nodes of the void region. This type of recovery strategy unnecessarily increases
    the path length where an alternate smaller path might be possible. The anchor-based
    methods focus on minimizing the path length in the larger volume of IoT network
    with sufficiently increased void in the network. Moreover, these methods are more
    suitable for multi-hop routing in broad geographical region e.g., disaster prone
    hilly areas, step farming fields, and multi-floor buildings, among others. In
    this work, we have addressed the problem of the longer path during detouring the
    void and proposed a novel anchor-based void detouring routing protocol (AVDR)
    for three-dimensional IoT networks. This work is focused on locating and advertising
    intermediate nodes that play vital roles in reducing the path length. These nodes
    act as intermediate source nodes as well as local destinations, also termed anchor
    nodes. The major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (i) We
    have proposed a novel method for locating the anchor node(s) in the large scale
    3-dimensional networks. First, we construct a plane by using source node, destination
    node and void node’s 3D coordinates. Then, we create a perpendicular plane with
    respect to the said plane to divide the desired part of the network. Subsequently,
    we apply an orthogonal distance based procedure in each sub-part of the network.
    (ii) We have developed a novel method to determine the scope of anchor nodes to
    avoid repeated anchor discovery process. Here, we adaptively identified a group
    of nodes which lies inside this scope. Further, we distribute the anchors’ location
    to the identified group of nodes. The nodes from this group may utilize the location
    of already discovered anchor nodes for subsequent communication. Additionally,
    each node adaptively selects the suitable anchor from available anchor nodes.
    Therefore, this method helps in reducing the path length, avoiding unnecessary
    searching of the path, and minimizing the network overhead and overall energy
    consumption. (iii) A novel energy measurement model is developed corresponding
    to the energy consumption by investigating the practical scenarios for the data
    transfer over the developed IoT networks. The rest of the paper is organized as
    follows: Section 2 describes related research work done in the literature. The
    modeling and assumptions related to the proposed method are given in Section 3.
    Section 4 presents the detailed description of the proposed anchor based protocol.
    Further, experimental work, along with its analysis, is given in Section 5. The
    experimental work includes simulated testbed and real field testbed. Finally,
    the paper’s conclusion is available in Section 6. Download : Download high-res

    work The geographical routing protocols rely on local decisions where packets
    follow a greedy forwarding approach to reach the destination node [15], [16],
    [17], [18]. There is a possibility of unavailability of a suitable forwarding
    node which satisfies the greedy approach criteria [19], [20], [21]. This condition
    causes VNP problem [22]. The researchers have made an effort to fix the VNP problem
    with face routing and proposed Greedy-Face-Greedy (GFG) [23], Greedy Perimeter
    Stateless Routing (GPSR) [19] and other variants [24], [25]. These protocols rely
    on the planarity of the network [5], [26] which may not be possible in practical
    complex 3D topology [4], [13], [26]. These protocols follow the longer paths in
    practical scenarios due to boundary based void recovery methods and lack of consideration
    of the third dimension in 3D networks. The path length followed by packet affects
    overall energy consumption. Many efforts have been made to get recovery from VNP
    in 3D networks [4], [5]. Taking care of the third dimension, GDSTR-3D [27], Multihop
    Delaunay Triangulation (MDT) [28], WEAVE [10], 3D real-time geographical routing
    protocol (3DRTGP) [7], OnionMap [13], GPSR-3D [29] and some other protocols came
    into the picture. Zhou et al. [27] proposed GDSTR-3D where each node keeps two-hop
    neighbor information and sets up convex hull tree to route the packet around the
    void nodes. The maintenance of two hop information is quite memory consuming.
    Simon S. Lam and Chen Qian [28] have extended S4 algorithm in 3D network and introduced
    MDT routing protocol. MDT protocol uses virtual links to handle the VNP problem
    and dynamic topology changes. The MDT produces a good packet reception ratio and
    routing stretch, but the end-to-end delay is very high. The WEAVE [10] protocol
    used the concept of checkpoints and waypoints to route the packets in large-scale
    2D and 3D networks. Most of these approaches use periodic beacons to ensure connectivity.
    In reality, maintaining connectivity all the time is not a good idea in any ad
    hoc or sensor network. A node requires the next hop only when it has data packets
    to transmit. Further, the comprehensive survey on 3D routing protocols is given
    in [4], [5], [30] where it has been observed that packets follow void boundary
    nodes to reach the sink node [19], [24], [25], [31], [32]. As a result, boundary
    nodes get overloaded and each packet has to go through a longer path, whereas
    some other alternative may be available [33]. Considering this problem, researchers
    have proposed intermediate sub-destination based protocols [11], [34], [35], [36],
    [37]. The intermediate sub-destination is also termed as anchor node where packets
    may follow several anchors to avoid the void boundary and minimize the path length.
    The main issue with the anchor-based approach is to find a suitable anchor node
    that could optimize the average path length. An effort has been made to find suitable
    anchor nodes in the literature [4], [11], [34], [37]. The idea of projected distance
    based approach has been proposed in EAGR [34], EMGR [37] and EDGR [11] routing
    protocols. In case of network void, the anchor discovery packet traverses around
    boundary of the void and monitors the projected distance on source to sink connecting
    line. Initially, projected distance starts increasing and reaches at peak node
    before decreasing. This peak node is considered as an anchor node. The protocols
    use a reactive approach to find the anchor list prior to starting the communication.
    The reactive approach unnecessarily utilizes the network resources every time.
    The EDGR is an anchor based dual path routing protocol where two anchor nodes
    are to be discovered based on projected distance. In this protocol, the source
    node starts anchor discovery process and then switches to data forwarding after
    identifying the anchor nodes. Each source node has to perform an anchor discovery
    process before data forwarding, which causes a high initial delay. Further, it
    relies on periodically beacon exchange, which creates overhead. As a result, this
    protocol suffers from initial delay as well as additional packet transmission
    overhead. It is also mentioned that EDGR protocol considers 3D network topology.
    However, it uses a 2D plane, ignoring one dimension during the anchor discovery
    process. Ignorance of one dimension may cause actual longer path in practical
    3D networks. The protocol is restricted to the ideal conditions where left and
    right side anchors are available, but in real networks, void area may touch network
    boundary where such anchors may not be available. Nguyen et al. proposed RVMH
    [38] protocol to deal with routing path length issues. Further, it is improved
    in the BSMH protocol [33] and divided the entire approach into three parts. In
    the first part, apply tent rule to detect the void boundary nodes of entire network
    and create convex polygons. In second part, propagate the polygon information
    to the entire network which reduces overall network overhead of repeated polygon
    creation. After getting the void boundary locations, in the third part, the packet
    forwarding has been started. However, approach achieved better routing stretch
    and minimized network overhead, but it still has some functional limitations.
    Creating and maintaining the void convex polygons in practical 3D networks is
    very difficult. Further, each node requires a lot of memory to store the polygons’
    information. Apart from routing strategies, routing protocols rely on certain
    baseline model based on current technology. In this context, Routing Protocol
    for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) [39], [40] provides a baseline model for
    energy constrained IoT networks. RPL has been considered as de-facto routing model
    for IoT networks which offers IPv6 addressing scheme atop of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC
    for Low-Power and Lossy Networks. This model can quickly create a primary route
    using a proactive approach, share routing information and efficiently adapt the
    topology. The literature survey indicates that addressing the void node problem
    is the biggest challenge of any geographical routing protocol. In case of 2D topology,
    this can be deterministically solved using face routing approach by traversing
    the boundary nodes left-hand side or right-hand side. In case of 2D plane, two
    anchor nodes are sufficient to handle void node problem. One anchor node on left
    most side and another anchor for right most side of void boundary can handle the
    connectivity. On the other hand, there is no such deterministic left or right-side
    boundary present in 3D networks. Thus, the identification of anchor node(s) is
    a challenging task in 3D IoT networks. Further, it becomes more challenging while
    ensuring no packet looping, no routing failure, minimized network overhead, unambiguous
    routing with minimized data latency. To fill these gaps, in this work, we shall
    develop a novel anchor-based void detouring routing (AVDR) protocol to improve
    the performance of 3D IoT network. The applicability and effectiveness of the
    proposed method are illustrated over both simulated and real field data sets.
    3. Network model The AVDR routing protocol is used to route a packet from a source
    to a gateway using the concept of local forwarding. The local forwarding is governed
    by constraints available at local node. These constraints include direction of
    the next node, availability of forwarding node, selection of more effective forwarding
    node. Here, first of all, we shall discuss the assumptions considered while modeling
    the proposed protocol. These assumptions are based on the literature [41]. 1.
    The network consists of three dimensional static randomly deployed sensor nodes
    where node location after its deployment in remains fixed. 2. There is a destination
    node, known as gateway/sink node, and its location is known to each node in the
    network. Gateway and sink keywords are used interchangeably. 3.1. Terms used In
    this section, we discuss the terms and symbols used in the paper. First, we provided
    a list of terms along with their description and then, we prepared a table for
    special symbols. All the special symbols are given the Table 1 followed by their

    deploying number of randomly distributed sensor nodes in 3D space specified by
    latitude, longitude and altitude. The volume of network space where sensor nodes
    are deployed in X Y Z volume. X, Y and Z are the respective maximum difference
    in latitude, longitude and altitude among the coordinates of the network space.
    A node on its deployment, knows its own position and position of sink node. These
    positions are measured in terms of 3D coordinates. Further, it computes the network
    density and network density is stored at each deployed node. The network density
    is the ratio of number of nodes deployed to the total volume of the deployed network
    i.e., network density . The network density measures probabilistic availability
    of next available node as next hop. More density is more chance for availability
    of many forwarding nodes, whereas only fewer number node availability is possible
    in core of sparsely deployed network. The non availability of network forwarding
    node is creating the void. Further, network model and base protocol (A3DR) are
    taken from previous research work [41]. 3.3. Energy consumption model The energy
    needed to send -bit data from node i to one-hop neighbor node j can be calculated
    using the energy consumption model, which is similar to the models given in [11],
    [34], [42]. The major portion of energy consumption needed during (a) data transmission
    at sender node i, (b) data reception at nodes available in the transmission range
    of node i and, (c) data processing at i and j nodes. The energy needed to transmit
    the -bit data with data-rate bits/second, considering path loss in the channel,
    is . Here, is the distance-relative constant of energy consumption and is the
    euclidean distance between node i and node j. The is path loss constant, generally
    between 2 and 6, that depends on the transmission environment [43]. Further, transmitted
    data is received by all the listener nodes in the transmission range of node i,
    so total energy consumption during data reception is proportional to the number
    of nodes in the transmission range of node i. Therefore, the proposed protocol
    adjusts the maximum power according to selected next hop, which minimizes the
    occurrence of other nodes in transmission region of the sender node. Each listener
    utilizes power during transmission time and consumes energy to receive the transmitted
    data. The one-bit receiving energy consumption by the nodes in the neighborhood
    is , where is the average network density in terms of number of nodes per unit
    volume and is the volume of transmission region covered by sender node . The data
    is processed to the intended next hop only and other nodes simply discard it.
    So, data is processed to sender node and receiver node only, which consumes constant
    energy, i.e., . Finally, total energy consumption in one packet transmission is
    given in . (1) A node i receives data from the previous sender, process it and
    forwarded to node j then its energy consumption is equivalent to the sum of all
    three components. It can be computed using formula provided in . (2) 4. Proposed
    anchor based void detouring routing (AVDR) protocol Utilizing the sub-destination
    node concept, the objective here is to reduce the path length by removing the
    redundant path segments and their availability for future course of communication
    to the sink node. Future communication may include data transfer between same
    source to sink or another source node to the sink. The proposed protocol used
    an orthogonal distance based approach while discovering its communication path
    to the sink node. In the beginning, no node knows about the void in network. When
    a node starts communicating with sink node, it may get stuck with void. At this
    point, the current node starts anchor discovery process which requires finding
    a suitable sub-destination node. The number of anchors may vary according to network
    structure, position or size of the void. The anchors’ information needs to be
    advertised to other nodes, which are in the scope of anchors, upon discovering
    the anchor node(s). The anchor advertisement process minimizes the overhead of
    repeated anchor discovery. There is a provision of sharing anchors’ information
    with other nodes in the scope of anchors. So, these nodes could utilize the anchors’
    information. The protocol is distributed in nature where the entire algorithm
    is available at all nodes. Depending on the current condition, any node may work
    as source, destination or intermediate. The current node react on specific events
    and takes appropriate action on receiving the packet. In next subsections, we
    first discuss the anchor discovery process in detail followed by anchor advertisement.
    4.1. Anchor discovery In the beginning, a source node transmits the packet focusing
    on the sink node using A3DR protocol. The packet may be stuck at a node where
    it has to increase its angle repeatedly but did not find any neighbor in the forwarding
    direction. The neighbor may be available at higher value of angle where next selected
    forwarding node has more distance from sink than the previous node. A node is
    said to be void node from where distance to the sink node starts increasing. The
    void node is responsible for starting anchor discovery process, finalizing the
    anchors and broadcasting the anchors’ information to the scope of anchor nodes.
    The anchor discovery process is based on computation of orthogonal distance between
    current node and straight line joining void node and sink node. Suppose the coordinates
    of current node (C ), void node (V), source node (S) and sink node (D) are , ,
    and respectively. The mathematical formulation for orthogonal distance is shown
    in Eq. (3). (3) where and are 3D vectors. The cross product of two vectors ( and
    ) is as below in Eq. (4) (4) The magnitude of these two vectors are: (5) and (6)
    substituting the values of Eqs. (5), (6) in Eq. (3) (7) where Download : Download

    distance demonstration. Example 4.1 The demonstration of orthogonal distance is
    represented in Fig. 3 where nodes D, V, C and C with their coordinates are node
    15 (800, 400, 0), node 5 (350, 430, 0), node 12 (320, 480, 0) and node 19 (250,
    540, 0) respectively. The straight line between node 5 and node 15 is VD line
    and dotted line represents its continuation. The orthogonal distance from node
    12 and node 19 (represented using red lines) can be computed using Eq. (7). The
    computed orthogonal distances are 154.32 m from node 12 and 209.53 m from node
    19. Anchor Discovery Process: In case of void, forwarding nodes are selected around
    the boundary of void, where orthogonal distances of each node keep increasing.
    It means that we are moving away from the sink node. During this selection, a
    node with the highest orthogonal distance from other nodes, selected around the
    boundary of void. The node with the highest orthogonal distance is termed as an
    anchor node. This anchor node is also known as intermediate destination toward
    sink from the source node. The orthogonal distance starts decreasing after reaching
    the anchor node while traversing the void boundary. This can be seen in Fig. 4
    where node 9 has the highest orthogonal distance whereas node 5 has least orthogonal
    distance. Download : Download high-res image (367KB) Download : Download full-size

    image Fig. 4. Projection on source–sink line. The anchor discovery process starts
    with forwarding of packet contains discovery and direction fields to denote the
    status of packet. The discovery field is initially set to false and it will be
    true on the occurrence of void node. Further, it becomes false on allocation of
    node as anchor node. Algorithm 1 demonstrates the procedure to check the occurrence
    of void node. After detecting the void node, start searching anchor nodes in four
    directions. These four directions are given as top-left, top-right, bottom-left
    and bottom-right for 3D routing protocol. For clarity, we first discuss anchor
    discovery process for 2D plane where we can choose directions as left and right.
    The direction is calculated based on equation of VD line i.e., line joining void
    node and sink. The equation of VD line is given in Eq. (8). The value is returned
    as positive number or negative number when substituting the X, Y coordinates of
    current node in this equation. The positive value indicates the left direction,
    whereas the right direction to the line for negative value. This can be seen in
    Fig. 4 where on moving left direction path, we have reached node 9 via nodes 12,
    19, and 7. Out of these nodes, node 5 has least orthogonal distance, while node
    9 has maximum orthogonal distance. Other nodes have distances between these two
    extremes. (8) Further, it is made clear that on following right direction path
    from node 5, one has to backtrack up to node 3 and then start searching for another
    anchor node that is node number 17 via node 39, 24, 29, 16. Thus, we have two
    anchor nodes corresponding to void node number 5. The above process of finding
    out anchor nodes is given in Algorithm 2. In three dimensional coordinate system,
    one has to search the anchor nodes at top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right
    directions. These directions can be obtained by considering two planes where one
    plane is plane coordinates: source node, void node and sink node, as shown in
    Fig. 5. Another plane is perpendicular to this plane, passing through the line
    VD. The mathematical equation of the plane passing through source node, void node
    and sink node is given in Eq. (9). Download : Download high-res image (276KB)

    source, sink and void nodes. The anchor discovery process is again extended to
    cope coordinates. The extension includes condition selecting four directions,
    i.e., top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right, for packet forwarding
    to discover the anchor nodes on the occurrence of void node. The equations of
    base plane, containing source node, void node and sink node, and its perpendicular
    plane are given in Eqs. (9), (12), respectively. The values returned as four combinations
    of positive/negative numbers on substituting the current node’s X, Y, and Z coordinates
    in these equations. The outcome of both equations may be positive–positive, positive–negative,
    negative–positive or negative–negative, representing top-left, top-right, bottom-left
    or bottom-right directions, respectively. (9) The equation of perpendicular plane
    is derived as below: The normalized form of equation of plane can be written as
    (10) Therefore, comparing Eq. (9) with Eq. (10) we have: So, the equation of perpendicular
    plane is the dot product (11) The simplified equation of plane, which is perpendicular
    to the plane with source, sink and void nodes, is given as Eq. (12). (12) Algorithm
    2 considers two cases at the end of anchor discovery process. Case 1: Discovered
    suitable anchor node in specific direction. Case 2: The packet reaches and traverse
    the network boundary in specific direction but does not find anchor node. In case
    1, anchor node transmits arep (anchor reply) message to the void node. The arep
    contains the anchor node’s details, e.g., location and direction. In case 2, a
    node that detects the network boundary transmits the aerr (anchor error) message
    to the void node. The aerr contains direction of void. The void node collects
    the arep/aerr messages and proceeds with anchor advertisement process. Once the
    anchor nodes are detected, their use for other sources, which may communicate
    to the destination node, must be ensured. This is achieved by advertising the
    anchor node details to the other nodes in the anchor node’s communication zone.
    This is discussed in next subsection. 4.2. Anchor advertisement The proposed protocol
    minimizes the packet transmissions using anchor advertisement process. All other
    nodes do not need the anchor discovery process. The anchor information is judicially
    shared with other nearby nodes that may face void node problem. For such nodes,
    anchors are intermediate destinations toward the sink node. Further, these source
    nodes are said to be nodes lying in the scope of anchor nodes. The decision about
    these nodes is done by means of (i) Projection lines in case of 2D coordinate
    system and (ii) Projection plane in case of 3D coordinate system. For 2D, lines
    joining the anchor node and sink node decide the anchors’ scope. The equation
    of these lines are given in Eqs. (13), (14). We put the X, Y coordinate of a node
    in the line equation to check the relative position of the node with respect to
    the line. If the output value is positive, the node lies on one side of line and
    negative output for another side. Therefore, from both line equations, the output
    (positive–positive, positive–negative, negative–positive & negative–negative)
    can be combined as four directions. To ensure the availability of node in the
    scope of anchor nodes, the direction of the candidate node should be same as the
    direction of the source node. (13) (14) It can be seen in Fig. 6 that some nodes
    are lying in the projection of these lines toward the considered source node.
    These nodes are candidates for advertisement of anchor nodes’ information, i.e.,
    node numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 34,
    35, 36, 37, 38, 39 are supposed to be user of anchor nodes. First of all void
    node collects the information of anchor nodes. Then, it starts advertising this
    information to the nodes between these two lines. Anchor advertisement procedure
    is summarized as Algorithm 3. In case void node receives aerr message from all
    directions, it means network is disconnected and communication is not possible.
    This message is forwarded to all connected nodes and stop routing process for
    disconnected segment. Download : Download high-res image (242KB) Download : Download
    full-size image This method can be extended to the case where we have four anchor
    nodes for 3D coordinates. Here, we choose four planes: (i) plane containing top-left
    anchor, top-right anchor and sink node, (ii) plane containing top-left anchor,
    bottom-left anchor and sink node, (iii) plane containing bottom-left anchor, bottom-right
    anchor and sink node, and (iv) plane containing top-right anchor, bottom-right
    anchor and sink node. All nodes (towards the source node) that lies within the
    scope of these four planes will be candidate for advertisement. One node is detected
    as anchor node, and it is required to backtrack from anchor node to source node
    via void node: when packet is backtracking, it releases the resources captured
    during the forward movement and frees all resources occupied between anchor nodes
    and source node. Further, source node start path searching with one anchor node
    has least path length. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Nodes in anchor forwarding zone. Example 4.2 This can
    be seen in Fig. 6 where nodes source, anchor , anchor and sink node (D) with their
    coordinates are node 1 (0, 450, 0), 9 (280, 640, 0), 17 (270, 230, 0), 15 (800,
    400, 0) respectively. Here, we have two lines: (i) line joining left anchor node
    and sink node (i.e., node 9 & node 15) and (ii) line joining right anchor node
    and sink node (i.e., node 17 & node 15). substituting the coordinates of node
    9 and node 15 in Eq. (13), the equation of line joining anchor and sink node will
    be: (15) Similarly, the equation of line joining anchor and sink node will be:
    (16) putting the X, Y coordinates of node 1 in Eq. (15) and putting the X, Y coordinates
    of node 1 in Eq. (16) Here, we found positive value with respect to line joining
    anchor and sink node and negative value with respect to line joining anchor and
    sink node. Let us check for node 36 (200, 500, 0) the output of equation of line
    joining anchor and sink node and the output of equation of line joining anchor
    and sink node At node 30, the same pattern is followed and we got positive value
    for line joining anchor and sink node and negative value with respect to line
    joining anchor and sink node. Thus, it is in the scope of anchor nodes. Let us
    again check for node 39 (400, 470, 0) the output of equation of line joining anchor
    and sink node and the output of equation of line joining anchor and sink node
    At node 39, the same pattern is followed and we got positive value for line joining
    anchor and sink node and negative value with respect to line joining anchor and
    sink node. Thus, it is also in the scope of anchor nodes. Let us check for node
    10 (360, 630, 0) the output of equation of line joining anchor and sink node and
    the output of equation of line joining anchor and sink node In node 10, the same
    pattern is not followed and we got negative values in both of the cases. Thus,
    this is not also in the scope of anchor nodes. Now, the nodes in scope of anchors
    got the information about anchor nodes. So, the nodes within the scope of anchors,
    want to communicate with the sink, compute the relative distance to sink via all
    anchors. An anchor with minimum distance is treated as sub-destination node. Above
    examples made it clear that the proposed method addresses the void node problem
    in sufficiently large volume of IoT network. If void region is very small then
    the proposed method works like a traditional greedy geographical routing approach.
    In such cases, overhead of anchor selection and anchor advertisement processes
    gets reduced. Moreover, the proposed method is more suitable for multi-hop routing
    in broad geographical regions e.g., disaster prone hilly area, step farming fields,
    and multi-floor buildings, and other large fields. In next section, we discuss
    the performance evaluation through results generated using simulated testbed and
    real field testbed. 5. Performance evaluation Performance evaluation of the proposed
    method is carried out using simulation study and real testbed results. The results
    concerning route length are obtained in terms of routing hop stretch. Hop stretch
    is the ratio of measured path length and minimum possible path length between
    source and destination. The measured path length is computed using proposed method
    which is a measure of hop count. The stretch factor always becomes more than 1.0,
    but it should be close to 1.0 for a good routing protocol. Further, its effect
    on other quality of service (QoS) parameters is accessed using packet delivery
    ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay (E2ED) and routing overhead. The PDR is ratio of
    total number of packets received at the sink to the number of packets sent from
    source node. End-to-end delay is the time difference between packet generated
    at source node and delivered by the sink node. It is used to evaluate the timing
    performance of the protocol. Overhead is evaluated in concern with transmission
    ratio. The transmission ratio is the ratio of total packets transmitted in the
    entire network over data packets generated from all source nodes. The number of
    packets becomes an overhead if a protocol requires additional packets due to beacons,
    longer path and re-transmissions. In the simulation study, number of transmitted
    packets are fixed (i.e., according to the packet rate), so the traffic overhead
    is computed according to the average number of transmissions occurred with respect
    to one packet from source node. The proposed AVDR protocol is an extension of
    A3DR, so the performance of proposed protocol is compared with A3DR [41]. Additionally,
    to have in-depth performance analysis, it is also compared with other existing
    methods including EDGR [11], GPSR-3D [29], BSMH [33] and RPL [39], [40]. 5.1.
    Experimental conditions The proposed protocol has been implemented on the INET
    framework under the OMNET++ simulator by considering diversified simulation environment.
    OMNET++ is a discrete event simulator for Internet/network systems which is primarily
    used for research purposes. It provides real wireless network environment to perform
    the experimental work where network layer protocol stack is implemented. The parameters
    taken for simulation work are given in Table 2. One thousand IoT devices are randomly
    distributed in a 3D region of . The void zone is created at center of the network.
    Cubical and spherical void structures are considered for the experimental work.
    The sink node is fixed at one side of the network while source nodes are selected
    in such a way that each source has to pass the packet through the void zone. Moreover,
    each node can directly communicate in its communication range which radiates spherically.
    Further, considering the practical scenario, the communication range of each node
    may vary due to its own environmental/physical conditions, so the communication
    range of each node varies between 40 and 100 m. The average and median of the
    communication range are near 70 m. Following three basic simulation scenarios
    are designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol: Table 2. Experimental
    parameters. Parameter Value Simulator OMNET++ [44] (INET 3.6.3 framework) MAC
    IEEE 802.11 (ad hoc mode) Data packet size 32 bytes (UDP datagram) Simulation
    time 300 s Packet lifetime (expiry time) 1500 ms Target network area 400 m × 400
    m × 300 m Communication range Varies for different nodes between 40 and 100 m
    (average and median near to 70 m) Number of nodes 1000 randomly deployed Number
    of source nodes 3 to 24 Void type (1) Cubic void with edge varies between 60 and
    200 m. (2) Spherical void radiating between 30 and 100 m Packet rate 4 packets/s/source
    (i) Number of source node scenario: Here, number of source nodes varies from 3
    to 24 and a cubical void with 200 m edge is fixed at center of the network. The
    coordinates of center of void are set to (200, 200, 150). Other nodes may participate
    in the routing process. (ii) Void volume scenario: The number of source nodes
    is set to 10 and center of spherical void is fixed at center of the network having
    coordinates (200, 200, 150). The void radius varies from 50 to 120 m with an interval
    of 10 m. (iii) Multiple void scenario: The number of source nodes is set to 10
    and two spherical voids with radii varying from 30 to 100 m. Two spherical voids
    are placed so that both voids are separated on shorter radii while these intersect
    each other on longer void radius. The coordinates of centers of both of the voids
    are set to (150, 200, 150) and (250, 200, 150), respectively. In the simulation
    study, each scenario is tested on 10 different random networks (for same number
    of nodes) by changing 10 seed values. Further, for each network three repeated
    executions are carried out. So, each reported result is an average of 30 outputs.
    5.2. Number of source node scenario In the proposed AVDR protocol, one source
    node discovers the location of anchor nodes and forwards this information to other
    nearby nodes. The boundary of these nearby nodes is decided by the position of
    anchors and sink, which consists only nodes that may suffer from void node problem.
    Therefore, the anchor discovery process requires only once and is not affected
    by number of sources. On the other hand, EDGR protocol requires anchor discovery
    with respect to each source node so performance varies according to the number
    of source nodes. BSMH protocol discovers and propagates void boundary nodes to
    the entire network prior to data transmission. The packet rate is set fixed and
    the number of source nodes is increasing linearly, so the total number of packet
    transmissions is also increased. Such a scenario may cause congestion in the network,
    resulting in packet loss, delay in packet delivery, retransmissions, overhead
    etc. This effect is represented in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10. Fig. 7 depicts
    the delivery ratio of packets under number of source nodes. When the number of
    sources increases, the packet delivery rate of proposed A3DR protocol remains
    constant and provides guaranteed message delivery. There are four anchors available,
    so traffic divides significantly and could not create congestion. Meanwhile, the
    A3DR protocol follows the void boundary so initial packets are dropped due to
    the expiry of packet lifetime during covering the longer path. The delivery ratio
    is still more than 98%. The GPSR3D protocol is showing a downward trend but still
    maintaining a good delivery ratio of about 95% in the worst case. EDGR and BSMH
    protocols rely on beaconing process and report high packet loss due to collision
    on high network traffic. Here, it can be seen that AVDR is providing 0.67%, 7.4%,
    2.13% and 13.66% more delivery ratio over A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols,
    respectively. The following paragraph shows the impact on path length. The routing
    stretch depends on route length traveled by the packet. It is a ratio of measured
    path length traveled by packet and minimum possible path length in terms of hop
    count. It is also affected by increasing number of source nodes in view of higher
    congestion in the network. The higher congestion causes an alternative longer
    path which leads to additional overall energy consumption. The hop stretch of
    AVDR is minimum and varying between 1.10 and 1.15 because packets are traveling
    through the shortest possible path. The 3D anchors bypass the void boundary traversal
    and provide direct shortest path between source and sink. Some initial packets
    travel through longer path during anchor discovery process so it is slightly higher
    than 1.0. The A3DR and GPSR-3D protocols follow void boundary so it covers slightly
    longer path, which results higher route stretch. The EDGR protocol uses 2D plane
    by ignoring one dimension during anchor discovery process. The ignorance of one
    dimension produces longer path which results greater path length. BSMH protocol
    assumes 2D network topology and traverses the void boundary so it is reporting
    highest routing stretch. The routing stretch of AVDR protocol is minimum and it
    is 10.89%, 13.42%, 12.07% and 21.89% better than EDGR, A3DR, GPSR-3D and BSMH
    protocols, respectively. This can be seen in Fig. 8. Next, we shall discuss about
    the effect of number of source nodes on network overhead. Download : Download

    of source nodes on packet delivery ratio. Data transmission amount is a good estimation
    of average energy consumption. It considers that most of the energy is consumed
    in data transmission. The number of packet transmitted is directly proportional
    to the number of sources because every source node generates the network traffic.
    To cope with more number of packets, additional packets are also needed in terms
    of beacons, control packets, re-transmissions etc. This effect is shown in Fig.
    9. When number of source nodes were set to 3, total of 3588 packets were generated
    from all the sources. As per AVDR protocol, it requires 8 to 10 hops to deliver
    the packet. Hence, 34,912 packets are transmitted over the network to deliver
    these 3588 packets with an average of 9.73 transmissions per packet generated.
    The transmission ratio is reduced to 9.11 on 24 source nodes. It happened because
    anchor discovery and anchor advertisement is one time process and independent
    of number of sources. There is very small additional traffic reported during initialization
    process. A3DR protocol uses void boundary nodes without any periodic communication
    overhead. For three sources, the A3DR protocol transmitted 43,995 packets to the
    network with packet transmission ratio of 12.26. This ratio becomes 12.81 on 24
    source nodes. Here, trend is growing slowly because number of re-transmissions
    is increasing due to congestion. Download : Download high-res image (243KB) Download

    of number of source nodes on end-to-end delay. In case of EDGR protocol, when
    number of sources is set to 3, it generated a total of 175,849 packets which included
    42,813 data packets and 100,000 beacons in the simulation time with the rate of
    1 beacon per 3 s per node. Additionally, 33,036 are extra transmissions due to
    anchor discovery, anchor list preparation and re-transmissions etc. It generated
    49.05 average transmissions per source data packets during entire communication.
    When number of sources becomes 24 then packet transmission ratio decreases to
    20.16 because beacons are fixed. GPSR-3D protocol also follows the same style
    as EDGR but unlike EDGR, it does not rely on creating and maintaining anchors.
    Therefore, it has relatively smaller overhead. BSMH protocol uses too many control
    packets (HELLO packets) exchanged to construct the void boundary. The construction
    and maintenance of void boundary results in excessive overhead. During the initialization
    phase, the packets get congested and dropped in midway which causes re-transmissions.
    According to simulation results available in Fig. 9, AVDR has an average 25.24%,
    65.93%, 41.14% and 72.68% less overhead than A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH, respectively.
    The end-to-end delay consists of propagation delay, network congestion delay and
    processing time. The processing time is fixed and propagation delay and processing
    time are affected by route length. The network congestion depends on number of
    sources as well as overhead. The effect on end-to-end delay is represented in
    Fig. 10 where results considered the delay of delivered packets only. Here, network
    congestion increases with increasing the number of source nodes. In case of AVDR
    protocol, the path length is minimized because of anchor nodes. The congestion
    delay is also minimum which is slightly growing with number of source nodes. As
    per simulation results, it has been observed that each source demands about 9
    to 10 hops to deliver the packet and an average one hop travel time is about 5
    ms with minor congestion or queuing delay. Further, the average per hop travel
    time is slightly increasing with respect to number of source nodes. Therefore,
    end-to-end delay varies from 46 ms to 53 ms on variation of number of source nodes.
    The A3DR protocol has to travel through boundary of the void so it requires an
    average of 12 hops to deliver the packet, which results in higher end-to-end delay.
    On the other hand GPSR-3D, EDGR and BSMH protocol suffers from higher congestion
    delay because of overhead of periodic beacons, longer path and other control packets.
    Additionally, BSMH protocol suffers from high initial setup delay. Fig. 10 infers
    that AVDR protocol is performing better than other existing protocols in context
    of end-to-end delay with respect to varying numbers of source nodes and its performance
    is 11.03%, 17.84%, 15.08% & 22.08% improved over A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D & BSMH protocols
    respectively. Here, it can be concluded that AVDR protocol is performing better
    than other protocols. It has very less impact of increasing number of source nodes
    on performing parameters delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, stretch and network
    overhead. 5.3. Void volume scenario In this subsection, we have evaluated the
    effect of increasing void volume size. We fixed the number of source nodes 10,
    packet rate 4 packets per second per source and manually set a void with various
    sizes (radius) from 50 to 120 m in center of the network. The packet takes longer
    path to deliver at sink node as void size increases. Unlike Section 5.2, here
    we have considered spherical void structure to check the effect of various void
    shapes. Further, performance of a protocol depends on void type and behavior of
    recovery policy. The effect of varying void size is shown in Fig. 11, Fig. 12,
    Fig. 13, Fig. 14. The void recovery from spherical structure is relatively easier
    because routing path is smoother than other void structures. Fig. 11 demonstrates
    the packet delivery ratio where packets from different source nodes are sent to
    the sink node. While void size increases, the remaining area of the network becomes
    denser as number of nodes is fixed. Therefore, each packet has to cross the void
    in the network. Thus, it is clearly seen that the AVDR protocol produces guaranteed
    message delivery and there is no impact reported higher void volume. On the other
    hand, existing protocols reported a trend of packet loss on increasing the void
    volume. A3DR and GPSR-3D protocols offer a good delivery ratio facing a slight
    packet loss on increasing void size. A3DR and GPSR protocols lose some packets
    during initial phase. AVDR protocol has achieved an average of 4.1% and 11.9%
    improvement over EDGR and BSMH protocols, respectively. The larger void zone causes
    longer path length, which results packet loss due to expiry of lifetime of the
    packet. The expansion in network density along with periodic beaconing increases
    the chance of collision, which results high packet loss in EDGR and BSMH protocols.
    On applying BSMH protocol, additional losses are reported due to heavy congestion.
    Further, the boundary discovery process in spherical void is relatively costlier
    than cubical void shapes. Download : Download high-res image (252KB) Download

    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Effect of void radius size on end-to-end
    delay. In general, the hop distance increases with increasing the void size which
    affects routing stretch. As per results depicted in Fig. 12, it is clearly shown
    that AVDR is producing minimum routing stretch among existing geographical routing
    protocols. After completion of the 300 s of simulation, it varies between 1.07
    and 1.12 for AVDR protocol because it is able to conquer the shortest possible
    path. It has been observed that AVDR is offering 11.83%, 7.63%, 10.66% and 18.2%
    improvement over A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols, respectively. The network
    overhead is calculated in terms of ratio of total packets transmitted in the network
    during the simulation on total data packets generated from different sources.
    The path length is always increased on expanding the void size, which results
    more packet transmissions. Apart from the path length, the control packets also
    affect the overhead. This effect is depicted in Fig. 13. The plot shows the ratio
    for proposed AVDR protocol and its comparison with existing A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D
    and BSMH protocols where proposed protocol offers 17.95%, 67.26%, 49.6% and 75.01%
    improvement, respectively. The increment in void size reflects longer path which
    results greater delay. The condition becomes worse for the protocol, which follows
    the void boundary. Additionally, boundary nodes get congested because overall
    traffic passes through the void boundary, which creates extra end-to-end delay.
    The timing performance of AVDR protocol along with other existing protocols can
    be seen in Fig. 14. The results indicate that anchor based protocols are able
    to follow smaller path lengths, but network congestion may affect overall delivery
    delay. As per simulation results, the AVDR protocol produced 36.18 ms delay when
    void radius was 50 meters and increased to 46.57 ms on void radius of 120 m. The
    A3DR is following boundary of void and producing end-to-end delay of 40.54 ms
    to 56.12s ms when void radius increases from 50 to 120 m. The EDGR protocol has
    shorter path length but suffered from congestion delay because of limited anchors
    and periodic control packets. Thus, AVDR is producing an average of 19.42%, 14.19%,
    22.68% and 25.37% less end-to-end delay over EDGR, A3DR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols
    respectively when void radius length is increasing from 50 to 120 m. Here, it
    can be seen that AVDR protocol is outperforming other existing approaches. It
    is working smoothly and has relatively smaller impact of increasing void volume
    on stated parameters. 5.4. Multiple void scenario We have analyzed the simulation
    results calculated on single void in the network. The network may have multiple
    voids in two conditions: (i) multiple separated voids (ii) consecutive overlapped
    voids. Considering both of the cases, we have created a new simulation scenario
    where 10 source nodes are transmitting the packets to the sink node with packet
    rate of 4 packets per second per source. Two consecutive spherical voids are placed
    inside the network. The distance between centers of both voids is 100 m. The radius
    of void is varying between 30 and 100 m. When void radius is 30, 40 or less than
    50 m, the voids are separated while void boundary is touching each other on 50
    m radius and overlap on larger radius size. In this way, all three cases have
    been tested in this simulation scenario. The performance based on varying multiple
    void size is plotted in Fig. 15, Fig. 16, Fig. 17, Fig. 18. Fig. 15 displays the
    packet delivery ratio of proposed protocol and other existing protocols with different
    void sizes in overlapping and non-overlapping mode. The delivery ratio is decreasing
    on larger size of void radius in case of non-overlapping mode. On the other hand,
    overlapping void depicts single view of void where delivery ratio is significantly
    increasing. Further, after certain points, it decreases with the effect of very
    larger voids. This trend is followed by all of the approaches but variation depends
    on nature of protocol. The proposed AVDR protocol has minimal impact of such diversified
    conditions and able to maximize the delivery ratio. The main reasons for packet
    drops are congestion due to (i) periodic/setup control messages and (ii) tendency
    of following the same path. The proposed protocol poses freedom from both of the
    problems. It does not rely on huge control packets and also divides the traffic
    among four different anchors. Thus, data collisions decrease to achieve a better
    packet delivery ratio. The results indicate that the packet delivery ratio of
    AVDR fluctuates comparatively less than A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols.
    It exploits separated paths, which are passing through different regions of the
    voids, to deliver data with fewer collisions. Compared to A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D
    and BSMH, the proposed approach has an average of 1.61%, 8.25%, 5.72% and 16.01%
    higher packet delivery ratio, respectively, due to less data collisions. Download

    Effect of radius size of two consecutive voids on routing stretch. When void radius
    size increases, it transforms from non-overlapping to overlapping form. It creates
    a type of deep valley structure by combining two voids in overlapped manner (as
    shown in Fig. 2). In the results, routing stretches are computed based on 2400
    routes between each source and to the sink node. We have observed that the routing
    stretch of AVDR is the lowest and slightly lower than that of EDGR for every void
    size. The boundary based protocols traverse the entire boundary and follow a longer
    path around the boundary whereas anchor based protocols directly connect the extreme
    nodes of different voids. The AVHR and EDGR protocols are anchor based hence reported
    good routing stretch. Further, EDGR relies on 2D based structure, hence, it may
    not cover optimal paths in real 3D networks. In comparison, the average routing
    stretch in AVDR is substantially higher, especially for longer voids radius. Fig.
    16 shows that the routing stretch of A3DR protocol is very high because of traversal
    of void boundary and it is highest on radius of 50 m. The overall performance
    of AVDR is improved by 18.52% from A3DR, 6.24% from EDGR, 20.30% from GPSR-3D
    and 31.99% from BSMH protocols. Fig. 17 shows the effect of different sizes of
    various voids on network overhead. The boundary traversing protocols follow longer
    paths, which cause more packet transmissions per source packet. Further, overhead
    of periodic control messages also plays a vital role in generating the overhead.
    The proposed protocol follows a shorter path via anchor nodes and it does not
    consider any periodic control message. The average packet overhead for different
    void sizes is less in our proposed scheme because other protocols either follow
    void boundary or suffer from control message transmissions. This effect can be
    seen in figure where our proposed scheme performs 16.27%, 36.06%, 29.49% and 39.11%
    better than A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols respectively, in terms of average
    packets transmitted per source data packet. Download : Download high-res image

    (271KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 18. Effect of radius size of
    two consecutive voids on end-to-end delay. On increasing the void size, the packets
    have to follow the longer path, which increases end-to-end delay. This fact is
    supported by results plotted in Fig. 18. The figure indicates the delivery delay
    of AVDR, A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH with two consecutive voids on different
    sizes. The results show that the end-to-end delay of proposed approach is 12.04%,
    10.60%, 21.34% and 28.09% lower than A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols, respectively,
    as the voids size increases. The AVDR and EDGR are anchor based protocols and
    minimize path length, which causes shorter end-to-end delay. The EDGR projects
    3D network to 2D so, due to posture errors. It does not always find an optimal
    anchor node. As a result, it could not minimize delivery delays. On the other
    hand, the A3DR follows void boundary and suffers from high delivery delay. Here,
    we can observe that there is a sudden increase in end-to-end delay of A3DR protocol
    when void radius is moving from 40 m to 50 m. This happened because of beginning
    of the void overlapping, which creates deep valley type structure for packet traversing.
    Additionally, A3DR protocol does not generate any periodic overhead, so it delivers
    data with minimum delay. When voids radius increases continuously, then we can
    visualize these voids as single one. In this case, there will be less difference
    in anchor and non anchor based approaches and majority part of delay will be affected
    by network congestion. This effect is depicted beyond radius 80 m in Fig. 18.
    In the simulation, we tested the proposal on different network structures under
    various network conditions. It is important to note that a delay of 36.18 ms is
    observed using proposed method when void radius is 30 m and it increases to 46.57
    ms on void radius of 100 m. Hence, it is concluded that the end-to-end delay using
    proposed method is approximately 14.18%, 19.42%, 22.68% and 25.37% less than A3DR,
    EDGR, GPSR-3D and BSMH protocols, respectively. Moreover, it is also observed
    that proposed approach claims an improvement of 11.83%, 7.63%, 10.66% and 18.20%
    in routing stretch and 17.95%, 67.26%, 49.60% and 75.08% in network overhead over
    A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D, and BSMH protocols, respectively while maximizing the delivery
    of data. In comparison with existing protocols, we found that the overall performance
    of proposed AVDR protocol is better than related protocols on given parameters.
    5.5. Real field testbed results The results are also obtained using real field
    data set [12]. The details of real field data set in form of testbed are available
    at FIT-IoT Lab, Strasbourg, France. In this work, the data set has been generated
    using the information available in [12], [45]. It utilizes IPV6 based addressing
    scheme and routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) as baseline
    protocol [39], [40], [46]. We have considered 88, IoT devices for experimental
    work deployed over 120 m 100 m 30 m of volume in ICube building at Strasbourg.
    A detailed description of the real testbed used in this work is given in [47].
    All of the IoT devices use Arduino-compatible microcontroller platform architecture
    Zigduino board, and IEEE 802.15.4 radio chip ATmega128RFA1. For simplicity, the
    nodes’ actual 3D locations are normalized to the network dimensions such that
    x, y, z coordinates of all nodes lie between (0, 0, 0) and (120, 100, 30). The
    experimental work is carried out under two different test cases. The first test
    case is depicted in Fig. 2 where node 74 is considered as source and node 47 is
    the sink. The first test case focuses on void creation and anchor discovery process.
    However, the second test case considers the varying number of sources while sink
    is fixed at node 74, shown in Fig. 19. This test case illustrates the anchor advertisement
    process and represents the effect of varying sources on network performance. Similar
    to the simulation work, the experimental results are also obtained in terms of
    packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, routing stretch and routing overhead.
    The numerical values of the experimental results are presented in Table 3, Table
    4. Each source generates 2 packets per second and results are collected for 300
    s of data transmission. In first test case, 3D coordinates of sink node 47 are
    fixed at one end at (111.21, 75.36, 12.6) of the network, whereas source node
    74 is configured at another end with 3D coordinates (8.9, 11.54, 21.20). The source
    node initiates the data packet and forwards it towards the sink node. Initially,
    packet follows the greedy approach and passes through nodes 85, 84, 37 and then
    stuck at node 19. However, node 19 does not have any neighbor nearer to the sink
    node, it creates void in the network and node 19 becomes a void node. This scenario
    is depicted in Fig. 2(a). At this point, proposed method starts anchor discovery
    process and packet follows the void boundary nodes. The boundary nodes compute
    orthogonal distance over line connecting void node and sink node. A node with
    longest orthogonal in a specified direction becomes an anchor node. Following
    such procedure, node 81 and node 18 are declared as anchor nodes. On completing
    the anchor discovery process, source node approaches anchors rather than sink
    node. Further, anchor node forwards the packet to the sink node. This procedure
    is illustrated in Fig. 2(b). Table 3. Variations in the packet delivery ratio,
    end-to-end delay, routing stretch, and overhead with varying one source–sink pair

    1.49 35498 RPL [39], [40] 98.16 45.81 1.51 21746 The source node generates 2 packets
    per second and total communication duration is 300 s. Initial communication for
    one second time is ignored for anchor discovery process hence, we collected the
    data of 299 s. A total of 598 packets were initiated from the source node. The
    proposed method is able to deliver all of the packets at the sink node whereas
    other methods have certain packet loss. Further, the proposed method delivers
    the packet after going through 8 hops but using manual process, data can be delivered
    in 7 hops. Hence, average routing stretch of the proposed method is 1.14 (i.e.,
    8/7). Other existing methods are delivering data using more than 8 hops and have
    bigger value of routing stretch. Moreover, path length also affects the end-to-end
    delay. The average time consumed per hop is about 4 ms. Hence, proposed method
    consumes an average of 34.14 ms of time to deliver the packet at sink node. This
    delay is smaller than other existing routing protocols. Additionally, proposed
    method consumes very less number of additional transmissions for data delivery.
    Thus, the network overhead is minimized. The beacon based methods suffer from
    network overhead. So, it can be concluded that proposed method outperforms existing
    geographical routing protocols in the first test case. Download : Download high-res

    performance. This test case is depicted in Fig. 19(a). In this test case, 3D coordinates
    of sink node 74 are fixed at one end at (8.9, 11.54, 21.20) of the network where
    as six source nodes are configured at another end of the network. A void is available
    between source and sink such that each source packet has to pass through void.
    Initially, node 50 initiates the data packet and is stuck at void node 28 in the
    route of the sink node while following the greedy approach. This can be seen in
    Fig. 19(a). The anchor discovery process starts at this point. The discovery process
    discovers node 7 and node 17 as anchor nodes for upcoming communications. Further,
    the location of these two anchors is advertised to the other nodes in scope of
    these anchors. Here, anchor advertisement process completes and other sources
    get the information of available anchors. Now, all the sources utilize the anchor
    information to find out direct route from source to anchor and anchor to the sink
    node. This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 19(b) where network void does not affect
    the communication between source and sink. In this test case, the proposed method
    achieves more than 99% delivery ratio in the best case and it is more than 98%
    when number of source nodes increases to 6. Here, a few packets are lost in the
    beginning due to anchor discovery and anchor advertisement process. However, it
    is noted that the performance of the proposed method increases by 0.74%, 4.83%
    3.90%, 9.48% and 4.38% when compared to A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D, BSMH, and RPL protocols,
    respectively. In addition to the delivery ratio, it is also noted that the proposed
    AVDR protocol has reported the least average end to end delay when compared to
    other existing geographical routing protocols. The proposed method has an average
    end-to-end delay about 31 ms when all sources are transferring the data simultaneously.
    However, the average end-to-end delay in case of conventional A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D,
    BSMH and RPL routing protocols is greater than 35 ms under similar conditions.
    The reason for the improved end-to-end delay of the proposed method is due to
    its ability to select the direct path through anchor nodes during data delivery
    to the sink node. It is lacking in the conventional geographical routing and existing
    two dimensional based anchor discovery methods. Recall that the proposed method
    takes into account path length as one of the parameters and minimizes the data
    transmission delay during the data transfer. The proposed method obtains 10.12%,
    15.25%, 13.44%, 21.80% and 24.89% improved results over existing A3DR, EDGR, GPSR-3D,
    BSMH and RPL methods. The average routing stretch for all the packet transmissions
    over the testbed is also given in Table 4. A closer examination of the experimental
    results shows that the proposed method achieves routing stretch of 1.14 in the
    best case. This is possible in case of less number of source nodes as very less
    traffic is generated in the network. When number of sources increases, the respective
    traffic also increases which degrades the path length performance. Also, the average
    routing stretch is less than 1.22 in all other cases using proposed method. Hence,
    the proposed method is able to deliver the data using the shortest path length
    when compared to other existing methods. The proposed method achieves more than
    5% and 12% average improvement over existing anchor based and traditional non-anchor
    based approaches, respectively. This study also considers the effect of varying
    source nodes on the network overhead. The overhead increases due to additional
    packets e.g., beacons, control packets and re-transmissions. This effect is illustrated
    in Table 4. A total of 598 packets are sent from source when only one source is
    generating the data packets. Existing protocols EDGR, GPSR-3D, BSMH and RPL protocols
    require more than 14,500 transmissions to deliver these packets. On the other
    hand, A3DR and proposed AVDR protocol require near to 6000 transmissions. When
    number of source nodes increases to 6 then total 3588 packets generate for data
    delivery. In this case, proposed method utilizes 25,959 transmissions but non-anchor
    based methods needed more than 39,700 transmissions due to longer path. On the
    other hand, the beacon based methods require more than 53,000 transmissions including
    beacons, control packets and re-transmissions. Further, it is noted that the network
    overhead analysis is also important because it affects the average energy consumption.
    Each transmission and reception consume energy of IoT devices. Therefore, the
    discussion on energy consumption and its comparative analysis are given in next
    paragraph. As part of energy consumption analysis using different methods, BSMH
    method reports higher energy consumption and lesser network lifetime. This method
    wastes a lot of energy to deal with network overhead due to packet loss, re-transmissions
    and longer paths. The RPL method also utilizes more energy but less than the BSMH.
    Further, EDGR and GPSR-3D methods consume relatively less energy because these
    methods are anchor-based methods and require smaller paths during void conditions.
    A3DR also consumes moderate energy because it does not rely on periodic beacons
    but follows a longer path around the boundary of the void. The path length, overhead,
    and losses are minimized in the proposed novel AVDR method. As a result, the novel
    AVDR method performs better than existing geographical routing methods. Hence,
    it can be treated as an energy-efficient one. 6. Conclusion In this paper, a novel
    anchor-based void detouring routing (AVDR) method is proposed to detour the void
    with reduced path length and improved data transmission delay. The method utilizes
    anchor nodes towards routing of data packets in a 3D IoT network. The anchor node
    selection is based on orthogonal distance between anchor candidate and line joining
    between void node and sink node. The anchor nodes are judiciously distributed
    to other nodes lying inside the scope of anchor nodes. Therefore, all source nodes
    do not require anchor discovery process again and again which helps in minimizing
    the overall network overhead. The performance of the proposed method has been
    illustrated with diagrams, mathematical analysis, examples, test cases, simulated
    and real testbed results. The simulation results are obtained using INET framework
    under OMNET++ simulator. The performance of the proposed method is also validated
    using real field datasets in different test cases. The results illustrate that
    the AVDR protocol efficiently enhances the performance of packet delivery ratio,
    path length in terms of routing stretch, network overhead and end-to-end delay.
    Multiple experimental scenarios have been considered on various void conditions
    in the network. The proposed scheme is efficiently able to detour the network
    void and follows smaller path in shorter duration. Thus, it has been proven that
    the experimental results of the proposed AVDR protocol is outperforming other
    existing anchor-based and non anchor-based geographical routing schemes. CRediT

  title: Anchor-based void detouring routing protocol in three dimensional IoT networks
  verbatim_quote1: In this context, geographical routing protocol has been considered
    as a promising approach for the path selection in WSNs. This approach is full
    of scalability and multi-hop routing is performed using local decisions. However,
    geographical routing protocols suffer from the void node problem (VNP) i.e., a
    region where active nodes are not available in the direction closer to the destination.
    Numerous protocols have been designed to get recovery from VNP in 2D networks
    which cannot be directly applied to 3D networks. The 3D routing includes the networks
    deployed in the hilly area, high buildings, airborne region, underground, underwater
    and so forth. On applying the 2D routing protocols on complex 3D topology, the
    network may face additional problems like packet looping, routing failure, ambiguity,
    or increased data latency due to longer path. Further, the majority of geographical
    routing protocols follow the boundary of void which leads to a longer path. In
    order to address the aforementioned challenges, this paper presents a novel anchor-based
    void detouring routing (AVDR) protocol where anchor node is treated as a sub-destination

    satellite and drone images and the Internet of Things (IoT) has begun transforming
    remote sensing of agriculture by improving accessibility and frequency of updates.
    Modern IoT-based smart agriculture systems use Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)
    to gather information from an ecosystem that regulates the quantity of water in
    agricultural fields could be one of these activities. The WSNs remained a challenge
    to transfer data to drones for analysis purposes. These are composed of tiny sensory
    architectures organized together to bring efficiency and scalability features
    to a network. WSN nodes are controlled and managed by a cluster. It is quite difficult
    to design an efficient leader election protocol. The computation power, storage
    space, and energy supply of sensor nodes make them unable to frequently switch
    to a different cluster. The WSN cluster-head election process requires a lot of
    energy (evaluation and computational process to select the most appropriate node
    with the least impact on network fragmentation in energy consumption of selected
    node). Then it is necessary to formulate a mechanism where WSNs utilize the least
    energy to coordinate with the remote sensing sources. This study presents a cluster
    election algorithm using the fuzzy logic inference system. It uses a coordinates
    system to map network nodes and map them based on prioritized scheduling. Lifetime
    augmentation in wireless sensor networks has always been of great interest. During
    data transmission from normal sensor nodes to the base station (sink), excess
    energy is dissipated. Optimizing the energy dissipation of WSNs through the selection
    of cluster heads is a powerful way to increase the lifespan. By electing more

    1. Introduction Remote sensing is extensively used in smart agriculture systems
    to manage and monitor agriculture yields both in productivity and sustainability
    (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018, Glaroudis et al., 2020). These systems consist
    of modern communication equipment aimed at helping farmers improve crop productivity.
    A smart agriculture system consists of precision equipment such as sensors, actuators,
    and unmanned aerial vehicles. Sensors are installed on agriculture farms to monitor
    variations and trends. Most of the time, these sensors communicate by using wireless
    communication. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) constitute an important component
    of a smart agriculture system. It is extensively used both for monitoring and
    tracking applications (Devi et al., 2020). It has been used widely in environments
    such as temperature, pressure measurement, and environment monitoring (Rajpoot
    et al., 2020, Dai et al., 2020). However, if we want to use WSN, we have to keep
    in mind that WSN does not have an external power supply, and sensors rely on their
    internal power and are almost difficult to recharge and replace. However, work
    has been done to compensate for this problem. Energy consumption can be reduced
    or compensated as much as possible (Mazunga and Nechibvute, 2021) (See Table 1).

    based optimal cluster head sections Not consider the cluster head distance with
    a base station Therefore, power consumption has become one of the most critical
    issues in WSN. Most researchers in this field have focused on reducing energy
    consumption by presenting different approaches that have greatly improved our
    focus on the subject. With the help of proper messaging and optimal use of network
    resources, we aim to reduce energy consumption. WSN architecture consists of interconnected
    sensor nodes (Jamshidi et al., 2020, Huang et al., 2020, Pal and Jolfaei, 2020).
    Each sensor node is a single, tiny device equipped with a simple microcontroller.
    WSN-based systems are used in many fields such as industry, civilian application,
    healthcare, and agriculture. The biggest challenge in maintaining sensor efficiency
    is the complex nature of the optimized algorithms. Their complexity often constrains
    the WSN nodes, such as processing power and size. WSN node management is a complicated
    task (Das et al., 2020, Rodrigues and John, 2020, Gbadouissa et al., 2020). Many
    works of literature are available on the topic of network node management (Tian
    et al., 2020, Elappila et al., 2020). Apart from those mentioned above, most sensor
    nodes detect functions such as motion, temperature, humidity, and light. These
    sensors use a Pico-power microcontroller. It helps control the power transceiver
    and the communication function of the sensors. The recovery of the captured information
    from dead nodes is a complicated task. Therefore, various localization methods
    ensure that the information arrives at the right time from the active nodes. In
    remote sensing environments, agriculture farms are monitored using aerial vehicles
    such, e.g. drones, as shown in Fig. 1. These drones monitor the farms by communicating
    with the cluster leader of the WSN for exchange and update of information. The
    cluster heads do not send information directly to aerial vehicles but rather through
    a base station (Sink). WSN classification is based on performance, network architecture,
    and user requirements. Includes creating a cluster with the features required
    for the classification phase (Gheisari Mehdi, Afzaal Abbasi Aaqif, Sayari Zahra,
    Rizvi Qasim, Asheralieva Alia, Banu Sabitha, M. Awaysheh Feras, Hussain Shah Syed
    Bilal, Arif Raza Khuhawar. “A Survey on Clustering Algorithms in Wireless Sensor
    Networks: Challenges, Research, and Trends”, 2020). Romika et al. In 2020 (Ngangbam
    et al., 2020) proposed a new distributed algorithm for selecting cluster heads.
    This algorithm has three main features and is based on symmetric key operations.

    Fig. 1. Remote monitoring of agriculture farms. The cluster nodes unanimously
    elect the leader. These are resilient against hacking attacks and have no impact
    on cluster leader election decisions. The node is also considered fault-tolerant
    to ensure safety for messages lost or altered through malicious attacks. Tao et
    al., in 2019 (Han et al., 2019), also presented a cluster head selection algorithm.
    The proposed algorithm uses fuzzy rules. It considers the section''s three main
    characteristics: the energy available from the nodes, the number of neighboring
    nodes, and the distance from the base station (or sink). This method is compared
    to hierarchical distributed clustering. The results show that this method improves
    the performance in terms of network lifetime. The research proposed by Baby and
    Vasudevan (Shalini and Vasudevan, 2019) introduced a distributed and stable algorithm
    for cluster head election. The proposed algorithm works with the calculation of
    probability values. It considers two parameters, i.e., residual energy of the
    sensor node, and compares it with the average energy of the combined WSN node.
    The results show that the proposed algorithm is stable and efficient compared
    to traditional technology. The main disadvantage of this algorithm is that it
    sends or receives a relatively high number of data packets to the sink compared
    to other algorithms. Mirel et al. (2020) (El Gheche et al., 2020) Proposed a multilayer
    clustering algorithm. Consider three centralized algorithms that share distributed
    functions to reduce the number of CH (Cluster Head) candidates. The multilayer
    algorithm also reduces the message exchange load using efficient topology architecture.
    The lifetime and stability of a WSN are ensured through a proper energy utilization
    method. This issue is enabled through the concept of clustering (Srikanth and
    Prasad, 2020, Kumaresan and Kalyani, 2021). Clustering improves energy efficiency
    through cluster-head selection methods. Several ways to select cluster heads in
    sensor networks (Malakar, 2020, Nehra et al., 2020). If a suitable cluster is
    selected, it will help reduce the transmission distance of the communication distance
    of the main node that is not the cluster head. The Low Energy Adaptive Clustering
    Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol (Nafei and Javadpour, 2021, Shukla and Tripathi, 2020)
    is considered an important clustering method because it improves energy efficiency
    in a very efficient way. Besides, other swarm intelligence approaches, such as
    (Raj et al., 2020, Arora et al., 2020), have also improved computing power usage.
    This research proposes a WSN cluster leader selection algorithm that uses fuzzy
    logic, reducing communication overhead, improving energy efficiency, and reducing
    memory requirements. Fuzzy logic is one of the most effective methods for combining
    and evaluating parameters in wireless sensor networks since it allows us to combine
    and evaluate data more effectively. However, it is possible to use it to improve
    the performance of sensor networks, which has led us to use this logic. The author
    compares the proposed algorithm with the advanced algorithm (such as LEACH) in
    energy consumption. The research offers a fuzzy-based system that will lead to
    smart agriculture and effective crop development. The model''s goal is to monitor
    agricultural fields for effective water consumption. The suggested approach demonstrates
    high water utilization in irrigation and is advantageous for the restricted water
    area. The contributions of this study are highlighted as follows: a. Improve decision
    making by the fuzzy choice of cluster leader, reduce resource consumption, and
    generally improve performance; b. The proposed model considers both cluster leader
    selection and the power consumption; c. Evaluation and extension lifetime of the
    network; d. The network consists of homogeneous nodes with the same energy level;
    1.1. WSN in agriculture WSN is an important enabler for precision agriculture.
    Because it helps gather, monitor, and analyze data from agricultural areas (Kumar
    and Ilango, 2018). WSN might connect IoT sensors, allowing for real-time detection
    of soil and climatic conditions as well as irrigation automation (Safari et al.,
    2020). IoT, clustering, RFID, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are important
    enablers for creating smarter, more sustainable agriculture that benefits farmers
    and consumers. WSN solutions drew a lot of attention and gained much traction
    because of their potential capacity to improve farmers'' awareness of crop conditions,
    resource utilization, and environmental conditions. The proposed method recommends
    improvement approaches for existing WSN deficiencies in the context of energy
    efficiency in order to provide an information platform for WSN to play a more
    important role in crop production. The authors propose a novel cluster-head selection
    mechanism using fuzzy logic to establish a fully connected network with efficiency
    and network resource utilization in an agriculture environment. Using the proposed
    algorithm, full connectivity between sensor nodes is assumed to be energy-efficient
    while enhancing network lifetime. This increases the network''s longevity by reducing
    the dead node count considerably. The fundamental point of the proposed strategy
    appropriation in horticulture is information collection, environmental monitoring,
    and data analysis. The rest of the study is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes
    the related work. Section 3 briefly explains the methodology used in the proposed
    study. Section 4 reports on the evaluation, results, and discussion of the proposed
    system. Finally, Section 5 summarizes the article. 2. Related work Remote sensing
    is the concept of using sensors to accumulate data. The sensor detects statistics
    by using gathering energy reflected from the ground. Sensors are often established
    on satellites or statistics series drones (Colomina et al., 2014, Barrientos et
    al., 2011). Remote sensing explores treasured records due to the fact it affords
    an overview. Remote sensing science is active and passive, based totally on sensory
    responses to goal stimuli. This statistics can be used for correct estimations
    because it uses a large vicinity with repetitive calibrated sensory measurements
    to estimate changes in one-of-a-kind resolutions (Turner et al.,(Gheisari, 2016)).
    This issue helps accomplish correct effects in contrast to the usual facts series
    methods. The world summit on food security concluded on a note that the world
    population would grow by 10 billion by the year 2050 (Tomlinson and “Doubling
    food production to feed the 9 billion: a critical perspective on a key discourse
    of food security in the UK” Journal of rural studies 29, , 2013). With the evaluated
    rate of growth, agriculture production must also increase. This issue will help
    in accommodating the increasing food demands. Agricultural land management can
    improve agriculture production by improving water resources, land up-grading,
    and crop monitoring. In modern agriculture systems, monitoring is performed through
    remote sensing techniques. Remote sensing in agriculture is of fundamental importance
    because it provides ways and means to monitor agriculture yields and crops effectively.
    Agriculture systems involving remote sensing technologies are widely known as
    smart agriculture systems. These systems involve sensors and sensory equipment
    for monitoring agriculture crops. These sensors are connected to exchange information
    using a cluster head sensor (Al-qaness et al., 2019, Gupta and Sharma, 2015; Jafari
    et al., 2016). A cluster head later communicates information to a base station,
    which can be based or mounted on a drone or satellite. This section discusses
    the latest developments in WSN cluster leader selection. In Heinzelman et al.
    (2000), the LEACH algorithm was proposed. It was developed to achieve energy efficiency
    in a clustered hierarchical network. This methodology proposes to use a dedicated
    central location for storing and collecting cluster data. Each cluster has a specified
    location where data collection is performed. It also uses probabilistic methods
    to select cluster heads; however, it does not consider the remaining energy sources
    of the cluster. This issue is because information can only be obtained after transmitting
    and receiving information. However, this is a complex and energy-consuming task.
    In Heinzelman et al. (2002), an improved LEACH algorithm for cluster head selection
    was proposed. To solve the problem of selecting the head of the cluster uses the
    time division multiple access (TDMA) method. The base station updates the nominated
    cluster head to synchronize future transmission. The cluster head also checks
    its immediate neighbors to reduce future data and time-related delays. The presented
    LEACH-C performs the same cluster head selections for other components of the
    networks to find sensor nodes with a smaller number of computational power and
    communication resources. Performing all computing tasks at the base station would
    result in higher energy consumption, adversely affecting its performance. Several
    research proposals target improving the performance of cluster head selection
    (Han et al., 2019, Balaji et al., 2019, Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018, Glaroudis
    et al., 2020, Devi et al., 2020). Cluster head selection is given more importance
    because it helps in improving the computational complexity of the wireless sensor
    network. Several particle swarm optimizations (PSO) based approaches are presented
    to address these challenges. PSO concepts are vastly used in computing to optimize
    challenges by relating their availability to given quality value. Swarm intelligence
    has often been used in WSN protocols for optimizing energy-related constraints.
    PSO-C was implemented by Abdul Latiff et al. (2007), Abdul Latiff et al. (2007)
    in WSNs to determine optimal cluster head sections for clusters. By using PSO-C,
    location cluster heads can achieve effective results, thus conserving energy and
    improving the lifetime of sensors. Unfortunately, the selection process does not
    consider the cluster head distance concerning the base station. Ignoring the distance
    parameter may affect the energy efficiency and data transmission time. Srinivasa
    et al (2017) (Srinivasa Rao et al., 2017),. addressed this challenge. The author
    proposed a PSO-based Power Saving Cluster Head Selection (PSOECHS) algorithm.
    It uses an objective function that measures the cluster head and base station
    distance. Then it uses an objective function to select a node within each cluster.
    PSOCHS is considered an optimal solution for environments where sensors can communicate
    with each other using normal traffic patterns; however, its performance degrades
    under higher values of power, energy consumption, and computational complexity.
    In Wang et al. (2019) (Rezaeiye, 2011), an even distribution strategy for network
    resource allocation is presented. It ensures that the amount of data spread across
    the WSN is distributed evenly across all locations. Wang et al. (Wang et al.,
    2018) proposed a cluster election algorithm based on PSO. They calculate the amount
    of power allocated by evaluating the distribution of the energy levels of the
    sensor nodes and the energy of the cluster heads in the coverage area. Finally,
    choose the node with the highest energy. Mehra et al. (Mehra et al., 2020) proposed
    a fuzzy-based cluster head selection algorithm by choosing the best candidate
    for cluster head to provide load balancing. Therefore, in order to solve this
    problem, it uses the remaining energy, the distance of the sink point, and the
    density of the node as the input parameters of the fuzzy inference system. In
    other words, compared with the previous model mentioned in the document, the advantage
    of this model is that it is more efficient, and the network life is longer than
    before. Because this method attempts to reduce the data transmission between nodes
    by selecting cluster head nodes more efficiently than other methods, it has been
    mentioned in the document. On the other hand, the weakness of this system is that
    it largely depends on the distance of the nodes. Fuzzy logic is a decision-making
    system in most aspects. It has been widely used in knowledge-based systems and
    multiobjective optimization techniques. Traditional control mechanisms require
    precise and concise information about their environment. However, fuzzy logic
    systems can make decisions based on many environmental parameters. Wang et al.
    (2019) (Lei et al., 2019) propose a fuzzy system and multiobjective technology
    based on predefined rules. Wireless sensor networks usually overcome the uncertainty
    problem by incorporating fuzzy logic into clustering algorithms. In the Fuzzy
    Clustering Algorithm (FCA) (Godbole, 2012), fuzzy logic combines multiple parameters
    to determine a cluster head for WSNs. FCA uses the IF_THEN rule for better precision
    when using the defuzzification output method. If a node has a strong coupling
    with its neighbors, it will become the cluster''s head. Fuzzy logic technology
    can be used in distributed and centralized systems. Besides, positioning services
    and temporal remote sensing images are crucial to many countries for intelligent
    agriculture. For example, Brazil has developed functions in the Global Navigation
    Satellite System (GNSS) multi-constellation data processing and analysis, which
    can be used for various applications such as agriculture (Javadpour et al., 2018).
    Another example is the New Zealand government. They allocated funds to support
    the Regional Satellite Augmentation System (SBAS) (Wifi). This issue will significantly
    improve the accuracy of the WSN GPS and apply it to intelligent farming and cadastral
    mapping purposes. Methodology. Several studies on energy consumption, resource
    scarcity, and global warming are now being conducted throughout the world. WSN
    and other supporting technologies can significantly improve the efficiency of
    agriculture. It demonstrates that optimal resource utilization is critical in
    agriculture. A helpful cluster-head selection approach might be utilized to collect
    data from sensor nodes, improve energy efficiency, and reduce channel congestion
    to preserve the stability of WSNs in the clustering aspect. As a result, it is
    critical to extend the life of sensor networks and respond to the demands of precision
    agriculture, which necessitates improved methodologies and technologies to reduce
    costs and enhance output. In this research, we use a fuzzy inference system to
    improve the performance of the previously proposed algorithm and propose an optimal
    cluster head selection algorithm by reducing memory and communication overhead.
    The proposed clustering algorithm is based on the functionality of the LEACH protocol.
    The LEACH protocol is one of the first and most popular layer protocols for selecting
    WSN cluster leaders. This protocol can divide network activity into four phases
    (Fig. 2). At the beginning of each cycle, the resulting number of nodes is chosen
    as the cluster head in random order. For this purpose, each node generates a random
    number between 0 and 1 using Eq. (1). If the generated number is less than T(n),
    the node is selected as cluster-head. In Eq. (1), P represents the correlation
    between the number of nodes and clusters in the network. Here, r represents the
    current round, and G is the number of nodes in the previously selected cluster
    head. (1) Download : Download high-res image (125KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Overview of a fuzzy system and its features. After the cluster head
    node is defined, other nodes can be classified according to the strength of the
    received signal. It helps design a strategy so that each cluster leader can decide
    to lead a cluster. The cluster head node uses the TDMA mechanism among the cluster
    members to divide its scope of responsibility for various time slots. In each
    time segment, a cluster leader communicates with a single cluster member and then
    shares their packets of information. Each time slot, the cluster leader sends
    cluster information to the master cluster node. According to this mechanism, cluster
    headers are modified to handle load distribution among different nodes. So, the
    algorithm works in the following four stages. Notification phase (advertising),
    cluster formation phase, forming phase schedule, and data transfer phase. A. Advertising
    stage (Notification phase) Each sensor has chosen a random value between 0 and
    1. If the random number is less than the threshold T(n), the node selects the
    cluster head by itself. This issue is indicated by the symbol P, representing
    the percentage of the required cluster head. It is represented by the symbol r,
    which indicates the number of cycles in the current period. G represents the percent
    of nodes cluster heads in 1 / P of the last recording period. This threshold will
    determine that each node in period 1/P is a cluster head. With probability P,
    any node can be the head of the cluster in the first round. The next step increases
    the probability of selecting a node that is not chosen as the cluster head. The
    fuzzy inference system (FIS) is described in this study. A broadcast message is
    sent from each node selected as a cluster head node to other sensors. This message
    is sent with residual energy from each cluster head node. ADV = Node ID + Detectable
    header. In the next step, the non-cluster head node selects the cluster head to
    which it belongs. The non-cluster head node will join the partner/tightly coupled
    cluster head if it receives multiple advertisement messages. The strength and
    correlation of the sensors are determined by the strength of the signals received
    by the cluster. B. Cluster formation stage (phase) After determination, each node
    must deliver the following information to the cluster head in this phase. When
    each node decides to join one of the clusters, it sends a join-request message
    (Join-REQ) back to the cluster head. The messages contain the cluster head''s
    ID, the node''s ID, and the header. Each node transmits a join-request message
    (Join-REQ) back to the chosen cluster head using a CSMA MAC protocol. (2) C. Forming
    stage schedule The cluster head receives all data from the members and forms a
    TDMA program to coordinate data transmission within the cluster, and the TDMA
    prevents head nodes from colliding. The CH node broadcasts an advertisement message,
    and each non-cluster head node determines a cluster head node. Therefore, each
    non-cluster head node broadcasts a join request message (JoinREQ) to its cluster
    head. D. Data transfer stage In the data transfer phase, the data transfer begins.
    If the radio equipment on a non-cluster head node is interrupted, the system has
    the authority to turn it off. A fuzzy system calculates the number of opportunities
    (step messages) from each node to the parent node. Based on the “Mamdani” approach,
    we used a fuzzy system in our case (Negnevitsky, 2001). This system has three
    input functions and a single output function. The fuzzy value is converted into
    a crisp value in the output defuzzification operation. The study used a defuzzification
    method called the central method. One of the more popular methods among defuzzification
    studies. This method is calculated using the following equation: (3) The purpose
    of defuzzification is to put a numerical value on the fuzzy set resulting from
    the aggregation to be used by the designer (i.e., the tracking step ). Defuzzification
    can be performed using at least seven operators. Still, the most popular is the
    centroid, which is calculated by the above formula, for which μ( ) is the degree
    of membership of the aggregated fuzzy set for the output . An overview of the
    fuzzy system and its properties is shown in Fig. 2. The membership functions (MF)
    used for our fuzzy system have been tested and optimized, i.e., Gaussian MF. The
    Gauss M.F. equation is as follows: (4) where c determines the center and represents
    the width of the Gaussian MF, Inputs and outputs are defined as follows: The first
    input (residual energy): Indicates the remaining energy of each node. The higher
    the energy, the more information can be sent and received. This increases the
    battery life of the node. The second input (neighbor''s #): It displays the count
    of each neighboring node. A node with many neighbors is more likely to be a parent
    node. A proposed method for calculating the number of neighborhoods is given in
    (Biswas et al., 2019). This method uses the following formula: (5) Among them,
    R is the radius of the neighbor, γ = 0.01, so the radius of the operating neighborhood
    of the algorithm is 15 m. The third input (centrality): Is the distance from the
    central node to the node. The output (chance): It uses fuzzy rules to combine
    three input values. The input and output membership functions are shown in Fig.

    function of the fuzzy system. Input values are defined by fuzzy rules combined
    to produce an output. The fuzzy system is expressed through the “fuzzy rule base”
    in Table 2. The relation between the three inputs and the output, which calculates
    the decision, is as follows: (6) Table 2. Fuzzy Inference Rule Base. Rules Inputs

    nodes to test the method. Other network parameters modified in the algorithm are
    shown below: 2.1. Simulation setup Simulation parameters used in the proposed
    method’s experimental analysis are presented in this section. Network Simulator2
    (NS2) was used in the simulation experiments, which is a well-known and reliable
    simulation tool for analyzing network routing and communication. Table 3 shows
    the default values for the simulation parameters. The dimension of the network
    extends to an area of 100 m × 100 m, and the coordinates of the base station are
    [50.50]. There are different numbers of rounds in which the simulation results
    are evaluated. The period of a single simulation round is set to 1000. Additionally,
    the number of agriculture sensors is set to 100, respectively. All of the agricultural
    sensors, i.e., temperature sensors, light sensors, soil moisture sensors, location
    sensors, airflow sensors, etc. are scattered randomly. Packet size (k) and payload
    size are set to 64 bits and 256 bytes. The energy required to run a running transmitter
    of agriculture sensors is uniform, i.e., 50nj. A Constant Bit Rate (CBR) is used
    between sensor nodes, and the sensor nodes'' transmission range is set to 20 m.

    system model are explained. First, we announce the assumptions of the network
    model. To confirm the design method, we use a randomization form to consider a
    test platform network consisting of 100 nodes. The dimension of the network extends
    to an area of 100 m × 100 m. In this case, the base station coordinates are considered
    [50.50], and the probability value is set at 0.1. The initial energy is set to
    0.5 J. All sensor nodes are considered to have the same energy state. At the beginning
    of Cluster head selection, all nodes have the same probability of being a CH.
    The probability that an initial selection of a node will become a header is determined
    by P. The energy model of nodes in Joules is determined. Regarding Pseudocode
    in the previous chapter, the simulation continues until the radio equipment of
    normal node(s) goes down. So, the algorithm has the propriety of turning the node
    off and continuing to transfer data by other nodes. In addition, all nodes and
    the sink are located in a fixed position with similar computational and memory
    capacity. The network is considered in a homogenous form. The distance between
    nodes is calculated as the intensity of the received signal and means that the
    sensor node does not recognize its exact position. The following is a description
    of the radio energy model. The model of K-bit packet transmission radio energy
    is modeled over distance as follows: (7) The radio energy model receives a K-bit
    package which can be represented as. (8) Eelec considers the energy required to
    run a running transmitter circuit depending on the distance. The radio parameters
    used in the simulation are defined as follows: Algorithms are tested for other
    values of the case. After about 1000 runs, optimal cluster head values can be
    obtained. Fig. 6 shows the changes in the system parameters during iteration.

    that the precision is higher than the traditional LEACH algorithm. Fig. 8 shows
    the performance analysis of our system in terms of remaining energy and the number
    of active nodes. Fig. 9 illustrates the performance comparison between the standard
    LEACH algorithm and the fuzzy inference system. Part (a) represents the remaining
    energy, and part (b) represents the number of active nodes. As shown in Fig. 9

    the performance of the proposed method with the other methods. The performance
    of the proposed method is compared with the FCA method. Given that the FCA method
    is consistent with the proposed method and also uses fuzzy logic that can show
    the efficiency of the proposed method by comparison. The FCA algorithm is designed
    for WSN with fixed sensor nodes. It adjusts the radius of the radio cluster head
    according to the remaining energy. It also adjusts the distance between the sensor
    nodes and the base station. This method aims to select the radius of the cluster
    head. In this algorithm, a number between 0 and 1 is generated for each node in
    each round. If the threshold (T(n)) is greater than a certain value, the node
    can be considered a cluster head. The fuzzy system considers three inputs. The
    results of this study were simulated. FCA is regarded as a stable and energy-efficient
    WSN clustering algorithm. Due to the similarity between our proposed method and
    the LEACH algorithm, we compared it with the LEACH algorithm. Fig. 10 shows the
    performance comparison between the FCA method and the LEACH algorithm. The results
    demonstrate that FCA has improved performance over the LEACH. Finally, in Fig.
    11, it can be seen that the results of the comparison demonstrate the superiority
    and improvement of our proposed method. From the simulation results, it is evident
    that the proposed method results in a 24% improvement in the ratio of alive nodes
    compared to other methods. Fig. 12 illustrates the amount of residual energy algorithm
    in which the proposed method is more efficient than other methods, and the lifespan
    of the network is extended. Simulation results however indicate a 9% improvement
    in the residual energy ratio of the proposed method. Download : Download high-res

    the WSNs constitute an essential contribution to remote sensing of smart agriculture
    systems for monitoring, temperature measurement, irrigation system measurement,
    and water supply measurement, among other things. It plays a vital role in enabling
    communication between several intelligent agriculture ecosystem computing components.
    WSN consists of a network of nodes, which communicate with each other and a base
    station. The sensors have several limitations, including topology management,
    mapping, and organization, battery power. These challenges adversely affect the
    intelligent agriculture system''s performance. By improving the quality of WSN,
    data can be accessed remotely. This will enhance the connectivity and coverage
    area of the farm. An algorithm for fuzzy-based intelligent agricultural system
    cluster head selection is proposed to overcome the difficulties of unreasonable
    cluster head selection and excessive power consumption. An extensive evaluation
    and discussion of other related technologies in this field were conducted, followed
    by a brief comparison. By comparing this work with existing solutions, we conclude
    that the proposed method is more efficient than the existing methods. Energy consumption
    caused improving network lifetime. This study also concluded that the proposed
    algorithm could apply in innovative agriculture applications to analyze and use
    a simulation environment. 5. Availability of data and materials If necessary,

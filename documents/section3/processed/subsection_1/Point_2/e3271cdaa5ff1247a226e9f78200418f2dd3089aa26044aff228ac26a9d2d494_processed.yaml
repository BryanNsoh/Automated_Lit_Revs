    \ is a new agricultural system which aims to utilize the limited access to\nland,\
    \ especially in big cities. Vertical agriculture is the answer to meet the challenges\
    \ posed by land\nand water shortages, including urban agriculture with limited\
    \ access to land and water. This research\nstudy uses the Preferred Reporting\
    \ for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) item as\none of the literary\
    \ approaches. PRISMA is one way to check the validity of articles for a literature\n\
    review or a systematic review resulting from this paper. One of the aims of this\
    \ study is to review\na survey of scientiﬁc literature related to vertical farming\
    \ published in the last six years. Artiﬁcial\nintelligence with machine learning,\
    \ deep learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) in supporting\nprecision agriculture\
    \ has been optimally utilized, especially in its application to vertical farming.\
    \ The\nresults of this study provide information regarding all of the challenges\
    \ and technological trends in\nthe area of vertical agriculture, as well as exploring\
    \ future opportunities.\nKeywords: vertical farming; artificial intelligence;\
    \ machine learning; deep learning; internet of things (IoT)\n1. Introduction\n\
    The world population is increasing at an accelerating rate. According to a UN\
    \ report,\nthe world population is expected to reach around 8.5 billion by 2030\
    \ [1] and is even pre-\ndicted to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 [2,3]. The challenges\
    \ posed by reliable food demands\nwill be inﬂuenced by various factors, including\
    \ climate change, water scarcity, and limited\nland due to increasing urbanization\
    \ [3]. Research on agriculture has become an important\nfocus [4]. The smart farming\
    \ model is an essential step towards sustainable agriculture [5],\nwhich applies\
    \ intelligent technological innovations in agriculture by leveraging modern\n\
    technologies, such as the Internet of Things platforms, fog/edge computing, cloud\
    \ comput-\ning, and storage, all from the most advanced information and communication\
    \ technologies\n(ICT) [6]. Vertical agriculture is the answer to the challenge\
    \ of land and water shortages,\nincluding urban farming, which has limited access\
    \ to land and water [7]. One of the\ngoals of this research is to provide information\
    \ about agricultural land use by applying\nthe development of vertical farming\
    \ models [8–10], and intelligent system technology in\nvertical crop production\
    \ based on IoT [11–13], as well as processing data collected with the\nrole of\
    \ machine learning algorithms from various scenarios, such as intelligent irrigation\
    \ in\nvertical land technology, predicting yields, monitoring growth, monitoring\
    \ diseases, and\nproposing framework models on vertically integrated farmland\
    \ effectively. They are all\nconducted to change the paradigm of the traditional\
    \ agricultural industry into a modern\nagriculture format from the perspective\
    \ of precision and smart agriculture [2,14].\nMachine learning focuses on developing\
    \ computational artiﬁcial intelligence methods\nthat can access various types\
    \ of data (text, numbers, images, video, and audio), and is\nsupported by data\
    \ communication technology capabilities with data streaming speed\n(velocity)\
    \ using the data for self-learning [15].\nComputers 2022, 11, 135. https://doi.org/10.3390/computers11090135\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/computers\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n2 of 19\nThe\
    \ study also presents a framework that maps the activities deﬁned in smart farming,\n\
    the data sets or features used in the data modeling, and the machine learning\
    \ algorithms\nused to analyze the features for each activity deﬁned in the described\
    \ stages of the chain\nand the farm sequences. Vertical farming offers many opportunities\
    \ to combine advances\nin genetics with advances in environmental modiﬁcation\
    \ and to produce a guaranteed\nquality and quantity of crops regardless of the\
    \ weather, soil conditions, or impacts of\nclimate change [10]. This enables the\
    \ opportunity of producing functional or specialized\nfood from staple foods through\
    \ environmental control and manipulation [16]. Vertical\nfarming has various advantages\
    \ over horizontal rice ﬁeld farming, observed from the\nperspectives of environmental,\
    \ social, and economic stability. New high-tech cultivation\nmethods, including\
    \ hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics, largely challenge the need\nfor soil-based\
    \ agriculture for a wide variety of crops [17] and also present a viable option\n\
    for growing crops in urban environments where the geographic footprint is limited\
    \ and the\ndemand for on-time product delivery always increases [8]. A research\
    \ approach was taken\nto obtain the technology used to achieve this goal, at a\
    \ low cost, by utilizing the Internet\nof Things (IoT) [18,19] and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ [20] on machine learning techniques [15]\nto help transform big data into knowledge\
    \ [21]. The IoT approach requires a set of sensor\ndevices, including temperature,\
    \ light, soil moisture, nutrition, and several other supporting\nsensors, which\
    \ are monitored continuously and obtain data through the data transmission\npath\
    \ where sensor data can be communicated wirelessly using microcontrollers and\
    \ wireless\nmodules to build intelligent and precise agricultural processes using\
    \ IoT [22].\nThe main objective of this research is to introduce a model of vertical\
    \ crop farming\nas an era of precision and intelligent agriculture as an embodiment\
    \ of intelligent agricul-\nture. Artiﬁcial intelligence methods are described\
    \ that combine the processing of big data\ncollected by IoT systems, the use of\
    \ machine/deep learning in different vertical irrigation\nscenarios, as well as\
    \ for yield predictions, monitoring growth and disease, and assessing\nsample\
    \ quality. Vertical farming (VF) opens up a new era of intelligent agricultural\
    \ engi-\nneering that has the potential to meet future food requirements. Looking\
    \ at the current\nagricultural trends, VF can utilize all agricultural IoT devices\
    \ in multiple dimensions.\nApplying agricultural technologies such as AI (artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence), machine learning,\nproductivity, and quality factors will increase\
    \ the efﬁciency of VF [23].\nIn Figure 1. The design of the proposed VF model\
    \ represents a new era of intelligent\nagricultural engineering. The application\
    \ of the Intelligent Internet of Things concept by\ncombining artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and machine learning algorithms, productivity, and quality\nfactors will improve\
    \ VF.\nIntelligent system agriculture refers to data-driven agriculture, which\
    \ can adaptively\nkeep up with future developments by utilizing new technologies\
    \ for the improvement of\nagricultural knowledge systems from the availability\
    \ of larger amounts of data [24]. With\nthe advancement of data management, smart\
    \ agriculture is growing exponentially, and\ngenerating relevant data has become\
    \ a key element in modern agriculture to assist users in\ndecision-making [25].\
    \ The concept of data-centric agriculture has been promoted in several\nformats,\
    \ such as Agriculture 4.0, Digital Farming, and Smart Farming, and was born from\n\
    telematics and data management combined with the concept of precision agriculture\
    \ to\nimprove agricultural operational accuracy [26]. IoT in the context of agriculture\
    \ refers\nto the use of sensors and other devices to transform every element and\
    \ action involved\nin agriculture into data [27]. IoT is a model for developments\
    \ in Agriculture 4.0 [28]\nand becomes one of the reasons why agriculture can\
    \ produce a large amount of valuable\ninformation. The agricultural sector is\
    \ expected to be heavily inﬂuenced by technological\ndevelopments and innovations\
    \ in IoT [6,29]. The big data concept applied to agricultural\napplications at\

    \ on using AI, machine learning, deep\nlearning, and IoT in vertical farming.\
    \ However, none of these studies focus on using smart\nvertical farming for food\
    \ crops such as paddy, corn, and wheat. Study research on vertical\nagricultural\
    \ land using artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning on staple\n\
    crops such as rice, wheat, or corn is one of the new opportunities for food crop\
    \ agriculture\nresearch on vertical land that can be controlled and monitored\

    \ ripening phases.\n3.\nMore precise and complex water, nutrition, and lighting\
    \ management.\n4.\nMore extended production period from planting to harvest.\n\
    The novelty of this study is to address a new opportunity to study the development\

    \ AI Research Trends in Vertical Farming\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) involves\
    \ the development of theories and computer systems\ncapable of performing tasks\
    \ that require human intelligence, such as sensory perception\nand decision making\
    \ [38] which are combined with Cloud Computing, IoT, and big data.\nAI, especially\
    \ in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) aspects, is considered one\n\
    of the main drivers behind the digitalization of smart agriculture. This technology\
    \ has\nthe potential to increase crop production and improve real-time monitoring,\
    \ harvesting,\nprocessing, and marketing [39]. Several intelligent farming systems\
    \ were developed that\nuse ML and DL algorithms to deﬁne various parameters such\
    \ as smart irrigation, lighting,\nweed detection, yield prediction, or disease\
    \ identiﬁcation. The type of vertical farming\nproposed to be a smart farm has\
    \ been reviewed in several kinds of literature as well as\nreviews conducted with\
    \ a focus on artiﬁcial intelligence [2,4]. One of the ﬁndings of this\nreview\
    \ is that machine learning and deep learning algorithms are proven to be better\
    \ in\nproviding high-accuracy quality results compared to other algorithms in\
    \ terms of accuracy\nwhen applied to various agricultural problems, such as disease\
    \ detection and identiﬁcation,\nfruit or crop classiﬁcation, and fruit counting\
    \ among other domains [40]. Figure 9 shows\nthe trend of the artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ approach based on a literature study.\nFigure 9 describes the research trend\
    \ of the vertical farming model structure taken\nfrom 68 related articles, under\
    \ research studies on types and structures of vertical farming\ndevelopment with\
    \ soil use, hydroponics, energy use, and indoor lighting systems. Study\nanalysis\
    \ shows that most of the research focuses on open farming systems and large areas\n\
    of land, compared to research on vertical farming systems. This is due to the\
    \ high costs\nassociated with developing intelligent technologies and systems\
    \ which typically also in-\nvolve hardware installation. The centralized network\
    \ subscriptions and software packages\nare required to facilitate data processing,\
    \ management of IoT devices and equipment, and\nknowledge exchange, which in turn\
    \ increases operational costs.\nBased on the literature study described in Table\
    \ 3, it was found that AI and ML tech-\nniques are still rarely explored in indoor\
    \ vertical farming systems, whether they are using\nsoil media or without, especially\
    \ for hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics [32]. There\nare only a few publications\
    \ listed in the table related to intelligent system models with\nML techniques.\
    \ Unlike the case with artiﬁcial intelligence in agricultural applications that\n\
    are not vertical land models, many explorations with machine learning in agriculture\
    \ are\nclassiﬁed into three categories, i.e., supervised learning, unsupervised\
    \ learning, and rein-\nforcement learning [34]. ML techniques and algorithms that\
    \ have been widely implemented\nin the agricultural sector are for prediction\
    \ of crop yields, disease and weed detections,\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n10 of\

    \ Vertical Farming\nIoT refers to interconnected computing devices, sensors, actuation\
    \ equipment, and\nmachines connected to the internet, each with a unique identity\
    \ and ability to perform\nremote sensing and monitoring [52]. IoT reference model\
    \ architecture has six layers, i.e.,\nphysical devices and controllers, connectivity/network,\
    \ edge/fog computing, data accumu-\nlation, data abstraction, and application\
    \ layer (user interface) [4]. The development of IoT\napplications in vertical\
    \ farms requires the support of hardware and software infrastructure\nas well\
    \ as communication media to ensure the interconnection of various heterogeneous\n\
    components [53]. This support is one of the vertical efforts of agriculture in\
    \ Industrial Tech-\nnology 4.0, namely the cyber-physical system (CPS) which refers\
    \ to a distributed system\nthat combines physical devices with communication networks\
    \ automatically. CPS bene-\nﬁts from various existing technologies, namely intelligent\
    \ agents, IoT, cloud computing,\ncomputer vision, big data, ML, and DL [54].\n\
    A wireless sensor network (WSN) is considered a type of technology used in IoT\n\
    systems. It can be deﬁned as a group of spatially distributed sensors for monitoring\
    \ the\nphysical conditions of the environment, temporarily storing the collected\
    \ data, and trans-\nmitting the collected information at a central location [6,55].\
    \ The results of the study that IoT\nis applied signiﬁcantly in agriculture, due\
    \ to its broad purpose and function in monitoring,\ntracking, tracing, agricultural\
    \ intelligent machines, and precision agriculture [52], which is\none of the main\
    \ research objectives in the smart farming approach. However, there are still\n\
    few studies that conduct some research on vertical agricultural land by considering\
    \ data\nreliability, interoperability, and IoT smart systems in the development\
    \ of the intelligent\nvertical farming system. This can be seen in Figure 10;\
    \ the trend of IoT-based agricultural\nresearch that focuses on the research of\
    \ IoT applications, monitoring (water, temperature,\nhumidity, pH), and lighting\
    \ systems.\nThe results of the studies from previous research on IoT applications\
    \ on vertical farms\nin Table 4 have been developed for the management of various\
    \ services on vertical farms.\nMost systems are still classiﬁed as prototype and\
    \ conceptual. Considerable research has\nbeen reported on greenhouses, but none\
    \ was found that is relevant to vertical farming.\nThe application of IoT in vertical\
    \ farming has attracted signiﬁcant research because its\napplication has potential\
    \ in various ﬁelds, such as the application of the CPS model to\nvertical farming\
    \ applications, and is a challenge because it requires the right hardware and\n\
    software [56].\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n13 of 19\nComputers 2022, 11, x FOR PEER\

    \ framework maps primarily onto three entities\nconsisting of a vertical land\
    \ smart model, AI/machine learning, and IoT. The literature\nsources were obtained\
    \ from 2016 to 2022 and an article processing approach was carried\nout using\
    \ PRISMA based on the search keywords in Table 1, which obtained 68 limited\n\
    articles indexed by Scopus in quartile 1 as many as 11, quartile 2 as many as\
    \ seven, quartile\n3 as many as 11, quartile 4 as many as six and no quartile\
    \ 33 articles. The distribution\nof reputation-indexed scientiﬁc articles at the\
    \ quartile level (Scopus), with details are\nas follows: Q1 16%, Q2 16%, Q3 10%,\
    \ Q4 95 and No Q 49%. The trend of the number\nof research and publications continues\
    \ to increase in the application of digitalization of\nvertical agriculture by\
    \ utilizing artiﬁcial intelligence. A review from the year that the trend\nis\
    \ always increasing, it can be seen in 2021 by 32%, which is described in Figures\
    \ 3 and 4. A\ntotal of 91% of the selected articles discuss vertical agriculture\
    \ as shown in Figures 5 and 6.\nThe distribution of the use of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ has been widely conducted and found;\nthis is seen in 47% of usage on machine\
    \ learning, 22% on robotic automation, and 13% with\ndeep learning approaches.\
    \ The IoT approach can be seen from the discussion of the sensor,\nmonitoring,\
    \ and LED applications which is shown in Figure 9, with a 28% soil research\n\
    object model, 18% hydroponics, and 22% lighting and irrigation.\nVertical agriculture\
    \ has great potential to meet the future food demand by strength-\nening the digital\
    \ farming system to support precision in agriculture with technology and\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence. The prospects of vertical farming in smart agriculture involve\
    \ the use\nof explainable artiﬁcial intelligence to monitor crop growth, forecast\
    \ crop nutrition, evaluate\nplant health, and control pests and diseases. The\
    \ described AI removes the traditional\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n15 of 19\nparadigm\
    \ concept of machine learning and allows for an understanding of the reasons\n\
    behind certain decisions [68].\nIoT integration in vertical farming is focused\
    \ on optimization and automation tech-\nnologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge,\
    \ products, and services to achieve high\nproductivity, quality, and proﬁt. Not\
    \ much research has been conducted and put forward\nregarding the incubation of\
    \ the IoT concept in the vertical agriculture sector. The main\nﬁndings of several\
    \ studies are presented in Table 4.\nVarious technological problems and architectural\
    \ problems have been addressed\nthrough the development of an IoT-based vertical\
    \ farming smart system, but most of these\nsystems are either in the conceptual\
    \ stage or in prototype form at this time. Its main focus\nlies in farm management,\
    \ irrigation control, crop growth, crop health monitoring, and\ndisease detection.\
    \ Some of these studies have also explained the implementation of IoT\nin modern\
    \ agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming—aquaponics,\n\
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). In addition,\
    \ most\nresearch focuses on addressing speciﬁc problems.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ approaches and digital technologies in vertical farming make\nagricultural processes\
    \ more environmentally friendly, and climate-resistant, signiﬁcantly\nreducing\
    \ crop failure and ﬁeld growth, and also reducing the usage of nitrogen fertilizers,\n\
    pesticides, and herbicides [35]. Based on the ﬁndings summarized in the previous\
    \ section,\nmachine learning algorithms and IoT smart technologies can be used\
    \ to increase the overall\nefﬁciency of a vertical agricultural production system.\
    \ However, in the review, the types\nof algorithms discussed in Table 3 have not\
    \ been mentioned much in vertical farming; in\nthis case, models on machine learning\
    \ or deep learning. The analysis shows that several\nstudies have focused on vertical\
    \ farming.\nThe research ﬁndings also show that most of the use cases are still\
    \ in the prototype\nstage. This is due to the complex design and management of\
    \ indoor farming, especially\nsoilless agriculture where the parameters and factors\
    \ (pH, air temperature, humidity, etc.)\nto be controlled vary [69] considerably.\
    \ By looking at Tables 3 and 4 in Section 3, it can\nbe seen that some of the\
    \ uses of artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms from machine learning\nand deep learning\
    \ as well as technologies such as big data and analytics, wireless sensor\nnetworks,\
    \ cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in the ﬁeld of vertical farming have\n\
    not been signiﬁcantly explored. In addition, the costs required to develop smart\
    \ models for\nvertical farming are still expensive, which include deployment,\
    \ operation, and maintenance\ncosts [70].\nThe reliability of the sensor devices,\
    \ as well as the appropriate software applications\nare very important. This is\
    \ because IoT devices need to collect and transfer data based\non decisions made\
    \ using multiple software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and\ntransmission\
    \ can lead to erroneous monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data\n\
    loss, thus ultimately impacting agricultural system performance [71]. Standardization\
    \ is\nneeded to take full advantage of digital technology for smart vertical farming\
    \ applications,\nparticularly in device standardization. With standardization,\
    \ device, application, and\nsystem interoperability problems can also be solved.\
    \ The results of previous research on\nvertical farming applications have been\
    \ developed to manage various vertical farming\nservices. Most of the study systems\
    \ are still classiﬁed as prototype and conceptual. Then,\na lot of research was\
    \ conducted on greenhouses, and no investigation was found that\nis relevant to\
    \ the farming system that has been applied. There are still new research\nopportunities\
    \ to investigate and study indoor food crop production using smart and\nprecision\
    \ vertical farming.\n4. Conclusions\nThe results of this study contribute to research\
    \ that will be carried out around vertical\nagriculture to support Agriculture\
    \ 4.0. Vertical farming with AI, ML, and DL approaches\nhas been carried out in\
    \ several previous studies. The main limitation of this review is that\nit uses\
    \ only the prioritized online repositories for literature searches (Scopus, IEEE,\
    \ and\nComputers 2022, 11, 135\n16 of 19\nScience Direct). Second, additional\
    \ keywords and synonyms can result in more research.\nSLR implementation with\
    \ PRISMA received 68 articles from 2016 to 2022 discussing the\nproblems and recommendations\
    \ for vertical farming presented in this study. The pattern\nin the vertical agriculture\
    \ sector is continually increasing. The results can be selected in\n2021 by 32%,\
    \ as depicted in Figures 3 and 4. A total of 91% of articles were chosen to\n\
    discuss vertical agriculture, as shown in Figures 5 and 6. The distribution of\
    \ the use of\nartiﬁcial intelligence has been completed and discovered. This is\
    \ seen in 47% of usage\non machine learning, 22% on robotic automation, and 13%\
    \ on deep learning approaches.\nThe IoT approach can be seen from the discussion\
    \ of the sensor, monitoring, and LED\napplications shown in Figure 9, with a 28%\
    \ soil research object model, 18% hydroponics,\nand 22% lighting and irrigation.\
    \ The research questions posed are regarding the types of\ndigital technologies\
    \ used in vertical farming of innovative farming relationships, the level\nof\
    \ development and intelligent models adopted, and the challenges and barriers\
    \ to gaining\nopportunities from implementing intelligent vertical farming systems.\
    \ The added value of\nvertical agriculture has various advantages compared to\
    \ horizontal rice ﬁelds, as seen from\nthe three pillars of sustainability; namely\
    \ environmental, social, and economic, in the effort\nof world food security.\
    \ The results of studies from previous research on IoT applications in\nvertical\
    \ farms have been developed to manage various services on vertical farms. Most\n\
    of the systems are still classiﬁed as prototypes and mainly carried out conceptually\
    \ for\ngreenhouses. No relevant research on basic crop farming systems such as\
    \ rice, soybean, or\nwheat has been implemented. With the results shown from the\
    \ number of articles reviewed,\nthe use of artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms from\
    \ machine learning and deep learning as well\nas technologies such as big data\
    \ and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical\nsystems, and digital\
    \ twins have not been signiﬁcant and explored in vertical farming. This\nis because\
    \ the costs required to develop an intelligent vertical farming model are still\n\
    expensive, including implementation, operational, and maintenance costs. This\
    \ research\nreveals that there are new research opportunities to investigate and\
    \ study indoor food crop\nproduction using smart and precision vertical farming.\n\

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

  analysis: Thermal Comfort System based on Tasks Allocation Mechanism was presented
    in this paper, with emphasis on the process of mapping tasks to IoT resources.
    Microservices, which are subsets of the service, can be connected to a virtual
    object through a task mapping mechanism. The allocation of tasks on the physical
    IoT device is based on task scheduling. The performance of the architecture was
    evaluated using round-trip time (RTT), response time, latency, and task dropping
    rate metrics. The results indicate that even with worst-case scenarios, these
    parameters remain negligible, which makes the architecture suitable for real-time
    IoT applications.

    \ (IoT) is bringing innovations in almost every ﬁeld\nof science. IoT is mainly\
    \ focused on the connectivity of things via the Internet. IoT’s integration tools\n\
    are developed based on the Do It Yourself (DIY) approach, as the general public\
    \ lacks technical\nskills. This paper presents a thermal comfort system based\
    \ on tasks allocation mechanism in\nsmart homes. This paper designs and implements\
    \ the tasks allocation mechanism based on virtual\nobjects composition for IoT\
    \ applications. We provide user-friendly drag and drops panels for\nthe new IoT\
    \ users to visualize both task composition and device virtualization. This paper\
    \ also\ndesigns tasks generation from microservices, tasks mapping, task scheduling,\
    \ and tasks allocation\nfor thermal comfort applications in smart home. Microservices\
    \ are functional units of services in\nan IoT environment. Physical devices are\
    \ registered, and their corresponding virtual objects are\ninitialized. Tasks\
    \ are generated from the microservices and connected with the relevant virtual\
    \ objects.\nAfterward, they are scheduled and ﬁnally allocated on the physical\
    \ IoT device. The task composition\ntoolbox is deployed on the cloud for users\
    \ to access the application remotely. The performance of\nthe proposed architecture\
    \ is evaluated using both real-time and simulated scenarios. Round trip\ntime\
    \ (RTT), response time, task dropping and latency are used as the performance\
    \ metrics. Results\nindicate that even for worst-case scenarios, values of these\
    \ metrics are negligible, which makes our\narchitecture signiﬁcant, better and\
    \ ideal for task allocation in IoT network.\nKeywords:\nInternet of Things; Do-It-Yourself;\

    \ Introduction\nServices provided through the world wide web (WWW) serve as a\
    \ medium for people to create,\ninnovate and share their work with others. The\
    \ Internet enables the reuse of other’s work as a\ncornerstone for smart and useful\
    \ things creation. The Internet medium plays a vital role in the\nrealization\
    \ of IoT [1]. The recent trend in the IoT is bringing innovations in almost every\
    \ ﬁeld of life [2].\nHardware boards are electronic modules; IoT users can combine\
    \ these modules to develop their custom\nIoT applications based on smarter things.\
    \ Some of the most popular boards are Adafruit Flora [3],\nArduino [4], Intel\
    \ Edison [5], and Raspberry Pi [6]. Most of the manufacturers of these boards\
    \ provide\nAPI and coding documentation for the programming languages supported\
    \ by its environment; many\nof these boards support programming languages such\
    \ as Python and Java. Users with the necessary\nskills of its supported languages\
    \ can start creating IoT applications by customizing the existing code\nfor these\
    \ boards.\nIn the IoT network sensors, actuators are the most used vital nodes;\
    \ other important key nodes\nare smart objects, RFID tags, and servers. These\
    \ nodes can perform a minimal amount of tasks as they\nSustainability 2019, 11,\
    \ 5849; doi:10.3390/su11205849\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 5849\n2 of 24\nare different from each other in capabilities such\
    \ as power consumption, residual energy, available\nmemory, and processing capacity\
    \ [7]. In order to perform some given IoT application tasks, these\nnodes must\
    \ have capability of reconﬁguring themselves and interoperate autonomously. Powerful\n\
    IoT applications require different IoT nodes to collaborate for performing a speciﬁc\
    \ task; all of these\ntasks performed by a node or more than one nodes brings\
    \ to the most diverse applications. Examples\ninclude IoT applications in smart\
    \ house, Agriculture and Healthcare. Furthermore, technologies trends\nshowings\
    \ that in future, more complex applications will be developed by integrating IoT\
    \ and Artiﬁcial\nintelligence, and other ﬁelds’ knowledge together. e.g., Machine\
    \ to Machine (M2M) communication,\ni.e., smart cars and smart vehicles sharing\
    \ critical information such as trafﬁc congestion and accident\nlocations to ambulances.\n\
    Human psychology has various drivers toward the DIY approach. Usability and Innovations\n\
    of today’s DIY architectures enable new users to do creative things in a simple,\
    \ easy way. In the IoT\nﬁeld, one of the motivations for applying DIY approaches\
    \ is the advancement in development Kits\nsuch as Arduino, Grove* and Raspberry\
    \ Pi. Today’s IoT research is mainly focused on technologies\nand research methodologies\
    \ for enabling the connectivity of things to the Internet intelligently and\n\
    efﬁciently. These innovations and research in IoT, particularly in DIY architectures\
    \ making the general\npublic involved in the extension of these technologies to\
    \ other ﬁelds of science. Therefore, DIY\narchitecture and toolkits are essential\
    \ for future IoT advancements. New users cannot understand\nmany important contents\
    \ easily if architecture is not following usability and other ease of use matrices.\n\
    Hence, one of the goals of this research is to provide a solution to the task\
    \ allocation problem using a\nDIY approach focused on user usability and reliability\
    \ factors.\nIn this paper, we propose a tasks allocation mechanism for thermal\
    \ comfort in smart homes. The\nprocess is based on task-based managemnt that includes\
    \ from microservice analysis to task allocation\non physical devices. Microservices\
    \ are used for the generation of Tasks in the IoT environment. These\ngenerated\
    \ tasks are directly associated with IoT resources such as sensors or actuators.\
    \ A task is\nassociated with a device commonly known as task mapping [8]. Task\
    \ scheduling is changing the\norder of these pairs such that tasks that need to\
    \ be executed ﬁrst are executed ﬁrst and vice versa.\nTask allocation is the process\
    \ of assigning a task to a physical device and allocating a time slot to the\n\
    task. Task deployment is the execution of tasks on the physical device at the\
    \ allocated time. The IoT\norchestration architecture we propose provides effective\
    \ task allocation on physical IoT devices full\nﬁling basic requirements of the\
    \ user and avoid the excess use of constrained resources.\nThe rest of the paper\
    \ is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the related work, highlighting\n\
    the contribution to IoT integration architectures. In Section 3, the proposed\
    \ methods for Task and\nVirtual Objects Composition are discussed; Section 4 explains\
    \ the design of the proposed architecture;\nImplementation and results are discussed\
    \ in Section 5. Performance analysis and signiﬁcance of the\nproposed architecture\
    \ is discussed in Section 6; Section 7 concludes the research study and discusses\n\
    future work direction.\n2. Related Work\nThe IoT vision is the connectivity of\

    \ provides mechanisms for data collection, processing the data, providing analytics\
    \ based on\nrule engine. The visualization module is embedded with more than 30\
    \ widgets to visualize a complete\nIoT smart space.\nAmong the notable projects\
    \ from Kickstarter [17] is SAM [18]. SAM does not need any expertise\nin the ﬁeld\
    \ and can be exploited equally by new users as well as expert developers. The\
    \ approach\nused is combining electronics modules blocks, all these modules are\
    \ wireless, which is a cornerstone\nfor innovation, creation, and designs. The\
    \ mechanism followed by SAM is using the internet with a\ncombination of hardware\
    \ and software to a project. The programming language used for SAM toolkit\nis\
    \ the python.\nMazzei et al. [19] further investigate how customizability will\
    \ enable general mass involvement in\nthe creation of such products that can contribute\
    \ to the IoT ecosystem. In literature, some other studies\nused the same idea;\
    \ In the case of Feki et al. research study [20], DIY approach is considered among\n\
    the most trending approach in the future for the development in the IoT ﬁeld.\
    \ Low-cost Systems on\nChip (SoC) based IoT development following the DIY approach\
    \ is proposed by the research study of\nScott and Chin [21].\nSustainability 2019,\
    \ 11, 5849\n4 of 24\nKefalakis et al. [22] presented an OpenIoT project based\
    \ on the visual development paradigm.\nThese tools are visual development based\
    \ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the\ndevelopment of IoT application\
    \ and manage its life cycle. A minimal programming approach is\nused in the development\
    \ of IoT applications based on semantic IoT architecture. Users model services\n\
    into graphs in a node-based user interface, which are then converted into SPARQL\
    \ queries.\nIoT applications development in the form of real-time data streams\
    \ is provided by an IoT platform\ncalled Super Stream Collider (SSC) [23]. This\
    \ platform will enable everyone from new IoT users to\nan expert to develop custom\
    \ IoT applications. SSC web-based interface enables users to develop\napplications\
    \ for various IoT scenarios by combining linked streams and data sources to IoT\
    \ resources.\nFor SSC support editor based SPARQL/CQELS query languages; the approach\
    \ used is simple drag\nand drop. The platform exploits cloud infrastructure for\
    \ massive data acquisition, processing, and\nspreading of the data.\nIoT is now\
    \ applicable in agriculture, how to bring innovations in agriculture using IoT\
    \ is studied\nin a ﬁeld called digital agriculture. Recently DIY approach based\
    \ IoT application was developed for\ndigital agriculture. Jayaraman et al. [24]\
    \ discuss such digital agriculture applications which will make\nnaive users monitor\
    \ the growth of the crop in a form, suggests and support the user with irrigation\n\
    decisions. They discuss a user interface called Phenonet, which is a zero-programming\
    \ based novel\nDIY architecture. The efﬁciency of this Open IoT platform is evaluated\
    \ through Phenonet and other\nseveral use cases.\nIn the examples of services\
    \ for data feeds collection, Pachube [25] is a notable web-centric service.\n\
    Pachube store information related to various sensors devices and the data feeds\
    \ provided by these\ndevices over some time. Pachube work on the idea of \"triggers,\
    \ it is capable of data integration,\nprocessing, and visualization. The data\
    \ arrival from hardware or software resources can be deﬁned\nas a trigger. The\
    \ response to such trigger is forwarding of the data to particular URL based on\
    \ rules\ndeﬁned by Pachube, triggering some other relevant triggers. Pachube increases\
    \ the creativity and\ndevelopment by provides a medium for sharing the feeds triggered\
    \ or integrated by one user can be\nused by another user.\nM. S. Khan et al. [26]\
    \ presents a novel CoAP protocol based on DIY architecture. This toolkit\ndesign\
    \ services based on CoAP proxy. The CoAP proxy Communication with the server device\
    \ is\ndone through CoAP proxy using socket connection. All the details are handled\
    \ by improved service\ncomposition toolkit. The toolkit visual interface enables\
    \ a beginner user to compose IoT services. User\nregisters and combines virtual\
    \ objects for physical devices through the drag and drops approach.\nShabir et\
    \ al. [27] present a DIY based service designer with a zero-programming experience.\n\
    Node-RED inspires the concept of the research study, the functionalities provided\
    \ by remote and CoAP\ndevices can be easily customized. Internet Engineering Task\
    \ Force (IETF) [28] has standardized CoAP\nis communication protocols for devices\
    \ having scarce resources. The CoAP server is implemented\nusing the Intel Edison\
    \ board. The platform was chosen due to growth in its acceptance day by day\n\
    in the DIY community all over the world. Visual service designers access the CoAP\
    \ resources via\nCoAP proxy shared by the CoAP server. The proxy implementation\
    \ is based on the Californium [29]\nframework in a programming language called\
    \ a Java. For storing the conﬁguration, they use a novel\napproach based on the\
    \ repository at the cloud. This cloud-based platform ensures the availability\
    \ of\nthese conﬁgurations everywhere. The HTTP protocol is used to handle communication\
    \ between real\ndevices and the DIY toolbox, whereas CoAP protocol is used to\
    \ handle communication between the\nDIY toolbox and cloud.\nIn literature, we\
    \ found some AI-based Intelligent solutions for service composition in the IoT\n\
    environment. Some AI algorithms are used for virtual object management and naming\
    \ these objects\nand automatic service composition. An example of this is A framework\
    \ for IoT objects based on IoT-IMS\nplatform where the naming and management of\
    \ objects are done intelligently [30]. An intelligent\nIoT-based project called\
    \ IoT.est is an effort to support the exchange of information among distributed\n\
    and different IoT nodes, by the use of semantic technologies. IoT service is created\
    \ using a testbed,\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n5 of 24\nand several use cases\
    \ are used for validation purposes. IoT.est also not consider management and\n\
    scalability issues and only focus on the realization of IoT [31].\nTools which\
    \ are Platform-As-A-Service (PAAS), and it does not provide ease of use to new\
    \ users\nare also discussed in the literature. Some of the platforms discussed\
    \ by Vestergaard, L.S et al. [32] are\nDweet.IO [33], ThingWorx [34] and Particle.IO\
    \ [35]. Closed source is one of the disadvantages of such\nplatforms. Other well\
    \ known closed source IoT platforms are Google Cloud IoT [36] and AWS IoT\nplatform\
    \ [37]. To the best of our knowledge, the paradigm of these tools is either desktop-based\
    \ or\nweb-based. They say that if we can combine these paradigms and integrate\
    \ it into IoT applications,\nthen more ideal IoT applications can be developed.\
    \ We now present a summary of the well-known\narchitectures in Table 1. IoT platforms\
    \ are summarized based on features, i.e., devices management,\nintegration API’s,\

    \ discuss the proposed methodology of Task allocation for thermal comfort in\n\
    smart homes. The proposed methodology consists of several steps. Users use the\
    \ DIY application to\nadd the services they need. For instance, we add thermal\
    \ comfort service name and its requirements\nin detail as a case study for this\
    \ work. The description is analyzed by the IoT server through natural\nlanguage\
    \ processing libraries to split it into microservices. Microservices description\
    \ is analyzed by\nthe microservice analyzer component for generating input tasks.\
    \ Physical things are virtualized into\nvirtual objects through virtualization\
    \ mechanism provided by Virtual Device Manager(VDM), VO-Task\nMapping Manager\
    \ (TMM) mappes relevant tasks to relevant virtual objects. TMM loads tasks and\n\
    virtual objects to the mapping window and visualizes it through Graphical shapes.\
    \ User maps a task\non a virtual object based on the suggestions; A line is dropped\
    \ from tasks to virtual objects to establish\na connection. A mapping window generates\
    \ mapping pairs of tasks and virtual objects based on\nthese connections.\nSome\
    \ of these tasks and virtual objects pairs are more important than others and\
    \ should be\nexecuted ﬁrst than the others. The reordering of these pairs is done\
    \ by VO-Task Scheduling Manager\n(TSM). TSM has a scheduler component that receives\
    \ the mapping pairs from TMM and reorders the\nmapping pairs through scheduling\
    \ algorithms of the TSM. Task Allocation Manager( TAM) handles\nscheduling results\
    \ and allocate tasks into physical device based on the virtual object information\
    \ in\nthe scheduling results, i.e., id and URI of the virtual object, which virtualizes\
    \ a physical device. TAM\npasses the allocated time, device address and task message\
    \ to deployer, which ﬁnally deploys the task\non a physical device at the allocated\
    \ time. Figure 1 represents the proposed methodology.\nGood IoT architecture can\
    \ help develop a robust and scalable IoT solution. In this paper, we\npropose\
    \ a ﬁve-layered architecture for the design of IoT applications based on tasks\
    \ composition\nand virtual objects mechanisms. The proposed architecture is given\
    \ in Figure 2. Each Layer has its\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n6 of 24\nfunctionality;\
    \ the functional goal of all layers is to allocate tasks on virtual objects in\
    \ an IoT environment\nefﬁciently. Physical things Layer composed of physical devices,\
    \ these devices can be actuators and\nsensors. Examples of actuators can be categorized\
    \ to pneumatic actuators, hydraulic actuators, electric\nactuators, and thermal\
    \ actuators, fan and LEDs are examples of actuators in IoT smart space. Examples\n\
    of sensors are a pressure sensor, humidity, proximity sensors, smoke sensors,\
    \ gas and smoke sensors,\nIR and temperature sensors.\nAnalyze Thermal \nComfort\

    \ System.\nThe Virtual Objects Layer represents the virtualization of physical\
    \ layer things; these physical\ndevices are virtualized into virtual objects.\
    \ VDM manages these virtual objects; virtual objects\nmanagement includes the\
    \ registration of physical devices to IoT server registry, Creation of virtual\n\
    for the physical device and connectivity of physical devices to virtual objects.\
    \ These virtual objects\nare visualized through sensors and actuators icons on\
    \ Google map. Each marker icon represents a\nvirtual object in the interactive\
    \ map environment; the marker is placed on the latitude and longitude\nof physical\
    \ device location on the building or other places where the device is physically\
    \ deployed.\nEach virtual object performs speciﬁc actions and having certain properties\
    \ representing attributes of\nthe physical device.\nThe Micros service layer is\
    \ responsible for analyzing the description of services and splitting\nthese services\
    \ into functional units based on the analysis results. A group of virtual objects\
    \ provides\nsome of these services and hence, this layer performs the role of\
    \ interconnection between Virtual\nobjects. The microservice composition manager(MSCM)\
    \ module is responsible for the management\nof this layer. MSCM is responsible\
    \ for providing the user interface for services composition, services\nanalysis,\
    \ and microservice generations. MSCM uses two approaches for Micro Services composition,\n\
    the ﬁrst approach compose microservices directly from its associated sensors and\
    \ actuators. The other\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n7 of 24\napproach for microservice\
    \ composition uses logical objects such as proxy server and fuzzy system\nbetween\
    \ sensors and actuators virtual objects.\nThe tasks layer is responsible for the\
    \ composition of tasks from the microservices; this layer\nmanages intuitive and\
    \ easy to use interface for task composition based on the microservices description.\n\
    The architecture utilizes the IntelliSense approach to output Intellisense dialogues\
    \ with tasks and\nmicro services suggestions generated from service at the time\
    \ of service orchestration.\nPhysical things\nProcesses\nProcesses\nVirtual objects\n\

    \ on Virtual Objects in IoT Environment.\nOnce tasks are composed in the tasks\
    \ layers, these tasks are utilized by process layers for further\noperation on\
    \ these tasks. The process layer is responsible for the visual environment where\
    \ tasks can\nbe mapped on virtual objects. Task Mapping is done manually through\
    \ a drag and drop approach.\nThese mapped task results are utilized by a process\
    \ created for task scheduling. The scheduling process\nconsiders task attributes\
    \ and scheduling algorithms to generate scheduling results. A process is created\n\
    for task allocation, which handles scheduling results and allocates tasks to the\
    \ physical device in the\navailable time slot; ﬁnally, tasks are deployed on the\
    \ physical devices.\n4. Design\nIn this section, we discuss the design of the\
    \ proposed system developed on the Task Composition\nArchitecture based on Virtual\
    \ Objects in IoT Environment. We discuss the processes of the platform\non top\
    \ of which thermal comfort mechanism is implemented. The ﬁrst process is the analysis\
    \ of\nthermal comfort servic to generate tasks. Task Generation Manager (TGM)\
    \ component of the system is\nresponsible for the initialization of TGM components\
    \ for Services analysis to generate tasks, the design\nof task generation from\
    \ microservices is given in Figure 3. Natural Language Processing techniques,\n\
    i.e., tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, are used to generate tasks from\
    \ the description of the\nmicroservices.The Part of Speech (POS) tagging technique\
    \ is used to detect the verb, which helps in\ndeciding the type of the task. Once\
    \ tasks are produced from the microservice description, the Task\nmanager is also\
    \ responsible for the interface for displaying the generated tasks proﬁle on the\
    \ form and\nﬁlling out the form’s visual components.\nTask Manager’s other responsibility\
    \ is extracting the conﬁguration proﬁle from both the\ninformation generated autonomously\
    \ through NLP algorithms and from the form information ﬁlled by\nthe user. The\
    \ parsed proﬁle is converted to task data and stored in the task repository. The\
    \ generated\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n8 of 24\ntask data is passed to TMM,\
    \ where it is loaded into a visual interface used for task mapping on\nvirtual\

    \ the virtualization of physical resources.\nVDM is the main module\nresponsible\
    \ for it to form virtual objects (VO). The virtualization process is also visualized\
    \ through\nvisual components by this module. VDM responsibilities include analyzing\
    \ the supported protocols\non the devices, e.g., CoAP and metadata. VDM also analyzes\
    \ supported methods and platforms that\nprovide the interface for adding, deletion\
    \ and updating of the virtual objects. The virtual object is a\nsimulation of\
    \ the physical device at the virtual IoT smart space. These virtual objects contains\
    \ all the\nattributes of the physical device with some extra attributes particular\
    \ for the virtual IoT environment.\nThese virtual objects also simulate the behaviour\
    \ of the physical device. Figure 4 represents the design\nof the Device virtualization\
    \ mechanism.\nThe third process is the association of tasks with virtual objects\
    \ called task mapping in recent\nstudies [8]. Task Mapping Manager(TMM) is the\
    \ design component responsible for the mapping\nmechanism. Task Mapping Conﬁguration\
    \ Flow is shown in the Figure 5. TMM initializes the graphical\nuser interface\
    \ and libraries needed for the mapping mechanism. The mapping mechanism is drag\n\
    and drop achieved through mapping libraries. TMM is connected to both task and\
    \ virtual objects\nrepository. TMM fetches all virtual objects, tasks, and stores\
    \ it in lists in the main memory. Task and\nvirtual object proﬁles are extracted\
    \ and fed into the mapper submodule of TMM. The user uses a drag\nand drop approach\
    \ to select a task and map it on the relevant virtual object by dropping a line\
    \ from\nthe task to a virtual object. TMM visualize the connection between tasks\
    \ and virtual objects using a\ngraphical line from task to a virtual object. TMM\
    \ saves the connections between virtual objects and\ntasks to a database repository.\n\

    \ Manager is\nresponsible for scheduling the Mapping Results on the physical devices.\
    \ The Scheduling Manager\nmanages the whole ﬂow of the information in the scheduling\
    \ window. Scheduling Manager is\nconnected to Task Mapping Repository, Virtual\
    \ Object Repository, and Task Repository.\nScheduling Manager ﬁrst initializes\
    \ the Scheduling window graphical user interface.\nTask mapping results are then\
    \ fetched from task Mapping repository. Task mapping results contain the\nID of\
    \ a task, and a virtual object, based on these ID’s tasks and virtual objects\
    \ are fetched from their\nrepositories. The design of the scheduling conﬁguration\
    \ is given in Figure 6. Once tasks and virtual\nobjects are loaded next step is\
    \ the ordering of the tasks, the primary purpose of task scheduling is a\nreordering\
    \ of tasks for task allocation in IoT application.\nScheduler module fetches virtual\
    \ object information and task proﬁle and creates a scheduling\nprocess using the\
    \ scheduling algorithm. The scheduling process outputs the scheduling order, which\
    \ is\nreordering of the mapping pairs. Scheduling Manager saves these results\
    \ into the scheduling repository\nin the pairs format task id, virtual object\
    \ id, scheduled time. Task Allocation Manager utilizes these\nscheduling results\

    5. Implementation and Results\nIn this research, we developed two DIY based applications\
    \ on the proposed architecture. One\napplication is desktop-based developed in\
    \ .NET technology; the other is web-based developed in\npython. Each of the application\
    \ projects has two main components, one is the IoT server and the\nother the DIY\
    \ toolbox, Table 2 explains the IoT server technology stack, whereas Table 3 explains\
    \ the\ntechnology stack of the DIY toolbox. The IoT server is installed on Raspberry\
    \ PI, all physical resources,\ni.e., sensors and actuators, are connected with\
    \ the IoT server. Arduino is used for the support of\nsensors, i.e., MQ-2 sensor.\
    \ A registry is maintained of the devices with its current status, the status\
    \ of\nthe device can be connected, disconnected, available or busy. The implementation\
    \ at the server side is\ndone through the Python programming language.\nSustainability\

    \ the experimental purpose of this study, different physical resources such as\

    \ whereas among the sensors used are a hybrid\nsensor called BME 280, at which\
    \ three sensors are embedded, i.e., temperature, pressure, and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ Other sensors used as physical resources are particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)\
    \ and Gas\nsensor Co2.\nFlask server-side application is responsible for the registration\
    \ of these physical resources. This\nserver-side application identiﬁes each physical\
    \ resource by a unique identiﬁer called URI for every\nresource. To request these\
    \ remote resources applications such as our DIY toolbox is accessed through\n\
    these URI by sending an HTTP request to the IoT server, the server give an HTTP\
    \ response containing\nJSON object which is then parsed by the DIY Toolbox.\n\

    \ users where they can virtualize\nthe physical resources connected to their IT\
    \ smart space. Based on the services needed by the users,\ntasks are composed\
    \ through DIY application and ﬂask server. These tasks are mapped to virtual\n\
    objects based on the mapping mechanism explained in the design section. The DIY\
    \ toolbox allocates\ntasks on physical resources based on task scheduling results.\
    \ The DIY toolbox provides all these\nfunctionalities through simple dragging\
    \ and dropping approach. In the future, we will focus on\ndeveloping intelligence\
    \ to the toolbox for making the IntelliSense and suggestions to users more\nefﬁciently.\
    \ For the ease of the user, we will use natural language processing algorithms\
    \ such as the one\nused by the Alexa application.\nFigure 7 represents the structure\
    \ of the DIY applications developed for the evaluation of the\narchitecture client\

    \ for thermal comfort monitoring is analyzed and microservices are\ngenerated.\
    \ IoT resources are available to the users through IoT services. The user adds\
    \ services\nthrough the DIY application; Microservices are generated autonomously\
    \ from services description.\nNatural Language Processing POS technique is used\
    \ to identify conjunction in the description of the\nservice and the Bigram model\
    \ is used for Semantic Analysis. Python’s NLTK library is used for the\ntokenization\
    \ and POS tagging. For the Bigram model python, ngram library is used. Figure\
    \ 8 represent\nthe implementation results of services and microservices. Section\
    \ (a) of Figure 8 visualize the services\ncomposed manually by the user through\
    \ the DIY application Interface. Section (b) of Figure 8 shows\nthe microservices\
    \ results generated based on the description of the service through Natural Language\n\
    Processing techniques.\nEach service and microservices having a context menu which\
    \ can be open by right-clicking\non the service or microservice. The context menu\
    \ contains a command for creating new services.\nDelete command can be used to\
    \ delete a service or microservice, and View command can be used to\ndisplay a\
    \ property window where description and various attributes of services and microservices\
    \ are\nvisualized through graphical user interface. A service named ‘Monitoring\
    \ Thermal comfort’ are used\nto generate two microservices, namely, Monitoring\
    \ Thermal comfort results and analysis of Thermal\ncomfort conditions. For better\
    \ visualization, if the microservice title is long, a short title is generated\n\
    by abbreviating the verb tokens.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n13 of 24\n(a)\

    Once microservices are generated, they are analyzed to generate tasks. Task generation\
    \ from\nmicroservices is visualized in the Figure 9.\nThe ﬁgure shows task suggestions\
    \ based on the\nmicroservices description analysis by the DIY Application. Users\
    \ can either ignore the task suggestions\nby clicking the cancel command button\
    \ or utilizing the suggestion by pressing the Add Task command\nbutton. The task\
    \ information is then used by the Task Manager module to ﬁll the window form for\n\
    adding a task proﬁle. The user ﬁlls the rest of the information or modiﬁes the\
    \ task title, and then\nsaves the task by clicking the add command button. If\
    \ the user wants to cancel the task proﬁle adding\noperation, the user has to\
    \ click the close command button.\nFigure 9. Task Generation from Services.\n\
    The task proﬁle is then added to the local database table developed in MySQL in\
    \ our case, but any\ndatabase server can be used. The task proﬁle is ﬁnally added\
    \ to the cloud-based MySQL database. Each\ntask is fed to the Task Mapping Manager\
    \ which is responsible for visualization in the mapping window.\nSustainability\
    \ 2019, 11, 5849\n14 of 24\nEach task is having a context menu, from which various\
    \ operations on the task can be performed.\nTasks can be added, deleted and previewed\
    \ in the graphical user interface of the DIY Application.\nThe next process is\
    \ device virtualization. As already discussed in the design section, VDM is the\n\
    main module responsible for the whole virtualization process of physical things\
    \ into Virtual objects.\nThe device virtualization process is also visualized\
    \ through an interactive map environment based\non the GMAP.NET library. A Virtual\
    \ object is represented through a map marker using a visual icon\nof the physical\
    \ thing. For example, Figure 10a represents the Interactive map with three physical\n\
    things virtualized. Two temperature sensors are visualized through a temperature\
    \ icon image. LED\nActuator is visualized through Red LED icon image. Each virtual\
    \ object is having an options window\nfrom where properties of the virtual object\
    \ can be previewed. Figure 10b is showing the options\nmenu which contains commands\
    \ button for opening windows of task mapping, task scheduling, task\nallocation,\
    \ and Task deployment. Each of these windows contains mapping, scheduling, allocation,\n\
    and deployment modules.\nPhysical things which are registered and currently connected\
    \ to IoT server are visualized on the\nmap at a location based on latitude and\
    \ longitude address of the physical device. The virtual objects\nconﬁguration\
    \ is stored in the form of JSON docs temporarily which is then stored to MySQL\
    \ database\nat a local server and ﬁnally synced to the cloud-based MySQL database.\n\
    (a) Map with Virtual objects\n(b) Virtual objects option Menu\nFigure 10. Device\
    \ Virtualization and Visualization on Map.\nAfter the virtualization of physical\
    \ things and Task generation, the next step is the mapping\nmechanism. The Mapping\
    \ mechanism from the implementation perspective is presented in Figure 11.\nThe\
    \ virtualization module extracts all the available virtual objects from the virtual\
    \ objects repository\nand feeds the virtual objects to the mapping module. The\
    \ task manager extracts the candidate tasks\nfrom the task repository and feeds\
    \ them to the mapping module. In the ﬁgure, Virtual objects are\nvisualized at\
    \ the left side of the mapping window as rounded cornered rectangles, whereas\
    \ tasks are\nvisualized at the right side of the mapping window as circle shapes.\
    \ A window interface utilizing\nMind Fusion diagramming library enables the user\
    \ to do a simple drag and drop operation of mapping.\nA line is dragged from the\
    \ task and dropped at the virtual object establishing a connection between\nthe\
    \ virtual object and task. Once the connection is made, the Generated Mapping\
    \ results are saved\ninto it the mapping repository. Mapping repository is a relational\
    \ table of MySQL database at the local\nserver and cloud MySQL. One mapping connection\
    \ is stored as one record of the mapping repository\ntable at the MySQL database.\
    \ The mapper repository stores the id of participating tasks and the id of\nvirtual\
    \ objects and the mapping time as a single row. In the ﬁgure ‘Mapped Task’ relational\
    \ table is the\nrepository where the results of the mapped tasks are stored.\n\

    \ Task mapping from Implementation Perspective.\nAfter task mapping, the next\
    \ step is task scheduling. As discussed earlier, mapping results are\npairs of\
    \ tasks and virtual objects, i.e., { task id, vo id, mapped time }. In the context\
    \ of this research\nstudy, Task scheduling is referred to the ordering of these\
    \ mapping pairs to minimize the network\nlatency. So Task scheduling changes the\
    \ order of mapping pairs such that more important tasks are\nallocated on the\
    \ devices ﬁrst, the importance of tasks is calculated from various task attributes\
    \ through\nscheduling algorithms. We used the concept of traditional scheduling\
    \ algorithms for the ordering of\nthe tasks. The scheduling window is embedded\
    \ with these algorithms and user select algorithms for\nthe ordering of tasks.\
    \ The ordered tasks are visualized through table and grant chart. Table 4 lists\
    \ task\nattributes considered by the scheduler for reordering the tasks.\nTable\

    \ Task\nscheduling algorithms are used to produce optimal task orders based on\
    \ the attributes of mapped tasks.\nAlgorithms we considered for scheduling are\
    \ First Come, First served (FCFS), Shortest Task Execution\nFirst (STEF), Shortest\
    \ Task deadline Time (STDT), highest Priority Task First(HPTF) and priority-based\n\
    round-robin. The scheduling manager is responsible for fetching the task and virtual\
    \ object proﬁles.\nIt also fetches mapping results of these tasks from the mapping\
    \ module. The interface provided by\nscheduling manger is used to choose an algorithm\
    \ and preview the scheduling results on the table\nand grant chart. Scheduling\
    \ algorithms consider an attribute or group of attributes mentioned in\nTable\
    \ 3. For example, FCFS considers only the arrival attribute, whereas STDT considers\
    \ the deadline\nattribute only. Human inspection on the scheduling results is\
    \ currently necessary. In the future, we are\nconsidering an autonomous intelligent\
    \ approach for task scheduling. Task scheduling manager saves\nthe generated results\
    \ into local and cloud-based MySQL repository. The scheduling results are stored\n\
    in the scheduling repository, which is fed into the task allocation manager for\
    \ allocation of the tasks on\nphysical devices.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n\

    \ is done by the platform, the actuall deployment happens which is the\nreal running\
    \ of the service on IoT devices installed in smart homes. The task allocation\
    \ manager is\nresponsible for the allocation of the task to correct physical devices\
    \ based on the scheduling pairs.\nThe physical device is accessed through the\
    \ URI attribute of the virtual object. As discussed earlier,\nthe Raspberry PI\
    \ based IoT server keeps track of all the devices by maintaining the registry\
    \ of the\nconnected devices. URI contains a device model and encoded Message,\
    \ e.g., getTemp. This Message is\nparsed and decoded by the IoT server to allocate\
    \ the task on the physical device. Figure 13 shows the\nimplementation of the\

    \ to Tasks Allocation\nIn this section, a brief overview of maintaining Thermal\
    \ Comfort in IoT smart space is presented\nwhich summarized the use of the platform\
    \ and the accomplishment of service goal. The IoT smart\nspace in this case study\
    \ is the Mobile Computing lab, at Jeju National University. The example case\n\
    study has been illustrated in the light of the proposed architecture, signifying\
    \ the strengths of the\nproposed architecture. Table 5 describes the case study\
    \ at service, microservice and task levels. Service\n1 in the case study for the\
    \ Thermal Comfort detection and Notiﬁcation. This service is analyzed from\nits\
    \ description to split the service into functional units called microservices.\n\
    For Example, there are two microservices with Id’s 1.1 and 1.2 belonging to Service\
    \ ID 1. There\nare six tasks in Microservice with Id 1.1 and 2 tasks in Microservice\
    \ with Id 1.2. For this case study,\nRaspberry PI is used as an IoT server and\
    \ a PC server for Data Staging between sensors and Cloud\nSQL based MySQL. Sensors\
    \ such as MQ-2 Gas is connected to Arduino ESP 8266 board because\nthese sensors\
    \ belong to analog sensors family and connecting to Raspberry PI would require\
    \ another\nhardware such as digital to analog which will add a further overhead\
    \ and cost on the overall system.\nThe resources we use are shown in the experimental\
    \ setup shown in Figure 14. From the Experimental\nsetup, it can be understood\
    \ that The PC Server is responsible for accumulating all the data from Http\n\
    client and IoT servers. All sensors are either connected to the Http client or\
    \ the IoT server installed\non Raspberry PI. The PC server syncs the data with\
    \ Cloud SQL for MySQL and deploys tasks on the\nphysical devices either through\

    \ analysis of the proposed architecture. The performance\nof the proposed architecture\
    \ is evaluated using a round-trip time (RTT), Response Time, Latency and\nTask\
    \ Dropping rate metrics. The RTT in our scenarios is the total time the system\
    \ takes from task\ngeneration till task execution and physical device response\
    \ back to the DIY application. The DIY\napplication developed based on the proposed\
    \ architecture maintain logs for each task from its\ngeneration until its execution.\
    \ A log contains information such as task id, target device, deployment\nstatus\
    \ and execution time. For Performance analysis, we calculated the RTT metric by\
    \ deploying tasks\nmentioned in Table 5 via the toolbox.\nDeployment is made based\
    \ on different task parameters, i.e., execution time, period, arrival time\nand\
    \ priority. We deployed these twelve tasks eight times and recorded the total\
    \ times each task took\nfrom task generation to task execution and response back\
    \ to the application. From 8 observations of\neach task, we then calculated min,\
    \ max and Average RTT, which is shown in Figure 15. The RTT is\nmeasured in milliseconds,\
    \ results show that the minimum RTT is 5 ms in the case of the event-driven\n\
    tasks, for example, task ‘Notify Via Alarm’ and task ‘Notify Via LED’. The maximum\
    \ RTT is observed\nfor a task is 92 ms which is also minimum and bearable delay\
    \ for the execution of task which needs\ninput data from other tasks for its complete\
    \ execution.\nThe average RTT for all the tasks executed is 27.75 ms which shows\
    \ that architecture strength for\nimplementing the architecture in real-time scenarios\
    \ such as ﬁre safety and road safety. We consider the\nRTT of Tasks load is the\
    \ second performance analysis metric. For the RTT of Task load, we simulated\n\
    60 tasks in the Apache JMeter load testing tool and analyzed the performance irrespective\
    \ of the load,\nRTT of the simulation results are in the order of a few seconds.\
    \ Figure 16 illustrates the simulation\nanalysis visually through the Line chart.\
    \ Various tasks load from 4 tasks to 60 tasks were taken for\nthe load testing\
    \ of the DIY Toolbox. RTT of tasks is directly proportional to the number of tasks,\
    \ i.e.,\nincreasing the number of task loads will increase the RTT, but the average\
    \ RTT increase is negligible.\nFor instance, for 30 tasks, the minimum RTT observed\
    \ is 22 ms, the maximum RTT for 30 tasks observed\nis 29 ms, and the average time\
    \ for 30 tasks is 24.909 ms. A case study of thermal comfort can be utilized\n\
    in 12 tasks. The architecture can be utilized for more complex case studies in\
    \ the IoT environment.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n19 of 24\nFigure 15. Round\
    \ Trip Time based Performance Analysis of the proposed Architecture.\nFigure 16.\
    \ Round Trip Time Analysis for different Task load.\nThe third metric on which\
    \ we evaluate the proposed architecture is the response time over time.\nFigure\
    \ 17 shows the response time over time analysis of both periodic sensing tasks\
    \ and event driven\ntasks.The response time is calculated in Milliseconds for\
    \ both periodic sensing tasks and event-driven\ntasks. The maximum and minimum\
    \ response time for a periodic sensing task is 28.6 ms and 15 ms.\nCompare to\
    \ periodic sensing tasks maximum and minimum response time for event-driven tasks\
    \ are\n18.8 ms and 5 ms. As discussed in earlier sections that the sensing tasks\
    \ sense ambient scenarios and\nbased on contextual data generated, irregular patterns\
    \ are predicted. Based on these prediction control\ntasks are activated, which\
    \ can be executed with a variety of actuators. Having said that, the control\n\
    tasks, which are event-driven tasks, are of the highest possible priority. The\
    \ experiments carried out in\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n20 of 24\nthis section\
    \ afﬁrms that the proposed architecture always give more priority to event-driven\
    \ tasks, and\nthis can be witnessed by the lower response time in comparison with\
    \ sensing tasks.\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n48:37.0\n48:38.0\n\

    \ Response Time over Time.\nThe fourth metric we consider for the performance\
    \ evaluation is the stability of the architecture in\npeak load time. Task dropping\
    \ rate quantitatively accounts for the stability of the system. The lesser\nnumber\
    \ of tasks dropped in peak load time; the more stable will be the system. For\
    \ this, we carried\nout the task dropping analysis of the proposed architecture.\
    \ Figure 18 shows that as the number of\ninput tasks increases, task dropping\
    \ increases. The minimum task dropping rate is 0 for 26 tasks, and\nmaximum task\
    \ dropping rate is 14 for 600 tasks. It is evident from the rate of increase,\
    \ although the\nnumber of tasks increases but the rate of the dropping is very\
    \ steady. Even for 600 tasks, only 27 tasks\nare dropped, which in other words\
    \ implies that the performance of the system is 97.7%.\nFigure 18. Task Dropping\
    \ Rate.\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n21 of 24\nFinally, we consider the latency\
    \ of tasks deployment; for this purpose, we simulated various sets\nof virtual\
    \ users in Locust, an open-source load testing tool, for cross-domain requests\
    \ from our Toolkit.\nFigure 19 shows the latency of tasks deployment in the simulated\
    \ environment. During testing, we\nprovided three sets of virtual users, 50 users,\
    \ 300 users and 1000 users. Minimum latency for 50, 300\nand 1000 users are 49\
    \ ms,71 ms, and 97 ms, respectively. Maximum latency of 50, 300 and 100 users\
    \ are\n358 ms, 455 ms and 830 ms, respectively. Finally, the average for 50, 300\

    \ knowledge, Task Composition Architecture based on Virtual Objects\nin IoT Environment\
    \ is the ﬁrst-ever attempt towards task allocations in the IoT environment using\
    \ a\nDIY approach. There are only a few user interfaces for IoT integration platforms\
    \ such as Node-RED,\nAWS IoT, NoFlo, ioBroker, CoAP prototype-based DIY interface\
    \ for service customization of Remote\nIoT devices. These user interfaces are\
    \ the only integration platform for the internet of things and\ndo not provide\
    \ any task level management. First and foremost, The DIY toolkit developed on\
    \ the\nproposed architecture is a complete solution addressing various aspects\
    \ of task allocation in the IoT\nenvironment. These aspects include device virtualization,\
    \ microservices generation from services, task\ngeneration from microservices,\
    \ task mapping to virtual objects, task scheduling and task allocation\nand deployment\
    \ on the physical device. Table 6 provides a comparison of the proposed toolkit\
    \ and the\nrelated IoT integration platforms.\nFor the comparative analysis, we\
    \ consider various parameters including, open-source, DIY\nsupport, Remote Access,\
    \ Conﬁguration repository, ofﬂine access, cloud support, application type,\ngeneric\
    \ entity support, and task level management. One of the goodness of the proposed\
    \ architecture\nis the loosely coupled nature of the modules, making it very easy\
    \ to maintain. The architecture is\nwell-suited for IoT applications that involve\
    \ multi-devices and multi-tasks. The proposed architecture\nis ﬂexible, which\
    \ means that different algorithms for mapping, scheduling and allocation could\
    \ be\nSustainability 2019, 11, 5849\n22 of 24\nintroduced without a major revamp\
    \ to the architecture. The freedom from hardware dependence,\ntask-level management\
    \ and DIY nature of the integration platform for the internet of things makes\
    \ our\nsolution a signiﬁcant, better and ideal solution towards the realization\
    \ of IoT network.\nTable 6. Comparative analysis of proposed Architecture with\

    \ towards the design and implementation of a task\ncomposition toolbox based on\
    \ virtual objects in the IoT environment. The proposed system allows\nthe user\
    \ to perform task allocation on both local and remote physical IoT devices. DIY\
    \ based toolbox\nis developed based on usability factors, the intuitive user interface\
    \ and zero coding approaches for\neffective task allocation and visualization\
    \ of all the modules processes make it a novel architecture. We\nhave made cloud\
    \ services available for data storage. The data from the local server is synced\
    \ and hence\nensures the data available to the user remotely. The DIY toolbox\
    \ also provides real-time visualization\nof the virtual objects and whole task\
    \ allocation process at remote IoT devices. In the future, we will add\nmachine\
    \ learning to automate task mapping to improve the capabilities of the composition\
    \ toolbox.\nTask scheduling can be improved by adding complex scheduling algorithms\
    \ for real-time scenarios,\nsuch as a Fair emergency ﬁrst. The proposed work can\
    \ also be improved by considering network\nlatencies and device paring for task\
    \ allocation autonomously. For the ease of the user, we will use\nnatural language\
    \ processing algorithms such as the one used by the Alexa application.\nAuthor\

  analysis: 'This study develops a smart system for illiterate and low-literate farmers
    to assist them with agricultural tasks. Through a combination of sensors and an
    Android mobile application, the system provides comprehensive guidance and recommendations
    for soil analysis, crop selection, irrigation management, pest and disease control,
    and fertilizer application. The system emphasizes user accessibility and usability
    by incorporating visual components, audio, voice, and iconic elements, effectively
    addressing the unique needs of semi-literate and low-literate audiences.


    The proposed system was implemented on a small-scale farm and compared with conventional
    farming practices. The results exhibited a significant 53% reduction in water
    consumption, demonstrating the system''s potential for optimizing irrigation practices.
    Additionally, the system effectively facilitated crop cultivation, providing valuable
    insights and guidance to the farmers.


    This system represents a substantial step forward in bridging the information
    gap and empowering low-literate farmers. By integrating advanced technologies
    with user-centric design principles, it enables these farmers to access crucial
    agricultural information and make informed decisions, ultimately contributing
    to enhanced agricultural productivity and sustainable farming practices.'

    \ The agriculture sector is the backbone of Pakistan’s economy, reﬂecting 26%\
    \ of its GPD and\n43% of the entire labor force. Smart and precise agriculture\
    \ is the key to producing the best crop yield.\nMoreover, emerging technologies\
    \ are reducing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness for saving\nagricultural\
    \ resources in control and monitoring systems, especially for those areas lacking\
    \ these\nresources. Agricultural productivity is thwarted in many areas of Pakistan\
    \ due to farmers’ illiteracy,\nlack of a smart system for remote access to farmland,\
    \ and an absence of proactive decision-making\nin all phases of the crop cycle\
    \ available in their native language. This study proposes an internet of\nagricultural\
    \ things (IoAT) based smart system armed with a set of economical, accessible\
    \ devices and\nsensors to capture real-time parameters of farms such as soil moisture\
    \ level, temperature, soil pH level,\nlight intensity, and humidity on frequent\
    \ intervals of time. The system analyzes the environmental\nparameters of speciﬁc\
    \ farms and enables the farmers to understand soil and environmental factors,\n\
    facilitating farmers in terms of soil fertility analysis, suitable crop cultivation,\
    \ automated irrigation and\nguidelines, harvest schedule, pest and weed control,\
    \ crop disease awareness, and fertilizer guidance.\nThe system is integrated with\
    \ an android application ‘Kistan Pakistan’ (prototype) designed in\nbilingual,\
    \ i.e., ‘Urdu’ and ‘English’. The mobile application is equipped with visual components,\n\
    audio, voice, and iconic and textual menus to be used by diverse literary levels\
    \ of farmers.\nKeywords: smart farming; precision agriculture; IoT; sensor network;\

    \ it is the primary food source\nand plays a crucial role in the global economy.\
    \ Pakistan is 79.6 million km2 and is home to a\npopulation of 192 million. The\
    \ contribution of the agricultural sector to gross domestic product\n(GDP) in\
    \ Pakistan gradually decreased to 19.3% in the year 2020–2021 from 22.04% previously\n\
    recorded in 2019 and generating employment opportunities for 38.5% of Pakistan’s\
    \ labor\nforce and valuable foreign exchange for the country [1–3]. It supports\
    \ the manufacturing and\nservices sectors of the economy by providing backward-forward\
    \ linkages in inputs-outputs\nmarkets and the most significant consumer of household\
    \ durables. Therefore, our agriculture\nsector can be considered an economic activity\
    \ in the country [4]. Farmers are facing issues in\nthe agriculture sector, so\
    \ it’s significant to research, develop of latest mechanisms, and adopt\nnew practices\
    \ to enhance production. Pressure on the agricultural system will increase with\n\
    the continuing expansion of the human population.\nMany areas of Pakistan are\
    \ trailing in agricultural productivity due to a lack of farmers’\nawareness,\
    \ timely access to crucial information, and proactive decision-making [5,6]. It\
    \ is\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12081277\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n2 of 23\n\
    vital for human development in these underdeveloped areas to utilize information\
    \ and\ncommunication technologies (ICTs), artiﬁcial intelligence techniques, machine\
    \ learning\n(ML), and deep learning (DL) to make such information more readily\
    \ accessible to farmers,\nsigniﬁcantly increasing crop production [7–13]. Climate\
    \ change and shortage of agricultural\nresources are also signiﬁcant concerns\
    \ for the downfall of agricultural performance resulting\nin food insecurity [14–17].\
    \ This lets farmers hamper soil with intensiﬁed pesticides, which\naffect agricultural\
    \ practices in a harmful manner. Finally, ﬁelds remain barren [18–22].\nThese\
    \ are reasons for crop failure, lower production due to diseases, unpredictable\
    \ climate\nchange, and loss of soil fertility [23,24].\nIn this scenario, the\
    \ traditional agriculture trends are insufﬁcient to increase agricul-\ntural growth.\
    \ Agriculture is also out of the reach of less conventional technologies. In\n\
    this context, digital agriculture, automation, and precision farming, now termed\
    \ smart\nfarming, have arisen as new scientiﬁc ﬁelds that use intense techniques\
    \ to drive agricultural\nproductivity while minimizing its environmental impact\
    \ [25–27]. Data generated by smart\nfarming operations is provided by various\
    \ sensors that enable a better understanding of\nthe operational environment (interaction\
    \ of dynamic conditions of the crop, soil, weather,\nand environmental factors)\
    \ and the operation itself, leading to more accurate and timely\ndecision-making\
    \ [28,29]. Variability in climate and labor shortage is increasing continu-\n\
    ously, providing better insights for agricultural machinery automation. Remote\
    \ monitoring\ntechnologies facilitate farmers to access every inch of the farmlands\
    \ by creating virtual\nfences to monitor, detect and protect crops in real-time\
    \ [30–32]. IoT-based technologies\nallow farmers, among other things, to gather\
    \ data on plants’ environmental conditions like\nclimate change, soil fertility\
    \ level, humidity, temperature, and light intensity to monitor\nﬁelds and farms\
    \ remotely. These technologies assist farmers in having know-how and\nstatus of\
    \ crops anywhere and anytime [33–36].\nIn Pakistan, most farmers have android\
    \ phones [37–41] but are regrettably under-\nutilized. Our preliminary literature\
    \ study compelled us to work to facilitate farmers for\nagriculture automation,\
    \ recommendations, and guidelines in their local language, i.e.,\nUrdu, by using\
    \ the internet of agricultural things (IoAT), also known as agricultural\ninternet\
    \ of things (Ag-IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence technologies with transliteration\
    \ and\nvoice-speech support in the local language. IoAT is the network of complex\
    \ and diverse\nagricultural objects that compute, process, and recommend solutions\
    \ intelligently based on\ndata generated from every connectable thing [42].\n\
    Previous research shows that using graphical cues, audio, speech, and video in\
    \ mobile\ninterfaces helps low-literates better adapt [43,44]. Field study experiences\
    \ reﬂect that low-\nliterates feel more challenged in understanding and interpreting\
    \ textual information than\ntheir literate peers [45]. In our research, we try\
    \ to accommodate such users by introducing\naudio, speech, Urdu language support,\
    \ and an interactive graphical interface. Researchers\nalso talked about the improvements\
    \ in information dissemination systems for less literate\nfarmers via different\
    \ means [46–50]. However, none considered interface design and\nUrdu language-based\
    \ real-time updates about agricultural guidelines using the android\napplication\
    \ and user preferences. Our choice of Urdu in this work was made by observing\n\
    that 87% of farmers preferred Urdu as a medium of information dissemination [51].\
    \ Our\nresearch is an extended form of [52–54] and primarily focuses on developing\
    \ an IoT-based\nand user-friendly system with these utilities.\n1.1. Rationale\n\
    This section reﬂects the ﬁndings and an evaluation report on information found\
    \ in\nthe literature relevant to our research domain. It represents the overview\
    \ of different ap-\nproaches used by other researchers. Integrating the Internet\
    \ of Things into the agricultural\nsystem has led to the internet of Agricultural\
    \ things (IoAT) and advanced computing\ntechniques. The researchers applied this\
    \ to obtain maximum beneﬁts and also to improve\nthe production of agriculture,\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, and IoT [55]. The agriculture domain is\nexperiencing\
    \ new evolution and revolution motivated by cloud technology, IoT, Edge and\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n3 of 23\nfog computing, sensors, IoT, and big data\
    \ [56]. A proposal was presented for agriculture\napplications by investigating\
    \ integrated platforms, including cloud computing, IoT, and\ndata mining techniques\
    \ [57]. An IoT-based smart agricultural system was developed using\ndeep learning\
    \ combined with a cloud environment comprised of four layers: data collection,\n\
    edge computing, data transmission, and cloud computing layer [58]. A scalable\
    \ network-\nbased architecture was proposed to monitor and regulate agricultural\
    \ farms in rural areas\nusing IoT-based wiﬁ, long-distance network, and fog computing\
    \ [59]. Agricultural data\nanalytics employed with IoT has transformed from speciﬁc\
    \ crops to any kind of crop. The\ndeveloped system could support various applications,\
    \ from controlling and monitoring the\ncrops to promoting them to market [60].\n\
    Literacy is the ability to read and write simple statements [61]. Illiteracy,\
    \ low education,\nand computer illiteracy are signiﬁcant concerns in developing\
    \ countries like Pakistan.\nStudies indicate that user interface (UI) would be\
    \ designed differently for literate, low-\nliterate, and illiterate users. A user\
    \ interface should also consider the cultural context, such\nas language and images.\
    \ The non-textual interface is more user-friendly than the textual\none for illiterate\
    \ users [62].\nThe inability to read and write and the illiteracy of small farmers\
    \ make them vulnerable\nto various workers and cause human health risks [63].\
    \ Previous research inferred that\ncomplex hierarchy and multi-screens become\
    \ difﬁcult for low-literates to understand\nhelpful information, so the visuals,\
    \ audio, video, speech, icons, and images are a better\napproach to passing complex\
    \ data and information to mobile users [64]. The research\nﬁndings shed light\
    \ on some user interface (UI) design guidelines for illiterate and semi-\nliterate\
    \ users that can help take advantage of information and communication technologies\n\
    ICT [51]. The most powerful design factors that should be incorporated into a\
    \ user interface\n(UI) for low-literate users are localization and graphics [65].\
    \ An android application with\naudio, textual, and visual components was designed\
    \ for farmers with diverse literacy\nlevels. It could facilitate them regarding\
    \ vital weather information [45]. Pakistani farmers\ntypically rely on traditional\
    \ sources of information, which could be a reason for their\ninformation deﬁciency.\
    \ Data analysis indicated that farmers had diverse demographic\nconditions, but\
    \ primary among them is the ordinary level of education (52.4% illiterate).\n\
    A high level of information deﬁciency was observed among farmers regarding fertilizers\n\
    application, seed rate, disease diagnosis, pests, and insects’ identiﬁcation,\
    \ and a medium\nlevel of lack in information regarding the selection of varieties,\
    \ harvesting, and pets’\nmanagement was observed [66]. Providing information access\
    \ to low-literate, linguistic\nminority, tech-shy, handicapped and marginalized\
    \ users using speech-based services is a\nviable solution. These services were\
    \ made the national weather hotline of Pakistan [50]. A\nsurvey data revealed\
    \ that farmers in the Vehari district of Pakistan have a low literary rate\nand\
    \ less technical knowledge. They are unable to read agricultural instructions,\
    \ unaware\nof pesticides persistence and toxicity (73%), unable to diagnose cotton\
    \ pests and diseases\n(86%), and unable to decide which crop to grow on cotton\
    \ adjacent farms (100%) [67]. The\nresearch was conducted to study knowledge,\
    \ attitude, and practices regarding pesticide\nusage by vegetable growers in three\
    \ districts; Dadu, Larkana, and Shikarpur of Sindh,\nPakistan. Results show that\
    \ most vegetable growers (40.90%) have low primary education\nliteracy, and 27.27%\
    \ possess a middle pass. That’s why most growers are unfamiliar with\npest and\
    \ insect damage indications and the safe handling of pesticides [68]. Pakistani\n\
    farmers’ awareness of the damaging effects of different pesticides can lead to\
    \ integrated\nand smart pest control and management [69]. Research ﬁndings reﬂect\
    \ farmers’ behavior\nand a low tendency towards reading the labels of the pesticides\
    \ due to low education,\nadvanced age, usage of too technical language, illegible\
    \ fonts, and unclear texts [70]. In [71],\nthe authors developed a basic interactive\
    \ voice response (IVR) system for agro-information\ndissemination, such as fertilizer,\
    \ pesticide information, and weather forecast. In terms\nof usability and information\
    \ extraction, their study reﬂected that simple menu-based\nnavigation interfaces\
    \ are relatively easy to use and understand.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n4 of\
    \ 23\nA remote agricultural monitoring platform was proposed in [72] after a detailed\n\
    literature study. Cyber security-based precision farming conceptual architecture\
    \ was\npresented in [73] for the frost prediction in peach production by analyzing\
    \ data captured\nby sensors implanted around an orchard. IoT-based precision farming\
    \ comprises multiple\ncontrol and monitoring applications like monitoring water\
    \ needs according to climate\nconditions, analyzing soil patterns, monitoring\
    \ crops disease and pest attacks, and assessing\noptimum time for planting, harvesting,\
    \ and tracking [74,75].\nAquaAgro offers IoT and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) enabled\
    \ solutions for precision\nfarming. Using a software or app embedded hardware,\
    \ the predictions will be made for\nthe Irrigation scheduling, Fertilizer requirement,\
    \ Pest attack prediction, and Plant disease\ndetection. The essential four services\
    \ that AquaAgro provides are irrigation scheduling,\nFertilizer requirement, Pest\
    \ attack prediction, and Plant disease detection. They have\nreceived an overwhelming\
    \ response from the people [76]. An android mobile application\nnamed ‘Mentha\
    \ Mitra’ was developed with an interactive interface with bilingual (Hindi\nand\
    \ English) for menthol mint growers [77]. Android application provides scientiﬁc\
    \ e-\nadvisories on crop-related diseases, high-yield varieties, pests, insects,\
    \ and improved\ndistillation units.\nAn IoT-based wireless sensor network (WSN)\
    \ framework was proposed to monitor\ncrops smartly by analyzing environmental\
    \ factors [78]. In [79], the authors utilized the\nbeneﬁts of IoT for the implementation\
    \ of precision agriculture by sensing required param-\neters from the ﬁeld and\
    \ making suitable decisions such as activation and deactivation of\nirrigation\
    \ valves. Parameters include soil moisture, temperature and light intensity, etc.\n\
    Sensors could also send the gathered data to the cloud, and an Android application\
    \ was\ndeveloped to access these parameters. An expert IoT-based system relies\
    \ on the stored\nknowledge base and real-time data for farmer recommendations\
    \ [80]. This system will help\nin proactive and reactive tasks to a minimum the\
    \ loss of water. Farooq et al. [81] performed\na comprehensive literature study\
    \ on state-of-the-art techniques in smart farming. They\ndiscussed agriculture\
    \ networks, platforms, architecture, and topologies to help farmers\nto enhance\
    \ the corps’ productivity. This survey paper shows that Government and many\n\
    other stakeholders are interested in deploying IoT in Pakistan’s agriculture ﬁeld.\
    \ To in-\ncrease agricultural productivity, the authors suggested that collaboration\
    \ between allied\nand agriculture activities can be built by integrating big data\
    \ into climate-smart agriculture\nwith resource utilization [82].\nIn [83], the\
    \ authors are more concerned about the water supply to the plants. They\nproposed\
    \ a system in which a farmer can water the plants with a push of a button on his\n\
    phone when he is out of the station. Machine learning algorithms and radio frequency\n\
    identiﬁcation (RFID) tags detect and measure moisture and humidity. Internationally,\n\
    many studies [12,84–86] have been conducted to improve agricultural processes\
    \ based on\nsoil fertility level, crops, weather patterns, and fertilizers. These\
    \ studies used IoT, Global\nPosition Systems (GPS), Global information systems\
    \ (GIS), Wireless Sensor Networks\n(WSN), and many machine learning techniques.\
    \ The implementation of studies results in\nincreased proﬁtability and self-sufﬁciency.\
    \ IoT enabled decision support systems based on\nreal-time farm sensors data,\
    \ improving the water consumption by crops [87–89]. Authors\nin [90] provided\
    \ the real-time farm data, weather, and crops data to a Penman-Monteith\nand crop-coefﬁcient\
    \ model to produce recommendations about irrigation schedules. An\nintelligent\
    \ approach for diagnosing crop disease was proposed in [91], capable of working\n\
    with android devices equipped with fuzzy decision-making at the backend. The system\n\
    interacts with farmers in their native language of Urdu for crop disease diagnosing.\
    \ ‘Padi2U’\nis an android application developed for farmers to manage paddy ﬁelds.\
    \ It provides\nguidelines related to paddy varieties, planting schedule, pest,\
    \ disease, weed, weather\nforecast, and yield information in their native language\
    \ ‘Malay’ [92]. In [93], the authors\ndeveloped an application named ‘BLYNK’ to\
    \ control the IoT-based hardware remotely. The\npurpose of ‘BLYNK’ was to automate\
    \ irrigation and fertilizer supply to farms. Their results\nreﬂect approximately\
    \ 50% water saving and a 35% increase in yield. Irrigation monitoring\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 1277\n5 of 23\nand automatic control systems were developed using\
    \ fuzzy decision support to generate a\nmoisture content distribution map of soil\
    \ and enhance affectivity [53,94–98].\nSoil having an essential quantity of macro\
    \ and micro-nutrients would be capable of\ncultivating different crops. The soil’s\
    \ lack of signiﬁcant nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus,\nand Potassium) declines\
    \ crops’ cultivation, growth, and yield. To increase crop production,\nthe suitability\
    \ of a speciﬁc crop to be planted can be recommended by exploiting the soil’s\n\
    macronutrients [99–103]. Soil pH level is the major parameter for measuring soil\
    \ macronu-\ntrients (N, P, and K) and some of the micronutrients [104–108]. Smart\
    \ agro farms [109] use\nsolar power and a low-cost smart system, a perfect combination\
    \ of IoT, data mining, and\nAndroid application. The system monitors and extracts\
    \ a farm’s environmental factors\nsuch as soil moisture, humidity, and weather\
    \ and temperature parameters via data mining\nmodules, and provides optimized\
    \ guidance regarding crop cultivation, irrigation, and\nweather forecast in the\
    \ English language.\n1.2. Objectives and Hypotheses\nThe proposed system obtains\
    \ agricultural data through implanted IoT sensors, such\nas pH, soil moisture,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The Internet plays a mediatory role in\ncommunication\
    \ and data exchange. We integrated agricultural data acquired from im-\nplanted\
    \ IoT devices with the cloud platform. Data is processed in a decision-making\
    \ system\nbased on learning prediction rules in conjunction with a rule-based\
    \ engine. Generally, a\nfarmer requires guidelines, even from the crop selection\
    \ phase to the harvesting stage. As\npresented in Figure 1, to facilitate low\
    \ literate farmers at each of these steps in their native\nlanguage, we performed\
    \ the following research objectives:\n•\nInvestigated traditional techniques and\
    \ systems with different agricultural interfaces\nto ﬁnd a research gap.\n•\n\
    Design and develop an interface in an easy-to-use format and Urdu for low-literate\n\
    farmers to facilitate their awareness and guidelines in their native language.\n\
    •\nDesign and develop a mechanism for measuring soil fertility of speciﬁc land\
    \ to recom-\nmend suitable crops according to soil fertility using fuzzy logic.\n\
    •\nProvide crops cultivation schedule, crop harvest schedule, automated irrigation\
    \ pro-\ncess, and watering guidelines to farmers.\n•\nFacilitate farmers concerning\
    \ guidelines for weeds and their eradication, pest attacks,\nand awareness of\
    \ best pesticides, crop diseases, and suitable fertilizers.\nAgriculture 2022,\

    \ most farmers are unfamiliar with the latest practices of\nagriculture as they\
    \ are not facilitated with new technologies to access agricultural information\n\
    and thus rely on traditional methods to grow their crops. Related studies indicate\
    \ that there is\nno such smart system providing an interactive interface to a\
    \ low literate or illiterate farmer\nand guidelines from the crop selection phase\
    \ to the harvesting stage. Significant barriers to\naccessing modern information\
    \ systems are the low literacy of farmers, the non-availability of\nlocal-language\
    \ information systems, and systems with fewer features. Our research identified\n\
    that it is essential to equip rural and semi-literate or illiterate farmers with\
    \ updated information\nthrough ICT, IoT, Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, and\
    \ Machine learning techniques, and\nprovide them guidance in almost every phase\
    \ of the crop cycle. It is necessary to develop\nUrdu-language-based information\
    \ smart systems to enhance farmers’ comprehension, crop\nproduction, and sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nProposed System Design and Architecture\nThe overall design and\
    \ architecture of the solution proposed to cover smart agriculture\nare depicted\
    \ in Figure 2. It comprises three layers: crop (edge) layer, fog computing layer,\n\
    data analytics, and smart management at the cloud layer. The edge and cloud layers\
    \ are\ndesigned to be deployed respectively at local crop premises and remote\
    \ data servers. The\nintermediate fog computing layer comprises a set of virtualized\
    \ control modules in the form\nof Network Function Virtualization (NFV) nodes\
    \ that can be initiated along the network path\nfrom the farm facilities to the\
    \ cloud layer. NFV is a way to virtualize network services, for\nexample, firewalls,\
    \ routers, and load balancers that have traditionally been run on proprietary\n\
    hardware. The intermediate fog layer increases the versatility of deployed solutions\
    \ and\nconnectivity performances with the edge layer. At the crop premises, suitable\
    \ sensors like\nhumidity, temperature, soil moisture sensor, light intensity,\
    \ pH sensor, and actuators like\nwater pumps, valves, and activation of devices\
    \ for smart farming automation are deployed\nand connected with wireless nodes\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Sensors’ data is captured at the edge\nlayer through wireless\
    \ nodes and transmitted to the fog layer. This layered architecture lets\natomic\
    \ operations requiring high reliability and low latency between sensors and actuators\n\
    to be processed at the fog layer, such as executing irrigation mandates for a\
    \ specific time\ninterval. The fog layer subsystem comprises the farm’s operative\
    \ control like irrigation,\nfarm monitoring, energy management, etc. The fog layer\
    \ is responsible for data fusion and\naggregation to offload analytics functions\
    \ that are usually performed. The fog layer control\nmodules are virtualized through\
    \ NFV techniques that communicate with edge nodes via IoT\nprotocols like constrained\
    \ application protocol (CoAP) and MQ telemetry transport (MQTT).\nAs depicted\

    \ facilitation with the following\nmain features.\n3.1.1. Soil Nutrient Analysis\n\
    With increased emphasis on precision agriculture, economics, and the environment,\n\
    soil analysis is a tool to determine areas where adequate and excessive fertilization\
    \ has\noccurred.\nSoil analysis is also used to monitor past fertility practices\
    \ to changes in\na ﬁeld’s nutrient status.\nNutrient availability can be impacted\
    \ by soil chemical and\nphysical properties.\nIn determining soil nutrient contents,\
    \ soil pH analysis is one parameter. Soil pH refers\nto the acidity and alkalinity\
    \ of soil measured on a logarithmic scale; thus decrease in 1 unit\nof pH value\
    \ causes an increase in acidity by a factor of 10. Small changes in pH values\
    \ have\nsigniﬁcant consequences. Table 1 represents the range values deﬁned for\
    \ soil pH.\nTable 1. Soil pH range values.\npH Level\nRange Values\n<3.5\nUltra-Acidic\n\
    3.6–3.9\nExtremely Acidic\n4–5.5\nStrong acidic\n5.6–6\nMedium acidic\n6.1–6.5\n\
    Slightly acidic\n6.6–7\nVery Slightly acidic\n7.1–7.5\nVery Slightly alkaline\n\
    7.6–8\nSlightly alkaline\n8.1–8.5\nMedium alkaline\n8.6–10\nStrongly alkaline\n\
    Measuring the acidity and alkalinity of soil is essential for analyzing the number\
    \ of\nmacro-nutrients present in the soil, particularly nitrogen (N), potassium\
    \ (K), and phospho-\nrus (P). Crops need these macro-nutrients in their growth,\
    \ thrive, and combat diseases.\nRemoval of bases from the soil due to harvested\
    \ crops, leaching, and acidic residual left in\nsoil due to fertilizers causes\
    \ an increase in acidity of the soil. Soil acidity affects crops and\nplants in\
    \ many ways, such as whether the surface pH is very high or too low, when the\n\
    efﬁcacy of herbicides and chemical reactions may be affected. Soil analysis is\
    \ the best way\nto check pH levels, and maintaining at least a pH of 6.0 is a\
    \ realistic goal. When soil pH is\nvery low (acidity is high) following conditions\
    \ occur:\n•\nSoluble metals, especially Manganese and Aluminum, may be toxic.\n\
    •\nThe population of organisms and their activities accountable for transforming\
    \ N, P,\nand S to plant-available forms may be reduced.\n•\nDeﬁciency of Calcium.\
    \ The soil’s cation exchange capacity (CEC) is low.\n•\nSymbiotic N ﬁxation in\
    \ legume crops is signiﬁcantly impaired. The symbiotic asso-\nciation entails\
    \ a narrower range of soil reactions than does the growth of plants not\nrelying\
    \ on ‘N’ ﬁxation.\n•\nAcidic soil with less organic matter is poorly aggregated\
    \ and has poor tilt.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n8 of 23\n•\nThe availability\
    \ of mineral elements in soil may be affected. Association between soil\npH and\
    \ nutrient availability to plants can be depicted in Figure 3. The wider the blue\n\
    bar, the greater the nutrient availability. For example, for a pH range of 5.5–7.5,\
    \ the\navailability of P is highest and drops below 5.5. If the soil pH is 6,\
    \ an amount of P\napplied to it will be more available than if the same amount\
    \ is used in soil with a pH\nless than 5.5. Soil with high pH (>7.4) reduces several\
    \ nutrients such as Fe, Mn, Zn,\nand P, which is not economical for growing agronomic\
    \ crops.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n9 of 24 \n \n \nFigure 3.\

    \  \nMacronutrients are essential for plant growth and an excellent overall plant\
    \ state. The \nprimary macronutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium\
    \ (K). Nitrogen is \na principal constituent of several essential plant substances\
    \ necessary for plant develop-\nment, energy metabolism, and protein synthesis.\
    \ Phosphorus is involved in vital plant \nprocesses. Unlike other macronutrients,\

    manganese, copper, molybdenum, and zinc in relatively small amounts, often called\n\
    micronutrients. Plant nutrition is difﬁcult to understand entirely because of\

    \ Recommendation\nThe recommendation system proceeds based on a decree made by\
    \ a fuzzy logic-based\ndecision support system. Fuzzy logic is the key concept\
    \ for decision-making systems and\ncharacterizes each object of a set by a degree\
    \ of member functions from the interval [0,1].\nThe membership function deﬁnes\
    \ the degree of similarity of an object to the fuzzy subset.\nFuzziﬁcation is\
    \ the method of allocating a system’s numerical input to fuzzy sets with some\n\
    degree of membership. The fuzzy system decides by considering predeﬁned conditions\n\
    and real-time data captured by sensors implanted on a speciﬁc farm. A fuzzy decision\n\
    system is integrated with the controller to recommend suitable crops that can\
    \ be cultivated\non farmland based on available soil nutrients in the soil. Finally,\
    \ real-time data is processed\non the server, and a list of suitable crops is\
    \ directed to the farmer’s mobile app, as shown in\nFigure 4, where the farmer\
    \ can select any crop to cultivate.\nA fuzzy set S with parameters (U, i) where\

    \ 2022, 12, 1277\n19 of 23\n4. Conclusion\nAgriculture is the backbone of Pakistan.\
    \ It is necessary to ensure its sustainable growth\nover the years. We studied\
    \ traditional trends followed by farmers and investigated why\nproductivity lags.\
    \ The key barriers are information inadequacies, lack of information\nsystems\
    \ for illiterates or less-literates, and lack of a system that provides guidance\
    \ at\nevery stage of the crop cycle. This study was carried out to provide a smart\
    \ advisory\nsystem for illiterate and semi-literate farmers of Pakistan that could\
    \ provide them guidance\nfrom crop selection to the harvest stage phase. In this\
    \ research work, we built a cost-\neffective smart system equipped with multiple\
    \ sensors and devices related to the internet\nof things (IoT) technologies. We\
    \ also developed an android application named ‘Kistan\nPakistan’ that allows illiterate\
    \ and low-literate farmers to manage their farms remotely. The\ninterface of the\
    \ android application is interactive due to its visual, audio, voice, and iconic\n\
    components. The proposed solution is applicable globally as all information and\
    \ guidelines\nare disseminated in both the ‘Urdu’ and ‘English’ languages. Edge-cloud\
    \ computing\ndelivers more accurate guidelines in less time and in almost every\
    \ phase of the agricultural\ncycle, increasing productivity and making the agricultural\
    \ ecosystem more robust. We\nexperimented on a small-scale farm, but the results\
    \ reﬂect that it will be efﬁcient for medium\nto large-scale ﬁelds.\nAuthor Contributions:\

  analysis: '**Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)
    and their collection and use**


    The authors of this paper discuss the different types of data that can be collected
    from soil and plants using various sensors. They categorize the data into three
    main types: soil moisture, canopy temperature, and weather data. Each of these
    data types provides valuable information about the state of the soil and plants,
    and can be used to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and
    other agricultural practices.


    * **Soil moisture** is a critical factor in plant growth and development. It affects
    the availability of water and nutrients to plants, and can have a significant
    impact on yield. Soil moisture sensors can be used to measure the water content
    of the soil, and this information can be used to determine when and how much to
    irrigate. This data type is also useful for tracking the long-term trends in soil
    moisture, which can help farmers identify any potential problems that need to
    be addressed.


    * **Canopy temperature** is another important indicator of plant health. It reflects
    the amount of heat that is being emitted by the plant, and can be used to assess
    the plant''s water status, nutrient status, and overall health. Canopy temperature
    sensors can be used to measure the temperature of the plant canopy, and this information
    can be used to identify plants that are stressed or diseased. This data type is
    also useful for monitoring the effects of environmental conditions on plants,
    such as drought, heat, and cold.


    * **Weather data** can also have a significant impact on plant growth and development.
    Factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation can all affect
    the growth rate, yield, and quality of plants. Weather stations can be used to
    collect weather data, and this information can be used to make informed decisions
    about when to plant, irrigate, and harvest. This data type is also useful for
    tracking the long-term trends in weather patterns, which can help farmers identify
    any potential changes that need to be taken into account.


    **Collection and transmission of data**


    The authors of this paper also highlight the importance of collecting and transmitting
    data in a timely and accurate manner. They discuss the use of wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) for this purpose, and explain how WSNs can be used to collect
    data from multiple sensors and transmit it to a central location. This data can
    then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices.


    **Case studies**


    The authors of this paper present two case studies that demonstrate the use of
    soil moisture, canopy temperature, and weather data in agricultural applications.
    The first case study describes the use of soil moisture sensors to optimize irrigation
    in a vineyard. The second case study describes the use of canopy temperature sensors
    to detect water stress in a corn ﬁeld.


    **Conclusion**


    The authors of this paper conclude by emphasizing the importance of data collection
    and analysis in precision agriculture. They argue that by collecting and analyzing
    data from soil, plants, and weather, farmers can make more informed decisions
    about irrigation, fertilization, and other agricultural practices. This can lead
    to increased yields, reduced costs, and improved environmental sustainability.


    **Relevance to the point**


    This paper is relevant to the speciﬁc point of the outline because it provides
    a comprehensive overview of the different types of data that can be collected
    from soil and plants, and how this data can be used to improve agricultural practices.
    The paper also discusses the importance of collecting and transmitting data in
    a timely and accurate manner, and presents two case studies that demonstrate the
    use of soil moisture, canopy temperature, and weather data in agricultural applications.'

    \ of things\n1. Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic shifted the general public’s\
    \ attention to digital solutions\nand brought immense demand to the telecommunications\
    \ market. The convergence of 5G\ntechnology and the Internet of Things (IoT) [1]\
    \ is the next natural step for two advanced\ntechnologies developed to make the\
    \ lives of their users more accessible, more comfortable,\nand more productive\
    \ [2]. One of the most standard technologies to be brought into the\nmainstream\
    \ area is 5G, which will allow for new business opportunities by being comple-\n\
    mented with Industry 4.0, IoT devices, and Smart Cities and improve overall connectivity\n\
    around the globe [3]. The Internet of Things is an ecosystem of increasing complexity:\
    \ a\nuniverse of connected things capable of capturing critical data and carrying\
    \ out advanced\nanalysis using cloud-based functionalities to extract valuable\
    \ information. This technology\nposes a great opportunity for a multitude of actors\
    \ in all sectors of activity [4]. Many\ncompanies are organizing to focus on IoT\
    \ and connectivity when developing their products\nand services of the future.\n\
    Deployment costs, range, interference, and capabilities of Internet of Things\
    \ devices\nare all factors in identifying the right primary or complementary connectivity\
    \ option for\nan IoT deployment. Wi-Fi 6 or Zigbee is adequate for some elements\
    \ of smart building\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23083876\n\

    \ but useless for highly mobile wide-area use [5]. Additionally, endpoints such\
    \ as\nBluetooth, Zigbee, RFID, or Wi-Fi can be signiﬁcantly more cost effective\
    \ in scenarios where\n5G may be available but has not yet reached a signiﬁcant\
    \ market scale to do competitive\nendpoints or network services [6]. Technical\
    \ studies [7] show that 5G and other services can\ncoexist in speciﬁc frequency\
    \ bands. The technical conditions must be adequately adapted\nand not excessively\
    \ restrictive; otherwise, there is a risk of affecting the costs, coverage,\n\
    and quality of operation of 5G services.\nThere is great interest in the new applications\
    \ of mobile technology merging 5G and\nthe Internet of Things technologies. In\
    \ the design of new applications or technological\naccessories using 5G and the\
    \ Internet of Things, compliance with the permitted exposure\nlimits are contemplated.\
    \ International exposure guidelines have been developed due to\nextensive research\
    \ carried out over many decades. All the analyses carried out by indepen-\ndent\
    \ public health authorities, expert groups, and the World Health Organization\
    \ (WHO)\nagree that these guidelines guarantee protection for all people against\
    \ any health danger [8].\nAs with all technological generations, 5G dramatically\
    \ improves energy efﬁciency depart-\nment and speed rates. However, this technology\
    \ has recently been in the public eye for its\nimplementation challenges.\nIoT\
    \ technologies are now being widely used in the consumer-grade market, primarily\n\
    targeted toward home automation and security. This rise in consumer adoption has\
    \ led to\nproposals to incorporate IoT devices to bring these types of improvements\
    \ to a metropolitan\nscale [9]. These improvements are speculated to improve security\
    \ and automation tasks\nand tackle long-lasting difﬁculties such as trafﬁc control,\
    \ waste management, and so on.\nHowever, IoT does not depend solely on the electronics\
    \ being deployed and installed;\nthey rely on efﬁcient and resilient transmission\
    \ technology being used. The convergence\nof networks and services is an essential\
    \ aspect of the modern internet. The internet has\nevolved from a simple means\
    \ of communication to a complex and multifaceted ecosystem\nthat is integrated\
    \ into nearly every aspect of our daily lives. The advent of 5G technology\nhas\
    \ further pushed the convergence of networks and services, providing users with\
    \ faster\nand more reliable internet connections, enabling a range of new and\
    \ innovative applications\nand services [10].\nOne of the most signiﬁcant ways\
    \ that the convergence of networks and services\nimpacts internet services is\
    \ by increasing the availability and speed of access to the internet.\n5G technology\
    \ offers faster speeds and greater bandwidth, allowing users to access high-\n\
    quality video, audio, and other media content in real-time [11]. This means that\
    \ internet\nservice providers can offer a range of new services and applications\
    \ that were previously\nimpossible, such as virtual and augmented reality experiences\
    \ and immersive gaming.\nCellular connectivity will enable key IoT goals to be\
    \ achieved, in particular, reduced\ndevice complexity and cost and increased coverage\
    \ to support challenging and remote\napplications, deployment ﬂexibility, high\
    \ capacity, and long battery life. 3GPP wireless\ntechnologies offer compelling\
    \ technology advantages that will continue to increase the\ncapacity of Long Term\
    \ Evolution (LTE) infrastructure to address the vast IoT market in\nthe long term,\
    \ and 5G will add to the IoT landscape soon. In Releases 14, 15, and beyond\n\
    of the 3GPP (Third-Generation Partnership Project), the standards solve all commercial\n\
    bottlenecks to facilitate the vision of 5G and the huge IoT Market [12]. This\
    \ can lead\nto the explosion of billions of devices and sensors that show digital\
    \ representations of\nour real world powered by low-cost devices, long battery\
    \ life, ubiquitous coverage, and\ninnovative business applications. 5G promises\
    \ that it will be possible to achieve critical\nIoT applications, which require\
    \ real-time dynamic process control and automation in\nvarious ﬁelds, such as\
    \ vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), high-speed\nmotion,\
    \ and trafﬁc control. Critical parameters to enable the required performance are\n\
    sub-millisecond network latency and ultra-high reliability. Both are intrinsic\
    \ components of\nthe 3GPP work to deﬁne the new radio interface for 5G [13]. The\
    \ 5G network architecture\nis being designed to address both IoT scenarios.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n3 of 41\nThe success of the IoT services on 5G networks\
    \ depends on the ability of these networks\nto manage interference effectively.\
    \ Interference can occur when different IoT devices operate\nin the same area,\
    \ and their signals overlap, causing lower throughput, higher latency, and\ndecreased\
    \ reliability [14]. This is a signiﬁcant challenge for 5G networks and IoT services,\
    \ as\nthey are designed to support a vast number of devices and applications,\
    \ each with unique\nconnectivity and latency requirements.\nFigure 1 shows the\
    \ comparison between 5G and IoT, which is a topic of interest\nin the technology\
    \ world. To implement 5G, there are speciﬁc requirements, including\ninfrastructure\
    \ and specialized hardware, while the evolution of wireless networks has led to\n\
    faster and more reliable data transfer rates. The evolution of IoT has enabled\
    \ the creation of\nlow-power, low-cost devices that can be connected to the internet.\
    \ Wireless communication\ntechnologies such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, and LoRa\
    \ are suitable for different types of\nIoT applications, and cloud-based solutions\
    \ are used to store and process vast amounts\nof data generated by IoT devices.\
    \ 5G applications include autonomous vehicles, remote\nsurgery, and virtual and\
    \ augmented reality, and these require high bandwidth, low latency,\nand reliable\
    \ connectivity. However, there are challenges associated with 5G networks,\nsuch\
    \ as interference and network optimization difﬁculties. The coexistence of 5G\
    \ networks\nand IoT applications is a concern, and optimization challenges in\
    \ 5G networks need to be\naddressed to enable efﬁcient and effective implementation.\n\
    Figure 1. Summary of conceptual schemes that addresses the present work.\nMotivation\n\
    The motivation of this work is to compile the impact of interference on the leading\
    \ 5G\ntechnologies that will inﬂuence the communications of IoT devices.\nIoT\
    \ services are used in various industries, including healthcare, manufacturing,\n\
    and transportation, where reliable and efﬁcient connectivity is essential for\
    \ the proper\nfunctioning of IoT devices and the smooth operation of business\
    \ processes. If interference\nand network performance issues are not addressed,\
    \ businesses may experience reduced\nproductivity, increased downtime, and decreased\
    \ customer satisfaction. Consequently,\naddressing the interference and optimization\
    \ of 5G networks in IoT services is essential to\nensure reliable and efﬁcient\
    \ connectivity for IoT devices and allow businesses to take full\nadvantage of\
    \ the beneﬁts of 5G networks and IoT services. For this reason, the motivation\n\
    of this work is to review the state of the art of the work to address the interference\
    \ and\noptimization of 5G technologies in IoT services.\nInterference and optimization\

    \ management techniques and\noptimizing network performance, businesses can take\
    \ full advantage of the beneﬁts of 5G\nnetworks and IoT services.\nThe main contribution\
    \ of this review is to present the idea that the convergence\nof 5G networks and\
    \ IoT services represents a technological revolution that promises to\nchange\
    \ how we interact with the world around us. However, this union has its challenges,\n\
    and only by overcoming them can we unlock the full potential of these groundbreaking\n\
    technologies. By bridging the gap between 5G and IoT, we pave the way for a new\
    \ era\nof innovation: every device is connected, and every experience is seamless.\
    \ This work\ndescribes the main challenges between 5G networks and IoT services\
    \ and highlights the\nneed for seamless integration of these technologies to achieve\
    \ their full potential. This\npaper reinforces the idea that IoT technologies\
    \ power 5G services, and their compatibility\nis crucial for offering high-speed\
    \ and low-latency services to consumers. Furthermore, it\nunderscores that interference\
    \ is one of the biggest problems facing manufacturers, and they\nmust consider\
    \ it to offer compatible and reliable services. Ultimately, this article guides\n\
    the industry to ensure that 5G and IoT technologies work together seamlessly,\
    \ opening up\nendless possibilities for innovation and progress.\nFigure 2 describes\
    \ how the IoT and 5G technology can work together to enable a range\nof applications\
    \ in different ﬁelds. In the ﬁrst application, smart cities, IoT devices can\n\
    be used to collect real-time data on trafﬁc patterns, air quality, and energy\
    \ usage. These\ndata can be used to optimize city operations and improve quality\
    \ of life. 5G networks\ncan support these applications by providing the necessary\
    \ bandwidth and low latency.\nIn industrial automation, IoT devices can be used\
    \ to monitor and control manufacturing\nprocesses and equipment in real time.\
    \ This can help to improve efﬁciency and reduce\ndowntime. 5G networks can provide\
    \ the necessary bandwidth, reliability, and low latency\nto support these applications.\
    \ In healthcare, IoT devices can be used for remote patient\nmonitoring and real-time\
    \ communication between healthcare providers. This can help\nto improve patient\
    \ outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. 5G networks can provide\nthe necessary\
    \ bandwidth, low latency, and reliability to support these applications. In\n\
    transportation, IoT devices can provide real-time data on trafﬁc patterns and\
    \ vehicle\nperformance, which can be used to optimize trafﬁc ﬂow and improve safety.\
    \ 5G networks\ncan support these applications by providing the necessary bandwidth,\
    \ low latency, and\nreliability. In agriculture, IoT devices can be used to monitor\
    \ crops and livestock in real-time,\nwhich can help to optimize production and\
    \ reduce waste. 5G networks can support these\napplications by providing the necessary\
    \ bandwidth, reliability, and low latency. In retail,\nIoT devices can be used\
    \ to collect real-time data on customer behavior and inventory levels,\nwhich\
    \ can be used to optimize store operations and improve the customer experience.\
    \ 5G\nnetworks can provide the necessary bandwidth, reliability, and low latency\
    \ to support\nthese applications. Overall, the text shows how IoT and 5G technology\
    \ can work together\nto enable a range of applications in different ﬁelds. By\

    \ Work\nThe radio signal characteristics of new wireless applications are similar\
    \ to those of\nexisting mobile technologies [5]. This is where the interest of\
    \ this work lies in considering in\ndetail the impact and types of interference\
    \ of 5G technologies that coexist with IoT devices.\nThe new applications use\
    \ similar transmit powers and operate in the same frequency ranges.\nTo mitigate\
    \ interference, we can synchronize or coordinate all networks or implement\nlarge\
    \ guard bands that waste valuable spectrum [15]. In practice, close cooperation\
    \ is\nrequired between all operators in each frequency band, and not all usage\
    \ modes and\nall types of 5G deployments can likely be supported simultaneously.\
    \ Regulators need\nto consider these technical issues and their implications when\
    \ deciding how to arrange\nfrequencies in these bands.\nVarious interference management\
    \ techniques, such as power control, channel allo-\ncation, and beamforming, can\
    \ be implemented to ensure that IoT devices on the same\nnetwork do not interfere\
    \ with each other. However, these techniques can be complicated\nand may require\
    \ signiﬁcant changes to the network infrastructure [16]. Additionally, new\ninterference\
    \ management techniques may be required as IoT devices continue to evolve\nand\
    \ become more sophisticated.\nAnother signiﬁcant challenge in managing interference\
    \ in 5G networks is the diversity\nof devices and applications that use these\
    \ networks. IoT services can be used in various\nindustries, including healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, and transportation, each with unique\nconnectivity and latency\
    \ requirements [17]. For instance, in healthcare, IoT devices, such as\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3876\n6 of 41\nwearable monitors and remote patient monitoring systems,\
    \ require low latency and reliable\nconnectivity to provide accurate data and\
    \ alerts. In contrast, IoT devices used in industrial\nautomation require high\
    \ bandwidth and low latency to operate effectively [18]. Therefore,\nmanaging\
    \ interference in 5G networks requires a comprehensive approach that considers\n\
    the diverse connectivity and latency requirements of different IoT devices and\
    \ applications.\nAnother important challenge is the potential for external interference;\
    \ while interfer-\nence management techniques can ensure that IoT devices on the\
    \ same network do not\ninterfere with each other, external interference can occur\
    \ when IoT devices operate in areas\nwith other wireless devices, such as Wi-Fi\
    \ routers, Bluetooth devices, and other cellular\nnetworks. This can lead to signal\
    \ degradation, reduced throughput, and decreased reliabil-\nity of the network\
    \ [19]. As a result, it is essential to consider external interference when\n\
    designing and implementing 5G networks for IoT services, and to use techniques\
    \ such as\nfrequency coordination and spectrum sharing to manage external interference\
    \ effectively.\nTo provide better insights for the 5G interference topic, we follow\
    \ the structure detailed\nin Figure 3.\nFigure 3. 5G and IoT technologies’ impact\
    \ scheme.\nThe impact of 5G network interference on IoT services is an active\
    \ research area. Sev-\neral studies have investigated the effects of interference\
    \ on the performance of IoT devices\nand applications. One recent study by Chandra\
    \ et al. analyzed the impact of interference\non the reliability of 5G networks\
    \ for IoT services [20]. The study found that interference\ncan signiﬁcantly reduce\
    \ the reliability of 5G networks for IoT services, especially in dense\ndeployments\
    \ where multiple devices operate in the same area. The study recommended\nusing\
    \ advanced interference management techniques such as dynamic channel allocation\n\
    and power control to mitigate interference effects and improve network reliability.\n\
    Another recent study by Azari et al. [21] investigated the impact of interference\
    \ on\nthe performance of 5G networks for IoT applications. The study found that\
    \ interference\ncan cause signiﬁcant degradation of network performance, especially\
    \ for applications\nthat require low latency and high bandwidth. The study recommended\
    \ using adaptive\nbeamforming and dynamic channel allocation to reduce interference\
    \ and improve the\nperformance of 5G networks for IoT applications. Additionally,\
    \ the study highlighted\nthe need for more research into interference management\
    \ techniques that can effectively\nmitigate the impact of interference on 5G networks\
    \ for IoT services.\nSeveral research studies have also investigated the impact\
    \ of interference on the\nenergy consumption of IoT devices connected to 5G networks.\
    \ One recent study by\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n7 of 41\nAl-Turjman et al. [22]\
    \ found that interference can cause IoT devices to consume more energy\nto maintain\
    \ connectivity, leading to reduced battery life and increased maintenance costs.\n\
    The study recommended the use of interference management techniques, such as energy-\n\
    efﬁcient channel allocation and scheduling to reduce interference and improve\
    \ the energy\nefﬁciency of IoT devices on 5G networks. The study concluded that\
    \ effective interference\nmanagement techniques are crucial for ensuring the sustainability\
    \ and economic viability\nof IoT services on 5G networks.\nAnother critical area\
    \ of research related to 5G network interference in IoT services is\nthe security\
    \ and privacy implications of interference management techniques. Interference\n\
    management techniques, such as beamforming and channel allocation, require the\
    \ ex-\nchange of information between IoT devices and the network, which can potentially\
    \ expose\nsensitive information to eavesdroppers and attackers. A recent study\
    \ by Hasan et al. [23]\ninvestigated the security and privacy risks associated\
    \ with beamforming and proposed a\nsecure beamforming scheme that uses encryption\
    \ and authentication to protect sensitive\ninformation. The study concluded that\
    \ the security and privacy implications of interference\nmanagement techniques\
    \ must be carefully considered when designing 5G networks for\nIoT services. Effective\
    \ security and privacy measures can help mitigate the risks associated\nwith interference\
    \ management techniques and ensure the integrity and conﬁdentiality of\nIoT data\
    \ on 5G networks.\nOverall, the current state of the art and related work on the\
    \ impact of 5G network\ninterference on IoT services highlight the importance\
    \ of effective interference management\ntechniques to ensure the reliability and\
    \ performance of 5G networks for IoT applications.\nThe studies recommend the\
    \ use of advanced interference management techniques, such as\ndynamic channel\
    \ allocation, power control, adaptive beamforming, and spectrum sharing,\nto mitigate\
    \ the effects of interference and improve network performance. However, more\n\
    research is needed to develop new and more effective interference management techniques\n\
    that can address the unique challenges of 5G networks and IoT services.\nTable\

    \ operate: This metric indicates whether the IoT service can operate\nwith multiple\
    \ devices. This is an important factor to consider since many IoT services\ninvolve\
    \ the connection of multiple devices, and the network needs to support the\nsimultaneous\
    \ communication of these devices.\n4.\nLatency: This parameter measures the amount\
    \ of delay or lag time in transmitting data\nbetween the IoT devices and the network.\
    \ Latency is an important metric to consider\nfor real-time IoT services, such\
    \ as connected vehicles and healthcare monitoring. The\nvalues in this column\
    \ range from low to ultra-low.\n5.\nInterference management techniques: This parameter\
    \ lists the various techniques that\ncan be used to manage interference in the\
    \ network. Interference management is crucial\nto maintain high performance in\
    \ the presence of other devices and networks that\nmay use the same frequency\

    \ channel hopping, beamforming, coordinated multi-point\ntransmission, dynamic\
    \ power control, interference avoidance, MIMO (multiple-input,\nmultiple-output)\
    \ [24], cognitive radio, massive MIMO, and interference alignment.\n6.\nEnergy\
    \ consumption: This metric indicates the amount of energy consumed by the\nIoT\
    \ devices and the network. Energy consumption is an important consideration for\n\
    IoT services, especially for those that operate in remote locations or rely on\

    Medium\n3. Materials and Methods\n4G networks are based on LTE technology, which\
    \ uses a frequency spectrum of around\n700 MHz to 2600 MHz. These frequencies\
    \ are divided into different bands that are used for\ndifferent purposes, such\
    \ as voice and data communication. 4G networks use a combination\nof Frequency\
    \ Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD) techniques to\ntransmit\
    \ and receive data. FDD uses separate frequencies for transmitting and receiving\n\
    data, while TDD uses the same frequency for both.\nOn the other hand, IoT devices\
    \ use a variety of technologies and protocols to com-\nmunicate with each other\
    \ and with the internet. These devices can operate on different\nfrequency bands,\
    \ such as 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and sub-GHz bands. Some IoT devices use the\nunlicensed\
    \ spectrum, which means they can operate on any frequency without needing a\n\
    license, while others use the licensed spectrum, which requires a license from\
    \ the relevant\nregulatory body.\nOne of the main issues with 4G services and\
    \ networks is that they can cause inter-\nference with IoT devices, especially\
    \ those operating on the same frequency bands. This\ninterference can cause communication\
    \ problems and even lead to data loss or corruption.\nTo mitigate this interference,\
    \ different methods can be used, such as frequency hopping,\nspread-spectrum techniques,\
    \ and power control.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n9 of 41\nFigure 4 summarizes this\
    \ section, where the main concepts related to the impact of\n5G networks on IoT\
    \ services are observed. We analyze the implementation, the evolution,\nand the\
    \ types of wireless technologies that inﬂuence current services, the leading 5G\n\
    technologies and problems, and the coexistence of next-generation networks. We\
    \ frame\ninterference as the heart of the study of problems in this type of network.\n\
    Figure 4. Materials and Methods for 5G and IoT services.\n3.1. 5G Implementation\
    \ Requirements\n5G is an emerging technology in the telecommunications area. Enabling\
    \ high-speed\nconnections, offering lower latencies, and ensuring highly scalable\
    \ connectivity between mul-\ntiple devices [34], every industry worldwide eagerly\
    \ waits for mainstream implementation.\n5G allows for several technologies related\
    \ to massive machine-to-machine communi-\ncations, or IoT, to improve and offer\
    \ high-speed connectivity between devices, primarily\nallowing automation in the\
    \ manufacturing and construction industries. However, IoT has\nseen massive consumer\
    \ implementation in homes, malls, and parks, which means this\ntechnology has\
    \ several use cases for ordinary daily consumers.\nOn the technical side of 5G,\
    \ it works on a higher spectrum range when compared to\ntraditional wireless technologies.\
    \ Ranging from 24 to 100 GHz, it provides low-latency\ncommunication and high\
    \ throughput rates but suffers from adverse conditions caused\nby its high-frequency\
    \ nature [35]. 5G also operates on two frequency bands: Sub 6 GHz\nand mmWave\
    \ (millimeter wave). While mmWave offers faster data transfer rates, it has\n\
    limited coverage and is easily obstructed. On the other hand, the Sub 6 GHz band,\
    \ which\nincludes frequencies below 6 GHz, offers wider coverage and can penetrate\
    \ obstacles such\nas buildings and walls [36]. This means that 5G can actually\
    \ work in the Sub 6 GHz band,\nproviding a more reliable and accessible network\
    \ for users. This is particularly important\nfor rural and suburban areas where\
    \ building penetration is critical, and for indoor usage\nwhere higher frequency\
    \ bands may not be able to reach. Therefore, despite the hype around\nmmWave,\
    \ the Sub 6 GHz band remains a vital part of the 5G network, providing a strong\n\
    foundation for the future of wireless technology.\nTo counteract the limitations,\
    \ 5G has been complemented with new technologies. The\nmost common ones are beamforming,\
    \ massive MIMO, small cell, mmWave, and network\nslicing, and new proposals arise\
    \ everyday to try and get the most out of this generation.\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 3876\n10 of 41\nEven though 5G is far from being implemented worldwide, several\
    \ service providers\nhave been publicly working and sharing their advances related\
    \ to this technology. Some\nfamous names from the IT world are Ericsson, Verizon,\
    \ Nokia, AT&T, T-Mobile, Samsung,\nand Qualcomm. However, undoubtedly, most big\
    \ telecommunications companies are\nworking on projects related to the new generation\
    \ of wireless technologies.\nResearch groups have been focused on the 5G mobile\
    \ network ecosystem, with institu-\ntions such as METIS (Mobile and wireless communications\
    \ Enablers for Twenty-twenty\n(2020) Information Society), 5G PPP (5G Infrastructure\
    \ Public Private Partnership), and\nNYU New York University Wireless, conducting\
    \ impactful research related to MIMO\ntransmissions, millimeter waves, and frameworks\
    \ in the 5G ecosystem [37].\n5G networks offer several features that are essential\
    \ for the Internet of Things (IoT)\nservices, as Figure 5 shows. 5G provides increased\
    \ bandwidth and lower latency, allowing\nIoT devices to transmit data quickly\
    \ and efﬁciently for real-time communication and\nresponse. 5G enables massive\
    \ machine-type communication (mMTC), which allows a\nlarge number of IoT devices\
    \ to connect to the network simultaneously. Ultra-reliable and\nlow-latency communication\
    \ (URLLC) is also provided, ensuring quick and reliable data\ntransmission suitable\
    \ for mission-critical IoT services. Network slicing is another feature of\n5G\
    \ networks, which creates dedicated virtual networks for IoT devices to provide\
    \ better\nnetwork performance and security.\nFigure 5. 5G features that are essential\
    \ for the Internet of Things services.\nBefore the implementation of 5G networks,\
    \ organizations such as IEEE needed to\ncope with challenges about the implementation\
    \ of 5G. One of these challenges is about the\ndata rate key dimensions, since\
    \ the demand of technology services are increasing in the\npast years. 5G should\
    \ be a solution in order to satisfy all this demand and provide a great\nQuality\
    \ of Service (QoS) [38].\nAnother factor to consider is the latency, which is\
    \ responsible for the delay in incoming\nand outgoing packages on a link, as streaming\
    \ services such as online games [39], metaverse,\nand more demand a low latency\
    \ in order to provide better services.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n11 of 41\nIn modern\
    \ society, most products use electrical power, including, for example, electric\n\
    cars such as Tesla. In other words, we are surrounded by electronic devices, and\
    \ it is\nessential to focus on developing friendly devices to avoid consuming\
    \ too much electricity.\nSome important points about 5G energy consumption need\
    \ to be mentioned. First, energy\nefﬁciency depends on the trafﬁc in the network.\
    \ According to the article “Energy-efﬁcient\n5G for a greener future” [40], when\
    \ the trafﬁc load is low, a base station can save 98.75% of\npower, but if the\
    \ trafﬁc load is high, the power consumption may increase.\nFigure 6 describes\
    \ the requirements for 5G. This generation is the latest generation\nof cellular\
    \ networks that is designed to offer signiﬁcant improvements in performance,\n\
    capacity, and ﬂexibility compared to previous generations. To achieve these improvements,\n\
    5G networks utilize several key technologies. One of these technologies is millimeter\n\
    wave (mmWave) frequencies, which are higher frequency bands that can provide higher\n\
    bandwidth and faster data rates. However, these frequencies have short wavelengths\n\
    and require line-of-sight communication between the transmitter and receiver.\
    \ Another\ntechnology used in 5G networks is massive MIMO (multiple input, multiple\
    \ output)\ntechnology, which uses a large number of antennas to increase the number\
    \ of spatial\nstreams and improve the efﬁciency of the wireless channel. This\
    \ can help to increase the\ndata transfer rates and overall network capacity.\
    \ Beamforming is also a key technology used\nin 5G networks, as it uses advanced\
    \ techniques to focus the radio signal towards a speciﬁc\ndevice, increasing the\
    \ signal strength and reducing interference. This technology is crucial\nfor providing\
    \ reliable and high-speed connectivity in a dense and dynamic environment.\nNetwork\
    \ slicing is another feature of 5G networks that allows for the creation of dedicated\n\
    virtual networks to meet the speciﬁc requirements of different applications. This\
    \ means that\ndevices can allocated their own network resources and services,\
    \ providing better network\nperformance and security. Edge computing is also used\
    \ in 5G networks, which provides real-\ntime processing and analysis of data at\
    \ the edge of the network. This can help to reduce the\nlatency and improve the\
    \ performance of time-sensitive applications, such as autonomous\nvehicles and\
    \ virtual reality. Low latency is another feature of 5G networks that is important\n\
    for applications that require real-time communication and response, such as autonomous\n\
    vehicles and remote surgery. 5G networks aim to achieve a latency of less than\
    \ 1 millisecond.\nHigh reliability is also a critical feature of 5G networks,\
    \ with features such as network slicing\nand redundant network paths, ensuring\
    \ that devices stay connected. This is essential for\nmission-critical applications\
    \ that require high availability and low downtime. 5G networks\nsupport full duplex\
    \ communication, which allows for simultaneous transmission and\nreception of\
    \ data. This technology can help to improve the efﬁciency and capacity of the\n\
    network, enabling higher data transfer rates and reducing latency.\nBased on the\
    \ requirements above, the following are the 5G network deployment\nrequirements:\n\
    •\nMillimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies for higher bandwidth and faster data rates.\n\
    •\nMassive MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) technology for increasing spatial\n\
    streams and improving the wireless channel’s efﬁciency.\n•\nBeamforming to focus\
    \ the radio signal towards a speciﬁc device, increasing signal\nstrength and reducing\
    \ interference.\n•\nNetwork slicing for creating dedicated virtual networks to\
    \ meet the speciﬁc require-\nments of different applications, improving network\
    \ performance and security.\n•\nEdge computing for real-time processing and analysis\
    \ of data at the edge of the net-\nwork, reducing latency and improving the performance\
    \ of time-sensitive applications.\n•\nLow latency for real-time communication\
    \ and response, aiming to achieve a latency of\nless than 1 millisecond.\n•\n\
    High reliability for mission-critical applications, ensuring high availability\
    \ and low\ndowntime.\n•\nFull duplex communication for simultaneous transmission\
    \ and reception of data,\nimproving efﬁciency, capacity, and reducing latency.\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n12 of 41\nThe combination of these technologies in 5G\
    \ networks can enable a wide range of\napplications, from IoT services to high-bandwidth\
    \ applications, such as virtual reality and\naugmented reality. 5G networks aim\
    \ to provide the necessary performance metrics to\nsupport these applications,\
    \ enabling the growth of the IoT ecosystem and a new era of\nconnectivity.\nFigure\
    \ 6. 5G implementation requirements.\n3.2. Evolution of Wireless Networks\nWireless\
    \ networks [41] have an important role in our society, because they allow us to\n\
    keep connected in a network without cables, being the bridge to create useful\
    \ tools. For\ninstance, 3GPP provides basic data services such as voice and messaging\
    \ capabilities, with\n4G we can make video calls, and use IP services, and with\
    \ 5G we can get more beneﬁts,\nsuch as low latency, more bandwidth, and other\
    \ interesting features [42].\n3.3. Evolution of IoT\nThe evolution of the internet\
    \ allowed remote connections between machines, and\nthe protocol standardization\
    \ used to transmit the information, such as TCP/IP, enabled\nresearchers to take\
    \ advantage of the internet and allowed to creation of new protocols and\nways\
    \ to transmit the data [43]. Since then, new technologies has arrived in our lives,\
    \ which\nis the case of IoT. In the last few years, new technologies and protocols\
    \ arose to connect\nand transmit data between IoT devices and networks, each providing\
    \ speciﬁc features\nto perform the applications. In the following statements,\
    \ we mention some protocols to\ncommunicate data. Each protocol can provide better\
    \ communication depending on the\napplication. For example, LoRaWAN is used in\
    \ long-range communication, allowing to\ntransmit of data through large distances\
    \ even with obstacles between the link and using\nlow power consumption. Zigbee\
    \ is a protocol commonly used in smart homes, avoiding\ninferences by routers,\
    \ electronic devices, and so on.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n13 of 41\nThe evolution\
    \ of IoT technologies is having a signiﬁcant impact on 5G networks. As\nmore and\
    \ more devices are connected to the internet, there is a growing need for faster,\n\
    more reliable connectivity. This is where 5G networks come in, providing higher\
    \ speeds,\nlower latency, and greater capacity than previous wireless technologies.\
    \ The proliferation\nof IoT devices also creates new opportunities for 5G, as\
    \ the technology is able to support the\nmassive amounts of data generated by\
    \ these devices. However, this also poses challenges\nfor 5G networks, such as\
    \ the need to handle large amounts of trafﬁc from a variety of\ndevices with different\
    \ requirements. As a result, the evolution of IoT technologies is\ndriving innovation\
    \ in 5G networks, as providers look for ways to meet the demands of this\ngrowing\
    \ ecosystem.\nThe implementation of 5G networks is expected to have a signiﬁcant\
    \ impact on the\nevolution of IoT services. One of the most signiﬁcant changes\
    \ is the increase in the speed\nof data transfer. 5G networks have much faster\
    \ data transfer speeds, lower latency, and\nhigher capacity than previous generations\
    \ of mobile networks [44]. This means that IoT\ndevices can transmit and receive\
    \ data much more quickly, which enables more real-time\ndata processing and analysis.\
    \ The improved responsiveness of IoT services will open up\nopportunities for\
    \ new applications that require near-instantaneous data processing, such\nas remote\
    \ surgery, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.\nAnother important\
    \ change brought about by the implementation of 5G networks is\nthe increased\
    \ scalability of IoT services. 5G networks have a higher device density, which\n\
    means that they can support a greater number of IoT devices per unit area. This\
    \ will help\nto increase the scalability of IoT services and allow for the deployment\
    \ of more complex\nand sophisticated IoT solutions.\nFurthermore, 5G networks\
    \ are expected to improve the reliability of IoT services. 5G\nnetworks have more\
    \ robust error correction capabilities and redundancy features, which\ncan increase\
    \ the reliability of IoT services. This is particularly important for mission-critical\n\
    applications, such as remote monitoring of infrastructure or medical devices [45].\
    \ Improved\nreliability will also be beneﬁcial in industries that require highly\
    \ reliable communication\nnetworks, such as manufacturing and energy.\nThe enhanced\
    \ security features of 5G networks will also impact the evolution of IoT\nservices.\
    \ 5G networks offer improved security features, such as network slicing, which\n\
    allows for the creation of isolated virtual networks for different IoT applications.\
    \ This can\nhelp to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the security and privacy\
    \ of IoT data. With\nthe increasing number of IoT devices, the importance of security\
    \ and privacy is critical and\n5G networks can provide a more secure environment\
    \ for the data transmitted.\n5G networks will help to reduce the power consumption\
    \ of IoT devices. 5G networks\nare designed to be more energy efﬁcient than previous\
    \ generations of mobile networks [46].\nThis can help to reduce the power consumption\
    \ of IoT devices, prolonging their battery life\nand reducing their environmental\
    \ impact. This is particularly important for IoT devices\nthat are difﬁcult or\
    \ expensive to replace or recharge, such as sensors deployed in remote\nor inaccessible\
    \ locations. Figure 7 describes the main features related to 5G networks and\n\
    IoT services. The performance metrics associated with energy consumption are mentioned\n\
    here too.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n14 of 41\nFigure 7. Deﬁning 5G and features\
    \ that are essential for the Internet of Things services.\n3.4. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for IoT and Cloud-Based Solutions\nThis section covers various\
    \ wireless communication protocols used in IoT devices,\nincluding Wi-Fi AdHoc,\
    \ Zigbee, Z-Wave, LoRaWAN, and SigFox. It also touches on the\nuse of cloud computing\
    \ for IoT applications, such as data storage, analytics, and remote\ndevice management.\
    \ This section could provide a comprehensive overview of wireless\ncommunication\
    \ technologies used in IoT devices and their integration with cloud-based\nsolutions.\n\
    1.\nWi-Fi AdHoc: With the standard of IEEE 802.11, Wi-Fi technology turned into\
    \ the\nﬁrst technology to create devices connected to the network. Allowing to\
    \ create news\narchitectures such as Wi-Fi AdHoc is a decentralized type of wireless\
    \ network because\neach node participates in routing by forwarding data to other\
    \ nodes [47]. These nodes\ncan be IoT devices and are very helpful in applications\
    \ where it is needed to have\nmany devices connected.\n2.\nZigbee: The most popular\
    \ industry wireless mesh networking standard for connecting\nsensors, instrumentation,\
    \ and control systems. Zigbee implements communication in\na personal wireless\
    \ area network, providing low power consumption and interoper-\nating multi-vendor,\
    \ commonly used in home automation, low-power consumption\nsensors, HVAC (Heating,\
    \ Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control, etc. [48].\n3.\nZ-Wave: A wireless\
    \ protocol evolved by Zensys and conﬁrmed by the Z-Wave Alliance\nfor automation\
    \ apparatuses for home and commercial environments. This protocol\nallows transmitting\
    \ short messages with minimum noise and uses a Mesh network\nconﬁguration [49].\n\
    4.\nLoRaWAN: A low-power, wide-area networking protocol designed to connect battery\n\
    wirelessly operated ‘things’ to the internet in regional, national, or global\
    \ networks. It\ntargets IoT requirements, such as bi-directional communication,\
    \ end-to-end security,\nmobility, and localization services. According to work\
    \ cited in [50], LoRa has the most\nfeatures in terms of IoT, such as low power\
    \ consumption, long-range communication,\netc. Furthermore, the paper tested communication\
    \ in urban and forest areas, showing\nthat LoRaWAN can transmit data up to 2.1\
    \ km in urban areas.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n15 of 41\n5.\nSigFox: SigFox is\
    \ a network operator dedicated to the Internet of Things. The SigFox\nnetwork\
    \ uses the ultra-narrow band, allowing devices to communicate with low\npower\
    \ on a wide area [51].\n6.\nCloud Computing: Cloud computing is a term used to\
    \ describe both a platform and a\ntype of application. One of the essential features\
    \ of cloud computing is the capability\nto assign dynamic resources to the network,\
    \ being an important key to providing\nscalable solutions and avoiding high costs.\
    \ The interference plays an important\nrole when connecting devices since the\
    \ signal quality decrease, which means the\nmodulation decreases and the bits\
    \ per error increases. That is a problem if we are\ntrying to offer large bandwidths\
    \ and low latency in each data transmission [52]. We\nmust consider different\
    \ factors to provide a great QoS, like the weather, buildings,\nhardware, software\
    \ resources, etc. In the IoT context, the buildings and distances\ncreate the\
    \ main interferences. For that reason, technologies such as Zigbee, SigFox,\n\
    LoRaWAN, and Z-wave play a vital role in connecting devices.\n7.\nWiGig: WiGig,\
    \ also known as 802.11ay, is a wireless communication technology that\noperates\
    \ on the 60 GHz frequency band [53]. It was developed as an extension of the\n\
    Wi-Fi standard to provide high-speed, short-range wireless communication, primarily\n\
    for applications that require high bandwidth, such as virtual reality, high-deﬁnition\n\
    video streaming, and gaming. WiGig supports multi-gigabit data transfer rates,\
    \ with\ntheoretical speeds of up to 176 Gbps, which is much faster than the previous\
    \ Wi-\nFi standards [54]. It achieves this speed through the use of wider bandwidth\
    \ and\nadvanced modulation techniques, such as Quadrature Amplitude Modulation\
    \ (QAM)\nand Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Another notable\
    \ feature\nof WiGig is its low latency, making it ideal for applications that\
    \ require real-time\ndata transfer, such as gaming and virtual reality [55]. It\
    \ also supports multiple-input,\nmultiple-output technology, which enables multiple\
    \ antennas to transmit and receive\ndata simultaneously, improving the overall\
    \ performance and efﬁciency of the network.\nIn the context of 5G networks, WiGig\
    \ can be used as a complementary technology\nto provide high-speed local area\
    \ network (LAN) connections for mobile devices and\nIoT devices. The 60 GHz frequency\
    \ band has a limited range, but it can support high\ndata rates over short distances,\
    \ making it suitable for applications, such as augmented\nand virtual reality\
    \ (AR/VR), wireless HD video streaming, and cloud gaming [56]. In\naddition, WiGig\
    \ can be used as a backhaul technology for small cells in 5G networks,\nenabling\
    \ high-speed data transfers between small cells and the core network. This\ncan\
    \ help improve the performance and capacity of 5G networks, especially in densely\n\
    populated urban areas where there is high demand for data services. Regarding\
    \ IoT\nservices, WiGig can enable high-speed local area connections between IoT\
    \ devices,\nallowing them to share data quickly and efﬁciently. This can be especially\
    \ useful for\napplications, such as smart homes, where multiple IoT devices need\
    \ to communicate\nwith each other in real time.\n3.5. 5G Applications\n5G beneﬁts\
    \ are not utilized solely by the most prominent IT corporations world-\nwide.\
    \ In the modern era, we have found several exciting applications where 5G’s high\n\
    speeds, excellent reliability, and energy efﬁciency come into play and provide\
    \ a better\nuser experience.\n•\nEntertainment services: Video-on-demand services\
    \ are currently one of the most\nutilized services on the internet. These services\
    \ demand high-speed connections, and\nwith rising trends to utilize higher resolution\
    \ devices, 5G plays a vital role in providing\noptimal user experience so that\
    \ they can consume their content without interruption.\n•\nGeneral mobile networks:\
    \ Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in recent years, teleworking\nhas seen an immense\
    \ rise in all sectors globally. This means workers must be able\nto respond to\
    \ video or voice calls at any given time, requiring improved downlink\nand uplink\
    \ speeds. These requirements, complemented with the higher reliability\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3876\n16 of 41\naspects of 5G, mean that this implementation will\
    \ improve communications in any\ngiven context, especially for work-related tasks.\n\
    •\nInternet of Things: IoT is one of the trendiest topics around the electronics\
    \ ecosys-\ntem, due to its nature to provide automation to simple or very complex\
    \ topics. Even\nthough most IoT devices currently utilize 3G or 4G-LTE technologies\
    \ due to their low\nrequirements for data connectivity, a new generation of IoT\
    \ devices requires higher\nthroughput rates. These requirements are on the limits\
    \ of the current generation of\nwireless technologies, which makes 5G an interesting\
    \ contestant to solve these require-\nments. The most popular IoT applications\
    \ today involve Smart Homes, industries,\nor farming, which generally require\
    \ low amounts of wireless capabilities because\nthe devices have low microprocessing\
    \ power due to the nature of the technology\nitself. However, new trends, such\
    \ as Smart Cities or IoV (Internet of Vehicles), require\nmuch greater throughput\
    \ to function correctly and offer an optimal user experience.\nThese types of\
    \ solutions require capabilities that are only offered by 5G. IoT data\nare visioned\
    \ to increase in data provided per area by 1000 times [57] which means\nIoT applications\
    \ will be part of our everyday lives. The current data are provided\nmainly by\
    \ sensors, but more complex devices will mean that data will be gathered\nfrom\
    \ additional sources. This exponential growth in data consumption will also need\n\
    to be stored in scalable data storages, and this is where cloud computing comes\
    \ in.\nSome of the most famous architectural trends of IoT devices follow three\
    \ principles:\nHardware: All sensor nodes that gather data, their communication\
    \ methods, and the\nhardware interface with the user.\nMiddleware: The layer in\
    \ charge of storing and analyzing the data and monitoring\nthe devices.\nPresentation\
    \ layer: Commonly called the front end, this presents visualization tools\nbetter\
    \ to understand our devices’ current state and behavior.\n5G technologies can\
    \ impact the hardware and middleware layer. As the technology is\nmore energy\
    \ efﬁcient, the devices do not need massive antennas, which can lead to\nincreased\
    \ consumption. At the middleware layer, as devices can communicate more\ndata\
    \ in a given period, this layer will beneﬁt from extra data to improve any statistical\n\
    or machine learning model.\n3.6. 5G Technologies\nThe purpose of this section\
    \ is to describe some of the most popular technologies\nimplemented with 5G.\n\
    Figure 8 shows characteristics and technical speciﬁcations of 5G. 5G networks\
    \ offer\nseveral key characteristics and technical speciﬁcations that make them\
    \ ideal for a wide range\nof applications. 5G provides signiﬁcantly increased\
    \ bandwidth, enabling faster data transfer\nrates for high-speed applications,\
    \ such as virtual and augmented reality. It also offers lower\nlatency, making\
    \ it suitable for real-time communication and response applications, such\nas\
    \ autonomous vehicles and remote surgery. 5G is highly reliable, with features\
    \ such\nas network slicing and redundant network paths, ensuring devices stay\
    \ connected. 5G\nenables massive machine-type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable\
    \ and low-latency\ncommunication (URLLC), making it suitable for mission-critical\
    \ applications, such as\nindustrial automation. Additionally, 5G offers network\
    \ slicing, beamforming, and uses\nmillimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies for even\
    \ higher bandwidth and faster data rates.\nOverall, 5G networks offer signiﬁcant\
    \ improvements in bandwidth, latency, reliability, and\nﬂexibility, making them\
    \ well-suited for a wide range of applications.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n17 of\

    1.\nMassive MIMO: This technology is responsible for sending and receiving multiple\n\
    signals simultaneously, utilizing the same radio channel. While other technologies,\n\
    such as Wi-Fi or 4G-LTE, have utilized this technology, massive MIMO performs\
    \ best\nwhen paired with 5G technologies. This technology uses extra antennas\
    \ to move\nenergy into smaller regions of space, which means spectral efﬁciency\
    \ and coverage\nare improved [58].\n2.\nNOMA: Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access:\
    \ A radio access technology that plays a vital\nrole in 5G applications [59].\
    \ This technology offers several beneﬁts, such as low latency\nand massive high-speed\
    \ connectivity. Code domain NOMA is commonly paired with\nmMIMO, drastically improving\
    \ spectral efﬁciency [60]. Power domain NOMA is\ncommonly utilized with MIMO,\
    \ beamforming, and even cooperative communications,\nbeing one of the most ﬂexible\
    \ technologies utilized in 5G implementations.\n3.\nMillimeter Wave: This technology\
    \ uses a frequency band between 30 GHz and\n300 GHz and derives its name from\
    \ the 1 to 10 mm waves utilized by the tech-\nnology. Utilized commonly in radar\
    \ applications, this technology is being paired with\n5G to improve spectrum bandwidth\
    \ and increase spectrum utilizations. The main\nbeneﬁt of pairing this technology\
    \ with 5G is the spectrum freedom linked to mmWave.\nStandard technologies, such\
    \ as GPS, 4G, and satellite connections, utilize the 1 GHz\nto 6 GHz spectrum,\
    \ which is becoming very crowded [61]. Because mmWave is new\nand has a massive\
    \ spectral range, 5G provides an improved user experience through\nthis combination.\n\
    4.\nMachine Learning Techniques: Supervised and unsupervised models are being\
    \ im-\nplemented in 5G technologies to improve overall network capacities, predict\
    \ energy\nconsumption, and optimize tracking technologies such as beamforming.\
    \ In the su-\npervised category, some 5G networks utilize Linear Regression Algorithms\
    \ to predict\nthe scheduling of nodes [62]. Other supervised models utilize Deep\
    \ Neural Networks\nto predict beamforming vectors. Then, unsupervised learning\
    \ models are used to\nimprove handover selection and reduce interruption of services,\
    \ as well as they can\nreduce latency by clustering fog nodes.\n5.\nUnmanned Aerial\
    \ Vehicles (UAV): Being the most innovative proposal, current 5G\nresearchers\
    \ are utilizing UAVs to improve network coverage. These UAVs will assist\nthe\
    \ terrestrial network by serving as beacons. The high altitude of these planes\
    \ could\nsolve many interference problems and even replace entirely terrestrial\
    \ cellular net-\nworks [63]. UAVs, commonly known as drones, have become increasingly\
    \ popular for\nboth commercial and personal use. With the advent of 5G networks\
    \ and IoT, UAVs\ncan now be equipped with a wide range of sensors and devices\
    \ that can transmit\nreal-time data to ground stations for analysis and decision\
    \ making [64]. There are\nseveral potential implementations of UAVs in the context\
    \ of 5G and IoT. One such\nimplementation is in the area of precision agriculture.\
    \ UAVs can be used to gather data\non crop growth, soil conditions, and other\
    \ factors that affect agricultural production.\nThese data can be transmitted\
    \ in real time to a ground station for analysis and used\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n\
    18 of 41\nto optimize planting, fertilization, and irrigation schedules [65].\
    \ 5G networks and\nIoT sensors can provide the necessary bandwidth and low latency\
    \ for this type of\napplication. Another potential application of UAVs in the\
    \ context of 5G and IoT is\nin industrial inspection and maintenance. UAVs equipped\
    \ with cameras and other\nsensors can be used to inspect and monitor equipment\
    \ and infrastructure such as\npower lines and wind turbines. Real-time data transmission\
    \ via 5G networks can\nenable remote monitoring and control of these systems,\
    \ improving their reliability\nand reducing maintenance costs [66]. UAVs can also\
    \ be used for emergency response\nand disaster management. In the event of a natural\
    \ disaster, such as a hurricane or\nearthquake, UAVs can be deployed to assess\
    \ damage and provide real-time informa-\ntion to ﬁrst responders. The data collected\
    \ can be transmitted via 5G networks to\nemergency management centers for analysis\
    \ and decision making. UAVs can be used\nfor surveillance and security purposes.\
    \ In public safety applications, UAVs can be\nused to monitor crowd movements\
    \ and gather intelligence on potential threats. In\nprivate security applications,\
    \ UAVs can be used to patrol and monitor facilities for\nintruders or other security\
    \ threats. The combination of UAVs with 5G networks and\nIoT sensors can enable\
    \ a wide range of applications in various industries. With the\npotential to improve\
    \ efﬁciency, reduce costs, and enhance safety, it is likely that we\nwill see\
    \ an increase in the adoption of UAVs in the coming years.\n3.7. 5G Problems\n\
    5G offers excellent improvements over last-generation mobile communication tech-\n\
    nologies. However, many problems related to technological complications, security\
    \ and\nprivacy implications, and even social implications have been discovered.\n\
    Technical complications are related primarily to interference. 5G as a technology\
    \ has\ncomplications related to interference, being as sensible as being dramatically\
    \ affected by\nmild rain in urbanized areas [67]. Even though the technologies\
    \ mentioned previously\nhelp mitigate these problems, 5G still needs to be ready\
    \ to be used on a massive scale.\nTests performed in several countries utilizing\
    \ small cells show the need for more extensive\narchitectures to offer full coverage\
    \ and optimal user experience [68]. This means costly\narchitectures will lead\
    \ providers to focus mainly on urban areas, leaving rural areas unat-\ntended.\
    \ This leads to the following obstacles, which are ethical and social implications.\n\
    One of the main advantages of 5G is the ability to offer improved connections\
    \ to people\nin poor conditions. However, right now, it is only used as a marketing\
    \ stunt because 5G\narchitectures are considerably expensive and cannot offer\
    \ coverage in rural areas. As 5G\nequipment and technology become more widely\
    \ adopted in the following years, we expect\nbig strides in this department.\n\
    Another ethical and social implication is IoV technologies enabled by 5G. As we\
    \ see\nmore autonomous driving cars, and 5G will enable more precise driving for\
    \ these cars, as\nwell as broad adoption of them, we are encountering huge moral\
    \ dilemmas in cases where\ncar accidents are caused by autonomous vehicles. Security\
    \ implications arise from the trend\nof connecting vehicles to the internet, which\
    \ means people can be kidnapped remotely by\ntheir car if hackers gain control\
    \ of their vehicle via the web.\nThe main problems mentioned and explained above\
    \ are listed below:\n•\nTechnical complications related to interference, including\
    \ sensitivity to mild rain in\nurban areas.\n•\nNeed for extensive and costly\
    \ architectures to offer full coverage and optimal user\nexperience, which may\
    \ lead providers to focus mainly on urban areas, leaving rural\nareas unattended.\n\
    •\nEthical and social implications related to the inability to offer improved\
    \ connections\nto people in poor conditions due to the high cost of 5G architectures\
    \ and the lack of\ncoverage in rural areas.\n•\nSecurity implications arising\
    \ from the trend of connecting vehicles to the internet,\nwhich could result in\
    \ remote kidnappings by hackers.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n19 of 41\nTable 2 compares\
    \ the problems presented by 5G and IoT services across several key\nareas, namely\
    \ security, latency, interference, cost, and compatibility. In terms of security,\n\
    5G networks are vulnerable to a range of threats, such as DDoS attacks, identity\
    \ theft, and\nman-in-the-middle attacks, while IoT devices can suffer from security\
    \ breaches due to weak\nencryption, passwords, and outdated ﬁrmware. Regarding\
    \ latency, 5G networks have lower\nlatency, which can be a problem for certain\
    \ IoT applications that require real-time response,\nwhile IoT services may suffer\
    \ from latency due to network congestion, distance from the\nserver, and the number\
    \ of devices connected to the network. Interference is another factor\nthat can\
    \ affect both 5G and IoT services, with both being susceptible to interference\
    \ from\nother wireless devices and environmental factors. Cost is also a concern,\
    \ as the high cost of\n5G infrastructure and services may limit its usefulness\
    \ for many IoT applications, while IoT\nservices may also be expensive to deploy\
    \ and maintain, particularly if they require high\nbandwidth or specialized hardware.\
    \ Finally, compatibility is a potential issue for both 5G\nand IoT services, with\
    \ some IoT devices not being compatible with 5G networks, and IoT\nservices limited\
    \ by compatibility issues with proprietary hardware or software.\nTable 2. Comparison\
    \ of problems presented by 5G and IoT services\nProblem\n5G\nIoT Services\nSecurity\n\
    5G networks are vulnerable to various security threats,\nsuch as DDoS attacks,\
    \ identity theft, and\nman-in-the-middle attacks.\nIoT devices are susceptible\

    the number of devices connected to the network.\nInterference\n5G networks can\
    \ experience interference from other\nwireless devices, which can disrupt the\
    \ transmission of\ndata.\nIoT services may also suffer from interference due\n\
    to environmental factors, such as obstacles and\ninterference from other wireless\
    \ devices.\nCost\nThe cost of 5G infrastructure and services may be\nprohibitively\
    \ high for many IoT applications,\nparticularly those that require large-scale\
    \ deployment.\nIoT services may also be expensive to deploy and\nmaintain, particularly\
    \ if they require high\nbandwidth or specialized hardware.\nCompatibility\nSome\
    \ IoT devices may not be compatible with 5G\nnetworks, which can limit their usefulness\
    \ in certain\napplications.\nIoT services may also be limited by compatibility\n\
    issues, particularly if they rely on proprietary\nhardware or software.\n3.8.\
    \ Coexistence of 5G Networks and IoT Applications\nThe coexistence of 5G networks\
    \ and IoT applications has the potential to revolu-\ntionize several industries\
    \ by providing ultra-reliable and low-latency communication,\nmassive machine-type\
    \ communications, and network slicing for multiple services and\napplications\
    \ [18]. One novel idea is the use of 5G networks for industrial automation and\n\
    autonomous vehicles, where ultra-reliable and low-latency communication is critical\
    \ for\nensuring the safety and reliability of the system. Another innovative application\
    \ is the use\nof 5G networks for vehicle-to-everything communication, where autonomous\
    \ vehicles can\nexchange information with other vehicles and infrastructure to\
    \ improve trafﬁc management\nand safety [69]. The use of 5G networks for smart\
    \ cities and agriculture can also be highly\nbeneﬁcial, as it can enable massive\
    \ machine-type communication to support a large number\nof IoT devices, such as\
    \ sensors and actuators, and facilitate data collection, analysis, and\ndecision\
    \ making. Additionally, the use of network slicing can enable multiple services\
    \ and\napplications to coexist on the same infrastructure while maintaining their\
    \ unique require-\nments for security, reliability, and latency. However, the\
    \ coexistence of 5G networks and IoT\napplications also presents several challenges,\
    \ such as security, interference, compatibility,\nand cost [35]. For example,\
    \ security is critical for protecting IoT devices and networks from\ncyber attacks,\
    \ while interference from other wireless devices and environmental factors can\n\
    affect both 5G and IoT services. Moreover, compatibility issues can arise when\
    \ IoT devices\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n20 of 41\nare not compatible with 5G networks,\
    \ and the high cost of deploying and maintaining 5G\ninfrastructure and IoT services\
    \ can limit their widespread adoption. Overall, the coexis-\ntence of 5G networks\
    \ and IoT applications presents both opportunities and challenges and\nrequires\
    \ careful consideration of their technical requirements, security, and compatibility\
    \ to\nrealize their full potential.\nTable 3 provides a summary of the coexistence\
    \ of various 5G services and networks\nwith IoT applications. It highlights the\
    \ wireless technology, algorithms used, and coex-\nistence of services with 4G\
    \ and Wi-Fi. The table includes several 5G services, such as\n5G NR, 5G-V2X, 5G\

    \ Difﬁculties\nNowadays, with the development of new technologies, networks face\
    \ different chal-\nlenges. Issues such as coverage, latency, availability, and\
    \ accessibility, among others, appear.\nMoreover, taking into account a more profound\
    \ or more centralized point to the character-\nistics of the network, issues such\
    \ as latency, interference, spectrum use according to the\ntechnology being used,\
    \ and others appear.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n21 of 41\nInterference in 5G networks\
    \ can occur due to a variety of factors such as environmental\nconditions, radio\
    \ frequency congestion, and the deployment of too many access points\nin a limited\
    \ area. These issues can cause signal loss or degradation, resulting in poor\n\
    network performance and reduced data transfer rates. Interference in 5G networks\
    \ can\nhave a signiﬁcant impact on IoT devices that rely on a stable and reliable\
    \ connection to\noperate effectively.\nIoT devices are designed to transmit small\
    \ amounts of data over long periods, often\nusing low power and low bandwidth\
    \ networks. The interference in 5G networks can cause\ndelays or interruptions\
    \ in the transmission of data between IoT devices and the cloud-based\nsystems\
    \ they rely on. These disruptions can impact critical functions, such as real-time\n\
    monitoring of environmental conditions, trafﬁc management, and energy consumption.\
    \ In\naddition, interference in 5G networks can result in increased latency, which\
    \ can make it\ndifﬁcult for IoT devices to communicate with each other in a timely\
    \ manner.\nAnother critical aspect of interference in 5G networks is the potential\
    \ for security\nbreaches. As the number of connected devices increases, the risk\
    \ of cyber attacks also\ngrows. Interference in 5G networks can make it easier\
    \ for hackers to gain unauthorized\naccess to IoT devices and the data they transmit.\
    \ This can have serious consequences,\nparticularly for devices that are used\
    \ in critical infrastructure, such as healthcare systems,\npower grids, and transportation\
    \ networks.\nTo mitigate the impact of interference in 5G networks on IoT devices,\
    \ it is essential to\nensure that the network is properly conﬁgured and managed.\
    \ This includes deploying ac-\ncess points strategically to minimize congestion,\
    \ using directional antennas to focus signals\nand reduce interference, and implementing\
    \ security measures to prevent unauthorized\naccess. In addition, new technologies\
    \ such as edge computing and network slicing can help\nto reduce latency and improve\
    \ the reliability of IoT device communication.\nTable 4 outlines some of the main\
    \ types of interference that can impact 5G networks\nand the IoT. Interference\
    \ can occur due to a variety of factors, such as noise, multipath,\nco-channel\
    \ interference, interference from other devices or wireless networks, and jamming.\n\
    One of the key aspects of network performance that interference can affect is\
    \ coverage.\nInterference can reduce the coverage of a wireless network by increasing\
    \ the signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR) threshold required for reliable communication.\
    \ When there is noise,\nmultipath, or interference from other wireless networks\
    \ present, signals may not reach as\nfar or penetrate as deeply into buildings,\
    \ resulting in reduced overall coverage. Another\naspect that can be affected\
    \ by interference is latency. Interference can increase latency by\nintroducing\
    \ delays in signal transmission or reception. For instance, multipath interference\n\
    can cause signals to arrive at a receiver at slightly different times, leading\
    \ to signal distortion\nand increased latency. This delay can be particularly\
    \ problematic for real-time applications,\nsuch as gaming or video conferencing.\
    \ Interference can also impact the availability of a\nwireless network. When there\
    \ is co-channel interference or interference from other devices,\nit can cause\
    \ collisions or channel saturation, leading to reduced availability. This can\
    \ result\nin packet loss or connection drops, making it difﬁcult for users to\
    \ access the network and\nresulting in a poor user experience. Access to a wireless\
    \ network can also be affected by\ninterference. Interference can make it harder\
    \ for devices to connect to a network, leading\nto connection failures or reduced\
    \ bandwidth. This can be particularly problematic in\nareas with high device density,\
    \ such as urban environments. Interference can also affect\nmodulation and coding.\
    \ When there is interference present, the quality of the signal can\ndegrade,\
    \ making it more difﬁcult for the receiver to demodulate and decode the signal.\n\
    This can result in errors and reduce the overall throughput of the network.\n\

    \ of 5G is interference. It should be\nremembered that interference, by deﬁnition,\
    \ is when two electromagnetic waves overlap.\nThis overlapping causes communication\
    \ failures from where the wave is sent to where it is\nreceived. There are two\
    \ types of interference: constructive and destructive. Constructive\ninterference\
    \ occurs when the waves overlap or collide in phase, and this causes the resulting\n\
    wave to have a greater amplitude. Furthermore, destructive interference is when\
    \ there is\nan out-of-phase overlap, where the resultant of this wave will be\
    \ of lower amplitude [80].\nSome networks may be more susceptible to interference\
    \ depending on the type of wave\nthey handle, i.e., the frequency used in the\
    \ electromagnetic spectrum. RF can give this\ninterference, whereas in 5G networks,\
    \ millimeter bands and below 6 GHz bands are used.\nIn addition, it must be taken\
    \ into account that these interferences will continue to grow\nwith the development\
    \ of technology.\nFigure 9 covers various types of interference in wireless communication\
    \ systems in\n5G. Adjacent channel interference occurs when adjacent frequencies\
    \ or channels overlap\ndue to imperfections in ﬁlters or non-linearity in ampliﬁers.\
    \ Inter-cell interference happens\nwhen two users from neighboring cells try to\
    \ use the same frequency band simultaneously\ndue to resource limitation within\
    \ the network. Intra-channel and inter-channel interference\noccur due to physical\
    \ proximity of devices and low power within the macro-cell network,\nrespectively.\
    \ Inter-symbol interference results from signal distortion due to phase or\namplitude\
    \ dispersion in the channel. Inter-carrier occurs due to frequency offsets between\n\
    sub-carriers. Inter-numerology interference arises due to non-orthogonality in\
    \ the system,\ncausing difﬁculties for symbol alignment. Cross-link interference\
    \ occurs when signals\nare transmitted to neighboring cells in different directions\
    \ simultaneously. Inter-beam\ninterference happens due to the use of multi-beam\
    \ antenna systems, causing interference\nfrom adjacent beams. Multi-user interference\
    \ happens when several users try to transmit\ntheir information requests at the\
    \ same time, and MU-MIMO is used to increase the capacity\nand performance of\
    \ wireless broadcasting systems.\nWe must consider that with the evolution of\
    \ higher data rates, we are looking for\nthe implementation in a frequency spectrum\
    \ that is becoming more saturated daily. The\ndevelopment in these frequencies\
    \ makes the operator reuse the same frequencies for\nneighboring cells to save\
    \ spectrum. This development causes high interference between\ncells [81]. In\
    \ addition to these, other interferences also occur within the networks. The\n\
    classiﬁcation of these interferences is as follows:\n•\nAdjacent channel interference:\
    \ Adjacent channel interference is a problem that occurs\nin many devices and\
    \ many frequency ranges. This occurs when an adjacent frequency\nor the adjacent\
    \ channel of the one used by our device overlaps. This problem occurs\nin 5G,\
    \ as in other mobile technologies. This type of interference is mainly caused,\
    \ as\nstated in [82], by an imperfection in the ﬁlters, where they cannot ﬁlter\
    \ the desired\nsignal correctly. These imperfections result in nearby frequencies\
    \ passing into the\npassband. In turn, this occurs because the ampliﬁers are not\
    \ linear.\n•\nIntra-cell and inter-cell interference: Inter-cell interference\
    \ is one of the most signiﬁ-\ncant causes of network performance degradation.\
    \ This occurs when two users from\nneighboring cells attempt to use the same frequency\
    \ band simultaneously. This occurs,\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n23 of 41\nas said\
    \ in [83], because of resource limitation within the network, due to the frequency\n\
    reuse factor. In the same way, inter-cell interference is identiﬁed when a Base\
    \ Station\nconnects directly in the close range of another BS, and that is when\
    \ there is a simulta-\nneous transmission in that reuse. A distortion appears\
    \ by the interference that gives\nthe user and other equipment in the same cell.\n\
    •\nIntra-Channel and Inter-Channel interference: Inter-channel interference usually\
    \ oc-\ncurs when there is a low power within the macro-cell network. Then, when\
    \ communi-\ncating, the information is forwarded to the nearest base station.\
    \ When the transmission\nis made, it is completed through fast switching and restricts\
    \ delays and propagation\nlosses. However, this produces intra-channel interference\
    \ that affects the valuable\nsignal. On the other hand, inter-channel interference\
    \ occurs due to the physical prox-\nimity of the devices when two separate frequency\
    \ bands cause interference with each\nother. As these devices operate in close\
    \ range, the transmitter of a high-power signal\ninterferes with the receiver\
    \ of a weak signal. It is important to emphasize that 5G IoT\nnetworks or devices\
    \ with channels in the MHz range are susceptible to this type of\ninterference\
    \ due to the proximity and number of nearby devices. One way to mitigate\nthis\
    \ type of interference is through spatial modulation via MIMO [84].\n•\nInter-Symbol\
    \ Interference: Inter-symbol interference occurs when one or more symbols\ninterfere\
    \ with other symbols. It is caused by phase or amplitude dispersion in the\nchannel,\
    \ resulting in signal distortion. This can be seen in OFDMA, where multipath\n\
    propagation occurs. One study [85] exposed how this type of interference can be\n\
    an excellent challenge for network systems and should be sought to improve the\n\
    efﬁciency of the bandwidth while seeking alternatives in the modulation. This\
    \ is in\norder to counteract this type of interference.\n•\nInter-numerology interference:\
    \ Multiple numerology is a model to provide ﬂexibility\nfor devices in different\
    \ services. For these numerologies, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 kHz\nchannels are\
    \ used. They aim to improve performance and signiﬁcant bandwidth.\nAs stated in\
    \ [86], the authors introduce a non-orthogonality in the system, causing\ndifﬁculties\
    \ for symbol alignment in the time domain. When sampling at the same\nfrequency,\
    \ numerology tends to align differently, making synchronization within the\nframe\
    \ difﬁcult. This is known as interference between numerologies.\n•\nCross-Link\
    \ Interference: This interference occurs when signals are transmitted to\nneighboring\
    \ cells in different directions simultaneously, either in time frequency or\n\
    arbitrarily overlapping resources. As mentioned in [87], there are different types\
    \ of\ninterference and different ways in which it occurs. For example, the Base\
    \ Station\nreceives interference from user equipment devices in adjacent cells,\
    \ or a downlink\nuser equipment receives interference from a second database.\n\
    •\nInter Beam Interference: With the high demand for technological services, the\
    \ aim\nhas been to improve spectral efﬁciency and network performance. In trade-offs\
    \ for\nnetworks such as 5G, where the quality and capacity must be high, the solution\
    \ of\nincorporating a multi-beam antenna system such as mMIMO was sought, as explored\n\
    in detail in [88]. This technique identiﬁes the best route to providing optimal\
    \ perfor-\nmance to a user. This approach helps compensate for transmission attenuation\
    \ losses,\nespecially in millimeter-wave communication. In this case, the base\
    \ station generates\nmultiple narrow beams of mainly RF energy in all directions\
    \ of the coverage area. This\ncauses a spatial division of multiple beams, introducing\
    \ interference. Adjacent beams\ncause this interference from the same cell or\
    \ a neighboring cell.\n•\nMulti-user Interference: Multi-user interference is\
    \ due to the industry’s quest for\nhigher data rates in applications and the dramatic\
    \ increase in subscribers to wireless\ncommunications [89]. The techniques used\
    \ for this type of technology are given by MU-\nMIMO, a 5G generation technique\
    \ that helps increase the capacity and performance of\nwireless broadcasting systems.\
    \ Multi-user interference occurs when several users try\nto transmit their information\
    \ requests at the same time.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n24 of 41\nFigure 9. Main\
    \ concepts of interference in 5G.\n3.9.2. Interference in 5G\nThe different classiﬁcations\
    \ of interference have been explored. Now it is sought\nas part of the state of\
    \ the art to understand interference within 5G. The enrichment of\ninterference\
    \ in technologies such as Hetnets, IoT, D2D, Relay Node, and New Radio 5G\nwill\
    \ be sought.\n•\nInterference in Hetnets: Hetnets are 5G heterogeneous networks.\
    \ They aim to pro-\nvide wireless coverage for mobile subscribers and indoor and\
    \ outdoor applications.\nHetnets are multi-tier network systems that deploy small\
    \ cells in populated areas.\nThese cells are characterized by having a short range\
    \ and low power consumption.\nThis network comprises access points, which allow\
    \ high density, improvements in\nnetwork ﬂexibility, and so on [90]. Due to the\
    \ infrastructure and locations for deploy-\ning this type of network, they are\
    \ prone to different types of interference, such as\nintra-cell, inter-cell, and\
    \ adjacency channels. This type of problem is due to its poor\nsystematization\
    \ and organization in its network design. There are types of interference\nwithin\
    \ heterogeneous networks due to their infrastructure or grouping depending\non\
    \ the need to be met. The ﬁrst interference that appears is Co-tier interference.\
    \ This\ntype of interference appears mostly in femtocells, where there is much\
    \ demand for\nhigher data rates. This environment allows coverage, such as low-power\
    \ radio access\npoints, giving various services at home [91]. This type of interference\
    \ is observed\nwhen multiple users reside in the same network tier, where transmission\
    \ occurs over\nadjacent cells within the femtocell. Similar to co-tier, cross-tier\
    \ interference can appear.\nThe difference is that the co-tier is the inter-cell\
    \ interference, and the cross-tier is the\ninterference between the femtocell\
    \ and macro-cells, considering that the femtocell is\ninside the macro-cell [92].\
    \ Last but not least, in [93], channel control interference says\nthat one of\
    \ the most critical factors for channel control is the physical control format\n\
    indicator channel. This channel carries scheduling and synchronization information\n\
    for the uplink and downlink link data channels. As the transport is by physical\
    \ means,\nthis will induce interference.\n•\nInterference in D2D: With the introduction\
    \ of 5G, the best wireless systems have\nconstantly sought a solution that allows\
    \ the best quality of communication. Device-\nto-device networks are one of the\
    \ candidates to be the future of 5G networks. Direct\ncontact between two mobiles\
    \ increases efﬁciency in the spectrum. However, it always\nbrings some challenges,\
    \ in this case dealing with interference. As discussed in the\ndescription of\
    \ Hetnets above, these use a high connectivity capacity thanks to their\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 3876\n25 of 41\nstructure with macro-cell and femtocell. They allow\
    \ good performance [94]. With\nthe introduction of D2D, a cellular network is\
    \ sought that signiﬁcantly improves\nspectral efﬁciency and performance. However,\
    \ some challenges are the need for more\nsecurity that this type of technology\
    \ presents and interference. On the interference\nside, they appear related to\
    \ inter-cell interference. Furthermore, intra-cell may be\nrelated to adjacent\
    \ frequency. Furthermore, we must remember that there are types\nof interference\
    \ typical of D2D nodes, D2D-to-CU interference, and inter-D2D node\ninterference,\
    \ among others.\n•\nInterference in IoT and Smart Cities: We cannot limit our\
    \ minds to just one application\nwhen discussing the Internet of things. However,\
    \ everything from D2D devices and\nV2X to smart homes or buildings is part of\
    \ it. The conception of IoT with 5G has\nevolved in large and small ecosystems.\
    \ IoT in some applications is used over the\nunlicensed ISM band, which is used\
    \ for various physical devices to properly leverage\nthe spectrum to adhere to\
    \ the conditions and regulations of short radio communication.\nThe Internet of\
    \ Things has been seen as the other great leap in the evolution of the\nInternet.\
    \ With this in mind, developing smart cities will help create a more sustainable\n\
    and cost-efﬁcient ecosystem [95]. The combination of technologies such as 5G,\
    \ IoT,\nand others will enable big data, offering complex services to the community,\
    \ adding\nmembers in smart cities, and ensuring compatibility. However, it should\
    \ be noted\nthat interference must be characterized. When talking about smart\
    \ cities using Wi-Fi\nbecause of the use of the millimeter band, physical obstacles\
    \ such as walls are things\nto keep in mind, in addition to channel overlapping\
    \ and inter-carrier interference [96].\n3.9.3. Optimization Challenges in 5G Networks\n\
    5G is presented as a developed environment with an ecosystem where the boundaries\n\
    are complete cities. 5G technologies promise high-speed and low-latency data transmission\n\
    using the millimeter band. Although this frequency band allows these advantages,\
    \ it only\nallows short distances. By allowing such short distances, problems\
    \ such as interference\nbecome apparent. The optimization of this type of network\
    \ should always be used to\nget the best out of it. In 5G, techniques such as\
    \ MIMO and beamforming are used to\nreduce interference or signal degradation\
    \ [90]. It should be noted that optimizations for\n5G networks include different\
    \ architectures that are part of this type of network. These\narchitectures can\
    \ be divided into non-standalone and standalone.\nOptimizing these architectures,\
    \ depending on their niche, can be proﬁtable, as the\ncommunication varies. Communication\
    \ can be more accessible or restricted depending\non the architecture. At the\
    \ same time, different modulations can be obtained to enhance\ndata transmission,\
    \ transmission speed, and latency. In the same way, with 5G, most of the\narchitectures\
    \ allow the incorporation of MIMO. Thanks to beamforming management, it is\npossible\
    \ to optimize the use of frequencies for transmission so that some technologies\
    \ can\nsend information in the mmWaves range.\nFrom interference in the case of\
    \ NR, other interferences negatively affect the data\ntransmission in this architecture\
    \ due to the nature of this architecture. These are inter-\ncarrier interference\
    \ and phase interference. This is because it uses the mmWave frequency\nrange.\
    \ In turn, another interference that damages NR is numerology interference [97].\n\
    The evolution of mobile networks from 3G to 4G and now to 5G has signiﬁcantly\n\
    impacted the services and Internet of Things devices. Each new generation has\
    \ provided\nfaster data transfer speeds, increased bandwidth, and improved reliability,\
    \ enabling the\nemergence of new services and applications that were previously\
    \ not possible on mobile\ndevices. As 5G networks become more widely adopted,\
    \ they will continue to unlock new\nopportunities for innovation, transforming\
    \ the way we interact with our devices and the\nworld around us.\nTable 5 shows\
    \ the impact of each mobile generation starting with 3G and explains the\nimpact\
    \ in an IoT context.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n26 of 41\nTable 5. Mobile generations\
    \ and IoT.\nYear\nTechnology\nImpact in IoT\n2000\n3G allows devices to\nconnect\
    \ to the internet since\n3G enables mobile and\nwireless internet\nconnections.\n\
    With internet connections, electronic\ndevices start transmitting data through\n\
    the internet, the ﬁrst step to developing\nIoT devices.\n2008\n4G enables cloud\n\
    computing technology and\ntransmits information with\nthe IP protocol. In addition,\n\
    4G increased the bandwidth\nof each transmission.\nThe data transmission through\
    \ IP protocol\nenables an easy communication method with\nelectronic devices.\
    \ The cloud enables a way to\ndevelop more affordable solutions.\nFurthermore,\
    \ the internet connection cost\ndecreases because 4G delivers a cheap way to\n\
    transmit data as IP protocols manage the data\nmore efﬁciently. This generation\
    \ is the most\nimportant in an IoT context because the\nindustry has all the resources\
    \ to connect\ndevices to the cloud.\n2019\nWith 5G, an essential\nfeature is the\
    \ beam width,\nan important key in the IoT\ncontext.\nIf we have more bandwidth,\
    \ we can provide\nbetter solutions, such as real-time monitoring\nsystems. In\
    \ our society, these solutions are\nvital if we want to automate processes. For\n\
    this reason, 5G plays an essential role in the\nIoT context because the industry\
    \ is trying to\nautomate all its processes.\nNew technologies and recent research\
    \ about wireless communication have created\nnew ways to transmit and receive\
    \ data. With the evolution of technology such as 5G, new\nfeatures arrived to\
    \ provide/perform the ways to send and receive data. IoT has shown\nmore beneﬁts,\
    \ helping with other technologies such as machine learning, cloud computing,\n\
    and others. Since the data can be processed, each device forms a swarm intelligence\
    \ that\nallows automatization and avoids wasting resources in the industry.\n\
    Another factor in analyzing is the interference with the channels, since our houses,\n\
    ofﬁces, and even natural places have electronic devices that typically use the\
    \ 2.4 GHz band,\nwhich causes interference in this band. Therefore, 5G incorporates\
    \ new bands to avoid\nthe interference caused by this massive consumption of 2.4\
    \ GHz. We need to compare\nthe features of 3G, 4G, and 5G to understand why 5G\
    \ is an essential key in smart cities.\nThe main technical characteristics of\
    \ these three generations of technologies can be seen in\nTable 6.\nTable 6. Important\

    \ for the use of 5G technology in the IoT. The ﬁrst\nfeature mentioned is bandwidth.\
    \ Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that can be\ntransmitted over a network\
    \ or a communication channel in a given amount of time. In\nthe context of 5G,\
    \ higher bandwidth means that more data can be transmitted over the\nairwaves\
    \ in a shorter period of time, which can result in faster and more reliable 5G\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n27 of 41\ntransmissions. Another feature highlighted is\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, which can analyze\nall the data generated by the IoT\
    \ devices to take accurate decisions. With the use of AI,\nIoT devices can identify\
    \ patterns, make predictions, and take actions based on the data\ngathered. This\
    \ feature is essential to support IoT applications that require real-time decision\n\
    making, such as smart cities and intelligent transportation systems. The third\
    \ feature is\nreal-time monitoring and management, which means the capability\
    \ to monitor and manage\nelectronic devices. This feature allows IoT devices to\
    \ be monitored and managed from a\ncentral location, which can be very useful\
    \ for large-scale applications, such as industrial\nautomation or smart grid management.\
    \ Swarm intelligence is another feature mentioned,\nwhich means that each IoT\
    \ device can be a node and work with other nodes to create a\nswarm intelligence.\
    \ This feature enables IoT devices to work collaboratively and efﬁciently,\nproviding\
    \ better performance and reliability in complex applications. Quality of service\n\
    (QoS) is also listed as a signiﬁcant feature that 5G can provide in IoT connections.\
    \ With\n5G, IoT devices can experience better connectivity, lower latency, and\
    \ higher throughput,\nwhich can improve the overall QoS and performance of IoT\
    \ applications. In the context\nof IoT connections, QoS refers to the ability\
    \ of the network to provide reliable and high-\nperformance connectivity to IoT\
    \ devices. 5G is a promising technology for IoT connections,\nas it can provide\
    \ several features that can improve the overall QoS and performance of IoT\napplications.\
    \ 5G is designed to provide a signiﬁcantly improved QoS compared to previous\n\
    generations of mobile networks. This is achieved through a combination of advanced\n\
    technologies and features that are built into the 5G standard. One of the key\
    \ features of\n5G that can contribute to a better QoS is the use of advanced radio\
    \ access technologies.\nThese technologies, such as massive MIMO and beamforming,\
    \ allow for more efﬁcient\nuse of the radio spectrum and better signal quality.\
    \ This means that 5G can provide better\nconnectivity and signal strength, which\
    \ can improve the reliability and availability of the\nnetwork. Another important\
    \ feature of 5G that can contribute to a better QoS is the use of\nnetwork slicing.\
    \ Network slicing allows the network to be divided into multiple virtual\nnetworks,\
    \ each tailored to speciﬁc use cases and requirements. This means that different\n\
    applications and services can be given different levels of priority, bandwidth,\
    \ and latency\nrequirements, depending on their needs. This can improve the QoS\
    \ for each individual\napplication and user. In addition, 5G can provide lower\
    \ latency, higher throughput, and\nbetter support for massive IoT deployments,\
    \ all of which can contribute to a better QoS.\nLower latency means that there\
    \ is less delay between the transmission of data and its\nreception, which can\
    \ enable real-time communication and faster response times. Higher\nthroughput\
    \ means that more data can be transmitted over the network in a given time,\n\
    which can improve the performance of applications that require high-bandwidth\
    \ data\ntransfer. Finally, better support for massive IoT deployments means that\
    \ the network can\nhandle a large number of connected devices and data trafﬁc,\
    \ without compromising the\nQoS for individual devices or applications.\nLow latency\
    \ is another feature that 5G can offer, reducing the delay between data\ntransmission\
    \ and reception. This feature is particularly important for applications that\n\
    require immediate decision making, such as autonomous vehicles or remote surgery.\
    \ Cloud\ncomputing is mentioned as a feature that 5G can provide in IoT connections.\
    \ With 5G, IoT\ndevices can connect to the cloud more efﬁciently, and each device\
    \ can use all the resources\nof the cloud, such as storage and processing power.\
    \ This feature can signiﬁcantly improve\nthe performance and scalability of IoT\
    \ applications, especially those that require large\namounts of data processing\
    \ and storage.\nLow latency is particularly important for applications that require\
    \ immediate decision\nmaking, such as autonomous vehicles or remote surgery. With\
    \ 5G, the latency can be\nreduced to as low as one millisecond, which can enable\
    \ real-time communication and\nfaster response times. Furthermore, 5G can provide\
    \ higher throughput, which refers to\nthe amount of data that can be transmitted\
    \ over a network in a given time. With higher\nthroughput, IoT devices can transmit\
    \ and receive larger amounts of data, which can\nimprove the performance of IoT\
    \ applications that require high-bandwidth data transfer,\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n\
    28 of 41\nsuch as video streaming or real-time sensor data. Cloud computing is\
    \ another feature\nthat 5G can offer for IoT connections. With 5G, IoT devices\
    \ can connect to the cloud more\nefﬁciently, and each device can use all the resources\
    \ of the cloud, such as storage and\nprocessing power. This feature can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the performance and scalability of\nIoT applications, especially those\
    \ that require large amounts of data processing and storage.\nTable 7. Expectation\
    \ for 5G in IoT.\nFeature\nDescription\nBandwidth\nMore bandwidth to supply applications\
    \ with\nhigh speed.\nAI\nArtiﬁcial intelligence can analyze all the data\ngenerated\
    \ by the IoT devices to take accurate\ndecisions.\nReal-time monitoring and\n\
    management\nThe capability to monitor and manage electronic\ndevices remotely.\n\
    Swarm intelligence\nEach IoT device can be a node, and working with\nother nodes,\
    \ can work as a swarm intelligence.\nQoS\n5G can provide a better QoS in IoT connections.\n\
    Low Latency\n5G reduces the latency, which means that the IoT\ndevices can take\
    \ immediate decisions.\nCloud computing\n5G can provide better connections to\
    \ the cloud,\nwhich means each IoT device can use all the\nresources of the cloud.\n\
    Since smart cities use IoT devices to provide a solution in our daily routine,\
    \ 5G is\nessential in providing a more stable, scalable, and accurate solution,\
    \ with help from other\ntechnologies, such as cloud computing, machine learning,\
    \ and so on. In other words, 5G is\nkey in smart cities because this generation\
    \ optimizes how to transmit and receive data and\nperforms the way to obtain data.\
    \ Based on these data, electronic devices can make accurate\ndecisions after processing.\n\
    Table 8 was divided into parts, in which the ﬁrst part deals exclusively with\
    \ the\ndescription and impact on 5G, and the second part describes cases and ways\
    \ to prevent\nthis interference.\nTable 8. Technologies for the elderly\nInterference\n\
    Description\n5G Impact\nAdjacent Channel\nInterference\nThis occurs when the frequency\
    \ channel of\nour device is overlapped.\nIf we do not have good bandpass ﬁlters,\
    \ there\nwill be interference from nearby frequencies. In\n5G devices, this can\

    \ interference occurs when two\nusers in neighboring cells attempt to use\nthe\
    \ same frequency simultaneously.\nIntra-cell interference occurs when there is\n\
    a simultaneous short-range transmission\nby two BSs, with distortion from the\
    \ user\nand the other equipment in the same cell.\nThis type of interference can\
    \ severely damage 5G\nnetworks because for bases or architectures\nwhere there\
    \ are micro- or macro-cells, the power\nof neighboring signals in both uplink\
    \ and\ndownlink transmission by multiple users can\ninterfere with each other\

    5G Impact\nIntra-Channel and\nInter-Channel\ninterference\nIntra-channel interference\
    \ occurs when\nthere is little power within the macro\nnetwork cell.\nInter-channel\
    \ interference occurs due to the\nproximity of devices when two separate\nfrequencies\
    \ cause interference. As they operate\nat short range, the transmitter of a high-power\n\
    signal causes interference; interference can also\nbe due to the exploration of\
    \ hetnets with OFDM.\nThere are ICI reduction solutions with reverse\nfrequency\
    \ allocation (RFA) employed, which is a\nproactive interference.\nInter-Symbol\n\
    interference\nThis type of interference occurs when one\nor more symbols interfere\
    \ with other\nsymbols.\nIt is caused by phase or amplitude dispersion of\nthe\
    \ channel, which results in signal distortion.\nThis can be clearly seen in OFDMA,\
    \ which\ncauses multipath propagation and impacts\nbandwidth efﬁciency.\nInter-Numerology\n\
    interference\nOccurs when using the numerology system\nfor greater ﬂexibility\
    \ and does not allow\nthe alignment in the time domain to be\nperfect. These misalignments\
    \ or\nimperfections are known as\ninter-numerology interference.\nIn the search\
    \ for higher performance and\nsigniﬁcant bandwidth, using numerology, can\ncause\
    \ interference by having networks with\nmany devices sending signiﬁcant amounts\
    \ of\ninformation, which makes this type of\ninterference more pronounced, affecting\
    \ the\nnetwork’s performance.\nCross-Link\nInterference\nThis type of interference\
    \ occurs when a\ntransmission is made to a neighboring cell\nin different directions\
    \ simultaneously,\neither by arbitrarily overlapping resources\nor by time frequency.\n\
    Cross-link interference can affect 5G networks\ndue to the amount of BS required,\
    \ since incorrect\nhopping can cause performance failures.\nInter-Beam\ninterference\
    \ [99]\nThis occurs when using MIMO technology,\nas this type of array sends RF\
    \ energy in all\ndirections, with the spatial division of the\nmultiple beams\
    \ causing interference.\nAdjacent beams cause this either by the\nsame cell or\
    \ by neighboring cells.\nIt causes interference in applications where\nMIMO antenna\
    \ technology is introduced due to\nthe same usage. When looking for better spectral\n\
    efﬁciency and improvements in network\nperformance, interference from adjacent\
    \ beams\nwithin the same cell or multiple MIMO arrays\nmay negatively inﬂuence\
    \ their neighbors.\nMulti-User\ninterference [100]\nThis occurs when, in MU-MIMO,\
    \ multiple\nusers try to transmit information\nsimultaneously.\nConsidering that\
    \ in 5G, performance and\ninformation forwarding improvements are\nsought, when\
    \ switching to MU-MIMO,\nuncoordinated cells encounter more signiﬁcant\nproblems\
    \ during user management.\nAdjacent Channel\nInterference\nThis occurs when the\
    \ frequency channel of\nthe device is overlapped.\nIf we do not have good bandpass\
    \ ﬁlters, there\nwill be interference from nearby frequencies. In\n5G devices,\
    \ this can have a signiﬁcant impact.\nIt is pertinent to consider how this type\
    \ of interference can affect or impact 5G networks\ntoday, since it must be kept\
    \ in mind with the explosive development of technology. In turn,\nthis can affect\
    \ different 5G architectures, since the main objectives of these networks are\
    \ to\nimprove things such as latency, throughput, transmission speeds, etc.\n\

    in neighboring cells attempt to use the same frequency simultaneously or when\
    \ there is a\nsimultaneous short-range transmission by two base stations in the\
    \ same cell. This type of\ninterference can severely damage 5G networks, particularly\
    \ in architectures where there\nare micro- or macro-cells. Intra-channel and inter-channel\
    \ interference occurs when there\nis little power within the macro network cell,\
    \ though inter-channel interference can also\noccur due to the proximity of devices\
    \ operating at different frequencies. Inter-Symbol inter-\nference occurs when\
    \ one or more symbols interfere with other symbols, resulting in signal\ndistortion\
    \ due to phase or amplitude dispersion of the channel. Inter-Carrier interference\n\
    occurs when the signal is lost due to an offset between the subcarriers, leading\
    \ to large-scale\nor small-scale fading and variations in the received signal.\
    \ Inter-Numerology interference\noccurs when using the numerology system for greater\

    \ interference. Cross-Link Interference occurs\nwhen a transmission is made to\
    \ a neighboring cell in different directions simultaneously,\nleading to performance\
    \ failures. Inter-Beam interference occurs when using MIMO tech-\nnology, with\
    \ the spatial division of the multiple beams causing interference from adjacent\n\
    beams either by the same cell or by neighboring cells. Finally, Multi-User interference\n\
    occurs when multiple users try to transmit information simultaneously, leading\

    \ networks has gained signiﬁcant attention due\nto its potential to revolutionize\
    \ the communication industry. One of the areas where 5G\nnetworks are expected\
    \ to have a substantial impact is the IoT services. This literature\nreview article\
    \ aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of 5G networks on IoT\nservices,\
    \ speciﬁcally examining the issue of interference in this type of network and\
    \ its\nrelated technologies.\nAs a result of new technologies in mobile communications,\
    \ 5G can provide a solution\nin a smart city context. Each IoT device can consume\
    \ a reduced bandwidth, but the problem\narises when the number of IoT devices\
    \ increases. For this reason, it is essential to provide\nhigh beam width for\
    \ better communication between IoT devices.\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n31 of 41\n\
    The emergence of 5G networks and Internet of Things services has brought about\n\
    a new era of connectivity and transformation to various industries. With the increasing\n\
    number of connected devices, there is a need for a network that can handle the\
    \ massive\ndata transfer, low latency, and high-speed communication required by\
    \ IoT devices. The\nconvergence of 5G networks and IoT services is expected to\
    \ revolutionize the way devices\ncommunicate with each other and the internet.\
    \ In this section, we will critically discuss the\nrelated impact of network and\
    \ service convergence between 5G networks and IoT services.\nOne of the main beneﬁts\
    \ of the convergence of 5G networks and IoT services is the\nability to support\
    \ massive machine-to-machine communication. The integration of 5G\nnetworks with\
    \ IoT devices creates a seamless connection, allowing devices to communicate\n\
    with each other and the internet at high speeds and low latency. This has signiﬁcant\n\
    implications for industries such as healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing,\
    \ where\nlarge volumes of data need to be transmitted in real time to enable efﬁcient\
    \ operations. For\ninstance, connected cars, trains, and airplanes can communicate\
    \ with each other and other\nconnected devices in real time, leading to improved\
    \ safety and efﬁciency.\nAnother impact of the convergence of 5G networks and\
    \ IoT services is the creation\nof new business models and revenue streams. With\
    \ the increased speed and capacity of\n5G networks, service providers can offer\
    \ new IoT services such as smart homes, smart\ncities, and smart factories. This\
    \ creates an opportunity for service providers to develop new\nbusiness models\
    \ and revenue streams, such as selling data insights, providing managed\nservices,\
    \ and offering customized solutions. For example, telecom operators can offer\n\
    IoT connectivity as a service, which provides businesses with a cost-effective\
    \ and scalable\nmethod to connect and manage their IoT devices.\nHowever, the\
    \ convergence of 5G networks and IoT services also presents some chal-\nlenges\
    \ that need to be addressed. One of the challenges is the issue of security and\
    \ privacy.\nAs the number of connected devices grows, the potential for cyberattacks\
    \ and data breaches\nalso increases. Therefore, service providers and device manufacturers\
    \ need to work to-\ngether to ensure that IoT devices are secure and comply with\
    \ data protection regulations.\nAdditionally, the convergence of 5G networks and\
    \ IoT services requires signiﬁcant invest-\nments in infrastructure and technology.\
    \ Service providers need to deploy a massive number\nof 5G base stations to enable\
    \ reliable and consistent connectivity for IoT devices.\nThe convergence of 5G\
    \ networks and IoT services has the potential to revolutionize the\nway devices\
    \ communicate with each other and the internet. It has signiﬁcant implications\n\
    for industries such as healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing, creating\
    \ new business\nmodels and revenue streams. However, it also presents challenges\
    \ such as security and\nprivacy concerns and the need for signiﬁcant investments\
    \ in infrastructure and technology.\nTherefore, service providers and device manufacturers\
    \ need to work together to address\nthese challenges and ensure that the convergence\
    \ of 5G networks and IoT services leads to\na safer, more efﬁcient, and connected\
    \ world.\nTable 10 discusses the potential positive and negative impacts of integrating\
    \ 5G\ntechnologies with IoT solutions. The table is divided into three columns,\
    \ including Category,\nContext, and Explanation.\nThe ﬁrst category mentioned\
    \ in the table is Positive, which includes three different\ncontexts. The ﬁrst\
    \ context is Cost Optimization, which refers to the potential cost savings\nassociated\
    \ with integrating 5G technologies with IoT solutions. With the help of data\n\
    gathered by devices, businesses and organizations can optimize their processes,\
    \ leading to\nmore cost-effective solutions. Additionally, data-driven decision\
    \ making allows private\nor public entities to make better decisions. For instance,\
    \ a city can use IoT solutions to\noptimize trafﬁc ﬂow, leading to reduced fuel\
    \ consumption and fewer trafﬁc jams.\nThe second context mentioned in the Positive\
    \ category is Improving QoS, which refers\nto the potential improvement in the\
    \ quality of life for citizens. By providing relevant\ninformation and real-time\
    \ control over public infrastructure, cities can positively impact\ncitizens’\
    \ lives. For example, using IoT solutions, a city can improve security by monitoring\n\
    Sensors 2023, 23, 3876\n32 of 41\npublic spaces and providing real-time alerts\
    \ in case of emergencies. Additionally, cities can\ncreate new economic development\
    \ opportunities fueled by the digitalization era.\nThe third context mentioned\
    \ in the Positive category is Reducing climate change. By\nimplementing IoT solutions\
    \ with 5G technologies, businesses can have closer control over\nindustrial processes\
    \ and real-time analytics regarding relevant environmental properties.\nThis can\
    \ be the next step in becoming a more environmentally friendly society.\nMoving\
    \ onto the Negative category, the table mentions two different contexts. The\n\
    ﬁrst context is Digital Non-Inclusion, which refers to the potential negative\
    \ impact of IoT\nsolutions on regions with less access to technological services,\
    \ while 5G and IoT efforts\ncan improve the quality of life of those cities that\
    \ can afford it, they currently do not offer\ncost-effective solutions for regions\
    \ with less access to technological services.\nThe second context mentioned in\
    \ the Negative category is privacy compromises.\nHaving real-time information\
    \ on assets, people, and any living or non-living organism\nin a region can seriously\
    \ threaten privacy violations. Political or social movements can\nnegatively use\
    \ sensible data related to citizens to perform any action.\nTable 10. Explanation\

    \ for data-driven decision making, allowing\nprivate or public entities to make\
    \ better decisions.\nPositive\nImproving\nQoS\nBy providing relevant information\
    \ and real-time\ncontrol over public infrastructure, citizens will be\npositively\
    \ impacted by reduced trafﬁc, improved\nsecurity, and new economic development\n\

    Negative\nDigital\nNon-Inclusion\nWhile 5G and IoT efforts can improve the quality\
    \ of\nlife of those cities that can afford it, they currently do\nnot offer cost-effective\

    citizens to perform any action.\nFigure 10 discusses the main challenges on 5G\
    \ networks. One of the main challenges\nof 5G networks related to interference,\
    \ IoT devices, and network optimization is the high\ndemand for wireless connectivity\
    \ and data transmission. With the increasing number of\nIoT devices and the exponential\
    \ growth of data usage, 5G networks must be optimized\nto handle the massive amount\
    \ of data transmission while minimizing interference. The\ndeployment of small\
    \ cells and heterogeneous networks is one strategy to increase net-\nwork capacity\
    \ and reduce interference. However, the complexity of network planning,\ndeployment,\
    \ and management increases with the deployment of small cells, which requires\n\
    sophisticated optimization techniques. Additionally, the development of 5G IoT\
    \ devices\nSensors 2023, 23, 3876\n33 of 41\nwith limited power and processing\
    \ capabilities also presents a challenge. The design of\nlow-power wireless communication\
    \ protocols and efﬁcient resource allocation techniques\nis necessary to optimize\
    \ the performance of IoT devices in 5G networks. 5G networks’\nchallenges related\
    \ to interference, IoT devices, and network optimization require advanced\nsolutions\
    \ and innovative technologies to ensure high-quality wireless connectivity and\n\
    meet the demands of the growing digital ecosystem.\nFigure 10. Challenges of 5G\
    \ networks.\nTable 11 is a representation of the future research challenges in\
    \ 5G that are directly\nrelated to IoT services. It is a ﬁve-column table with\
    \ the following labels for each column:\nFeatures, Advantages, Research Challenges,\
    \ Key Requirements, and Interoperability. The\nFeatures column lists the main\
    \ features that are relevant for IoT services in 5G. In this table,\nthe features\
    \ are IoT Services, Edge Computing, 5G Radio Access, and Network Slicing. The\n\
    Advantages column lists the advantages that 5G can provide to IoT services, for\
    \ example,\nenabling new use cases, reducing latency, providing high data rates,\
    \ and providing cus-\ntomizable networks. The Research Challenges column lists\
    \ the key research challenges that\nneed to be addressed in order to fully realize\
    \ the potential of 5G for IoT services, for exam-\nple, network slicing, security,\
    \ scalability, resource allocation, and spectrum management.\nThe Key Requirements\
    \ column lists the key technical requirements that need to be met in\norder to\
    \ address the research challenges, for example, low latency, high reliability,\
    \ energy\nefﬁciency, and service level agreements. The Interoperability column\
    \ lists the key interoper-\nability issues that need to be addressed in order\
    \ to ensure that different 5G networks and\nIoT devices can work together seamlessly,\
    \ for example, standardization, integration with\nexisting systems, compatibility\
    \ with different technologies, and interoperability between\nnetwork slices.\n\
    Interference can have a signiﬁcant impact on 5G networks, particularly in the\
    \ context\nof Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The large number of IoT devices\
    \ that will be connected\nto 5G networks will inevitably lead to increased interference,\
    \ which can result in degraded\nnetwork performance and poor user experience.\n\
    One of the critical responses to interference in 5G networks is to employ advanced\n\
    signal processing techniques to mitigate the effects of interference. For example,\
    \ beam-\nforming and advanced receiver algorithms can help to reduce interference\
    \ on 5G networks.\nAdditionally, the use of multi-antenna systems and smart antennas\
    \ can improve the quality\nof the received signal and reduce interference.\nAnother\
    \ critical response is to implement interference management protocols that\nenable\
    \ the efﬁcient use of available radio resources. These protocols can help to coordinate\n\
    the use of different channels, reduce interference between neighboring cells,\
    \ and optimize\nthe use of spectrum resources.\nFor instance, the use of small\
    \ cell networks can help to reduce interference by reduc-\ning the distance between\
    \ the transmitter and receiver. In addition, the use of frequency\nSensors 2023,\
    \ 23, 3876\n34 of 41\nreuse techniques, such as fractional frequency reuse, can\
    \ help to mitigate the impact of\ninterference in multi-cell networks.\nTable\

    \ an essential step\ntowards achieving new business opportunities and improving\
    \ connectivity worldwide.\nThe ecosystem of IoT devices is complex, and choosing\
    \ the right primary or complementary\nconnectivity option depends on factors such\
    \ as deployment costs, range, interference,\nand capabilities. Technical studies\
    \ have shown that 5G and other services can coexist in\nspeciﬁc frequency bands,\
    \ provided that the technical conditions are adequately adapted.\nCompliance with\
    \ the permitted exposure limits is also essential when designing new\napplications\
    \ or technological accessories using 5G and IoT.\nThe convergence of networks\
    \ and services, driven by 5G technology, is transforming\nthe internet into a\
    \ complex and multifaceted ecosystem integrated into nearly every aspect\nof our\
    \ daily lives. The availability and speed of access to the internet are increasing,\n\
    allowing users to access high-quality media content in real-time and internet\
    \ service\nproviders to offer a range of new services and applications. Cellular\
    \ connectivity will\nenable the achievement of key IoT goals, such as reducing\
    \ device complexity and cost,\nincreasing coverage to support remote applications,\
    \ and providing deployment ﬂexibility,\nhigh capacity, and long battery life.\n\
    Businesses can beneﬁt greatly from the optimization of network performance in\
    \ 5G\nnetworks, which is essential for adequately functioning business processes,\
    \ improving\nproductivity, reducing downtime, and enhancing customer satisfaction.\
    \ The potential of the\nconvergence of networks and services in increasing the\
    \ availability and speed of access to\nthe internet enables a range of new and\
    \ innovative applications and services, transforming\nthe way we live and work.\n\
    Managing interference in 5G networks is a signiﬁcant challenge in ensuring the\
    \ reli-\nability and performance of IoT services. Effective interference management\

    1\nINTRODUCTION\nA recent Computing Community Consortium (CCC) visioning activ-\n\
    ity defined spatial computing as a unifying field that “encompasses\nthe ideas,\
    \ solutions, tools, technologies, and systems that transform\nour lives by creating\
    \ a new understanding of locations – how we\nknow, communicate, and visualize\
    \ our relationship to locations and\nhow we navigate through them.” [9]. Advances\
    \ in sensor technolo-\ngies have greatly facilitated collection and archival of\
    \ big spatial and\ntemporal data, that lead to the centralized processing. Planet\
    \ Labs is\ncollecting about 9 PB/year and DigitalGlobe (Maxar) is collecting 36\n\
    PB/year of remote sensing data alone. In a recent study, IDC [4] pre-\ndicted\
    \ that the global data will grow from 33 Zettabytes in 2018 to\n175 Zettabytes\
    \ in 2025. Using commodity 8 TB disk drives, we need\nmore than 125 million hard\
    \ disks to hold a Zettabyte of data, making\noffline analytics infeasible without\
    \ employing smart data and edge\ncomputing technologies. In addition, there are\
    \ many real-world ap-\nplications, such as, natural disasters, crop disease identification\
    \ and\nbioterrorism, traffic monitoring, monitoring human activities and\npublic\
    \ places, gas pipeline monitoring for leaks, and autonomous\nvehicles, where real-time\
    \ extraction of knowledge from these data\nstreams becomes critical. We envision\
    \ that the edge computing\nframeworks that bring computing closer to the sensors\
    \ (e.g., UAVs)\nis very relevant for the spatial computing community. Figure 1\n\
    shows an example architecture of spatiotemporal edge computing.\nThis figure also\
    \ shows the distinction between traditional off-line\n(backend) analytics and\
    \ online (near) real-time analytics.\n1.1\nWhy Now?\nWe see two key technology\
    \ innovations that is driving this new vi-\nsion. First, we observe that edge\
    \ computing is not a new technology.\nThough ideas were in development for sometime,\
    \ due to limited\ncomputing capabilities and power requirements, deploying com-\n\
    puting closer to the field sensors was prohibitive. Second, unlike\ntraditional\
    \ sensors, the data generated by modern remote sensing\nsensors (e.g., UAV based)\
    \ and in-situ sensors (e.g., optical soil mois-\nture sensors) poses problems\
    \ in terms of data transmission and\nstorage. However, with recent advances in\
    \ computing, especially\nembedded supercomputing chips (e.g., Nvidia’s Jetson\
    \ TX-1, TX-2,\nNano), tiny yet powerful edge computers (e.g., Lenovo’s P330 Tiny),\n\
    and high-end edge workstations (e.g., Nvidia’s EGX), spatiotem-\nporal edge computing\
    \ at the edge can be feasible and impactful.\nBigSpatial ’19, November 5, 2019,\
    \ Chicago, IL, USA\nVatsavai, Ramachandra, Chen, Jernigan\nAs per Gartner, “91%\
    \ of today’s data is created and processed in\ncentralized data centers. However,\
    \ by 2022 about 75% of all data\nwill need analysis and action at the edge.” We\
    \ now briefly describe\nthe enabling technologies behind this vision and showcase\
    \ few im-\nportant applications, and argue why spatial computing community\nshould\
    \ pay attention to this emerging theme.\nFigure 1: Traditional Offline Analytics\
    \ Vs. Edge Based Near\nReal-time Analytics\n2\nTHE RISE OF THE SENSORS\nGartner\
    \ estimates that there will be 25 billion things connected to\nthe Internet by\
    \ 20201. These sensors (or things) range from sim-\nple temperature sensors to\
    \ complex ultrasound sensors. They are\nplaced at fixed locations, or on moving\
    \ platforms, or on remote\nplatforms like traditional satellites to recent UAVs.\
    \ Most of these\nsensors are connected to the Internet to transmit data to centralized\n\
    facilities, including traditional data centers or modern cloud storage.\nIn particular,\
    \ we are interested in multi-spectral and hyper-spectral\nsensors mounted on UAVs\
    \ which allows us to monitor natural re-\nsources and critical infrastructures\
    \ (e.g., crops, waters, forest, cities,\nnuclear facilities). One major limitation\
    \ with current centralized\nstorage and offline data processing is that this infrastructure\
    \ can\nneither support nor scale well for near realtime applications. A large\n\
    portion of the data generated from these sensors is spatiotemporal\nin nature.\
    \ Spatiotemporal data is often big, therefore it make sense\nto process this data\
    \ close to where it is being generated, which\nmakes case for edge computing.\n\
    3\nTHE RISE OF EDGE COMPUTING\nThe need for edge computing is evident from recent\
    \ report “IDC\nFutureScape: Worldwide Internet of Things 2017 Predictions.” As\n\
    per this report, “By 2019, at Least 40% of IoT-Created Data Will Be\nStored, Processed,\
    \ Analyzed, and Acted Upon Close to, or at the\nEdge of, the Network.” There are\
    \ two key requirements for edge\ncomputing to be successful, (i) computing devices\
    \ with low energy\nrequirements, and (ii) highly scalable streaming analytics\
    \ platforms.\n1http://www.gartner.com/technology/research/internet-of-things/\n\
    4\nTHE RISE OF THE LOW ENERGY HIGH\nPERFORMANCE COMPUTING (AKA\nEMBEDDED SUPERCOMPUTING)\n\
    The power and efficiency of GPUs has increased drastically in\nthe past decade\
    \ [8] along with ever-cheaper and faster storage.\nOnly 20 years ago, the fastest\
    \ computer in the world achieved a\nperformance metric of 1 teraFLOP [10] with\
    \ energy consumption\nof 850,000 watts. The current NVIDIA Jetson TX1 platform\
    \ can\nachieve the same performance metric at under 15 watts, and weighs\n88 grams.\
    \ The progress is absolutely astonishing. We effectively can\nput supercomputers\
    \ in UAVs, but the algorithms and software have\nnot kept pace. Fortunately, we\
    \ are increasingly seeing algorithms\nadapted for streaming GPU-processed workflows.\n\
    5\nTHE RISE REAL TIME SPATIOTEMPORAL\nAPPLICATIONS\nWe now describe two real world\
    \ applications making the case for\nspatiotemporal edge computing. More comprehensive\
    \ with geospa-\ntial big data, applications, and analytics can be found in [1,\
    \ 3, 11, 12]\nTowards UAV-based GPU-accelerated Remote Sensing: In aerial\nremote\
    \ sensing, such as with unmanned aerial vehicles, edge com-\nputing with embedded\
    \ GPUs can leverage immense computational\npower and efficiency [8] to provide\
    \ actionable insight in the food-\nenergy-water (FEW) nexus. NSF and several other\
    \ federal agencies\nare considering FEW 2 to be next big research thrust in the\
    \ USA.\nFood, energy, and water are essential for human wellbeing. Agri-\nculture\
    \ accounts for 70% of total freshwater withdrawals. About\nthe 30% of global energy\
    \ is consumed in food production. Figure 2\nshows simple interaction between these\
    \ three systems, where en-\nergy being is used to pump water for crops. In this\
    \ context, spa-\ntiotemporal edge computing can be used to analyze data from UAVs\n\
    to estimate in near real-time the soil moisture and crop water stress\nat field\
    \ scale which allows farmers to schedule irrigation more\noptimally.\nFigure 2:\
    \ Image shows nexus between food, energy, and wa-\nter systems\n2https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=505241\n\
    geoEdge: A Real-time Analytics Framework for Geospatial Applications\nBigSpatial\
    \ ’19, November 5, 2019, Chicago, IL, USA\nFarmers and agricultural producers\
    \ cannot wait very long for\nremote sensing data to process in the cloud when\
    \ an immediate\ndecision must be reached regarding water application to a crop\
    \ field,\nor how much fertilizer to use (and where to apply it) to address\nnutrient\
    \ deficiency. In search and rescue operations, the immedi-\nacy of data processing\
    \ is obvious. Embedded supercomputers (or\nGPUs) can greatly assist with remote\
    \ sensing algorithms due to the\ninherent multidimensionality of the image data\
    \ and the processors’\nhighly parallel computational architecture [5] [8]. The\
    \ effect would\nbe to expedite the remaining processing, if not obviate some offline\n\
    processing outright. The following are some example cases:\n(1) Batch-to-stream\
    \ workflows: In some cases, what has been\nan offline batch process like orthorectification\
    \ of remote\nsensing images (image stitching) can happen in real time if\nhardware\
    \ can leverage efficient parallel processing [2] [13].\n(2) Anomaly detection:\
    \ traditional streaming adaptations such\nas using a sliding window on real time\
    \ data can allow for\nstreaming anomaly detection with GPU acceleration and\n\
    modified algorithms [13]. Rapidly processed anomaly detec-\ntion could be of great\
    \ benefit when assessing crop damage\ndue to extreme weather events such as floods\
    \ or large hail.\n(3) Image classification: Multispectral or hyperspectral imagery\n\
    can allow detection of crop pestilence or disease using meth-\nods such as support\
    \ vector machines [7].\n(4) Hyperspectral signature classification: Water contamination\n\
    could be detected from hyperspectral data by flying UAVs\nalong waterways. On-board\
    \ processing for certain signatures\nand thresholds could trigger a flight reassignment\
    \ to gather\nhigher resolution imagery in suspected areas for offline pro-\ncessing.\
    \ This approach could lead to more regular monitoring\nof waterways for threats\
    \ to healthcare, agriculture, and the\necosystem.\n(5) Data compression and summarization:\
    \ Data compression\nand summarization (e.g., clustering) are efficient techniques\n\
    to reduce data storage and transmission costs. As these are\nunsupervised techniques,\
    \ it is easy to implement these al-\ngorithm on edge computers and compress images\
    \ on the\nfly.\nFigure 3 shows an use case of near real-time detection of weeds\n\
    using the spatiotemporal edge computing framework. Such real-\ntime detection\
    \ of weeds and crop diseases will allow timely action\nby the farmer before its\
    \ too late.\nAnomaly Detection in Video Streams: Anomaly detection in\nvideo streams\
    \ have several security applications. For example, one\ncould monitor video streams\
    \ at airports and other public places to\nidentify unattended bags or other objects.\
    \ We recently developed a\nprobabilistic anomaly detection framework (KDD-17 under\
    \ review).\nWe ran this algorithm on a video dataset “Peds1” [6] consisting\n\
    of natural images of a pedestrian walkway. Given that we model\nvariation in local\
    \ spatio-temporal neighborhoods, we would expect\nthe method to behave similar\
    \ to a 3D feature (optical flow) detector.\nAnomalous events could be abnormal\
    \ motion patterns or high\namount of variation in pixel values that lasts for\
    \ a short amount of\ntime. Figure 4 shows the result of applying our anomaly detection\n\
    method to a video dataset. (a) represents the frame on which we\nFigure 3: Near\
    \ real-time weed detection while the data still\nbeing collected by UAVs\nqueried\
    \ for anomalies with respect to the rest of the video. Darker\nregions in (b)\
    \ represent low cumulative chi-squared scores and thus\nlow deviation and whiter\
    \ regions represent high deviation from\nnormality (e.g., person on bicycle on\
    \ a pedestrian pathway). Finding\nsuch anomalous patterns in realtime is highly\
    \ useful.\nFigure 4: Anomalous events detected for a frame of a video\nof a pedestrian\
    \ walkway\n6\nFEASIBILITY STUDIES\nTo study the feasibility of running complex\
    \ models on the edge,\nwe started with benchmarking the running times for widely\
    \ used\nunsupervised approaches such as feature extraction (e.g., vegetation\n\
    indices) and data summarization (e.g., clustering) methods. We used\nLenovo ThinkStation\
    \ P320 Tiny edge computer equipped with an\nNvidia Quadro P600 GPU for these experiments.\n\
    BigSpatial ’19, November 5, 2019, Chicago, IL, USA\nVatsavai, Ramachandra, Chen,\
    \ Jernigan\nFigure 5\nExperiment details: For these experiments we considered\
    \ (i)\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index, (NDVI) (ii) Enhanced Veg-\netation\
    \ Index (EVI), (iii) Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI), (iv)\nK-means clustering\
    \ and (v) Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) cluster-\ning. For the clustering experiments,\
    \ a 10% sample of input pixels is\nused to build the clustering model (with 10\
    \ clusters) and every pixel\nis classified with this model. K-means clustering\
    \ used the smaller of\n1000 iterations or a difference of 1e-2 on root mean squared\
    \ error\nas the stopping criterion. GMM clustering used the smaller of 1000\n\
    iterations or a difference of 1e-8 on total log likelihood between\nsuccessive\
    \ iterations as the stopping criterion. To implement these\nfunctions we used\
    \ python3 with the pytorch GPU acceleration\nlibrary.\nFor image input, we synthetically\
    \ generate an image by picking\nvalues in [0, 255] from a uniform distribution.\
    \ We ran each of of\nthese functions 1000 times and compute the average runtime\
    \ per\nfunction call to summarize scalability.\nResults: Figure 5 shows how the\
    \ runtime scaling as function\nof image size. Since SVI, NDVI and EVI use 1, 2\
    \ and 3 bands to\nperform their computation and the data transfer to GPU memory\n\
    is the most expensive piece, we see this trend reflected in their\nruntimes. We\
    \ see that with even slightly more complex tasks such\nas K-means clustering or\
    \ GMM clustering, the runtime per call\nquickly approaches 100 ms, and depending\
    \ on the frequency of\ninput images, may not meet a real-time processing requirement\
    \ on\nthe edge for large image sizes (I/O bound) and compute intensive\ntasks.\
    \ Moreover, when the image size is too large (2048 x 2048),\neven a single image\
    \ is too large to fit into GPU memory, throwing\nan OutOfMemory error. We are\
    \ also working on parallelizing these\nalgorithms on the Jetson TX-1/2 cards.\

    1 Introduction

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a conceptual paradigm that connects billions of

    Internet-enabled devices to exchange data among themselves and their surroundings
    to

    enable smart interactions and connect the physical infrastructure to digital systems.
    IoT

    represents a revolutionary paradigm that started to affect our lives in many positive
    ways.

    The term Internet of Things was ﬁrst coined in 1999 by Kevien Ashton (Ashton,
    2009)

    and was initially designed to support RFID technology. However, nowadays IoT has

    reached far beyond its designers’ vision and become much popular for the new

    applications

    it

    opens

    up

    in

    many

    vital

    domains

    like

    healthcare,

    intelligent

    transportation,

    public

    safety,

    home

    automation,

    smart

    city,

    asset

    monitoring,

    industrial automation and much more. The evolution of IoT presented the long-

    awaited promise of ubiquitous data access in which people wanted to have access
    to

    real-time data on the go anywhere and anytime.

    Even though there are many other relevant paradigms/model that intersect with
    the

    purpose of IoT (e.g., M2M: Machine to Machine), Web of Things, Internet of Everything

    (IoE), pervasive computing, etc.), there are fundamental differences between them
    and

    IoT. The core values of IoT lies in the promise of helping businesses to increase
    their

    productivity, enhance control over their assets, and make informed business decisions

    based on the inference resulting from the processing of the fusion of big raw
    data acquired

    from the surroundings, including people themselves. Recent research statistics
    reveal over

    10 billion connected IoT devices in 2021. This number is anticipated to reach
    41 billion in

    2027, expecting over 152,000 IoT devices to connect to the Internet per minute
    in 2025.

    Considering the global IoT market size, there was a 22% increase in the market
    size of IoT

    in 2021, hitting $157.9 billion. Smart home devices are the dominant components
    of IoT.

    The penetration rate of IoT varies concerning the application domain. For example,
    IoT

    analytics (Lueth, 2020) argues that industrial applications occupy 22% of the
    global IoT

    projects, with transportation, energy, and healthcare occupying 15%, 14%, and
    9%,

    respectively.

    The main two types of devices that make up the most of IoT are: Sensors and

    Actuators. Sensors are physical devices that can sense/measure a certain phenomena
    and

    can communicate the sensed values to other parties (i.e., collect

    data and report internal states). A GPS and an ECG device are

    examples of IoT sensors. The constituent sensor nodes usually

    utilize small-scale embedded systems to achieve the cost-

    effectiveness

    criteria

    of

    IoT

    solutions,

    increasing

    their

    deployment in various domains. Sensor nodes often use 8-bit

    microcontrollers and inhibit small storage capacity, lowering

    their power sizing and allowing them to run for years on

    batteries. Coupled with the diversiﬁed networking protocols

    available

    to

    match

    the

    existing

    infrastructure

    or

    the

    operational conditions, this highly promotes the deployment

    of IoT solutions in different domains. Actuators are also

    physical devices that can affect a change on the physical

    environments (i.e., take actions) in response to a command or

    a recommendation such as an AC thermostat and a valve. These

    devices need to be connected to the Internet and are able to

    communicate to send or receive data so they can qualify as IoT

    devices.

    The convergence of IoT, advanced data analytics and artiﬁcial

    intelligence opened up the door for the next generation of

    applications that support real-time decision making such as

    improved user experience and predictive maintenance. As such,

    data analytics has become a core component of any IoT

    deployment and will continue to gain popularity and relevance

    to businesses as much as data collection continues to grow and

    support intelligent decision making. In industrial manufacturing,

    for

    example,

    predictive

    maintenance

    can

    predict

    when

    maintenance is required in advance through the measurement

    of vibration levels, heat and other parameters to avoid production

    disruption. IoT data can also reveal rich information about

    customer

    behaviors

    (e.g.,

    driving

    habits

    and

    shopping

    preferences)

    to

    support

    improved

    customer

    experience.

    Machine learning models and artiﬁcial intelligence techniques

    can

    learn

    from

    observations

    (IoT

    data

    collection)

    and

    recommend actions that lead into smart decisions (IoT actuation).

    Although IoT promises to support intelligence decision

    making, enable better quality of life to citizens and make

    transformative changes in their daily lives, there remain grand

    challenges that hinder IoT from reaching its full potential such as

    privacy and security concerns, data heterogeneity and device

    interoperability, unrestricted access control and deployment in

    the open access domain. The heterogeneity and small footprint of

    IoT of sensors for example, comes with two major shortcomings:

    1) The constraints of resources available on the sensor nodes

    render

    it

    infeasible

    to

    apply

    the

    conventional

    security

    mechanisms typically involved in capable computer systems,

    exposing the sensor nodes as a weak security point for the

    whole

    IoT

    system.

    2)

    The

    many

    networking

    protocols

    available to communicate sensed information among IoT

    devices result in interoperability issues between IoT systems

    utilizing different communication protocols.

    The ﬁrst shortcoming of incapable sensor nodes results in the

    notorious “vertical silos,” where an IoT system is, in fact, a set of

    subsystems that lack information sharing among each other.

    That did not represent a signiﬁcant concern at the early ages of

    IoT since the applications were relatively limited, and the IoT had

    not reached its maturity and big vision yet. However, the advent

    of cloud computing in the last decade, coupled with the

    advancements in artiﬁcial intelligence and its subdomains, has

    vowed the prospect of IoT in various domains. This necessitates

    the ability of collaborative IoT systems to build better-informed

    business decisions based on the fusion of inferences coming from

    multiple systems. However, the second shortcoming of IoT

    impedes the scalability of IoT systems, conﬁning the usability

    of sensed information by IoT systems to the managed networks

    of their users without exposing this information to public

    networks. This comes at the cost of increased IoT systems

    outlay, unwanted redundancy of the same information sensed

    by non-interoperable systems, expanded storage footprint, high

    network bandwidth utilization, risen processing cost, and more

    elevated system latency. This paper provides deep analytical

    views on many aspects of IoT technologies including standard

    architecture, stack protocols, value proposition, different IoT

    applications, trending technologies, and challenges.

    The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2

    discusses the IoT standard architecture, enabling technologies

    and stack protocols. Section 3 describes the different domains of

    application for IoT with the most prevailing deployments.

    Section 4 sheds the light on rising trends in IoT and the

    convergence

    between

    IoT

    and

    data

    analytics.

    Section

    5

    discusses the grand challenges for IoT that remain open for

    further research and deemed to decelerate its wide scale adoption.

    Lastly, Section 6 offers concluding remarks.

    2 IoT standard layered architecture

    and protocols

    From the engineering perspective, IoT is witnessing an

    increasing number of enabling technologies. This high diversity

    of IoT enabling technologies stem from the proliferation of IoT

    devices, their heterogeneity and uncertainty of operational

    environments, the advancements in chip manufacturing, and

    variety of communication protocols (Bouguettaya et al., 2021).

    Nonetheless, the advent of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and associated

    machine learning (ML) techniques leverage the serendipity of IoT

    by providing insightful information from the fusion of raw data

    collected by heterogeneous sensors to support decision making

    and change how people carry out their everyday business. This

    adds up to the enabling technologies of IoT. Therefore, abstracting

    IoT systems in terms of building blocks helps to contrast the hazy

    boundaries between different enabling technologies and enhance

    the agility and robustness to achieve a successful paradigm for IoT

    systems (Lin et al., 2017). The core elements of a typical layered

    IoT architecture, as depicted on Figure 1, can be summarized as

    follows.

    2.1 Perception layer

    The ﬁrst layer of the IoT architecture is the perception layer,

    also denoted by the hardware, physical, or infrastructure layer.

    This layer encompasses the constituent physical devices of an IoT

    system that are typically responsible for: 1) sensing the

    environment in their vicinity and sending the raw sensed data

    to the next upper layer for processing, such as environmental

    sensors; 2) transforming the logical decisions coming from the

    upper

    inference

    layer

    into

    physical

    actions

    applied

    to

    corresponding devices, such as actuators and servo motors. It

    is worth noting that, and as the name of IoT implies, the

    constituent devices that form an IoT system embed some

    form of communication by which they can be directly or

    indirectly, with the help of a gateway, connected to the

    Internet. Moreover, IoT devices typically include some form

    of identiﬁcation that helps differentiate the data passed to the

    upper layers of the IoT architecture. This identiﬁcation can be

    either burnt into the device ﬁrmware by the manufacturer [such

    as the unique identiﬁer (UUID)], set up by the user through

    conﬁgurable menus or DIP switches, or provided by the

    communication subsystem that the devices utilize (like the

    MAC address or the Bluetooth identiﬁer).

    2.2 Transport layer

    The transport layer, also denoted by the communication and

    network layer, and as its name implies, is responsible for

    connecting IoT devices in the perception layer to the upper

    layers of the IoT architecture, which are typically hosted over the

    Internet using cloud computing technologies. This layer utilizes a

    wide range of communication technologies, like cellular, Wi-Fi,

    Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc. Besides, the transport layer is responsible

    for maintaining the conﬁdentiality of the data exchange between

    the perception layer and the upper layers. Nonetheless, with its

    potential promise and anticipated ubiquity and prevalence, IoT is

    the motivating force behind recent research in enabling

    communication technologies. For example, IPv6 has been

    identiﬁed such that it can provide network addresses to the

    anticipated enormous smart objects connected to the Internet,

    which exceeds the already depleted IPv4 addresses. Similarly, the

    6LoWPAN communication standard has been mainly developed

    to enable IPv6 packet transmission for power-constrained smart

    objects communicating over IEEE 802.15.4.

    The transport layer securities typically used for IP-based

    networking, namely Transport Layer Security (TLS) and

    Datagram TLS (DTLS), provide the essential means for secure

    end-to-end communication. However, these technologies are not

    always

    feasible

    for

    deployment

    in

    resource-constrained

    embedded

    IoT

    devices

    due

    to

    the

    induced

    increased

    processing,

    storage,

    and

    power

    consumption

    overhead

    associated with these security mechanisms. This, in turn,

    usually delegates the authentication and the data integrity

    tasks

    of

    exchanged

    information

    in

    IoT

    systems

    to

    be

    arbitrarily carried out by the application layer based on the

    required security level and device capabilities. Besides, it

    exposes these poorly-secured IoT devices as a weak point for

    FIGURE 1

    IoT layered architecture.

    malicious users to penetrate the underlying critical network

    infrastructure or exploit them for botnet attacks to prevent

    the availability of network resources, aka distributed denial of

    service (DDoS). Derived by the proliferation of IoT devices,

    recent

    statistics

    anticipate

    that

    more

    than

    %25

    of

    all

    cyberattacks against businesses will be IoT-based by 2025.

    This slows down the adoption of IoT and makes businesses

    reluctant to expose the reachability of sensed information by

    their IoT systems beyond their managed networks, adding up to

    the “isolated islands” dilemma of IoT systems.

    2.3 Processing layer

    The processing layer, also denoted as the middleware layer,

    encompasses advanced features that could not be embedded within

    the inherently resource-constrained devices at the perception layer.

    This includes storage, processing, computing, and action-taking

    capabilities. Besides, the middleware layer facilitates IoT systems’

    scalability and interoperability across the computing continuum

    from the edge to a remote cloud data centre. It typically provides

    interfaces, like APIs, for other systems and third-party services to

    leverage the gathered raw data from the IoT devices or the insight

    obtained by the middleware layer after data processing. Based on the

    agreed tradeoff between device loads and bandwidth during the

    system design phase, the middleware layer can be either embedded

    within an on-site capable embedded platform, sometimes denoted as

    an IoT gateway, or hosted over the cloud. The former requires

    utilizing a medium-to-large scale embedded device to act as a

    gateway. Nonetheless, it typically utilizes a Linux kernel-based OS

    to mask the complexity of the underlying hardware interfacing to the

    perception layer devices. The latter, however, depends on relaying

    the raw data from the perception layer to cloud-hosted servers. This

    comes at the cost of higher bandwidth utilization and increased

    latency.

    The emergence of a cloud-hosted middleware layer for IoT

    systems represents a bottleneck considering the security concerns of

    IoT. Cloud computing is the only candidate to digest the enormous

    amount of IoT data coming from perception layer devices. However,

    cloud providers are also principal targets for cyberattacks and single

    points of failure for IoT systems. A successful cyberattack could

    expose an enormous amount of sensitive information to hackers and

    render the IoT system unfunctional. This puts system designers in a

    tradeoff of choosing between the capability, cost-effectiveness, and

    ease of access associated with cloud computing technologies on one

    hand and the panic of potential data leakage in case of a successful

    cloud attack on the other hand.

    2.4 Application layer

    The application layer deﬁnes the domains by which IoT

    systems are deployed. This includes smart homes, smart cities,

    smart agriculture, etc. The application layer manages the logical

    processes to be taken based on the inference coming from the

    middleware layer and the system requirements. This includes

    sending emails, activating alarms, turning a device on or off,

    setting

    parameters,

    etc.

    Therefore,

    the

    application

    layer

    represents the user interface to interact with the other layers

    below it, facilitating human-machine interactions. Since the

    application layer is meant to be used by people, it inhibits a

    wide surface area exposed to good actors and bad actors. The

    common vulnerabilities usually encountered in the application

    layer include distributed denial of service (DDoS), HTTP ﬂoods,

    SQL injections, and cross-site scripting. Although large-scale

    cybersecurity attacks are dangerous, the effect of small-scale

    cybersecurity attacks, usually encountered in IoT systems, can

    be even more dangerous. This is because they do not have unique

    ecosystems, their cyber defense has not yet reached maturity, and

    they can be gone unnoticed for a long time. The security

    mechanisms applied at the application layer are meant to

    fulﬁll the CIA triad, namely conﬁdentiality, integrity, and

    availability. This implies keeping the secrecy of exchanged

    information between communicating parties, ensuring that no

    alterations have been maliciously carried out on the information

    from its source to destination, and making the information

    always available to authorized users requiring it.

    In contrast to the vulnerabilities in the lower layers of the

    IoT architecture mentioned above which can also affect the

    upper layers, security breaches in the application layer do not

    affect the lower layers. In capable computer systems, however,

    security mechanisms are applied in parallel to different layers

    to tighten the system’s safety. Nevertheless, for a market

    usually biased towards the price and the convenience rather

    than the security, this is not usually valid for constrained

    embedded devices often encountered in IoT systems. Security

    practices for IoT systems often delegate the security measures

    to be applied at the application layer based on the system

    requirements or even delegated to the third-party ﬁrewall

    appliances managing the network. Security measures in IoT

    systems usually come at trade-offs regarding the capacity of

    the constituent IoT devices utilized by the system. Moreover,

    with the diverse application domains of IoT, security

    mechanisms can even affect the system’s effectiveness. For

    example, a VoIP-based IoT solution can be adversely affected

    by the induced latency of the security mechanism in action.

    On the other hand, this latency pales for conﬁdentiality- and

    integrity-critical applications, like ﬁnancial and medical

    applications, where the effect of a security breach would be

    catastrophic.

    2.5 Business intelligence layer

    A successful IoT system depends on the utilized enabling

    technologies and how inference is delivered to the user

    Frontiers in The Internet of Things

    frontiersin.org

    04

    Elgazzar et al.

    10.3389/friot.2022.1073780

    abstractly and efﬁciently. The business intelligence layer is

    meant to fulﬁll this task by providing the user with

    visualized

    representations

    of

    the

    information

    coming

    from the middleware layer, masking its complexity and

    making it easier for the user to make informed business

    decisions.

    The business intelligence layer is not affected by the

    constituent embedded IoT devices utilized by the system. It

    does not deal directly with the constituent IoT devices.

    However, it deals with the inference from the middleware

    layer after processing the raw data from the IoT devices

    through

    the

    application

    layer

    protocols.

    Therefore,

    the

    security of the business intelligence layer depends on the

    typical user-level security mechanisms found in capable

    computer systems. The user-level security can be applied to

    different entities constructing the layer. This includes ﬁles,

    databases, or any other resources. The user-level security is

    meant to implement a ﬁne-grained authorization control over

    accessible information to different users based on their

    credibility.

    3 IoT applications

    IoT can be seen in different real-world applications and

    services such as home automation, intelligent transportation,

    smart cities, digital healthcare, remote health monitoring, smart

    agriculture, and industrial automation (Gubbi et al., 2013). In

    each application domain, several sensors are triggered to

    independently gather data, transmit information, and initiate

    and execute services with minimum human intervention (Sarkar

    et al., 2014). The main objective of integrating IoT technology

    into real-world applications is to enhance the quality of life. For

    example, in the domain of smart city services, we ﬁnd IoT

    applications used for increasing city safety, efﬁcient mobility,

    and enhancing smart energy usage (Weber and Podnar Žarko,

    2019). On the other hand, IoT technology has introduced remote

    medical monitoring systems in the healthcare domain which

    empower physicians to provide superior care to patients (Selvaraj

    and Sundaravaradhan, 2020). Numerous research proposes

    different IoT-based solutions and innovations under three

    application domains shown in Figure 2 (Sarkar et al., 2014).

    3.1 Smart city

    IoT technology assists cities to enhance mobility services,

    improve public safety, and control and automate household

    systems. Intelligent transportation, for example, focuses on

    solutions that manage road infrastructure and improve route

    planning for drivers. Furthermore, it provides innovative

    solutions to monitor and manage trafﬁc systems using smart

    trafﬁc signals and sensors, throughout the road network to

    smooth the trafﬁc ﬂow and reduce congestion. The concept of

    smart city services is not restricted to transportation, but also

    involves other aspects of human life, such as public safety, green

    and clean environment, smart grid, efﬁcient delivery of

    municipal services and connecting the physical infrastructure

    to the digital world. In the following we shed the light on some of

    these aspects.

    3.1.1 Trafﬁc management

    IoT-based trafﬁc management systems mainly monitor road

    trafﬁc conditions to solve the problem of increased trafﬁc

    congestion and predict trafﬁc status (Poslad et al., 2015).

    These systems assist drivers by informing them about the

    trafﬁc conditions at a given location and time. For example,

    an adaptive trafﬁc signal control (ATSC) system that captures the

    trafﬁc volume level can signiﬁcantly reduce trafﬁc congestion

    (Saarika et al., 2017). Equipping roads with advanced sensors that

    capture real-time trafﬁc data assists in determining the duration

    of trafﬁc light signals across intersections. The ATSC system not

    only eases the trafﬁc ﬂow at intersections but also reduces travel

    time and fuel consumption, contributing positively to green

    environments. Research on IoT-based real-time ATSC systems

    at an intersection describes the coordinated approach as it is used

    to track the movements of vehicles and pedestrians (Eom and

    Kim, 2020; Jamil et al., 2020). It also uses the deep reinforcement

    learning (DRL) method which is commonly used in ATSC

    systems to teach/educate trafﬁc controllers how to make

    proper decisions. DRL simulates the effect of a trafﬁc signal’s

    action and the resulting changes in trafﬁc status. It would be

    classiﬁed as an appropriate action in that given situation if the

    action improved trafﬁc conditions, and as a negative action

    otherwise (Jamil et al., 2020). Furthermore, IoT-based trafﬁc

    management systems can facilitate smart parking in public

    spaces such as on-street parking, and lot parking. According

    to Libelium company (Dujić Rodić et al., 2020), parking spaces

    play critical roles in reducing trafﬁc volume, and gas emissions.

    In smart parking, drivers can easily locate an empty parking place

    using smart parking maps. These smart maps use IoT sensors

    and cameras to detect and manage the likelihood of parking

    space in a given area. An example of a real-time trafﬁc occupancy

    system for smart parking is called SplitParking which is managed

    by the city of Split in Croatia (Weber and Podnar Žarko, 2019).

    The SplitParking system places sensors integrated with an IoT

    technology within its parking spaces to monitor space occupancy

    andlert the end user of the parking availability through a user-

    friendly mobile application (Weber and Podnar Žarko, 2019).

    3.1.2 Intelligent transportation

    The emergence of IoT has provided a new perspective for

    intelligent trafﬁc systems development. This is because the IoT

    paradigm satisﬁes the public’s demand towards an “always

    connected” model by relying on the interconnection of our

    daily physical objects using the Internet. Hence, allowing it to

    collect, process and transfer data creating smart intelligent

    systems without human intervention.

    In the trafﬁc domain, IoT requires every element such as

    roads, tunnels, bridges, trafﬁc lights, vehicles and roadside

    infrastructures to be Internet-connected for identiﬁcation and

    management purposes. This can be done using sensor-enabled

    devices, for instance, RFID devices, Infrared sensors, GPS and

    many others. Intelligent trafﬁc systems that are IoT-based can

    efﬁciently improve trafﬁc conditions, reduce trafﬁc congestion

    and are unaffected by weather conditions. Moreover, IoT allows

    for dynamic real-time interactions, since it facilitates the

    incorporation of communication, control and data processing

    across the transportation systems. Beyond any doubt, IoT is

    causing a noticeable shift in the transportation sector.

    The

    rapid

    advancements

    within

    information

    and

    communication technologies have also paved the way for

    developing more self-reliable and intelligent transportation

    systems. These include striding advancements in hardware,

    software,

    sensor-enabled

    and

    wireless

    communications

    technologies.

    Therefore,

    moving

    towards

    a

    new

    era

    of

    connected

    intelligent

    transportation

    systems,

    where

    the

    demand

    for

    on-going

    and

    future

    real-time

    trafﬁc

    data

    continues to rise (Abdelkader and Elgazzar, 2020). This

    enforces

    several

    challenging

    requirements

    on

    the

    trafﬁc

    information

    systems.

    Among

    these

    requirements

    is

    broadcasting real-time, user-friendly, and precise trafﬁc data

    for users. These trafﬁc data including color-coded maps

    showing congestion, calculated trafﬁc time intervals between

    arbitrary points on the road network. In addition to trafﬁc

    density estimations that should be easily interpreted by users

    in a very short time. Moreover, demonstrating real-time routes

    for drivers based on the embedded navigation systems such as

    Global

    Positioning

    Systems

    (GPS).

    Another

    challenging

    requirement

    lies

    in

    storing

    huge

    amounts

    of

    trafﬁc

    information generated from progressively complex networks

    of

    sensors,

    where

    Big

    data

    comes

    into

    play.

    However,

    collecting and storing this amount of trafﬁc information is not

    enough. It is crucial to correlate based on game theory

    methodology, validate and make use of data in real-time.

    Hence

    providing

    valuable,

    relevant

    data

    extraction

    and

    insightful predictions of upcoming patterns and trends based

    on historical data. As an example, providing drivers with real-

    time trafﬁc information to assist them in ﬁnding out the best road

    routes. This is why the subsequent role of predictive analytics for

    Frontiers in The Internet of Things

    frontiersin.org

    06

    Elgazzar et al.

    10.3389/friot.2022.1073780

    the whole transportation is needed. Consequently, trafﬁc

    information systems require participation of all of the above

    components to interact and integrate through a common

    infrastructure. It allows immediate transmission of real time

    trafﬁc information to any part of the system (Abdelkader

    et al., 2021).

    Even with the aforementioned beneﬁts and challenges that

    come along with the integration of IoT into the transportation

    sector. IoT provides a paradigm shift that changes the transit

    services

    into

    intelligent

    groundbreaking

    systems,

    where

    numerous cutting edge technologies are incorporated. This

    creates a wide suite of intelligent transportation applications

    that have road users’ experience and safety at its core. A widely

    adopted IoT applications in the automotive industry include: the

    integration of sensors such as weight measurements and real-

    time ﬂeet location sensors-based tracking to help ﬂeet operators

    efﬁciently manage their ﬂeets. Another use case that IoT

    technologies have shown great impact is predictive analytics.

    In this context, drivers are provided with early in advance vehicle

    maintenance alerts in cases of failure of a speciﬁc vehicle

    component. This is because these components are equipped

    with sensors that collect and share real-time information on

    the vehicle’s status with their vendors. It avoids any sudden or

    abrupt failure that can cause a life-hazard situation. Last, but not

    least with a precise focus on the integration of IoT with connected

    mobility. Figure 3 showcases a predictive maintenance scenario,

    where an in-vehicle monitoring system acquires IoT sensing data

    from the faulty in-vehicle sensor. The vehicular data is sent to the

    Diagnostics and Prognostics cloud services for analyzing and

    predicting maintenance issues. Repair recommendations are

    then sent back to the drivers (Kshirsagar and Patil, 2021).

    3.1.3 Emergency response

    Crisis management is one of the critical situations that face

    many governments, ﬁrst responders, emergency dispatchers and

    others who provide necessary ﬁrst aid/assistance at the least

    possible time. In such situations, the design of the required

    infrastructure

    to

    handle

    emergencies

    becomes

    a

    critical

    requirement. With the introduction of IoT technologies to the

    safety systems where a suite of sensors are connected to provide

    real-time data to crisis management ofﬁcials. This includes the

    use of sensors to monitor the water levels in cases of ﬂood

    situations to provide insights that can support real-time data

    analytics to manage ﬂooding crises. Real-time information can

    contribute to improving crisis management response time.

    Hence, reducing or eliminating the costs of crisis-related

    damages. Fireﬁghting is considered a viable use case that ﬁnds

    value in IoT applications. Heat-proof sensors placed in indoor

    buildings can provide real-time information about the initial

    starting point of a ﬁre, spreading patterns and intensity levels

    (Mekni, 2022). It also extends to provide additional safety

    measures for ﬁreﬁghters as they use IoT-based safety alert

    devices that can accurately detect their motions. These devices

    are equipped with acoustic transmitters which act as beacons to

    FIGURE 3

    An IoT-based predictive maintenance use-case scenario.

    Frontiers in The Internet of Things

    frontiersin.org

    07

    Elgazzar et al.

    10.3389/friot.2022.1073780

    allocate ﬁreﬁghters within the building and embedded sensors

    that can monitor their vital health conditions. Besides protecting

    ﬁreﬁghters, IoT-based sensors are employed to sustain indoors

    electrical systems and smartly pre-identify any active heat

    sources through abrupt temperature spikes. Immediate alerts

    are then subsequently sent for rapid and instant inspections. Fire

    systems based on IoT solutions can be actively intelligent to

    detect and promptly put off small ﬁres through the use of smart

    sprinklers. Other emerging solutions that aid ﬁreﬁghters in ﬁre

    crisis situations include computer-aided dispatch data such as

    precise ﬁre locations, environmental conditions and others.

    Augmented reality-IoT based ﬁreﬁghter helmets (Choi et al.,

    2021) are another innovative solution that can effectively guide

    ﬁreﬁghters to navigate in low-visibility conditions.

    Emergency responders and dispatchers are leveraging the

    beneﬁts of IoT-based solutions when dealing with daily trafﬁc

    accidents. Numerous automotive industrial solutions such as GM

    OnStar provide a myriad of applications and services to assist

    ﬁrst aid dispatchers. This could be achieved through utilizing

    cellular networks in conjunction with GPS and IoT technologies.

    Leveraging Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communication-

    based technologies to provide critical information incases of

    trafﬁc accidents. These include avoidance crash response,

    where drivers in crash situations can connect to OnStar call

    center by requesting the appropriate help to be provided to the

    vehicle’s location. The ecall can be activated manually (using a

    push-button) or automatically through data collected from on-

    board

    sensors.

    Other

    applications

    include

    stolen

    vehicle

    assistance which help the authorities in locating the stolen

    vehicle by activating several functionalities. This includes

    halting the restart option upon reactivation of the remote

    ignition block and transmitting a slowdown signal to let the

    vehicle come to a stop eventually (Abboud et al., 2016). Other use

    cases include amber alert notiﬁcations sent to the public by

    integrating IoT and cellular network technologies. Amber alerts

    provide new means of aiding emergency responders and

    authority ofﬁcials in risky situations such as child abduction.

    Ofﬁcials collect crowdsourcing witness information from people

    within close event proximity to assist in their investigations. The

    alerts usually include event description (time and location). In

    addition to the Kidnappers’ detailed information (e.g, vehicle’s

    information, license plate number and their description) as well

    as child description. However, inability to correctly track the

    suspects’ vehicle or missed notiﬁcations by the public may

    contribute and lead to inefﬁcient amber alert-based systems

    (Zhang et al., 2018).

    Traditionally, infrastructure failures and power outages are

    other use cases implying sudden and abrupt crisis situations that

    may be disruptive to emergency ofﬁcials. Based on leveraging IoT

    technologies that aim at providing preventive and predictive

    maintenance. Hence, avoiding sudden breakdowns, anomalies

    and damages of the infrastructure. This could be achieved

    through continuous supervision and monitoring. For instance,

    smart bridges include a modular and IoT-sensor based system for

    monitoring, evaluating and recording any changes of the bridge

    structure in near real-time. Embedded sensors in the core

    structure of the bridge can then relay measurable information

    to management ofﬁcials for further analysis. This includes

    humidity, temperature and corrosion status of the structure.

    Such data is considered valuable to constantly assess and

    evaluate the health structure and provide necessary measures

    such as intervention and predictive measures strategies (Yang,

    2003).

    3.2 Home automation

    Home

    automation

    and

    control

    systems

    are

    essential

    components of smart cities and have played a signiﬁcant part in

    the advancement of our home environments. They have several

    applications for different usage at home, such as entertainment and

    smart living, surveillance, and safety management (Alhaﬁdh and

    Allen, 2016). Home automation is described as a standard home

    environment equipped with IoT technological infrastructure to

    provide a safe and comfortable lifestyle (Khoa et al., 2020). Home

    automation is based on an intelligent, self-adaptive system that

    analyzes and evaluates stakeholder behaviors and has the capability

    to predict the stakeholder’s future actions and interact accordingly.

    Home automation systems use image detection and facial

    recognition models that are embedded in an intelligent control

    system connected to different sensors such as light sensors, motion

    sensors, water leak sensors, smoke sensors, and CCTV cameras

    (Pavithra and Balakrishnan, 2015). These devices communicate

    with each other through a gateway that is distributed throughout a

    home area network. The home control system will connect different

    subsystems that cooperate in modeling the stakeholder’s actions

    and the environment’s information such as temperature, humidity,

    noise, visibility, and light intensity to enhance the learning process.

    For example, lights and AC temperature can be controlled and

    automated to adapt to the stakeholders’ needs and their movements

    in the home environment. This would conserve energy while also

    effectively monitoring energy consumption (Vishwakarma et al.,

    2019). Research on home automation is not restricted to energy

    optimization; it involves health monitoring and security measures.

    By using innovative IoT technologies, we can connect to

    surveillance cameras in the home environment via a mobile

    device. Additionally, stakeholders can have access to doors and

    window sensors to maintain home safety and security remotely

    (Alsuhaym et al., 2021).

    3.3 Industrial sector

    Industrial IoT leverages IoT capabilities in business and

    economic sectors to automate previously complex manual

    operations in order to satisfy consumer needs and reduce

    Frontiers in The Internet of Things

    production costs. Warehouse operations, logistical services,

    supply chain management, and agricultural breeding can have

    machine-to-machine (M2M) intercommunication to ensure

    optimal industrial operations (Pekar et al., 2020). Figure 4

    illustrates a scenario of the IoT communication sensors in a

    smart agricultural system. This smart agriculture system

    monitors and analyzes the environmental parameters using

    soil moisture and harvesting sensors such as ZigBee, EnOcean,

    Z-wave and ANT (Tang et al., 2018). These sensors are

    automated to diagnose the status of a plant and gather this

    data through an IoT platform to take the proper action such as

    when to irrigate in consultation with a weather forecasting

    service available in the Cloud; thus ensuring the efﬁcient use

    of water resources.

    3.4 Logistics and supply chain

    Supply Chain Management (SCM) is a crucial service in our

    world. Since 1900 (Lummus and Vokurka, 1999), humanity has

    evolved SCM to meet the market needs. Figure 5 highlights SCM

    milestones. Before 1900, SCM was restricted to the local areas.

    However, due to the revolution in railways, goods now can reach

    far beyond local borders. Between 1900 and 1950, global SCM

    attracted large players and organizations like UPS began

    providing their services in the SCM ﬁeld. Industry leaders

    started to look for how we could improve the mechanization

    of the SCM process. From 1950 to 1970, the SCM community

    gained a superior experience by analyzing the military logistics of

    the First World War. DHL and FedEx were established as

    logistics enterprises, and IBM built the ﬁrst computerized

    inventory management that was capable of handling complex

    inventory problems and making stock forecasts. In 1975,

    JCPenney

    designed

    the

    ﬁrst

    Real-Time

    Warehouse

    Management System (WMS) that monitors the warehouse

    stock in real-time. Seven years later, Keith Oliver introduced

    the

    Supply

    term.

    In

    the

    90s,

    the

    technological revolution was triggered when many enterprises

    deployed computers to manage their processes and the internet

    to reach their customers through the World Wide Web. In the

    90s, Amazon started running the e-commerce website. The

    4.0 industrial revolution, including the internet of things,

    began growing in the last decade. Although the IoT looks like

    a promising technology to be adopted in the SCM ﬁeld, deploying

    IoT in SCM faces many challenges. The main hindrance

    (Haddud et al., 2017) is the integration of different supply

    chain processes due to The heterogeneity of technologies used

    in various supply chain stages.

    COVID-19 (de Vass et al., 2021) uncovered a new factor that

    magniﬁes the importance of relying on information and

    communications

    technology

    to

    run

    the

    SCM

    systems.

    Businesses had to switch to remote working due to the

    pandemic.

    The

    lockdown

    and

    physical

    distancing

    requirements imposed on suppliers reduced their labors in

    their plants and sometimes obliged to shut down to limit the

    virus spreading. As a result, consumers face product shortages

    due to reduced production volumes during the pandemic. To

    date (Ozdemir et al., 2022), the world is still suffering from the

    devastating effects of COVID-19 on the supply chain. Therefore,

    decision-makers (Baldwin and Di Mauro, 2020; Baldwin and

    Tomiura, 2020) started exploring how we could deploy new

    technologies, such as IoT, for managing remote operations.

    3.5 Healthcare

    IoT sensors and devices shifted the landscape of portable and

    wearable medical devices from ﬁtness and wellness devices to

    medical-grade devices qualiﬁed for usage at hospitals and

    healthcare providers. This shift accelerated the integration of

    remote patient monitoring in hospitals to accommodate patients

    with chronic diseases (Casale et al., 2021). Therefore, numerous

    efforts have

    been conducted

    to advance remote

    patient

    monitoring (RPM) systems with the help of well-established

    IoT infrastructures and standards in the healthcare domain

    (El-Rashidy et al., 2021). The RPM systems are expected to

    match or exceed the performance of the existing monitoring

    and examinations administered at hospitals and healthcare

    facilities (Casale et al., 2021). For example, continuous heart

    rate monitoring and immediate heartbeat detection necessitate

    patients to be hospitalized and/or connected to a Holter monitor

    or similar devices for long-term cardiac diagnosis. However, this

    setup would hinder patient mobility due to the limitations of the

    existing devices in terms of size and the number of attached

    wires. Moreover, hospitals dedicate signiﬁcant resources to

    providing long-term cardiac monitoring that, in some cases, is

    unavailable, especially in low or middle-income countries.

    Therefore, RPM systems effectively reduce death from chronic

    diseases (e.g., heart diseases, diabetes). IoT platforms and devices

    signiﬁcantly accelerated the development and integration of

    RPM systems into existing healthcare infrastructures. To that

    extent, a typical RPM implementation constitutes various

    services but is not limited to data acquisition, tracking,

    communication,

    automated

    analysis,

    diagnoses,

    and

    notiﬁcation systems (Miller et al., 2021).

    4 Rising trends in sensor data

    analytics

    In recent years, the IoT domain has witnessed increasing

    interest by the research community and rising demands from

    the industrial sector to embed real-time data analytics tools into

    the core of IoT standards. While the real value proposition of IoT is

    shifting from providing passive data monitoring and acquisition

    services to autonomous IoT applications with real-time decision-

    making services. Consequently, real-time data analytics is no longer

    an add-on service and has become integral to any IoT application

    rollout. For example, remote patient monitoring (RPM) and real-

    time data analytics have signiﬁcantly contributed to enhancing

    ECG monitoring and enabling healthcare providers to gain 24/

    7 access to their patients remotely, especially for patients with

    coronary diseases (Mohammed et al., 2019). However, sensor data

    acquisition and collections are mapped as the foundation of IoT

    applications yet are considered passive techniques due to the

    absence of intelligence or decision-making. The main goals of

    IoT application at the early stages were to collect and monitor

    signiﬁcant information regarding speciﬁc applications as initially

    proposed in 1999 (Butzin et al., 2016) while developing supply

    chain optimization at Procter & Gamble. Nearly after 2 decades, the

    goals of using IoT applications and their expectations are on the

    rise, demanding proactive and active decisions made on sensor data

    Frontiers in The Internet of Things

    frontiersin.org

    10

    Elgazzar et al.

    10.3389/friot.2022.1073780

    collected in real-time. Accordingly, data analytics permits various

    applications to focus on performing real-time diagnoses, predictive

    maintenance,

    automated

    decision-making,

    and

    theoretically

    improving the productivity and efﬁciency of the intended

    applications. Meanwhile, modern stream processing engines

    (e.g., Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar) come with built-in APIs

    ready for data analytics integrations (Martín et al., 2022). Moreover,

    most cloud services provide ready-made end-to-end event

    processing and real-time data analytics tools (i.e., Google

    DataFlow).

    4.1 Real-time vs. ofﬂine data analytics:

    Differences, needs, and potential use

    In an IoT-driven society, applications and services integrate

    smart learning approaches for analyzing insightful patterns and

    trends that result in improved decision-making. For more

    effectively optimized analytics, several IoT data-speciﬁcation

    characteristics should be considered. These include dealing

    with huge volumes of data streamed from sensor-based

    devices deployed for IoT applications and services. It requires

    new means of big data analytics that can deal with huge volumes

    of sensor-generated data. In this context, conventional hardware/

    software methods for storage, data analytics and management

    purposes cannot handle such huge volumes of streaming data.

    Moreover, information collected from heterogeneous devices

    result in three signiﬁcant common features among IoT Data.

    These features include data heterogeneity and association of

    time/space stamps based on the sensors’ locations. The third

    feature is the subjectivity of IoT data associated with the high

    noise levels during acquisition and transmission processes.

    Beyond such characteristics that utilize big data analytics

    approaches, a new suite of applications and services arise that

    demand prompt actions in real-time analytics. This is primarily

    due to its time sensitive and fast streaming of IoT data that is

    generated within short time intervals for instant decision

    making and actions. These insightful decisions are time

    stringent, where IoT streaming data analytics need to be

    delivered within a range of hundreds of milliseconds to only

    a few seconds. As such, life-saving applications demand fast and

    continuous streams of incoming data associated in some cases

    with real-time multi-modal data sources for efﬁcient decision

    making. For instance, connected and autonomous vehicles

    require data fusion of real-time sensor data from different

    sources (e.g., Lidars and cameras), V2X communication and

    road entities (e.g., trafﬁc lights) for safe perception decision

    making. Transmitting trafﬁc data to the cloud servers for real-

    time analytics will be liable to network and communication

    latency that are not well-suited for time sensitive applications,

    which may result in fatal trafﬁc accidents. However, analyzing

    real-time streaming

    data

    on powerful cloud computing

    platforms

    that

    adopt

    data

    parallelism

    and

    incremental

    processing

    techniques

    can

    reduce

    the

    end-to-end

    delay

    associated

    with

    two-way

    data

    transmissions.

    A

    more

    optimized approach could reside in solutions such as edge

    computing, where data analytics are closer to the data

    sources (e.g., edge or IoT-based devices) for faster data

    analytics (Goudarzi et al., 2021). However, these solutions

    are still prone to a number of limitations including limited

    computation, power and storage resources on IoT devices. The

    rising trends towards real-time data analytics are also striving in

    non-critical business applications.

    4.2 Decision making

    Leading IoT-based business sectors rely heavily on well-

    analyzed real-time data inferred from their IoT-enabled

    products. For critical and unbiased decision making, real-

    time data analysis by machine learning algorithms can assist

    in eliminating/reducing junk information and estimating

    learning useful patterns. Data-driven analytics will provide

    more in depth insights for optimizing customers’ experiences

    through daily behaviors and patterns analysis. As an

    example, Apple watches can monitor our daily exercises

    and sleeping patterns in real-time and assist in providing

    customized preference notiﬁcations. Uber can also make

    informed decisions based on analyzing real-time demands

    for trafﬁc trips. This determines their pricing rates that

    proportionately increase in rush hours. Other examples

    may include placing sensors within oil tanks for real-time

    monitoring of oil ﬂuid levels, temperature and humidity.

    This initiates automated decision making such as oil

    reordering

    and

    planning

    pre-scheduled

    maintenance

    (Moh’d Ali et al., 2020).

    Decision

    making-based

    systems

    can

    be

    classiﬁed

    according to the different levels of system complexity. This

    includes

    visual

    analytics

    systems

    that

    help

    business

    practitioners to analyze and interpret gathered IoT data.

    Business

    intelligence

    embedded

    dashboards

    aid

    in

    presenting the retrieved IoT information in a meaningful

    manner. Automated and warnings-based systems conduct a

    predeﬁned data analysis that assists in highlighting risky

    situations through alerts and warnings. For example, IoT-

    based real-time environmental monitoring systems can track

    pollutants and chemicals’ levels in the air within an industrial

    city. Warning notiﬁcations are then subsequently sent to

    citizens within the affected geofenced area indicating health

    risk hazards. Reactive-based systems may take a step forward

    towards performing actions described through rule-based

    languages that are carried out when speciﬁc conditions are

    met. For instance, smart lighting IoT-based systems may

    switch off the lights in a speciﬁc building area if no one is

    present, which is indicated by infrared occupancy sensors

    (Wang et al., 2017).

    4.3 Predictive maintenance

    Utilizing

    IoT

    applications

    has

    incredibly

    reduced

    maintenance costs, in particular in the industrial sector. For

    example, industrial equipment manufacturing that embed

    sensors in heavy machinery integrate with analytical tools to

    monitor the operational efﬁcacy, detect faults or failures, and

    provide a full assessment of the operating condition (Mobley,

    2002). This comprehensive performance evaluation occurs on a

    regular basis to maintain the system’s efﬁciency and initiates

    maintenance if needed. This procedure is known as Predictive

    Maintenance (PdM), or condition-based maintenance, and it

    employs diagnostics and prognostics data to spot early signs of

    failure, allowing the system to operate as intended (Zonta et al.,

    2020). Furthermore, PdM can estimate degradation of the

    equipment and predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of

    equipment, which reduces the maintenance costs to the

    minimum and assures service availability. According to Selcuk

    (Selcuk, 2017), IoT-based predictive maintenance increases the

    return on investment by 10 times, where this approach increases

    the total production by 15%–70% and reduces the maintenance

    costs by 25%–30%. Although PdM successfully reduces the cost

    of production and maintenance, it is expensive to implement due

    to the high cost of the hardware and software required to

    effectively incorporate the PdM into the system. Moreover,

    the quality of the training services and the amount of data

    required to ensure the efﬁcacy of the PdM performance can

    be challenging (Compare et al., 2019).

    4.4 Operation optimization and

    automation

    Industry 4.0 is transitioning from a concept-based approach

    into a market reality. Through the integration of intelligent and

    computerized robotic devices into many aspects of industry

    verticals (e.g., 3D printing, E-sports) that can assist in

    automating and optimizing the manufacturing operations.

    This allows accurate, timely and cost effective completed

    manufacturing processes among a set of machines with

    minimal or no human interventions. In addition to decrease

    in

    cost-related

    operations

    through

    effective

    inventory

    management and energy consumption optimization. Effective

    inventory management in logistics and supply chain sectors is

    obtained through the integration of IoT with Radio Frequency

    Identiﬁcation (RFID) (Tan and Sidhu, 2022) and barcode

    scanners.

    Furthermore, IoT technologies within business automation

    can efﬁciently be used for controlling and monitoring machines’

    manufacturing operations, performance and rate of productivity

    through internet connectivity. Moreover, real-time analysis

    generated from onsite IoT-based sensors provides valuable

    insights to initiate more efﬁcient ways for decreasing cost-

    related

    operational

    expenses

    and

    safety-related/unplanned

    maintenance

    issues.

    For

    example,

    incases

    of

    machine

    operational failures, an IoT-based system can promptly send a

    machine repair request to the maintenance department for

    handling the issue. Furthermore, with the introduction of IoT

    technologies, business revenues are subsequently expected to

    increase

    due

    to

    the

    incremental

    rise

    in

    operational

    productivity. This can be achieved through analyzing three

    critical aspects including operational data, timing and the

    reasons for any production issues. This allows business leaders

    to be focused on their high-level core business objectives with a

    well-deﬁned automated workﬂow.

    4.5 Enhanced customer experience

    Connected environments enable businesses to adopt a user-

    centric approach which utilizes IoT technologies for enhanced

    overall customer experience and extend the customers’ loyalty

    towards their services and products. IoT-driven businesses are

    the gateway to futuristic enhanced digital customer experience

    and prolonged loyalty which are considered one of the primary

    laser-focus objectives by many brands. The drive towards more

    personalized services and applications by customers urge many

    enterprises to increase services for customer engagement through

    the use of artiﬁcial intelligence-based customer support systems

    for real-time assistance.

    The aforementioned notion of providing level up services

    that

    incorporate

    personalized

    experiences

    initiated

    many

    innovative applications and services. As such, omnichannel

    customers’ applications and products such as smart-based

    home

    appliances

    and

    devices

    including

    Alexa-supported

    devices,

    Nest

    Thermostat

    and

    intelligent

    Ring

    Doorbell

    cameras

    that

    enable

    customers

    to

    use

    voice

    assisted

    technologies along with IoT to control various aspects of their

    home intelligently. Moreover, ubiquitous smart wearable devices

    such as ﬁtness trackers that collect real-time health data related to

    customer behavior and daily routines to enhance customer

    experience. For instance, providing customers with real-time

    personalized notiﬁcations according to their daily activities.

    Figure 6 demonstrates the users-centric experience among

    various IoT services and applications.

    However, privacy and security data leakage are still

    considered a major challenge that many researchers and

    developers are trying to ﬁnd innovative and tangible solutions

    to secure personal information when shared for improved service

    and application experiences.

    4.6 Asset tracking and monitoring

    Introducing artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) into IoT applications

    has

    created

    signiﬁcant

    opportunities

    for

    innovations

    in

    Frontiers in The Internet of Things

    frontiersin.org

    12

    Elgazzar et al.

    10.3389/friot.2022.1073780

    automation and asset tracking domains. Companies and labour-

    intensive corporations are investing in autonomous working

    environments with less human interaction, and the demand

    for AI and context-aware systems has drastically increased.

    Whereas in times similar to the coronavirus pandemic,

    factories and workplaces have entirely shut down because of

    lockdown measures to prevent human interactions. The fusion

    between AI and IoT transitioned traditional industry models to

    the industry 5.0 revolution. AI and IoT as core technologies to

    industry 5.0 along with wireless sensor networks result in more

    beneﬁts to industries like using analytical techniques to provide

    predictive maintenance notiﬁcations directly affecting downtime,

    improving workforce and increasing production efﬁciency. IoT

    sensors and devices can perceive and sense their environment

    through high-level technologies, such as laser scanners, cameras

    and image processing, movement and proximity. Therefore, real-

    time

    decisions

    are

    made

    autonomously

    regarding

    object

    identiﬁcation

    and

    asset

    tracking

    by

    coupling

    these

    technologies (i.e., image-recognition software). Similarly, IoT

    applications based on AI algorithms can learn and think

    logically about different operations that require problem-

    solving schemes. Autonomous applications operate based on

    the receding-strategy approach, where new and old control

    inputs are carried out simultaneously through computing the

    new control inputs and executing the old ones. The application

    creates these control inputs to provide real-time performance

    based on three hierarchical levels. The higher level is concerned

    with deﬁning complex operations, for example, GPS waypoints

    for an autonomous device (e.g., robot) to follow. The other two

    (mid and lower) levels are precisely related to creating and

    tracking a reference trajectory for this course, respectively.

    The safety of the robot is the responsibility of the mid-level

    controller

    (Vaskov

    et

    al.,

    2019).

    More

    concisely,

    safety

    concerning collision avoidance among a group of automated

    robots performing a speciﬁc task can be avoided by sharing their

    perceived data. Other communications that involve Human-

    Robotic communication are based on the models, such as

    imitative learning and artiﬁcial neural networks.

    5 Open challenges

    5.1 Device and data heterogeneity

    The versatility of IoT devices and sensor nodes in various ﬁelds

    has given rise to many applications. While deep learning, AI, and

    many other enabling technologies assist IoT devices in learning by

    experience and adapting to new environmental inputs to be able to

    conduct complex operations. However, the reliance on receiving

    data representing the context of the environment surroundings

    speciﬁc to the IoT application requires a signiﬁcant number of

    different sensors and devices. Individual sensors or applications

    provide limited cognition and visibility of the surrounding

    environments. Therefore, integrating various sensors is essential

    in context-aware applications. Furthermore, the diversiﬁcation of

    sensor nodes and devices raised numerous challenges in the research

    FIGURE 6

    User-centric IoT application scenarios.

    Frontiers in The Internet of Things

    10.3389/friot.2022.1073780

    community and the industry with respect to uniﬁcation and

    standardization. In public sensing, different types of sensors are

    used (e.g., RFID, Ultrasonic, Cameras, Lidars, etc.) to solve

    designated issues like real-time counting of people waiting to be

    served at a speciﬁc service provider. The same extends to IoT

    applications similar to the public sensing domain like trafﬁc

    management

    and

    predictions.

    Therefore,

    the

    demand

    for

    modular

    platforms

    with

    uniﬁed

    application

    programming

    interfaces (APIs), transmission protocols, data transformation

    and

    storage

    is

    growing.

    Moreover,

    data

    conversion

    and

    normalization

    operations

    carried

    out

    in

    applications

    with

    heterogeneous

    devices

    increase

    exponentially

    due

    to

    the

    diversiﬁed number of sensors utilized just for one application

    (e.g., autonomous vehicles).

    Behmann (Behmann and Wu, 2015) described current IoT

    solutions as point solutions where they are isolated and cannot

    interact with each other. Collaborative IoT (C-IoT) (Behmann

    and Wu, 2015) is a recent trend that is still unsaturated and needs

    more effort to be deployed in real-world scenarios. Sharing the

    infrastructure and data becomes inevitable to pave the way for

    C-IoT systems. C-IoT can create an expandable ecosystem, and

    the IoT community will solve complicated problems by relying

    on the collaboration between IoT systems. For instance, an

    ambulance in the emergency state can always have a green

    light on its way if the emergency service can share the

    ambulance’s route with the city’s intelligent trafﬁc system

    using the shared infrastructure of C-IoT. Recently, an active

    movement to have a uniﬁed standard in different IoT layers has

    been raised for a few years to mitigate incompatibility challenges

    faced by the C-IoT trend.

    5.2 Interoperability

    The diversity of IoT devices in the perception layer brings the

    ﬂexibility to build customized IoT solutions and cherrypick the

    appropriate device for a speciﬁc task that matches constraints

    regarding the accuracy, cost, compatibility with the existing

    infrastructure, etc. However, this also comes at the cost of the

    absence of a uniﬁed ecosystem for IoT. This results in

    interoperability issues between different IoT systems and

    increased development time to get diverse IoT devices to act

    as a coherent system. Besides, it leads to the notorious “isolated

    islands” of miniature IoT subsystems based on the brand of

    devices or their enabling technologies, hindering the utilization

    of sensed information by different systems to its maximum and

    impeding the potential promise of IoT.

    5.3 User and data privacy

    The constituent IoT gadgets of an IoT system typically

    consist of consumer electronics (e.g., smart TVs) and wearable

    devices (e.g., smart watches) that gather a lot of information

    about people, which was previously hard to collect. Gathered data

    by IoT devices may include personal information of the users

    (e.g., name, birthdate, etc.), their biometric information (e.g.,

    ﬁngerprint, voice recognition, etc.), and their preferences (e.g.,

    eating habits, preferred movie genres, etc.), which are usually part

    of the device’s initial setup, registration to its cloud platform, or

    for the device to be able to perform its smart designated task

    efﬁciently. Moreover, advanced IoT systems typically involve the

    aggregation

    of

    numerous

    pieces

    of

    information

    from

    heterogeneous smart objects, which is known as “sensor

    fusion” (Abdelmoneem et al., 2018) to provide accurate and

    comprehensive data about the environment, including people

    themselves, to help make better informed decisions. Thanks to

    the

    advancements

    in

    artiﬁcial

    intelligence

    (AI)

    domain

    technologies which can leverage granular data collected by

    smart objects to generate inferences that would not be

    achievable with coarser data from individual smart objects.

    This intelligence imparted to IoT catalyzes its wide adaption

    and makes it quite useful in different application domains.

    However, user privacy concerns are still an open challenge to

    IoT that impedes its widespread adoption and limits its potential

    promise. IoT systems can disclose identiﬁable information about

    people without their consent. Therefore, amidst the potential

    promise of IoT to change the way we deal with our surroundings,

    users are mostly worried about the potential of private

    information leakage (Chanal and Kakkasageri, 2020). They are

    worried about who owns their data and how it is utilized.

    Nonetheless,

    the

    notorious

    correlation

    between

    service

    providers and device vendors on one hand, and data brokers

    on the other hand, raises concerns about the possibility of their

    personal information being disclosed for non-public interest

    objectives. People frequently alter their behavior when they

    suspect

    that

    their

    identiﬁable

    information

    and

    activity

    footprints are being monitored, which reduces their freedom,

    changes their lifestyle, and makes them sceptical of IoT. In the

    following subsections, we review data privacy concerns that are

    associated with IoT.

    5.3.1 De-identiﬁcation of IoT data

    Generally, it is prohibited to make datasets that include

    identiﬁable personal information publicly accessible. One

    common way to prevent exposing personal information in

    datasets is to avoid gathering information that could be used

    to identify people in the ﬁrst place and whenever possible.

    For example, PIR sensors could be used for occupancy

    detection

    rather

    than

    surveillance

    cameras.

    However,

    given the penetration of IoT in a lot of domains with

    differentiated requirements, it is usually hard, or even

    impossible,

    to

    preclude

    the

    inclusion

    of

    identiﬁable

    information in gathered datasets by IoT. In this context,

    de-identiﬁcation (Kim and Park, 2022) is the process used to

    anonymize identiﬁable personal information from datasets,

    challenging.

    Hashing

    algorithms

    are

    commonly used to pseudonymize identiﬁable information

    in datasets by replacing identiﬁed people in a dataset with

    their unique hash token. However, since different datasets

    often have a lot in common, it is usually easy to ﬁgure out

    who the hashed information belongs to using inference

    techniques.

    5.3.2 Consent

    Consent (O’Connor et al., 2017) is the typical justiﬁcation for

    businesses to collect, use, and disclose personal information.

    However, consent often matters more than just unconsciously

    clicking the “I agree” button by the end user on the “Terms and

    Conditions” statement page of a device. Rather, consent that is

    meaningful and effective requires well-deﬁned and ﬁnely-grained

    structured objectives that the user should be able to choose from.

    Moreover, one can not presume that consent will last forever.

    Therefore, consent methods should represent a single acceptance

    at a single moment in time, which may not be suitable for the

    continual nature of IoT. Also, given the interoperability nature of

    the IoT, where a smart sensor node may be utilised by different

    systems with different privacy policies, an individual can not

    grant meaningful permission for the use of their personal data for

    vague or broad purposes.

    5.4 Vendor lock-in

    IoT vendors and service providers typically maintain the

    security of their active devices or services by regularly providing

    ﬁrmware patches and system updates that address security

    vulnerability issues that continually emerge. However, they

    often

    have

    different

    expectations

    about

    how

    long

    their

    products or services will last than the people who buy them.

    For instance, vendors may terminate technical support or

    ﬁrmware maintainability of a device, or the service provider

    may discontinue the service that the device relies on to operate,

    far before the end user plans to retire the device. This usually

    comes at the cost of possible security holes, privacy issues, and

    vendor lock-in (Fantacci et al., 2014). Therefore, customers

    would have to stick with their active line of products and

    services to keep their systems safe and operational because

    suppliers would no longer care about security and privacy

    issues with their retired devices or have the skills to deal

    with them.

    5.5 Device management

    The “plug and play” feature that usually accompanies IoT

    devices makes them user-friendly since customers can

    seamlessly get them up and running effortlessly without

    the need for complicated setup procedures. However, this

    sometimes comes at the cost of potential user privacy

    exposure since the default setup of devices usually comes

    with

    insufﬁcient

    privacy

    and

    security

    precautions.

    Nonetheless, the fact that a gadget is an IoT device that

    can collect personal information and send it to third parties

    over the cloud may not be even realized by the majority of

    non-technically savvy customers by default. In addition,

    most IoT customers ﬁnd it hard and time-consuming to

    adjust the privacy settings for each device in the system.

    This is because IoT does not have a standard ecosystem and is

    often

    made

    up

    of

    many

    devices

    from

    different

    manufacturers,

    each

    with

    their

    own

    user

    experience

    interface.

    5.6 Accountability

    The extensive and distributed nature of IoT systems, which

    typically include different service providers that handle the collected

    data to achieve the designated task of the system, makes it

    challenging to precisely determine who is responsible for what.

    In order to achieve a robust and highly reliable IoT system

    architecture, system designers usually follow a common system

    architectural model that is known as “microservices” (Butzin

    et al., 2016). They divide the ultimate task of the system into

    small independent tasks, each of which may utilize numerous

    services from different service providers that communicate over

    well-deﬁned APIs. However, this raises privacy concerns because the

    collected

    data,

    which

    may

    contain

    personally

    identiﬁable

    information about users, is now handled and commonly stored

    by various third-party organizations with hazy boundaries that may

    apply different privacy policies.

    5.7 Transparency

    The tiny size of most IoT devices in use today without a

    screen, or at least an adequate screen size to display a lot of textual

    information, makes it difﬁcult for users to review their privacy

    policies before they start using them. In order to review the

    privacy policies of these devices, however, users should login to

    the website of the manufacturer of the device or use a proprietary

    software or a mobile application for the device. However, in

    either case, given the heterogeneous nature of the IoT and the

    anticipated large number of IoT devices people use on a daily

    basis, it looks extremely challenging to follow the privacy policy

    of each encountered device. Also, a lot of privacy policies for IoT

    devices seem vague to the majority of people. Moreover, some

    IoT devices that exist in organizations and public settings are

    usually anonymous without details about the type of information

    they collect or how this information is utilized and for which

    objectives. Also, most of the time, users do not have the option to

    stop the collection.

    5.8 Security (data and device vulnerability)

    IoT devices exchange data with millions of devices through the

    internet

    which

    implicitly

    exposes

    the

    IoT

    devices

    to

    the

    vulnerabilities and security threats of the Internet protocol stack

    (Ilyas et al., 2020). The amount of data collected, stored and shared

    between IoT devices and the service providers are expected to grow

    signiﬁcantly. Besides the extraordinary amount of data produced by

    IoT devices, they induce evidently high-security risks and potential

    cyberattacks destabilizing many applications and industries.

    IoT networks come with their unique security challenges

    (Khanam et al., 2020), where each layer is exposed to certain

    types of attacks (Hassija et al., 2019), like Distributed Denial of

    Service attacks (DDoS) on the network layer. To that extent, a

    multitude of surveys citerefs2 and studies have been conducted to

    expose existing security threats and vulnerabilities in current IoT

    applications. Recent surveys on IoT data and device security

    emphasize that the gap between applying existing security

    techniques to emerging IoT applications is growing signiﬁcantly.

    The security gaps in IoT applications are categorized into vendor-

    related security issues and available resources or capabilities on the

    IoT nodes. IoT vendors for sensors and devices are moving towards

    low-cost manufacturing that lack security features. Similarly, the

    heterogeneity of the IoT applications, protocols, and hardware

    increases the security scope of threats in IoT applications

    (Hassija et al., 2019). On the other hand, IoT applications are

    inherently constrained by the limited processing and storage

    capabilities

    of

    devices

    to

    carry

    out

    sophisticated

    security

    techniques. Therefore, new security measures are introduced for

    IoT resource-constrained devices using robust ML techniques like

    the TinyML framework. The concepts introduced behind the

    integration of ML is to increase the ﬂexibility of IoT nodes in

    defending against emerging security threats (Dutta and Kant, 2021).

    IoT devices can then train the deployed ML models to work against

    new security threats.

    5.9 Open deployments and access control

    Mentioning the access control usually ﬂashed RFID (Radio-

    frequency identiﬁcation) cards. RFID technology sparked the

    existence of the IoT term coined by Kevin Ashton, who

    considered RFID a vital component in The IoT systems. Access

    control as an open challenge is a multifaceted challenge that has been

    raised due to other issues. In this section, we use a wallet holding

    many RFID cards as an example to discuss the access control issues:

    • Heterogeneity: Having many cards to access different

    purposes itself is due to the heterogeneity of the

    systems. There are chances to have a consensus among

    some corporations to unify their access cards to mitigate

    this challenge. For instance, Google Pay is an android

    application that offers contactless purchases on the

    smartphone with a built-in Near Field Communication

    NFC module. Users can register debit or credit cards and

    use them in their daily in-person shopping instead of

    holding many bank cards in wallets. Due to systems

    heterogeneity, we still face a challenge in making all

    services accessible from uniﬁed access.

    • Security: Giving accessibility to banks a counting using

    contactless RFID bank cards looks a very smooth user

    experience in transactions instead of writing sixteen digits

    in card readers. However, card skimming devices can clone

    contactless bank cards.

    To discuss the other issues in access control, we use a smart

    home application as another example facing access control

    challenges:

    • Interoperability: Recently, users can simply control

    their IoT devices in their houses, such as smart TV,

    fridge, coffee machine, and adapted light systems. The

    interoperability between these devices is still very

    challenging due to the lack of standardization. For

    instance, a coffee machine starts pouring coffee on a

    cup if the adapted light senses a motion in the living

    room, and there is a collaborative integration between

    these devices. ThingsDriver (Elewah et al., 2022) is a

    beginning to have A Uniﬁed Interoperable messaging

    protocol that, if adopted by cooperates, can pave the

    way to have a collaborative environment.

    • Privacy: All these smart home devices become remotely

    accessible through user-friendly user interfaces such as a

    smartwatch or phone. On the other side, the ﬂexibility of

    accessibility raises privacy concerns. Residents’ data are

    highly vulnerable to being breached by unauthorized

    access.

    6 Conclusion

    In this paper, we review the Internet of Things technology

    from different architectural, technological, operational and

    value-proposition perspectives. We ﬁrst shed the light on the

    deﬁnition, acclaimed value and potential, and unique features

    and characteristics compared to similar previous technologies

    and standard layered architecture. We then highlight the

    different applications of IoT in various life domains that

    primarily beneﬁt from its realization as a novel computing

    paradigm. We outlined the grand challenges facing IoT which

    may cause slowdown in its widespread adoption at the individual,

    organizational and governmental levels.

    We believe the IoT will continue to grow as a disruptive

    technology that changed the world and it will never be the same

    again. There is a continuously increasing reliance on IoT

    technology in different sectors of our life for its convenience

    and innovative applications stemming out of it. Individuals and

    enterprises started to gain conﬁdence in the technology and

    overlook or ignore the downsides of its security and privacy

    aspects. However, we also believe that the emergence of Edge

    computing in its different forms and shapes has contributed to

    lower the adoption barriers of IoT and increased interest in its

    technology and smart services. We anticipate that in the next few

    years IoT will continue to penetrate deeper in various sectors and

    tape into more industrial and governmental settings.

    Abstract: Wastewater management is a mechanism that is used to extract and reﬁne
    pollutants

    from wastewater or drainage that can be recycled to the water supply with minimal
    environmental

    effects. New methods and techniques are required to ensure safe and smart wastewater
    management

    systems in smart cities because of the present deteriorating environmental state.
    Wireless sensor

    networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) represent promising wastewater treatment
    technologies.

    The elaborated literature survey formulates a conceptual framework with an Internet
    of Things

    (IoT)-based wastewater management system in smart cities (IoT-WMS) using blockchain
    technology.

    Blockchain technology is now being used to store information to develop an incentive
    model for

    encouraging the reuse of wastewater. Concerning the quality and quantity of recycled
    wastewater,

    tokens are issued to households/industries in smart cities. Nevertheless, this
    often encourages

    tampering with the information from which these tokens are awarded to include
    certain rewards.

    Anomaly detector algorithms are used to identify the possible IoT sensor data
    which has been

    tampered with by intruders. The model employs IoT sensors together with quality
    metrics to measure

    the amount of wastewater produced and reused. The simulation analysis shows that
    the proposed

    method achieves a high wastewater recycling rate of 96.3%, an efﬁciency ratio
    of 88.7%, a low moisture

    content ratio of 32.4%, an increased wastewater reuse of 90.8%, and a prediction
    ratio of 92.5%.

    1. Introduction

    Water must be safe enough to be used for drinking, washing, and industrial use.

    Wastewater is any water that needs cleaning after use. The purpose of wastewater
    man-

    agement is to preserve wastewater [1]. Untreated wastewater chemicals and pathogens

    can harm animals, plants, and birds that live in or near the water. Healthy wastewater

    management helps to reuse the water volume instead of waste it [2]. Thus, it contaminates

    crops and drinking water which impacts human health. Wastewater is a water supply
    with

    many uses, when correctly processed [3]. Treatment of wastewater is essential
    to protect

    many different habitats [4]. The beneﬁcial use of wastewater often decreases the
    impacts

    of wastewater or industrial efﬂuent contamination on the environment. The end
    usage of

    wastewater deﬁnes the appropriate water quality and safety control procedures
    [5].

    Increased urbanization poses a danger of water shortages. Safe drinking water
    is

    one of the basic human needs. This refers to the notion of wastewater reuse and
    recy-

    cling [6]. The recycled wastewater is contained in an underground sump, and it
    is used

    for planting water. Using recycled water eliminates the dependence on ever costlier
    and

    cheaper groundwater for such applications [7] and will minimize the overﬂow and
    reduce

    wastewater discharge into rivers and oceans. Similar treatment standards occur
    for speciﬁc

    applications of water [8]. Treated and recycled wastewater offers an inexpensive
    supply

    that eliminates the demand and burden on freshwater supplies such as groundwater,
    rivers,

    and reservoirs [9]. In the areas impacted by water shortages and drought, this
    is especially

    relevant. Wastewater that is not extracted and recycled is often discharged into
    the wide

    water bodies [10]. The recycling of wastewater is the best way to prevent potential
    water

    depletion and minimize contamination that harms the ecosystem. Untreated wastewater

    does not automatically decompose [11].

    Wastewater treatment is used to extract pollutants from waste or sewage and transform

    them into wastewater that can be reused for other uses (called water recovery)
    or added to

    the water supply with an associated environmental impact [12]. In a basic central
    device

    setup, a wireless sensor network is required, with the base terminal operating
    as the central

    hub [13]. The data are obtained, preserved, and analyzed afterwards. The hardware

    comprises a pump, a ﬂuidic chamber, and various sensor nodes for tracking the
    ﬂuid’s

    color changes [14]. The change of color is tracked independently in the channel
    cabinet and

    the bulk solution. To track atmospheric conditions such as light levels and temperature,

    sensor nodes are often used [15]. An experiment showed the usefulness of wireless
    sensing

    in controlling water puriﬁcation treatments.

    Through detecting and avoiding mixed sewage and chemical overﬂows in wastewater

    using IoT sensors, intelligent wastewater systems can satisfy the demand for freshwater

    within the smart community of the IoT. Freshwater is one of the most valuable
    natural

    commodities that is not available every day. The IoT uses the concept of sensing
    devices

    installed at different points in the water environment for aquatic care [16].
    These sensors

    capture and transmit data to surveillance systems. These data may include the
    water

    quality, temperature changes, pressure changes, water leakage detection, and chemical

    leakage detection. These sensors capture and transmit data to surveillance systems.
    A smart

    water sensor powered by the IoT can monitor the water quality, pressure, and temperature.

    In reality, a sensor solution can control the ﬂuid ﬂow throughout the treatment
    plant and

    can be used by a water utility provider. Using blockchain technologies to monitor
    these

    connections can efﬁciently analyze quantity communications, identify breaches
    in water

    mass balance management, and improve leak detection. If registered data can be
    changed

    retroactively in any particular block without modifying all additional blocks
    that need to

    be agreed by most networks, transaction process transparency and reliable and
    effective

    data management can be instantly enabled. Without the use of blockchain, the system
    will

    require a centralized repository and will be vulnerable to security threats. Moreover,
    it is

    difﬁcult to incentivize the recycling and reuse of wastewater in industries and
    households

    without the concept of tokens/credits in the form of a cryptocurrency. The wastewater

    treatment anomaly detection algorithm is used to diagnose irregular actions (anomalies)

    and water activities not seen regularly. These can result from attacks on control
    components,

    a network, or the physical surroundings; failures; misconﬁgurations; or even standard
    bugs

    in the IoT sensors. Therefore, the ability to detect anomalies acts as a protective
    tool and

    helps to build and sustain.

    The signiﬁcant contributions of this paper include:

    1.

    Designing an IoT-WMS for wastewater re-treatment and management to fulﬁl the

    water needs in a smart city.

    2.

    Suggesting a blockchain technology for the reuse of wastewater in smart cities.

    3.

    The anticipated cost-effectiveness and reliability of outputs compared to the
    current

    model undoubtedly eliminates conventional worldwide wastewater management.

    The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 1 introduces the concept
    of

    wastewater management in a smart city. Section 2 presents a discussion on related
    work.

    Section 3 explores the IoT-WMS framework to improve wastewater management and

    encourage recycling wastewater in smart cities. Section 4 elaborates on the results
    and

    discussion based on an analysis in Section 3. Section 5 concludes the research
    with some

    future perspectives.

    in smart

    cities with the adjacent Rurban Cluster based on the developed framework. The

    visualized the water, energy, and food linkages between the urban and rural divide.

    H. K. Pandey et al. [18] suggested the GIS and water quality index for groundwater

    quality assessments of a smart city. A water quality index and geographic information

    system was used to determine groundwater samples’ physico-chemical parameters
    for

    drinking purposes. The contamination level in the area was exacerbated by groundwater

    exploitation, urban planning, and anthropogenic practices.

    B. Essex et al. [19] introduced the national blueprint framework (NBA) for the

    able Development Goals to monitor progress on water-related goals in Europe. The
    17 Sus-

    tainable Development Goals (SDGs), endorsed by 169 countries, face signiﬁcant
    obsta-

    cles in adoption by national governments. A national blueprint framework (NBF)
    with

    24 water-related indicators based on SDG Six, each with a speciﬁc goal, was created.

    María C et al. [20] inferred wastewater management using paradigm shifts and current

    challenges. Wastewater is a major environmental and public health concern, and
    since

    ancient times, its management has been a relentless task. In recent decades, drainage

    analysis has grown exponentially. This paper offered a global review of growing
    wastewater

    science to recognize existing problems and paradigm shifts. Wastewater studies
    can answer

    global issues, such as the public approval of water conservation or access for
    almost

    one-third of the world’s population to basic sanitation.

    The authors of [21] developed decentralized wastewater based on a management

    policy gap analysis. On-site wastewater treatment (OWTS) schemes have been planned

    for the decentralization of wastewater on site. The study indicates a lack of
    coordination

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2590

    4 of 14

    between land use and water baseline preparation, efﬁciency priorities, system
    inventories,

    public outreach, homeowner education, routine inspections, and maintenance processes.

    In [22], the author suggests a cyber-physical systems management framework (CPSMF)

    for real-time control of the urban underwater cycle. Vital infrastructure, or
    urban life

    functioning, needs to be installed in the urban water cycle (UWC), including the
    water

    supply systems and the urban drainage system (UDS). This paper suggests a CPS-based

    management framework that allows control, interoperability, and automated optimization

    of the UWC to maximize the beneﬁts from CPSs.

    The author of [5] introduces Big Data analytics and the IoT into operation safety

    management underwater. An intelligent society such as a smart city is deﬁned by
    a place

    where people live well, plan their lives long term, ensure sustainability, and
    do the least

    harm to the physical environment by ICTs. This paper analyses the Supervisory
    Controller

    and Data Acquirement (SCADA) approach to sustainable smart city water treatment
    based

    on the Internet of Things and Big Data Analytics. Big data analysis is a new technological

    term implying the processing of vast volumes of relevant data from installed IoT
    sensors to

    monitor the device’s physical status, utilization, and efﬁciency.

    Seongpil Jeong et al. [23] used a Water Metabolism Framework (WMF) to evaluate
    ur-

    ban water management in a comparative analysis of three regions. In Korea and
    elsewhere,

    sustainable water conservation focuses on water conservation and reuse, as the
    climate

    and environmental transitions raise the importance of water insecurity. In Ulsan,
    water

    is being abstracted. The river’s water supply is less sustainable and more vulnerable
    to

    weather threats than Seoul, thus making Ulsan’s water infrastructure less sustainable
    and

    more vulnerable.

    Oriana Landa-Cansigno et al. [24] discussed the integrated framework of the urban

    water metabolism (UWM) and the water–energy–pollution nexus (WEPN) for an efﬁciency

    evaluation of water recycling techniques. This paper analyses metabolic efﬁciency
    and its

    effect on a variety of centralized and decentralized water reuse policies and
    the WEPN on

    integral UWSs. The ﬁndings suggest a metabolism measurement of the output in a
    complex

    system such as an UWS will illustrate the degree of the interactions among the
    nexus (e.g.,

    water, energy, and pollution) components.

    IoT-based systems employed in applications similar to wastewater management sys-

    tems, e.g., air quality monitoring systems, exhibit a loss in accuracy compared
    to the

    traditional measurement systems due to missing values and noisy data. The authors
    of [25]

    improved the prediction accuracy of a real-world IoT-based air quality monitoring
    system

    using a hybrid edge–cloud preprocessing framework.

    3. Proposed Model: IoT-Based Wastewater Management System (IoT-WMS)

    The prospect of water shortages is worrying as population growth rises. This has

    sparked the notion of wastewater reuse and recycling. Sensors may therefore be
    used

    for processing and monitoring at various stages of wastewater management. A com-

    prehensive literature survey leads the research for developing an IoT-WMS framework.

    The IoT-WMS concentrates on cloud security using blockchain technology for the
    intelli-

    gent wastewater management schemes followed by smart cities. This IoT-WMS proposes
    a

    trading system based on the use of blockchain rewards for wastewater recycling.
    Every

    household/industry in the smart city enables the IoT-based wastewater management
    strat-

    egy with sensors and actuators. The basic conceptual structure of the IoT in wastewater

    management for smart cities is shown in Figure 1.

    Figure 1 shows the wastewater management cycle with efﬁcient cloud data visualiza-

    tion for decision making. The decision support system performs token (cryptocurrency)

    allocation to households/industries regarding the volume of recycled wastewater.
    Based

    on their requirement to reach a minimum threshold volume, households/industries
    later

    resell these tokens. In a smart contract, the guidelines for the token exchange
    are estab-

    lished. Data stored on a blockchain-enabled cloud give inviolable auditing. The
    smart

    contracts often provide an automatic tracking framework with a secure cloud. Supervised

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2590

    5 of 14

    and unsupervised learning algorithms are used to detect the manipulation of information

    on wastewater recycling in IoT meters by individuals to ensure the robustness
    of this

    model. Effective home automation allows the best usage of water and thereby increases

    the performance of the water delivery system and its services. For anomaly identiﬁcation,

    this study utilizes a polynomial regression analysis algorithm. This anomaly monitoring

    model has been implemented to detect theft in energy consumption power meters.
    The

    time-series data are the meter readings, so a sequential learning model has been
    considered

    in this work. The IoT helps gain access to knowledge and makes signiﬁcant decisions
    by

    obtaining various sensor values such as soil moisture, water levels, etc.

    Figure 1. Domestic wastewater management cycle in smart cities.

    3.1. Wastewater Management Architecture with Blockchain Technology

    The smart wastewater management framework based on blockchain technology con-

    sists of ﬁve layers, as shown in Figure 2.

    The ﬁrst layer, named the sensor layer, establishes the various IoT sensors for
    mon-

    itoring water usage and wastewater recycling. The data captured through these
    sensors

    are considered in the second layer called the data collection layer. In this layer,
    various

    industry/household facilities from layer 1, such as pipelines attached with level
    gauges,

    water meters attached water storage tanks, and smart wastewater treatment units
    ﬁtted

    with IoT-based intelligent objects, are able to sense, track, analyze, acquire,
    and interact

    with data concerning the level of water storage, the quantity of water usage,
    the volume

    of wastewater generation, and its recycling volume. The gathered information is
    further

    transmitted to the third layer, the edge computing layer attached with edge nodes/smart

    gateways, through accessible internet services such as WiFi, 4G, and 5G for computation,

    decision making, collaborative ﬁltering, and transient data storage over a preconﬁgured

    period of time. Using the edge nodes, the aggregated data items are validated
    through

    smart contracts and added to the blockchain. The edge nodes hand over the validated
    data

    units to the cloud server in the fourth layer: the wastewater blockchain located
    on cloud-

    based servers responsible for collecting, storing, processing, monitoring, and
    managing

    blockchain-technology-assisted security operations handling massive data produced
    from

    different IoT-enabled smart cities. In the ﬁfth layers, frameworks for the management
    and

    monitoring of wastewater treatment for recycling and reuse are present. Through
    smart

    contracts, all parties interested in smart city wastewater management and monitoring
    are

    capable of querying the stored information in the blockchain-enabled cloud. For
    example,

    authorized people can access and visualize the data for decision making.

    Conceptual Workﬂow of IoT-WMS

    The IoT-WMS framework’s main objective is to oversee and manage the volume

    of smart city wastewater recycling remotely using a wastewater treatment unit
    that ex-

    tracts hazardous chemical liquids maintained by each household/industry in a smart
    city.

    The following are a detailed description of various phases involved in the above
    process:

    Phase 1:

    Smart IoT sensors and actuators are mounted on various observation decks and

    administration devices related to water ﬂow and level monitoring, water collection
    units,

    and wastewater treatment units.

    Phase 2:

    The deployed IoT devices will identify, process, and collect the water storage
    level,

    usage volume, and wastewater recycling in wastewater treatment. The gathered infor-

    mation is communicated to edge devices/nodes through smart gateways with acceptable

    technological innovations such as 4G, 5G, and WiFi.

    Phase 3:

    The edge nodes perform the aggregation of the information gathered by various

    database objects. Furthermore, by executing the authentication process, transient
    data will

    be stored on the blockchain. In parallel, for real-time analytics and decision
    making, it

    activates data processing at the edge nodes.

    Blockchain is a data structure that holds a database from distributed communication.

    Blockchain comprises four main elements that make up its entire architecture.
    The ﬁrst

    element, the decentralized network, is a peer-to-peer (P2P) link between sensor
    nodes.

    The interactions which happen in the system are managed by all the nodes. The
    next

    element, the distributed ledger, is an eternal, incorruptible, and publicly transparent

    archive distributed within network nodes with strengthened traceability. According
    to a

    consensus algorithm, the third element, trades, is checked and conﬁrmed through
    peers in

    the respective network. This assists the ledger in remaining consistent, which
    guarantees

    the ledger modiﬁcation when those network members accept it. The fourth element,
    smart

    contracts, deﬁnes the type of transactions that take place within the network.
    It helps

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2590

    7 of 14

    to exchange tokens/rewards between stakeholders, apply strategies, or deﬁne resource

    user privileges.

    As the application framework for implementing approved blockchain networks, Hy-

    perledger Fabric has been used [26–28]. It is an open-source, certiﬁed, distributed
    applica-

    tion framework built on blockchain that enables developers to create and deploy
    distributed

    services. The Composer tool is applicable for constructing the logic of the management

    platform. Smart contracts are distributed on all endorser nodes of the network
    in a Fabric

    network, and the peers check the transfers as shown in Figure 3. If the transaction
    is

    ofﬁcially accepted, it is attached to the ledger and then exchanged with all network
    nodes.

    An authorized blockchain guarantees that when they directly reach the network,
    sectors

    are validated. Except for Bitcoin or Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric employs a Kafka-based

    consensus rather than Proof-of-Work due to its computation cost. Proof-of-Work
    gives faith

    in a world of trustlessness. The application scenario in this research has a regulatory
    model

    for issuing tokens and rewards, so Proof-of-Work is not needed in this context.

    Figure 3. Flow of Hyperledger transaction.

    Phase 4:

    Each node responsible for validating data units earns a reward for every block
    to be

    authenticated and mined. These rewards (virtual tokens) are traded for different
    bene-

    ﬁts such as obtaining concessions on energy bills, tariffs, taxes, etc. Incentives
    are then

    incorporated into the scheme to encourage clients to support the wastewater management

    program in the smart city and invest in it.

    Phase 5:

    Using smart contracts, the validated data blocks can be submitted to cloud servers

    and logged to the blockchain. The cloud infrastructure can provide big data analysis
    and

    analytics capabilities on the collected data for future monitoring and decision
    making.

    Phase 6:

    Ultimately, to evaluate water consumption, the volume of toxic chemical liquids

    generated, treated, and disposed of by each household/industry in smart cities,
    various

    monitoring and management applications need to be created. In this phase, tokens,
    re-

    ferred to in the Hyperledger Composer as tradable cryptocurrencies, are distributed
    to

    households/industries in the smart city on the basis of their wastewater reuse
    output. The

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2590

    8 of 14

    most productive participant is considered a zero liquid spill strategy and a hundred
    percent

    wastewater is reused in its unit.

    (3)

    where Q f and Q

    ′

    f denote the quantity and quality factors, respectively. T represents the

    number of tokens to be issued, while a1 and a2 are constant values above the threshold

    values. Tokens are given in compliance with Equations (1)–(3), on the basis of
    the quality

    and quantity of wastewater recycling. For each participant, the threshold criterion
    for

    wastewater recycling differs due to the complexities in treating the various forms
    of toxins.

    When the participant surpasses the threshold, it can trade tokens to other participants
    who

    have not reached the ceiling. Similarly, tokens are often issued to promote greater
    purity of

    ﬁltered water based on efﬁciency.

    3.2. Anomaly Detection

    Anomaly detection is inevitable in IoT-WMS because it detects fraud tampering
    in

    the wastewater management sensor readings. This research extends the study with
    an

    algorithm as follows:

    Polynomial Regression Analysis

    Polynomial regression analysis is an algorithm that forms a relationship between
    two

    variables, such as the input variable (independent), I, and the output variable
    (dependent),

    O. The regression analysis relationship is deﬁned as a polynomial of I in x-th
    degree,

    as shown in (4):

    Om = τ +

    x

    ∑

    i=1

    µiIx

    m + ϵm,

    (4)

    where τ is the threshold reading value, µi denotes the regression factor for i
    ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . , x},

    and ϵm represents the error rate with m ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . , n} for n samples.
    If the squared

    difference between the real value and the expected value approaches the threshold
    set

    based on training results, the analysis model predicts the abnormality. The proposed
    IoT-

    WMS improves the quality of recycled water distributed in smart cities and achieves
    a high

    wastewater recycling rate and efﬁciency ratio, a lower moisture content ratio,
    improved

    wastewater reuse, and a higher prediction ratio.

    4. Simulation Results and Discussion

    The proposed IoT-WMS model monitors the recycled wastewater distribution in

    a smart city. Various parameters such as the wastewater recycling rate, the efﬁciency

    ratio, the moisture content ratio, the wastewater reuse ratio, and the prediction
    ratio have

    been considered using the proposed IoT-WMS method. The number of devices used
    for

    numerical simulations ranged from 5 to 30 in increments of 5. Each of these devices
    is

    assumed to have the capability of supporting up to 10 sensors. The simulation
    results

    averaged several random placements of sensors in a two-dimensional space. The
    devices

    are distributed in various stages of the wastewater management system, e.g., storage

    units, drainage units, recycling units, and water consumption units. A blockchain-based

    incentivization method is provided to various stakeholders in a model metropolitan
    area

    and its effect on the above parameters has been analyzed and compared with several

    existing approaches. Periodic monitoring of these parameters is performed using
    a cloud-

    based IoT system.

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2590

    4.1. Wastewater Recycling Rate

    The wastewater treatment method relies on different factors such as wastewater

    temperature, water velocity, water ﬂow, and pH. The productivity of the treatment
    plant

    improves if these parameters are kept within the necessary limits. These parameters
    must

    be carefully controlled to handle water efﬁciently. The IoT handles the wastewater.
    The IoT

    is a network that can link all devices embedded in electronic systems. Electronic
    IoT systems

    can interact and transfer information with each other. Several physical parameters
    can be

    tracked and communicated to linked equipment such as cell phones and laptops through

    different channels through sensors in wastewater treating plants, such as temperature,

    ﬂow rate, and water level sensors in various tanks. When the sensors sense anomalies

    above the acceptable thresholds of the physical parameters, the IoT can send a
    warning

    to the plant operator via a message or an e-mail and take a control action. Figure
    4 shows

    the wastewater recycling rate for our proposed approach as a function of the number
    of

    IoT devices deployed within a metropolitan area. The recycling rate is also compared

    with several state-of-the-art systems and it has been shown that the performance
    of the

    proposed IoT-WMS system is superior to the existing approaches. Moreover, the
    recycling

    rate improves as the number of deployed devices increases. In other words, the
    availability

    of more measurements and quality feedback helps improve the recycling rate.

    Figure 4. Wastewater recycling rate.

    4.2. Efﬁciency Ratio

    Effective wastewater collection (WC) is a key factor in smart cities’ service.
    Smart cities

    based on an integrated framework of new technologies can use the Internet of Things
    (IoT).

    Monitoring devices could be used as an assistive technology in wastewater collection
    to

    provide a high quality of service (QoS). The following IoT elements are directly
    integrated

    into ITS and waste disposal control systems: (i) RFID, (ii) sensors, (iii) camera,
    and (iv)

    actuators. We suggest IoT-WMS in this paper as an innovative solution to effectively
    store

    wastewater in smart cities. It includes a data management model for real-time
    monitoring

    of pipes to capture wastewater levels and leverage complex pathways.The system
    manages

    inadequate wastewater collection in inaccessible areas in smart cities. Surveillance
    cameras

    are used to capture the trouble areas and to supply the the controllers with evidence.

    The wastewater treatment scheme aims to provide the people of a smart city with
    a high

    standard of operation. Figure 5 shows the efﬁciency ratio for our proposed approach
    as a

    function of the number of IoT devices deployed within a metropolitan area. The
    efﬁciency

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2590

    10 of 14

    ratio is also compared with several state-of-the-art systems and it has been shown
    that

    the performance of the proposed IoT-WMS system is superior to the existing approaches.

    Moreover, the efﬁciency ratio improves as the number of deployed devices increases.

    In other words, the availability of more measurements and quality feedback helps
    improve

    the efﬁciency of the wastewater management system.

    Figure 5. Efﬁciency ratio.

    4.3. Moisture Content Ratio

    The proposed IoT-WMS covers numerous features such as GPS-based remote temper-

    ature and moisture sensing and irrigation equipment. It utilizes wireless sensor
    networks

    to record water characteristics and environmental factors continuously. There
    are multiple

    sensor nodes in a smart city at various points. These parameters are tracked from
    any

    remote computer or internet service, and interface sensors with IoT perform the
    opera-

    tions. This is mainly based on reducing water waste and minimizing manual work
    in the

    irrigation sector to save smart cities’ time, resources, and electricity. The
    system proposes

    to allow farmers to continually track the water levels in water tanks and humidity
    in the

    ﬁeld by remotely monitoring the supply on the internet. When the humidity falls
    below

    a certain level, drip irrigation will be automatically enabled, thereby ensuring
    maximum

    irrigation via the internet. Figure 6 shows the moisture content ratio as a function
    of the

    number of devices. It can be seen that the moisture content ratio is the lowest
    for our

    proposed scheme, with performance of our scheme closest to the UWM-WEPN approach.

    Furthermore, increasing the number of devices yields a lower moisture content
    ratio.

    4.4. Wastewater Reuse Ratio

    Blockchain or distributed ledger is a promising emerging platform that facilitates
    the

    use of a lack of water supplies to store and maintain. The concept of blockchain
    recon-

    ciliation may be a perfect case of inventive reasoning and opportunities for cooperation

    intended to examine the foundational problem of scarcity. The distributed ledger
    should be

    used not only for water use and control of water recovery but can also be used
    to promote

    wastewater sharing and rainwater harvesting for a more prosumer market. Blockchain

    could also be used to develop peer-to-peer water trading networks. Prosumers may
    receive

    wastewater for further treatment, reuse, recycling, and disposal over the water
    processing

    life cycle. Blockchain will radically change the way of handling water supplies,
    from the

    diligent use of renewable and fresh water and water use settlement and payment
    collection

    to water use and frequent reporting. Figure 7 shows the wastewater reuse ratio
    as a function

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2590

    11 of 14

    of the number of devices. The wastewater reuse ratio is the best for our proposed
    system

    relative to other recent approaches. The performance of UWM-WEPN is better than
    the

    rest of the approaches, while CPSMF shows a poor relative performance.

    Figure 6. Moisture content ratio.

    Figure 7. Wastewater reuse ratio.

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2590

    12 of 14

    4.5. Prediction Ratio

    It is necessary to control water in any part of its cycle in smart city water
    management:

    from freshwater abstraction, pretreatment, delivery, use, and collection to post-treatment.

    By removing pollution and changing the way to treat wastewater, the water quality
    will

    be improved. To ensure water safety, IoT-allowed monitoring systems could be deployed.

    Wireless sensors and the anomaly detection algorithm help anticipate leaks, maximizing

    resources, sales, running costs, and pipe repair facilities. Through blockchain
    technologies,

    city companies and city municipalities can monitor water delivery and use in real
    time.

    Through this proposed method, it is possible to track the water quality. Water
    ﬁltration

    devices are used to guarantee the water is of good quality, thus reducing water
    loss.

    Predictive management methods used in water plants ensure that problems contributing

    to the risk of water pipes failing are evaluated rapidly and efﬁciently. Figure
    8 shows the

    prediction ratio. The prediction ratio shows considerable improvement with an
    increasing

    number of IoT devices for all the considered approaches. Furthermore, the predictive

    performance of the proposed IoT-WMS systems is better than the rest of the approaches.
    The

    CPSMF approach shows some promise for lower numbers of devices but its performance

    deteriorates before improving as the IoT devices transition from a moderate value
    to a

    larger number.

    The proposed IoT-WMS improves the quality of recycling water distributed in smart

    cities and achieves a high wastewater recycling rate and efﬁciency ratio, a lower
    mois-

    ture content ratio, improved wastewater reuse, and a better prediction ratio compared
    to

    the cyber-physical systems management framework (CPSMF), the supervisory controller

    and data acquirement (SCADA) approach, the Water Metabolism Framework (WMF),

    the urban water metabolism method (UWM), and the water–energy–pollution nexus

    (WEPN) method.

    Figure 8. Prediction ratio.

    5. Conclusions

    A detailed literature survey helped us to establish a smart wastewater collection

    system for smart cities, namely the IoT-WMS system concentrated on cloud protection
    and

    Electronics 2023, 12, 2590

    13 of 14

    leveraging blockchain technologies. This IoT-WMS uses a trading scheme focused
    on the

    recovery of wastewater using blockchain incentives. Sensors and actuators make
    the IoT-

    based wastewater management strategy available for all households/industries in
    the smart

    city. Compared to existing models, the proposed IoT-WMS for wastewater treatment
    and

    recycling water quality in smart cities achieved a high wastewater recycling rate
    of 96.3%,

    an efﬁciency ratio of 88.7%, a low moisture content ratio of 32.4%, an increased
    wastewater

    reuse of 90.8%, and a prediction ratio of 92.5%. The proposed approach has limitations

    when it comes to the interworking of such systems deployed by several metropolitan

    and/or rural areas. A framework to incentivize wastewater quality improvement
    is more

    useful if it allows for reward tokens to be redeemable across various industrial
    sectors and

    facilities. A future extension of this study is to expand the system with in-depth
    learning

    assistance for wastewater management in smart cities using deep learning technology.

    \ this integration is not without its \nchallenges. Balancing tasks between edge\
    \ and cloud, \norchestrating dynamic workload distribution, ensuring \ndata privacy\

    \ considerations. \nAddressing these challenges demands a holistic \napproach\
    \ that spans technology, security measures, \norchestration mechanisms, and compliance\
    \ adherence. \nThis integration holds immense potential \nacross a myriad of domains.\
    \ From optimizing \nindustrial processes and enhancing IoT applications to \n\
    enabling intelligent decision-making[3] in healthcare \nand retail, the seamless\
    \ integration of edge computing \nand cloud resources promises to redefine how\
    \ data is \nanalysed, insights are derived, and strategies are \nformulated. As\
    \ this paradigm continues to evolve, \norganizations are poised to unlock new\
    \ dimensions of \nefficiency, agility, and innovation through the \nconvergence\
    \ of edge computing and cloud resources \nfor the purpose of enhanced data analysis.\
    \ \nIntegration Benefits for Data Analysis: \nLatency Reduction: Integrating edge\
    \ computing and \ncloud resources reduces latency by performing real-\ntime analysis\
    \ at the edge. Critical decisions can be \nmade promptly without waiting for data\
    \ to travel to a \ndistant cloud server and back. Cloud resources can \nthen be\
    \ utilized for more in-depth analysis. \nReal-Time Responsiveness: Edge computing\
    \ allows \nfor immediate data processing and response, making it \nsuitable for\
    \ applications that require instant reactions. \nBy integrating with cloud resources,\
    \ historical data \nand complex analyses can be performed to inform \nlong-term\
    \ strategies. \nScalability and Flexibility: Cloud resources provide \nscalability\
    \ for computationally intensive tasks. During \npeak demands, cloud resources\
    \ can be allocated to \nhandle the load, while edge devices handle routine \n\
    processing. This dynamic allocation ensures efficient \nresource utilization.\
    \ \nBandwidth Efficiency: Integrating edge and cloud \ncomputing optimizes bandwidth\
    \ usage. Only relevant \ninsights or summarized data need to be transmitted to\
    \ \nthe cloud, reducing the amount of data transferred and \nlowering associated\
    \ costs. \nData Privacy and Security: Edge computing \nenhances data privacy and\
    \ security by processing \nsensitive information locally. Only aggregated or \n\
    anonymized data is sent to the cloud, minimizing the \nrisk of exposing critical\
    \ data during transmission. \nDistributed Analysis: The integration enables a\
    \ \ndistributed approach to data analysis. Edge devices \ncan preprocess and filter\
    \ data, while cloud resources \nhandle more extensive analysis. This division\
    \ of \nlabour maximizes resource utilization and speeds up \noverall processing.\
    \ \nResource Allocation: Edge devices perform tasks \nthat require minimal latency,\
    \ leaving cloud resources \navailable for computationally demanding tasks. This\
    \ \nefficient resource allocation enhances the overall \nsystem's performance.\

    \ and reliability. If an edge device \nfails, the cloud can seamlessly take over\
    \ the workload, \nensuring uninterrupted data analysis and decision-\nmaking.\
    \ \nThe seamless integration of edge and cloud resources \nhas led to improved\
    \ data analysis and decision-making \nin various real-world scenarios. Here are\
    \ some \nexamples: \nSmart Manufacturing: In manufacturing plants, \nsensors installed\
    \ on machinery collect real-time data \nabout equipment performance. Edge computing\
    \ \nprocesses this data locally to detect anomalies and \npotential failures.\
    \ Critical alerts are sent to cloud \nplatforms for more in-depth analysis. This\
    \ integration \nallows manufacturers to predict maintenance needs, \nreduce downtime,\
    \ and optimize production schedules. \nHealthcare Monitoring: Wearable health\
    \ devices, \nsuch as fitness trackers and medical sensors, collect \ndata about\
    \ individuals' health metrics [4]. Edge \ndevices on these wearables process immediate\
    \ health \ndata, while cloud resources analyse historical trends. \nThis integration\
    \ helps doctors make informed \ndecisions about patient care and identify potential\
    \ \nhealth risks. \nAutonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars use edge \ncomputing\
    \ to process sensor data in real-time for \nimmediate navigation decisions. Cloud\
    \ resources are \nemployed for high-level route planning, map updates, \nand long-term\
    \ traffic pattern analysis. The integration \nensures \nreal-time \nsafety \n\
    and \ncomprehensive \nnavigation optimization. \nSmart Grids: In the energy sector,\
    \ edge devices \nwithin power distribution networks monitor and \nanalyse energy\
    \ consumption patterns. Immediate \nfeedback is provided for load balancing and\
    \ grid \nstability. Cloud resources are used for long-term \nenergy consumption\
    \ trends and optimizing energy \ndistribution across regions. \nAgricultural Precision:\
    \ IoT sensors in agriculture \ncollect data on soil conditions, weather, and crop\

    \ about traffic management and \nurban planning. The integration improves city\
    \ services \nand enhances residents' quality of life. \nDisaster Response: During\
    \ natural disasters, edge \ndevices in disaster-stricken areas provide real-time\
    \ \ninformation on conditions and casualties. Cloud \nresources process this data\
    \ to coordinate emergency \nresponses and allocate resources efficiently, thereby\
    \ \nminimizing human loss and damage. \nThe balance between processing data at\
    \ the edge and \nsending it to the cloud has a significant impact on data \nlatency\
    \ and real-time decision-making[6]. Here's how \nthis balance influences these\
    \ factors: \nProcessing Data at the Edge: \nLow Latency: Edge computing involves\
    \ processing \ndata locally, closer to the data source. This \nsignificantly reduces\
    \ the time taken for data to travel \nto a distant cloud server and back, leading\
    \ to lower \nlatency. \nReal-Time Decision-Making: Edge processing allows \nfor\
    \ immediate data analysis and decision-making. \nTime-sensitive actions can be\
    \ taken in real time based \non locally processed data, enabling quick responses\
    \ to \nevents. \nEfficiency: Edge processing is efficient for tasks that \nrequire\
    \ immediate attention and do not necessitate the \nextensive computational resources\
    \ of cloud servers. \nBandwidth Conservation: By processing data at the \nedge,\
    \ the amount of data that needs to be transmitted \nto the cloud is reduced, conserving\
    \ bandwidth and \nminimizing data transmission costs. \nSending Data to the Cloud:\
    \ \nHigher Latency: Transmitting data to the cloud \nintroduces latency due to\
    \ the time it takes for data to \ntravel over the network to the remote data centre\
    \ and \nback to the edge. This latency can be variable \ndepending on network\
    \ conditions. \nComplex Analysis: Cloud resources offer more \ncomputational power\
    \ and memory, allowing for more \ncomplex data analysis, machine learning, and\
    \ \nadvanced analytics that may not be feasible at the \nedge. \nHistorical Insights:\
    \ Cloud analysis can provide \ninsights based on historical data trends, which\
    \ may \nrequire larger datasets and computational capabilities \nnot available\
    \ at the edge. \nResource-Intensive \nTasks: \nTasks \nthat \ndemand \nsignificant\
    \ computational resources or involve \nanalysing vast amounts of data can be offloaded\
    \ to the \ncloud, where scalability is readily available. \nBalancing Latency\
    \ and Decision-Making: \nUse Case Dependence: The balance between edge and \n\
    cloud processing depends on the specific use case. \nApplications requiring immediate\
    \ actions benefit from \nedge processing to minimize latency, while those \nneeding\
    \ in-depth analysis leverage cloud capabilities. \n          International Journal\

    \ analysis. \nEdge Orchestration: Intelligent edge orchestration \nmechanisms\
    \ can dynamically determine whether data \nshould be processed locally or sent\
    \ to the cloud, \nconsidering factors such as data type, urgency, and \navailable\
    \ resources. \nThe integration of edge computing and cloud \nresources has a profound\
    \ impact on the development \nand deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) \napplications\
    \ and devices. It addresses key challenges \nand enhances the capabilities of\
    \ IoT solutions. Here's \nhow this integration influences IoT development and\
    \ \ndeployment: \nReduced Latency and Real-Time Responsiveness: \nIoT devices\
    \ often require real-time responsiveness, \nespecially in applications like industrial\
    \ automation, \nhealthcare monitoring, and autonomous vehicles. \nEdge computing\
    \ enables immediate data processing at \nthe device level, minimizing latency\
    \ and enabling \nreal-time decision-making. \nCloud resources can be used for\
    \ more comprehensive \nanalysis and long-term trends, enhancing the quality \n\
    of insights derived from IoT data. \nImproved Scalability: \nEdge computing and\
    \ cloud resources offer a scalable \napproach to IoT deployment. Edge devices\
    \ can handle \nlocalized data processing, while cloud platforms \nprovide scalability\
    \ for processing data from a large \nnumber of devices. \nBandwidth Optimization:\
    \ \nTransmitting large volumes of raw data from IoT \ndevices to the cloud can\
    \ strain network bandwidth and \nincrease costs. Edge computing reduces the amount\
    \ of \ndata transmitted by processing and filtering data \nlocally before sending\
    \ relevant insights to the cloud. \nEnhanced Privacy and Security: \nEdge computing\
    \ enhances data privacy and security \nby processing sensitive information locally,\
    \ reducing \nthe exposure of critical data during transmission. Only \naggregated\
    \ or summarized data is sent to the cloud, \nreducing risks associated with data\
    \ breaches. \nFlexibility in Application Design: \nIoT applications can leverage\
    \ the integration's \nflexibility. Real-time processing at the edge can cater\
    \ \nto time-critical tasks, while cloud resources can handle \nhistorical \nanalysis,\
    \ \npredictive \nmodelling, \nand \nresource-intensive computations. \nOptimal\
    \ Resource Utilization: \nIoT devices often have limited computational \nresources.\
    \ Edge computing offloads processing tasks \nfrom central servers, optimizing\
    \ the usage of device \nresources while leveraging cloud resources for more \n\
    complex computations. \nResilience and Redundancy: \nThe integration provides\
    \ redundancy in case of device \nfailure. If an edge device malfunctions, cloud\
    \ \nresources can take over processing, ensuring \ncontinuous data analysis and\
    \ decision-making. \nEdge Orchestration: \nEdge orchestration platforms dynamically\

    \ AI: \nResearch on federated learning and edge AI discusses \nhow these techniques\
    \ can be applied in the integration \nto enable collaborative machine learning\
    \ models \nwithout sharing raw data. \nThe seamless integration of edge computing\
    \ and cloud \nresources plays a crucial role in addressing issues of \nnetwork\
    \ congestion and bandwidth limitations [12]. \nHere's how this integration contributes\
    \ to alleviating \nthese challenges: \nLocal Data Processing: \nEdge computing\
    \ enables data processing to occur at or \nnear the source of data generation.\
    \ This reduces the \nneed to transmit large volumes of raw data over the \nnetwork\
    \ to centralized cloud servers. \nBy processing data locally at the edge, only\
    \ relevant \ninsights or summarized information are sent to the \ncloud, reducing\
    \ the amount of data that needs to \ntraverse the network. \nMinimized Data Transmission:\
    \ \nTransmitting data over networks, especially in \nscenarios with limited bandwidth,\
    \ can lead to network \ncongestion and increased latency. Edge computing \nreduces\
    \ the need for frequent data transmission, easing \nnetwork traffic. \nBandwidth\
    \ Conservation: \nEdge devices process and filter data, sending only \nnecessary\
    \ information to the cloud. This approach \nconserves bandwidth by avoiding the\
    \ unnecessary \ntransfer of large datasets to the cloud for analysis. \n \n \n\
    Real-Time Insights at the Edge: \nImmediate data processing at the edge enables\
    \ quick \ndecisions and actions without relying on cloud \nresources. This reduces\
    \ the dependency on continuous \ndata transmission to the cloud for real-time\
    \ \nresponsiveness. \nDynamic Data Prioritization: \nThe integration allows for\
    \ dynamic data prioritization. \nCritical or time-sensitive data can be processed\
    \ at the \nedge to ensure immediate responses, while less urgent \ndata can be\
    \ sent to the cloud for more comprehensive \nanalysis. \nEdge Caching: \nEdge\
    \ devices can store frequently accessed or critical \ndata locally using caching\
    \ mechanisms. This reduces \nthe need to retrieve data from the cloud repetitively,\
    \ \nthus alleviating network congestion. \nDistributed Load: \nOffloading computational\
    \ tasks to edge devices \ndistributes the processing load across the network.\
    \ \nThis avoids overburdening a single centralized cloud \nserver and reduces\
    \ the risk of network congestion. \nImproved Scalability: \nAs the number of IoT\
    \ devices and data sources \nincreases, the integration ensures that edge devices\
    \ \nprocess local data, reducing the strain on the network \nand cloud infrastructure.\
    \ \nRedundancy and Failover: \nThe integration provides redundancy by allowing\
    \ for \nfailover mechanisms. If an edge device or network \nsegment becomes congested,\
    \ the system can route data \n          International Journal of Scientific Research\

    \ smart monitoring with intelligence highly gained signiﬁcant attention for enhancing\
    \ the productivity of the crop.\nCurrently, IoT generates a lot of real-time data\
    \ from the sensors, actuators, and identiﬁcation technologies. However,\nextracting\
    \ the meaningful insights from the data is necessary for realizing the intelligent\
    \ ecosystem in agriculture. Based upon\nthe previous studies, it is also identiﬁed\
    \ that the limited studies have merely implemented machine learning (ML) on real-time\n\
    data obtained through customized hardware with dedicated server. In this study,\
    \ we have proposed a customized hand-held\ndevice that enables to deliver recommendations\
    \ to the farmer on the basis of real-time data obtained through IoT hardware\n\
    and ML. A three-layer structure is proposed in the study for realizing custom\
    \ hardware with 2.4 GHz ZigBee and IoT sensors\nfor the data acquisition, communication,\
    \ and recommendation. As a part of real-time implementation, the calibration of\

    \ survival, as it is the main\nsource of grain and other basic resources. In addition,\
    \ agricul-\nture accounts for about 4% of the world’s gross national prod-\nuct\
    \ (GDP) [1]. Urbanization and population growth in 2050\nconclude that food production\
    \ must be sustainably doubled\nwith minimal water resources [2]. About 97% of\
    \ the water\non the planet is salty, while the remaining 3 is freshwater [3].\n\
    Agriculture uses 70% of freshwater for irrigation in most\ndeveloping countries\
    \ [4]. Therefore, the eﬃcient use of fresh-\nwater during irrigation is the most\
    \ signiﬁcant issue in terms\nof cost reduction and yield improvement. Using the\
    \ traditional\nmethod, farmers manually check and regulate the availability\n\
    of water resulting in a 50% water loss [5]. However, diﬀerent\nirrigation techniques\
    \ like drip irrigation, sprinkle irrigation,\nand furrow irrigation have minimized\
    \ water wastage by 30-\n70% [6]. Yet, the optimal management of water content\
    \ in\nthe soil is not yet achieved with these irrigation techniques\nas overwater\
    \ usage in the agricultural ﬁeld leads to an overﬂow\nof nutrients from the soil\
    \ [7].\nAgriculture also requires adequate levels of fertilizers\nand pesticides,\
    \ as farmers use fertilizers and pesticides while\nneglecting the optimal needs\
    \ of the crop. Apart from that,\nwater availability, nutrient levels, and soil\
    \ moisture are some\nother factors that aﬀect crop productivity as well. With\
    \ the\ntraditional approach, it is a challenging task for the farmer\nto determine\
    \ water availability, nutrient levels, and soil\nHindawi\nJournal of Sensors\n\

    moisture and also to identify which factor is ﬁghting food pro-\nduction [8].\
    \ Here, smart and real-time systems help to moni-\ntor the various parameters\
    \ of the agricultural ﬁeld and\neﬀectively control the water level with other\
    \ resources to\nincrease productivity [9]. Nowadays, real-time monitoring\nand\
    \ intelligent systems are possible with the Internet of Things\n(IoT), as IoT\
    \ monitors agriculture with IoT-enabled sensors\nand communication protocols implemented\
    \ in agriculture\n[10]. The above facts conclude that the IoT has played crucial\n\
    role in multiple areas including agriculture with its sensing,\ncommunication,\
    \ and real-time monitoring features through\nthe IoT hardware. Moreover, it is\
    \ concluded from the previous\nstudies that the ML model delivered signiﬁcant\
    \ results on real-\ntime data [11]. The study framed a research question “How\n\
    and for what purpose may the ML technology be used in agri-\nculture on IoT real-time\
    \ data? On the basis of this research\nquestion, this study has carried out the\
    \ literature review.\n1.1. Literature Review. Large-scale agricultural monitoring\n\
    applications require reliable WSN networks because the maxi-\nmum number of sensors\
    \ is operated over a long period. A wire-\nless sensor network architecture for\
    \ vegetable greenhouses is\npresented to achieve scientiﬁc cultivation and minimize\
    \ man-\nagement eﬀort from an environmental monitoring perspective\n[12]. Smart\
    \ greenhouse management systems and WSNs are\nused to control and monitor agricultural\
    \ parameters and activ-\nities in greenhouses autonomously [13, 14]. A smart green-\n\
    house information monitoring system records environmental\nfactors with ZigBee\
    \ wireless sensors [15].Wi-Fi-based smart\nWSN has been proposed to monitor the\
    \ agricultural environ-\nment, and the system allows intelligent monitoring of\
    \ agricul-\ntural conditions [16, 17]. WSN’s eﬀorts recommend that\nsensor data\
    \ can be collected and sent to the main server [18].\nA WPAN-based water quality\
    \ monitoring system has been\nproposed to clean up and collect real-time sensor\
    \ data on agri-\ncultural land with the LabVIEW data logger [19]. In addition\
    \ to\nWSN, the advent of IoT technology has enabled farmers and\ntechnologists\
    \ to solve the challenges farmers face, such as water\nshortages, cost control,\
    \ and productivity issues [20].\nA scalable IoT and WSN architecture is proposed\
    \ for\nremote monitoring and control of agriculture [21]. For the\nsame, an energy-saving\
    \ ZigBee sensor network with bidirec-\ntional communication and end devices is\
    \ integrated to\ndeliver data from the sensors to the PC at variable times\ndetermined\
    \ by the central node [22]. SiloSense is a unique\narchitecture based on ZigBee\
    \ to monitor the storage condi-\ntions of grain silos to protect them from spoilage\
    \ and disease\n[23]. The most important parameters that are required to\nmonitor\
    \ while growing wheat and other vegetables are soil\nmoisture, ambient temperature,\
    \ air pressure, and sunlight\nintensity [24]. mIoT- and WSN-based agricultural\
    \ system\nare for monitoring air, temperature, soil moisture, and\nhumidity with\
    \ RF modules [25]. The cloud-based and IoT-\nbased smart irrigation system is\
    \ designed to obtain data on\nsoil moisture, soil health, and temperature to reduce\
    \ water\nconsumption [26, 27]. IoT-based greenhouse agriculture is\nimplemented\
    \ to monitor climatic conditions and to obtain\ndata on a cloud server for analysis,\
    \ while the ZigBee protocol\nand the Wi-Fi module are integrated [28, 29]. The\
    \ IoT-based\nframework is designed to perform data analysis using real-\ntime\
    \ data to increase productivity on farms through temper-\nature, soil moisture,\
    \ and humidity sensor [30, 31].\nIoT-enabled plant disease and pest prediction\
    \ system is\nimplemented to reduce the use of insecticides and fungicides,\nand\
    \ additionally, an assessment of meteorological data is also\ncarried out to identify\
    \ the correlation between pest growth\nand climate [32]. ML helps to examine and\
    \ analyze data from\ndiﬀerent ﬁelds of agriculture to improve crop yields and\
    \ oﬀers\ndiﬀerent analytical techniques to predict the yield of crop and\nplant\
    \ disease [33, 34]. The ML-based predictive model helps\nfarmers to get the right\
    \ harvest with unconditional weather\nbehavior [35]. ML algorithms such as neural\
    \ network-based\nmodels are used for predictive analysis purposes [36]. From\n\
    the literature review, it is identiﬁed that smart monitoring in\nthe agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld needs to carry out with advanced technol-\nogies such as IoT. The literature\
    \ also concludes that they are\nlimited studies that analyzed the accuracy of\
    \ the data obtained\nthrough sensors. In addition to this, customization of hard-\n\
    ware on the basis of agricultural ﬁeld requirement is limitedly\nexplored by the\
    \ previous researchers. ML technique is applied\non diﬀerent datasets for disease\
    \ detection, environmental\nparameters monitoring, and automation in irrigation,\
    \ but the\nprevious studies have yet to explore the crop recommendation\non the\
    \ basis of real-time data. However, implementing ML on\nreal-time data primarily\
    \ requires a resource-constrained and\ndedicated server to fulﬁll the task of\
    \ acquiring real-time agri-\ncultural data rather than using it for multiple purposes.\n\
    To overcome this research, the gap of this study imple-\nments customized IoT\
    \ hardware for obtaining the real-time\nﬁeld data through wireless personal area\
    \ network (WPAN)\nand wireless local area network (WLAN). WPAN enables to\nminimize\
    \ the power consumption and also transmits the sen-\nsor data reliably and securely.\
    \ WLAN is used to connect the\ncustomized hardware to the cloud server through\
    \ IP protocol.\nTo maintain accuracy in the data, the calibration methods are\n\
    applied on the sensors. It is also identiﬁed from the previous\nstudy that IoT\
    \ requires analytical techniques to provide intel-\nligent decisions based on\
    \ real-time sensor data obtained from\nIoT sensors [11]. The contributions of\
    \ the study are as follows:\n(i) Customized hardware for sensor node, master node,\n\
    and hand-held device with ZigBee RF modem is\ndesigned for sensing the real-time\
    \ data of agricul-\ntural ﬁeld including temperature, humidity, soil\npH, and\
    \ water level\n(ii) An interference test is implemented to verify that\nthe ZigBee\
    \ signal is not interfering with other\nsignals on the same frequency band\n(iii)\
    \ To enhance the security of data transmission, the\nsymmetric encryption approach\
    \ with a private key\nis applied by leveraging XXTea encryption functions\n(iv)\
    \ A cloud server is developed to log the real-time sen-\nsor data of the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld\n(v) The pretrained machine learning model is applied\nto real-time data\
    \ such as temperature, humidity,\n2\nJournal of Sensors\nrainfall, and soil pH\
    \ sensor on the cloud server for\nseasonal crop recommendations\nThe organization\
    \ of the study is as follows: Section 1.1\ncovers the proposed system. Section\
    \ 2 covers the circuit dia-\ngram for the development of the system. Section 3\
    \ covers\nsimulation analysis and calibration. Section 4 covers the\nreal-time\
    \ implementation of developed nodes and the cur-\nrent consumption analysis. The\
    \ article is concluded in the\nﬁnal section.\n2. Proposed Architecture\nTo realize\
    \ the main objective of crop recommendation, in\nreal-time, machine learning is\
    \ utilized. This system intends\nto leverage multiple sensors with real-time data\
    \ collection\nsuch as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil pH sensor\nto\
    \ improve the eﬃciency and the recommendation of crops,\nwith the support of machine\
    \ learning techniques. As shown\nin Figure 1, the architecture is divided into\
    \ multiple mod-\nules, with both software and hardware parts, each with its\n\
    purpose, from the hardware nodes, for data collection; the\nserver, for data processing;\
    \ and ﬁnally, the hand-held device\nto the user.\nThe system is composed of various\
    \ environmental sen-\nsors that are deployed around the agricultural ﬁeld to collect\n\
    data on a variety of characteristics such as water level, tem-\nperature, soil\
    \ pH, and humidity. This information is then\nsent to the master node, the main\
    \ hub of our system, which\nis in charge of communicating with the developed cloud\n\
    server and transferring the data obtained from the sensors.\nIn the server, the\
    \ information is stored and is also run\nthrough the ML algorithm to be studied.\
    \ From there, based\non the algorithm’s analysis, the information is presented\
    \ to\nthe user on a handheld device, such as crop recommenda-\ntion. The crop\
    \ recommendation feature is activated from\nthe hand-held device, and recommendations\
    \ are received\non the hand-held device based on the user’s request.\n2.1. Data\
    \ Acquisition Layer. The data acquisition layer is the\nprimary layer of the architecture\
    \ for acquiring the environ-\nmental parameters of the agricultural ﬁeld. This\
    \ layer is specif-\nically dedicated to continuously monitor the environmental\n\
    parameters including water level, temperature, humidity, light\nintensity, and\
    \ rain level. For this, IoT sensors are attached to\nthe sensor node as shown\
    \ in Figure 2 and through 2.4GHz\nZigBee communication [37], it transmits data\
    \ to the master\nnode. In addition, the sensor node is enabled with security,\n\
    interference technique, and node mapping feature for secure\nand reliable communication.\n\
    2.2. Data Processing Layer. IoT devices and sensors record\nthe environmental\
    \ parameters of the agricultural ﬁeld in real\ntime. Sensory data processing is\
    \ done with the data process-\ning layer. The master node, which consists of the\
    \ ZigBee RF\nmodule, receives the data from the data acquisition layer and\ntransmits\
    \ it to the cloud server via a Wi-Fi module\n(Figure 3). The master node is powered\
    \ by the battery power\nsupply. The data logger is also available in the data\
    \ process-\ning layer for visualizing the sensor data through Bluetooth.\nThe\
    \ master node with a Wi-Fi module connects to the Inter-\nnet to log the sensory\
    \ data in the cloud server.\n2.3. Analytics and Visualization Layer. Figure 4\
    \ illustrates the\nsystem logic, where it explains the preprocessing and analysis\n\
    of gathered data from the sensor node. The sensor data is\nreceived at the master\
    \ node which is converted into a set of\nscripts and is logged into the cloud\
    \ server. Here, a cloud server\nis also developed to log the sensor node values.\
    \ In the prepro-\ncessing step, the sensor data is converted into a suitable format\n\
    for performing machine learning analyses. The data is fed to a\nmachine learning\
    \ model and based on the data the model, it\nsuggests recommended crop. The outcome\
    \ of the model is\nstored in the cloud server, and the hand-held device that con-\n\
    nects to the cloud server also visualizes the recommended crop\nand real-time\
    \ sensor data. To provide the user with a way to\nsee the data collected from\
    \ the sensors and machine learning\noutcomes, a cloud server is developed.\nA\
    \ cloud server is developed with two diﬀerent API pro-\ntocols for data exchange\
    \ between backend and frontend\nand backend and custom gateway. The interface\
    \ between\nthe backend and the frontend for the exchange of data is\nimplemented\
    \ with the REST API. REST APIs use HTTP\nrequests to perform basic database activities\
    \ within a\nresource, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting\nrecords.\
    \ REST APIs accept JSON for the request payload\nand send responses to JSON. JSON\
    \ is the standard for data\ntransfer. The interface between the backend and the\
    \ gateway\nis implemented using the MQTT protocol. The cloud server\nassists in\
    \ checking all the sensor values retrieved from the\nagricultural ﬁeld in real\
    \ time. Moreover, a hand-held device\nis connected to the cloud server for providing\
    \ the updates of\nthe crop based on request generated by the user.\n3. Hardware\
    \ Development\nIn this section, we present the schematic diagram of the sen-\n\
    sor node that is primarily implemented for data acquisition.\nMoreover, the customization\
    \ is carried out for the hardware\nof agricultural monitoring including data logger\
    \ and hand-\nheld device. A detailed description of the sensor node and\nthe hand-held\
    \ device is presented below.\n3.1. Sensor Node. Figure 5 illustrates the connection\
    \ of diﬀer-\nent electronic components of the sensor node. The node is\ncomposed\
    \ of a 2.4 GHz RF modem that works in full-\nduplex mode to transmit the data\
    \ from one node to another\nconnected in the network. Principally, two sensors\
    \ (gas\nsensor and humidity sensor) are connected to the node\nwhich are placed\
    \ in the ﬁeld. The function of the gas sensor\nis to measure the concentration\
    \ of the gas (such as LPG and\nbutane) in the present environment. The humidity\
    \ of the\nenvironment is detected with the help of a humidity sensor.\nThe humidity\
    \ sensor gives serial data at the 9600 baud rate\nto the microcontroller. The\
    \ output of these sensors is in\nanalog form. Analog signal from the sensor is\
    \ fed onto the\nanalog to digital pin of the ATMEGA 8 [38].\nThe function of this\
    \ pin is to convert the analog signal\ninto a digital signal. After fetching the\
    \ signal from a sensor\n3\nJournal of Sensors\nattached, the microcontroller performs\
    \ the logical operation\nand controls the overall operation. A display (16∗2 LCD)\
    \ is\nattached to each node. The function of this is to display\nthe measured\
    \ parameters. MAX 232 IC is also used to pro-\nvide communication between the\
    \ node and PC. With the\nhelp of this, the end-user can easily observe the parameters\n\
    and execute the needful action. The whole circuit is working\non the 5 V power\

    \ A Zig-\nBee module (CC2500) [37] is used in the system to provide\nwireless\
    \ communication in the network. This module works\nin full-duplex mode and also\
    \ can communicate with many\ndevices at the same time. The topology of each node\
    \ in the\npresented network is based on mesh topology. All the\nrequired components\
    \ are integrated and developed hard-\nware of the sensor node as shown in the\
    \ Figure 6. The sensor\nnode is integrated with LCD to visualize the sensor values.\n\
    3.2. Hand-Held Device. Figure 7 shows the circuit diagram of\na hand-held device\
    \ that consists of a Bluetooth modem. The\nmain function of this modem is to receive\
    \ the data trans-\nferred from the data logger node. This node is at the end-\n\
    user and easily provides the collected data to the end-user.\nThis node is connected\
    \ with other nodes in a mesh topology.\nA display is used for showing the measured\
    \ data. Based on\nthis data, end-user can easily take the decision. Figure 8 illus-\n\
    trates the hardware of the hand-held device, and the hand-\nheld device is also\
    \ integrated with display to visualize the\ndata like real-time sensor value and\
    \ crop recommendation.\n3.2.1. Current Consumption Analysis of Hardware. Current\n\
    consumption analysis is performed based on the current\nrequired by each component\
    \ used to develop the system.\nThe power consumption by the ZigBee RF modem is\
    \ maxi-\nmum for each node, followed by consumption by the micro-\ncontroller.\
    \ Even though power was not a design issue for the\nsystem, it is evident that\
    \ the designed system requires less\npower than standard available devices like\
    \ Mica2 and Micaz\nnodes. The current consumption analysis concludes that the\n\
    designed hardware is consuming less amount of power during\nthe data transmission.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, the hand-held device is\nonly consuming a current of 79mA. The\
    \ current consumption\nmay vary when the components in the hardware are increased.\n\
    From Table 1, it is concluded that the power consumption of\nnode 1 is 85mA, node\
    \ 2 is 85mA, node 3 is 264mA, node 4\nis 104mA, and node 5 is 83mA. To meet the\
    \ power require-\nment of the sensor node, an energy harvesting system will be\n\
    integrated into the sensor node in the future. In agriculture,\nsolar panels will\
    \ be used to implement solar energy harvesting\nsystems on sensor nodes. Table\
    \ 2 shows the current consump-\ntion of the hand-held device, and it is 79mA.\

    without error. This section describes the sensor calibrations\n(temperature/humidity,\
    \ soil moisture, and ultrasonic) used\nto develop the system. Sensor calibration\
    \ is an important\nstep, before the actual implementation of the sensor in the\n\
    system. For the developed system, each sensor is ﬁrst cali-\nbrated with standard\

    \ used. The\nultrasonic sensor is calibrated with a standard measurement\nruler.\
    \ Tests were carried out for each sensor and compared\nwith standard instruments,\
    \ and it was observed that the sen-\nsors were calibrated appropriately as follows.\n\
    3.3.1. Soil Moisture Sensor. The soil moisture sensor is taken\nfrom the Sunrom\
    \ model (http://sunrom.com/) no. 1282\n[39]. The sensor gives a reading in terms\
    \ of numerical\nvalues, as can be seen in Table 3. This sensor measures mois-\n\
    ture based on the volumetric water content in the soil. On\nthe other hand, the\
    \ standard oven method for ﬁnding soil\nmoisture gives a reading in percentage.\
    \ Initially, the sensor\nreadings are mapped by the oven method [40] to check\
    \ the\nerror between the sensor value and instrument value.\nFigure 9 shows the\
    \ relation between soil moisture content\nshown by the sensor and by standard\
    \ instrument. It provides\ncalibration values of the sensor concerning the percentage\n\
    value of the oven method. To validate the calibration,\nrepeated experiments were\
    \ conducted by taking soil samples\nfrom ﬁve diﬀerent places with valid water\
    \ content and cali-\nbrated them with the standard instruments. Table 4 shows\n\
    the sample readings by soil moisture content (%) with sensor\nvalues. The sensor\
    \ reading from the sensor is received by an\nanalog-to-digital converter (ADC)\
    \ and converted to a %\nvalue using equation (1). If the ADC value of the sensor\
    \ is\n255, then the value is considered 100% accurate concerning\nthe standard\
    \ oven method.\nSoil moisture %\nð Þ = wet soil g\nð Þ‐dry soil g\nð Þ\nð\nÞ ∗\n\

    \ Test\n3.4.1. Security. As part of the security feature, during the\nimplementation\
    \ stage, we employ the AVR family of micro-\ncontrollers for applications comparable\
    \ to the one being\nproposed. Complex algorithms are a curse in AVR utilizing\n\
    time complex or memory because they frequently turn the\nexecuting code into a\
    \ blocking one, which means that any\nother routine to be conducted by the controller\
    \ is blocked\nand may create delays in executing the intended function.\nKeeping\
    \ these factors in mind, we should take considerable\nsensitivity while employing\
    \ cryptographic algorithms in\nthese low-bit controllers. Cryptographic functions\
    \ like\nXXTea and AVRCrypto can be used to implement the\nencryption method. In\
    \ our case, we use the XXTea encryp-\ntion functions to implement symmetric encryption\
    \ with pri-\nvate keys that remain exclusive to another layer of network\nnodes\
    \ to increase the security of data communication.\n3.4.2. Interference. The basic\
    \ parameter for detecting and\nhandling interference includes bit error rate (BER),\
    \ packet\nerror rate (PER), received signal strength indicator (RSSI),\nsignal-to-interference-to-noise\
    \ ratio (SINR), throughput,\nand time delay. In this study, we apply an interference\
    \ avoid-\nance algorithm based on frequency agility [39]. This algo-\nrithm allows\
    \ ZigBee to detect interference and ﬂexibly\nmove nodes to a secure channel with\
    \ minimal power con-\nsumption and minimal latency while handling the interfer-\n\
    ence. In this technique, the end devices measure PER with\na transmission time\
    \ of at least 20 packets, and if the PER\ngoes beyond the 25% level, the interference\
    \ information is\ntransferred to the parent router to assess the link quality\n\
    indicator (LQI). When the parent router determines that\nthe LQI value is less\
    \ than 100, it instructs the scanning\nenergy detection to perform interference\
    \ detection on acces-\nsible channels (ED).\nPER =\nNumber of failed messages\n\

    \ this study is that to\nchoose which algorithm is the best algorithm that can\
    \ be\nused not only in the system but in other situations with sim-\nilar data.\
    \ To do this, four diﬀerent classiﬁcation algorithms\nwere tested to see which\
    \ one had the highest accuracy.\n(a) Decision trees (DTs): through hierarchical\
    \ partition-\ning of training data, some functions are used to split\nthe data,\
    \ and this division is done iteratively until the\nleaf node contains the number\
    \ record amount that\ncan be used to classify data [44, 45]. However, as\n(a)\

    set can lead to a signiﬁcant change in the tree and\npredicting the next value\
    \ with accuracy becomes\nmore diﬃcult\n(b) Support vector machine (SVM) is used\
    \ mainly for\nclassiﬁcation, classiﬁes data by building dimensions\nn between\
    \ two classes, ﬁnds an optimal hyperplane\nto classify data, uses interval distance\
    \ between neigh-\nboring points, and distinguishes between classes\nwith minimum\
    \ error margin [47]. According to a\nsimpler interpretation, given the training\
    \ data, the\nalgorithm generates the best hyperplanes ranking\nnew examples\n\
    (c) Random forest (RF) is best applied to classiﬁcation\nproblems and integrates\
    \ the DT aggregate packing\nprocess by selecting a subset of features from the\n\

    \ Creation. The complete hardware of the proposed\nsystem is shown in Figure 10(a).\
    \ Figure 10(b) illustrates the\nsensor node based on the 2.4 GHz ZigBee module\
    \ that is\nembedded with multiple sensors including water level, tem-\nperature,\
    \ humidity, pH, and light intensity. Moreover, the\nsensor node is interfaced\
    \ with a liquid crystal display for\nvisualizing the sensor data. In this study,\
    \ a custom sensor\nnode with IoT sensors is deployed in the agricultural sector\n\
    of the Maheru, Punjab region as shown in Figure 11. The\nsensor node is deployed\
    \ in an outdoor environment to get\ndata from the sensors in real time. As discussed\
    \ earlier in\nthis section, the sensor node is interfaced with multiple sen-\n\
    sors to detect the environmental parameters of the farm ﬁeld\nand communicate\
    \ with the cloud server through a master\nnode based on 2.4 GHz ZigBee communication\
    \ and wireless\nﬁdelity (Wi-Fi).\nThe input parameters of the sensor data are\
    \ temperature,\nhumidity, water level, and soil pH. The 32,000 samples of\nIoT\
    \ sensor nodes over 6 months are used to build a dataset\nfor training. The manual\
    \ data splitting methods have been\nadopted in which the total number of samples\
    \ is divided into\ntraining and testing samples. The 70: 30 ratio is chosen for\n\
    the proposed dataset, in which 70% for training and 30%\nfor testing as shown\
    \ in Table 7.\nDuring dataset generation, besides collected timestamps\nand sensor\
    \ data, other features were added to each record\nbased on calculations and preprocessed\
    \ data from the values\nof the sensor. Table 8 shows the features of each data\
    \ set.\nThe diﬀerence between datasets is that the standard one only\nhas one\
    \ entry for each of the features while the clustered one\nhas three entries for\
    \ sensorID, average, value, and diﬀ_sen,\neach one regarding the three sensors\
    \ used in the test.\n4.2. Model Analysis. A variety of ML algorithms were used\
    \ to\nanalyze the model to ﬁnd the best one to use in our system.\nFor our case,\
    \ we performed a total of 8 tests for each\nalgorithm, each with a diﬀerent set\
    \ of parameters, to train\nthe algorithms to determine which one has the highest\n\
    accuracy so that it can be applied in our system. Each test\nwas run using Python,\
    \ the scikit-learn library [37], and the\nSpyder platform. Scripts were developed\
    \ for each algo-\nrithm using the appropriate library for scikit-learn classiﬁ-\n\
    cation and used the default conﬁguration. As mentioned\nearlier, 70% of the dataset\
    \ was used for training, and\n30% was used for testing. Table 9 shows the results\
    \ of\neach test, and Figure 12 shows the same results to improve\nthe analysis.\n\

    \ rain level, and\nsoil pH. In the temperature plot, orange denotes the wheat\n\
    crop, and blue color denotes the rice crop.\nBased on the temperature, humidity,\
    \ rain level, and soil\npH, the optimal crops are recommended. For example, in\n\
    the temperature plot, for the temperature range of 39°C-\n45°C, the recommended\
    \ crop is wheat. In case of humidity,\nthe minimum humidity level is recommended\
    \ for the wheat\ncrop. Rice crop is recommended for the rain level of 3 mm\nand\
    \ the pH value of 8, and the wheat crop is recommended.\nThe recommendation of\
    \ the crop is delivered on the basis of\ntrained data, and it may vary with other\
    \ location, as the\ndataset is developed through the real-time data of the study\n\
    location. In case, if the hardware needed to implement in\nother location, then\
    \ the customized hardware with IoT sen-\nsors needs to be developed for a certain\
    \ period of time for\nthe development of dataset.\nIn Figure 14, the crop recommendation\
    \ is processed\nbased on temperature, humidity, nutrients, and light inten-\n\
    sity. The x-axis denotes the number of the data samples,\nand y-axis denotes the\
    \ range of temperature, humidity,\nnutrients, and light intensity. In the temperature\
    \ plot, blue\ndenotes the green leaves, and violent color denotes tomatoes.\n\
    Based on the temperature, humidity, nutrients, and light\nintensity, the optimal\
    \ crops are recommended. In the tem-\nperature plot, for the temperature range\
    \ of 20°C-30°C, the\nrecommended crop is tomato. At the temperature of 35°C,\n\
    the plot concludes that green leaves and tomato crops are\nrecommended.\nIn case\
    \ of humidity, if the range of humidity level is\nbetween 60% and 70%, then both\
    \ crops including green\nleaves and tomato are recommended. The tomato crop is\n\
    recommended for the nutrients level in between 0 and 1%.\nIf the light intensity\
    \ is at 8 candelas, then tomato crop is\nhighly recommended. The hand-held device\
    \ based on the\ncloud server also receives the crop recommendation through\nthe\
    \ Internet based on demand. Table 10 presents the com-\nparison of smart agriculture\
    \ monitoring with previous stud-\nies. To validate the proposed study, the following\
    \ evaluation\nparameters are communication, data processing, analytics,\nsimulation,\
    \ calibration, and hand-held device. The proposed\nstudy oﬀers the advantages\
    \ of a communication protocol\nthat uses both 2.4 GHz ZigBee and Wi-Fi.\nThe integration\
    \ of these two-communication platforms\nenables to obtain the data locally and\
    \ also in the cloud. From\nthe table, it is concluded that the proposed study\
    \ is having\nbeneﬁcial in terms of providing the real-time data to the\nusers\
    \ on the hand-held device through stable and reliable\ncommunication. As seen\
    \ in the previous studies, many\nresearchers have implemented the advanced wireless\
    \ com-\nmunication technology like LoRa. The deployment of the\nLoRa-based sensor\
    \ nodes increases the infrastructure cost\nas compared to ZigBee-based sensor\
    \ nodes. However, LoRa\nand ZigBee can be utilized combinedly in the agricultural\n\
    ﬁeld monitoring in the following manner.\nZigBee-based sensor nodes can be deployed\
    \ in the agri-\ncultural ﬁeld to monitor environmental parameters, and\nthe single\
    \ LoRa-based node can act as supervisor node to\nall the ZigBee-based sensor nodes.\
    \ This LoRa-based node con-\nnects to the gateway, as LoRa can transmit the data\
    \ to a long\nrange. From there, the information of ZigBee-based sensor\nnode can\
    \ be visualized on the cloud server. This approach\ncan be implemented to enhance\
    \ the connectivity and minimize\ninfrastructure cost. This study have enhanced\
    \ the hardware\nwith node mapping feature, frequency agility interference\navoidance,\
    \ and XXTea encryption features. All these features\nare logged in the hardware\
    \ during the programming.\n6. Conclusions\nReal-time smart monitoring with intelligence\
    \ has gained sig-\nniﬁcant attention for increasing crop productivity. At the\n\
    moment, IoT generates a large amount of real-time data\nfrom sensors, actuators,\
    \ and identiﬁcation technologies.\nHowever, extracting meaningful insights from\
    \ data is\nrequired for the intelligent ecosystem and portable device\nfor monitoring\
    \ of agriculture. The current study is focused\non implementing the customized\
    \ hand-held device for\nassisting the farmers with crop recommendation with ML.\n\
    To realize it, ﬁrst, the customized hardware is designed,\nand sensors are calibrated\
    \ to obtain the error free data. In\naddition to this, security is also inbuilt\
    \ in the customized\nhardware for secure transmission of data on the cloud\nserver.\
    \ As the real-time data is available in the cloud server,\nit is utilized for\
    \ forming dataset to conclude to the optimal\nML model for crop recommendation.\
    \ After identifying the\noptimal ML model, it has been applied on the cloud server.\n\
    Based on this, the ML model recommends the crop from\nthe real-time data that\
    \ is generated from the customized\nhardware.\nData Availability\nData will be\
    \ available on request. For the data-related queries,\nkindly contact to Baseem\

    Abstract

    Service providers provision more and more Internet-of-Things (IoT) services in
    the cloud for dynamicity and cost-effectiveness

    purposes. This is made possible thanks to the introduction of edge computing that
    brings additional computing and resources

    for analytics close to the data sources and thus enables meeting the low latency
    requirement. Edge nodes should support (i) the

    heterogeneity of IoT devices (e.g., sensor, actuator) and (ii) characteristics
    (e.g., mobility, location awareness). IoT is already

    integrated to the hybrid cloud/edge environment. However, the ecosystem lacks
    of automation due to the previously mentioned

    characteristics. Indeed, edge nodes are often manually selected during deployment
    time, and most of the regular Quality Of

    Service (QoS) management procedures remain difﬁcult to implement. This paper introduces
    a comprehensive semantic model

    called EdgeOnto. It encompasses all concepts related to IoT applied in the context
    of edge computing. The ultimate goal

    of EdgeOnto is to automate the several steps that make up the IoT services lifecycle
    in hybrid cloud/edge environment. On

    the one hand, semantics enable an automatic discovery of the relevant edge nodes
    that are suitable to host and execute IoT

    services considering their requirements. On the other hand, it allows supporting
    the speciﬁc QoS procedures that are related

    to such setting (e.g., low latency, mobility, jitter). The core ontology was designed
    with the Protégé open-source tool. A smart

    strawberry farming use case was implemented and evaluated for illustration purposes.
    The results validate the accuracy and

    the precision of the designed semantic matchmaker.

    1 Introduction

    Internet-of-Things (IoT) service owners are more and more

    leaning on hyperscale cloud providers to provision IoT ser-

    vices, as well as, to store and to process the generated data.

    This trend is motivated by the several advantages that the

    cloud computing paradigm brings such as dynamicity, ﬂexi-

    bilityandcost-effectiveness.However,withtheever-growing

    workloads that is tied to 5G telco network, automation,

    real-time analytics and IoT, service owners started looking

    elsewhere for their computing needs.

    Notably, edge computing enables meeting these comput-

    ing needs. In fact, edge computing is currently reshaping IT

    and business computing. It brings additional resources close

    to the end-users and data sources so that the latency-sensitive

    computing and data analytics could be processed within a

    lownetworklatency[24]. Nevertheless, this brings additional

    challenges that need to be tackled to provision IoT services

    in such setting. Indeed, edge nodes are highly heterogeneous

    in terms of computing capabilities (e.g., supported run-time,

    CPU and RAM workload, storage capacity, autonomy), net-

    work interfaces (e.g., supported communication protocols),

    behavior (e.g., mobile or motionless, online or ofﬂine). These

    characteristics make the operation of edge computing difﬁ-

    cult and costly [24], in particular for IoT where applications

    are latency-sensitive and services are often bound through

    complex gateways and overlay networks.

    IoT is already integrated to the hybrid cloud/edge envi-

    ronments. However, the existing works mainly focus on

    123

    speciﬁc features (e.g., see [8] for IoT services deployment,

    see [22] for IoT services rescheduling) and fail to fully sup-

    port the whole steps that make up the IoT services life cycle.

    The reader should note that IoT services inherit the same

    Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) life-cycle phases (i.e.,

    discover, deploy, execute and manage during run-time) [34].

    SOA principles (e.g., service abstraction, discover ability,

    and composability) ensure the viability of network services’

    ecosystem that could be dynamically and ﬂexibly provi-

    sioned, thus coping with changeable IoT needs and dynamic

    Quality Of Service (QoS) requirements along with context

    conditions. In addition to these limitations, the current edge

    frameworks for IoT lack of automation when implementing

    these steps. Edge nodes are often manually selected during

    deployment time, and most of the regular QoS manage-

    ment procedures remain difﬁcult to implement. The QoS

    procedures need to be executed during run-time and aim

    to optimize a set of metrics based on predeﬁned service-

    level objectives. The latter might vary from one use case to

    another depending on the involved data and IoT devices and

    expected outcomes. The objectives could, for instance, range

    from faster response time to less network costs, low latency,

    less service breakdown or better ﬂow control of data, com-

    munication, efﬁciency and accuracy [10].

    1.1 Motivating use case

    The motivating use case is from smart agriculture research

    ﬁeld. It is inspired from the use case introduced in [12]

    where the authors propose an edge framework to handle the

    collection, analysis, prediction, and detection of heteroge-

    neous data in strawberry farming. Strawberries are sensitive

    fruits that are afﬂicted by various pests and diseases. There-

    fore, there is an intense use of agro-chemicals and pesticides

    during production. Due to their sensitivity, temperatures or

    humidity at extreme levels can cause various damages to the

    plantation and to the quality of the fruit.

    The proposed framework is depicted in Fig. 1. This frame-

    work monitors, collects and processes data in real time to (i)

    detect seven of the most common strawberry diseases and (ii)

    determine the required type and amount of chemical fertilizer

    and medication depending on the strawberry size, age and

    disease. To that end, it relies on several sensor nodes, a col-

    lector node and actuators. These devices communicate with

    the computing nodes through the collector module that plays

    the role of IoT gateway. The communication relies on LoRa

    protocol. The computing nodes integrate machine learning

    capabilities for capturing outliers in collected data and exe-

    cute a computer vision model using Yolo v5 architecture to

    identify the prospective disease.

    The provisioning of this framework in large strawberry

    farms requires, in addition to the deployment of the sensors

    and actuators, the deployment of several computing entities

    (e.g., raspberry nodes) that could host the computer vision

    and machine learning algorithms. These nodes must be suf-

    ﬁcient in number to cover the whole farm and to allow close

    and fast interactions between the devices and the algorithms.

    The end-to-end selection should optimize the data trans-

    fer time and the system reaction (e.g., detecting a disease,

    control an irrigation actuator for plant watering with med-

    ication) as fast as possible and with minimal energy cost

    to save devices autonomy and durability. Furthermore, one

    can imagine the deployment of monitoring mobile robots

    over the farm. The robots will be responsible of holding the

    monitoring sensors and the actuators instead of having them

    motionless. In that case, the system should be able to sup-

    port the devices mobility and dynamically select the most

    appropriate gateway and computing nodes to optimize on-

    the-ﬂy the previously mentioned service-level objectives. A

    precise and relevant semantic description of the nodes capa-

    bilities and current workload is the considered alternative in

    this work to automate and enable efﬁcient selection of the

    edge nodes while optimizing the QoS metrics.

    1.2 Contributions and obtained results

    This paper introduces a comprehensive ontology (called

    EdgeOnto). This ontology involves semantic concepts for

    both IoT domain and edge domain. It supports edge com-

    puting features and integrates high-level abstraction of the

    complex information and incremented knowledge at the net-

    work edge (e.g., ad hoc topology, breakdown, mobility). The

    ultimate goal is to support the automation of the QoS man-

    agement procedures in such environment. Speciﬁcally, this

    is achieved by enabling the instantaneous semantic matching

    between the IoT services requirements, from one side, and

    the edge nodes workload/position on the other side.

    The core domain of EdgeOnto was designed with Pro-

    tege,1 a free, open-source ontology editor and framework for

    building intelligent systems. As for the validation, the smart

    strawberry farming use case was implemented and evalu-

    ated. The results validate the accuracy and the precision of

    the designed semantic matchmaker.

    2 The state of the art

    This section ﬁrstly summarizes the different ontologies pro-

    posed in IoT domain. The reviewed ontologies cover sensor,

    security, and applications ontologies. These ontologies focus

    on devices (sensor, actuator), its lifecycle, etc. The detailed

    IoT ontologies do not support the concepts of security, loca-

    tion, place, or time in the exception of some which do not treat

    it deeply. These important concepts are especially useful in

    IoT domain in the context of edge computing (see Sect. 1).

    For thus, some ontologies related to location, context, and

    time are integrated in this section.

    2.1 Ontologies for sensors

    Existing ontologies for sensors in the literature aim to solve

    heterogeneity problems associated with the hardware, soft-

    ware, and the data management aspects of sensors (sensor

    capabilities, extensibility, data access and sharing, sensor

    data description, sensor discovery).

    The SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) ontology [11] des

    cribes sensor resources and the data collected through these

    sensors. The main concepts proposed are sensor, observation,

    and device.

    The SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator)

    ontology [19] is a redesigned SSN ontology. The SAREF

    (Smart Appliance REFerence) ontology [33] reuses and

    aligns concepts and relationships in existing appliance-based

    ontologies and is dedicated to the management of energy

    and services in smart homes. Its main proposed concepts are

    Device, Service, Energy, Task, Function and Measurement.

    Semantic actuator network (SAN) ontology [26] is used

    for the description of the actuator concept and its charac-

    teristics (Actuator, Actuating Device and Actuation). The

    OntoSensor ontology [28] extends concepts from other

    ontologies (SensorML, Sumo, ISO-19115) to allow con-

    cepts for the identiﬁcation of sensor categories, behavior,

    relationships, functionalities, and meta-data regarding sensor

    characteristics, performance, and reliability. The MyOn-

    toSens ontology [25] is an extension of OntoSensor. It

    describes sensor observations and capabilities to reason over

    the collected data for the domain of wireless sensor networks

    (WSN).

    2.2 Context-aware ontologies

    Context-aware ontologies aim to identify information about

    context like place, agent, event, latitude, longitude, altitude,

    and location. In the computation context, they express that

    “context is any information that can be used to characterize

    the situation of an entity. An entity is a person, place or object

    that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user

    and an application”.

    Context can be classiﬁed on the one hand as external

    or internal and the other hand as physical or logical [5].

    External or physical contexts are those that can be measured

    using physical sensors, while internal or logical contexts

    are those that are explicitly speciﬁed by users or captured

    by monitoring user interactions. Context awareness bridges

    the gap between real things and the virtual world in the

    IoT through acquiring, analyzing, and interpreting relevant

    context information [23]. [27] deﬁnes an Internet-of-Thing

    context-awareness model that accurately represents context

    in IoT. The context model is a hierarchical structure showing

    contexts related to Resources, Actors, Ambients and Poli-

    cies. This context model includes User context, Location

    context, Activity context, Personal context, Mood context,

    Time context, System context, Environment context and

    Device context. Context-aware ontologies are classiﬁed into

    generic ontologies (information provided by mobile device

    sensors) and speciﬁc domain ontologies (university domain,

    smart information provided by mobile device sensors, both

    physical (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.) and virtual (e.g., user

    schedule, web-logs, etc.) to support context-aware services.

    The proposed ontology deﬁnes the relations between differ-

    ent user locations and the contexts identiﬁed. The ontology

    proposed by [3] supports the devices’s discovery and their

    location in smart-home domains using concepts like Person,

    Sensor, Device, Location, etc. The ontology CONON (CON-

    text ONtology) proposed by [32] models context in pervasive

    computing environments and supports logic-based context

    reasoning.

    2.3 Location-aware ontologies

    Location-aware ontologies describe locations of things like

    geographical coordinates (altitude, latitude, and longitude).

    Location is used to describe the context location, its indoor

    and outdoor space, and the property of the environment

    (external context). Location is used to describe the spatial

    context (partly, physical context) of users/devices [4]. Loca-

    tion and context are closely linked and dependent. Different

    models can be used for deﬁning entities locations [15]. The

    considered models are as follows:

    • Geometric models (comprising Cartesian coordinates)

    • Set-theoretic models (for deﬁning location as an element

    of a set, e.g., cellular location, WiFi AP location, etc.)

    • Graph-based models (for deﬁning locations in physically

    grounded networks, social networks, etc.)

    • Semantic models (for deﬁning locations deﬁned using

    human-friendly notations)

    123

    28

    Service Oriented Computing and Applications (2023) 17:25–37

    In IoT domain, location informations are often collected from

    sensor data (like users’ mobile devices to estimate device

    location). WGS84 ontology describes abstract concepts for

    deﬁning spatial things (buildings, people, etc.) and tempo-

    ral things (events, or time duration). It also describes the

    geographical locations of these things by using concepts for

    deﬁning the geo-coordinates using latitude, longitude, and

    altitude.

    2.4 Time-based ontologies

    Time-based ontologies are used to describe the temporal con-

    textwhichincludetime,duration,andsometemporalaspects.

    Time modeling detects the behavior of a system at an interval

    or duration or point of time or the actions to be performed

    in speciﬁc temporal entity. The most popular and commonly

    used time based-ontology is OWL-Time [17]. It is reused to

    propose other time-based ontologies. It is focused on describ-

    ing date-time information speciﬁed in Gregorian calendar

    format.

    DAML-Time ontology [18] is focused on concepts to pro-

    vide a common understanding of time, whereas DAML-S

    ontology [1] provides temporal concepts required to deﬁne

    a web service such as proﬁle, process, and time. The

    KSL-Time (Knowledge System Laboratory) ontology distin-

    guishes between different types of intervals and granularity.

    The Timeline ontology [20] extends Time Ontology by pro-

    viding various concepts representing granularity of time to

    provide more ﬂexibility to the annotations.

    2.5 Security and QoS ontologies

    STAC ontology [16] is an IoT security ontology. It deﬁnes

    the main security concepts (cryptographic concepts, security

    protocols, security tools, security properties) and classiﬁes

    threats and countermeasures by domain and according to the

    OSI model. The main purpose of this ontology is to be reused

    in numerous domains such as security of web applications,

    network management or communication networks (sensor,

    cellular and wireless).

    In IoT domain, cloud computing and edge computing are

    widely used to store, deploy and analyze data coming from

    IoT devices. Due to network overload and changing trans-

    mission delay, the QoS offered can be different. That’s why,

    it is important to measure the QoS, which is dependent on

    many factors like availability, network, robustness, security,

    scalability, performance, etc. In the literature, different QoS

    ontologies are proposed. QoS is the description or measure-

    ment of the overall performance of a service (like telephony,

    computer network) particularly the performance seen by the

    users of the network. Jiang and Aagesen [21] propose a

    QoS ontology based on functional properties representing

    service functionality, which are modeled in terms of oper-

    ations, inputs, outputs, preconditions and effects. However,

    while non-functional properties comprise business policies,

    QoS properties as well as context policies. QoS properties

    include QoS parameters and QoS policies (rule). QoS param-

    eters represent security, availability, scalability, reliability,

    performance, etc.

    [31] proposes an ontology for knowledge representation

    in the Internet of Things composed of different modules like

    IoT services, IoT resources, QoS and QoI. In IoT domain,

    QoS and QoI (Quality of information) are important, which

    exhibit a much higher level of dynamicity. In this work, [31]

    enumerates all the QoS parameters and QoI that are common

    to many applications domains. Reference [31] reuses DUL

    ontology for ontology building. This ontology will be reused

    for EdgeOnto building and precisely for the QoS.

    2.6 Ontologies for IoT applications

    In IoT domain, many ontologies are proposed: IoT ontology

    [13], IoT Lite [7], and IoT-O [29].

    IoT ontology [13] is based on the reuse of other existing

    ontologies like SSN ontology, DUL (DOLCE Ultralite Upper

    ontology) ontology and QUDT (Quantities, Units, Dimen-

    sions and Data Types) Ontology, whereas IoT-Lite ontology

    reuses SSN ontology. The description of IoT concepts is

    based on three classes: objects, system or resource and ser-

    vices. IoT devices are classiﬁed into three classes: sensing

    devices, actuating devices, and tag devices.

    IoT-Lite is focused on sensing, although it has a high-level

    concept on actuation that allows any future extension on this

    area. Services are described with a coverage representing the

    2D-spatial covered by the IoT device.

    IoT-O ontology presents connected device networks and

    semantically describes devices and data in order to make

    systems aware of their environment, its evolution, and the

    changes they can bring to it. Such a description allows smart

    agents to transform their environment thanks to connected

    actuators, according to the perceptions they have of it through

    connected sensors. IoT-O is based on following modules:

    • Sensing module: describes the input data. Its main classes

    come from SSN ontology (ssn:Observation, ssn:Sensor,

    ssn:Device, etc.).

    • Acting module: describes how the system can interact

    with the physical world. Its main classes come from SAN

    (san:Actuator and san:Actuation). It also reuses SSN

    classes that are not speciﬁc to sensing such as ssn:Device

    • Life-cycle module: models state machines to specify sys-

    tem life cycles and device usage. Its main classes are

    lifecycle: State and lifecycle:Transition.

    • Service module: represents web service interfaces. Its

    main classes come from msm:Service and msm: Opera-

    123

    Service Oriented Computing and Applications (2023) 17:25–37

    29

    tion. Services produce and consume msm:Messages, and

    RESTful services can be described with hRest.

    • Energy module: IoT-O’s energy module is deﬁned by

    PowerOnt. It provides the poweront:PowerConsumption

    class, and a set of properties to express power consump-

    tion proﬁles for appliances.

    3 Requirements and related work review

    The previously discussed ontologies summarize the most

    important concepts used in IoT domain (sensor, actuator,

    device, service, etc.). Data generated from the different

    devices are important and should be stored, treated and ana-

    lyzed through the nearest edge nodes in order to increase

    high bandwidth, faster treatment, less transmission delay and

    less packet loss. That’s why different concepts should be

    tacked into consideration in IoT ontologies proposed. These

    concepts are related to edge computing characteristics. In

    fact, edge node should support mobility, data heterogeneity,

    context-awareness (time and location), security and QoS.

    The assessment of existing IoT ontologies regarding the

    presence of key concepts is summarized in Table 1. These

    ontologies are evaluated among a set of conceptual require-

    ments detailed below (see paragraph 3).

    A set of symbols are used to determine whether the con-

    ceptual requirement is supported by the ontology or not:

    • *: The conceptual requirement is not supported by the

    ontology.

    • ** : The conceptual requirement is quite supported by

    the ontology.

    • ***: The conceptual requirement is well supported by

    the ontology.

    Requirements The evaluation of related ontologies is based

    on conceptual requirements identiﬁed as follows:

    • CR1: “Cloud” constitutes the servers accessible on the

    Internet as well as software and databases which run on

    these servers. The servers located in the cloud are hosted

    in data centers distributed around the world.

    • CR2: “Edge” constitutes a computer that acts as an end

    user portal for communication with other nodes. In this

    paper, edge node allows the communication between

    cloud and IoT device.

    • CR3: “Location” constitutes context location of an entity

    in general (e.g., device, actuator, cloud, edge). A distinc-

    tion is made between physical place and virtual place.

    • CR3.1: “Physical place” constitutes an absolute position

    with geographic coordinates.

    • CR3.2: “Virtual place” constitutes a relative position of

    an entity.

    • CR4: “Time” constitutes the information’s given for time

    description (point in time, interval, duration, etc.).

    • CR5: “Security” constitutes a characteristic of using data.

    Data can be accessed only to suitable persons in suitable

    time and location and with some privilege.

    • CR6: “QoS” constitutes the quality of service offered in

    terms of properties and metrics used.

    None of the above-reviewed work meet all the require-

    ments (Table 1). More speciﬁcally, some ontologies meet

    partially the third, fourth, ﬁfth and seventh requirements

    (time and context-awareness). None meets even the ﬁrst, the

    second and the third requirements (edge, cloud, virtual loca-

    tion).

    Nowadays, the use of IoT devices is coupled by the use of

    cloud computing and edge computing for many reasons.

    First, it is an opportunity to analyze data generated by IoT

    devices locally (the nearest edge node used) without sending

    it to cloud. This can facilitate useful data identiﬁcation and

    reduce packet loss and transmission delay. Some applications

    need real-time treatment, which can be guaranteed by edge

    computing.

    Second, edge node support data heterogeneity of IoT

    devices.

    Finally, it is an opportunity to know the localization of an

    object which can be physical or virtual, the quality of service

    offered and information’s about time.

    To put it in a nut shell, an Iot ontology based on the use

    of edge computing should integrate other concepts useful in

    addition to the concepts already presented in the literature in

    relation to device, life cycle, consumption and other.

    The next section gives an overview about these concepts

    and the different requirement which should be respected on

    the one hand. On the other hand, it details reused ontologies

    for the design process of our EdgeOnto ontology.

    4 EdgeOnto principles and design model

    The design process of EdgeOnto is based on the NeOn

    methodology presented in [14]. The NeOn methodology

    is used for building ontology networks and is based on

    the “divide-and-conquer” strategy which decomposes the

    general problem to be solved in different sub-problems rep-

    resented by nine scenarios combined among them [14].

    The ﬁrst step of the NeOn process is to deﬁne conceptual

    and functional requirements (detailed in Sect. 4.1). Con-

    ceptual requirements determine the concepts that should be

    present in the EdgeOnto and are used to analyze existing IoT,

    time-based, location-based, context-awareness and security

    ontologies detailed in Sect. 3.

    As recommended by NeOn, reusable ontologies that are

    compliant with parts of the requirements are integrated in our

    design process and presented in Sect. 4.2.

    4.1 Functional requirements

    Functional requirements regard the ontology structure and

    design principles. Reusability is an important aspect of

    ontology. Many approaches can be used to solve ontology

    reusability.

    • Modularization: designing ontologies in separated mod-

    ules makes them easier to reuse and/or extend [2]. In IoT

    applications, many domains can be integrated and it is

    difﬁcult to capture them in the same ontology. Accord-

    ing to speciﬁc needs and goals, modular ontologies can

    be combined together [29].

    • Reuse of Existing Sources: in order to avoid redeﬁnition

    and prevent redeﬁned concepts from having to align a

    posteriori [29].

    • Alignment to Upper Ontologies: The concepts expressed

    by upper ontologies are intended to be basic and univer-

    sal to ensure generality and expressivity for a wide range

    of domains especially for IoT domain. These concepts

    are meta, generic, abstract and philosophical. The advan-

    tage of top-level ontologies is to gather lots of available

    knowledge and create super structures for information

    that provide interoperability for many applications [9].

    4.2 Reused ontologies for EdgeOnto

    For the design process of EdgeOnto, we reuse some existing

    ontologies: The IoT-O ontology [29], the description ontol-

    ogy for knowledge representation in the IoT domain [31], as

    well as, the DUL ontology.2,3

    4.2.1 DUL ontology

    DUL relies on DOLCE+DnS Ultralite ontology.4 It is a sim-

    pliﬁcation and an improvement of some parts of DOLCE

    Lite-Plus library,5 and Descriptions and Situations ontol-

    ogy.6 The DUL ontology main concepts are presented in

    Fig. 2.

    The main abstract classes of DUL ontology are:

    • DUL:Abstract: Any entity that cannot be located in

    space-time (like mathematical entities: formal semantics

    elements, regions within dimensional spaces, etc.).

    31

    Fig. 2 DUL ontology tree concepts

    • DUL:Event: Any physical, social, or mental process,

    event, or state. More theoretically, events can be clas-

    siﬁed in different ways, possibly based on ’aspect’ (e.g.,

    stative, continuous, accomplishment, achievement, etc.),

    on ’agentivity’ (e.g., intentional, natural, etc.), or on ’typ-

    ical participants’ (e.g., human, physical, abstract, food,

    etc.).

    • DUL:InformationEntity: A piece of information, be it

    concretely realized or not. It is a catchall class, intended

    to bypass the ambiguities of many data or text that could

    denote either an expression or a concrete realization of

    that expression.

    • DUL:Object: Any physical, social, or mental object, or

    a substance. Following DOLCE Full, objects are always

    participating in some event (at least their own life), and

    are spatially located.

    • DUL:Quality: Any aspect of an Entity (but not a part of

    it), which cannot exist without that Entity. For example,

    the way the surface of a speciﬁc PhysicalObject looks

    like, or the speciﬁc light of a place at a certain time, are

    examples of Quality, while the encoding of a Quality into,

    e.g., a PhysicalAttribute should be modeled as a Region.

    • DUL:Situation: A view, consistent with (’satisfying’) a

    Description, on a set of entities. It can also be seen as a

    ’relational context’ created by an observer on the basis

    of a ’frame’ (i.e., a Description).

    For the rest of the paper, we have identiﬁed some conven-

    tions to follow. The concepts’ names related to each ontology

    used are in bold and have the sans serif font different from

    the normal text. The concepts’ names are proceeded by the

    name of the corresponding ontology.

    4.2.2 IoT-O ontology

    Reference [29] presents a core-domain modular IoT ontol-

    ogy with a vocabulary to describe connected devices and

    their relation with their environment. IoT-O is reused in our

    EdgeOnto because it is based on DUL ontology as well as

    other reference existing related to IoT (like SSN, life cycle,

    msm, PowerOnt, SAN). More informations are given about

    IoT-O in Sect. 2.6. The IoT-O OWL ﬁle is available at the

    following address.7

    4.2.3 Knowledge representation ontology

    Reference [31] presents an ontology for knowledge represen-

    tation in the IoT domain and discusses how it can be used to

    support tasks such as service discovery, testing and dynamic

    composition (see Sect. 2.5). The main concepts reused of the

    description ontology [31] are QualityOfService, IoTService

    and IoTResource. For facilitating concepts’ referencing, we

    give the acronym DO to the Description Ontology of [31].

    The next section details the core domain EdgeOnto ontology

    applied for IoT domain in the context of edge computing.

    5 EdgeOnto architecture and speciﬁcations

    This section ﬁrstly discusses the several modules (i.e., IoT,

    location and time-awareness, and QoS management) that

    make up the EdgeOnto core domain. Our ontology is OWL-

    based (ontology web language). For each module, we detail

    the multiple deﬁned concepts, as well as, the relations

    between them. Then, the second subsection formalizes the

    end user requests to query EdgeOnto. This is followed by the

    description of the associated semantic matching procedure.

    5.1 EdgeOnto core-domain

    EdgeOnto answers to the following questions: What domain

    EdgeOnto will cover (IoT domain applied to Cloud and Edge

    Computing)? For what EdgeOnto will be used (searching the

    nearest edge to the IoT device and choosing the most suitable

    7 https://www.irit.fr/recherches/MELODI/ontologies/IoT-O.html.

    123

    32

    Service Oriented Computing and Applications (2023) 17:25–37

    one)? For what types of queries, EdgeOnto should provide

    answers (proximity, similarity)? A deep analysis is under-

    taken to extract the main concepts related both to cloud,

    edge computing and its use in IoT. Related ﬁelds used in

    this analysis are fog computing, multi-access edge comput-

    ing, time-based, location and IoT ontologies. The concept

    extracted is represented already by the conceptual require-

    ments.

    Secondly, an abstraction exercise is undertaken for iden-

    tifying the main common concepts shared by various IoT

    applications and using cloud and edge computing. Concepts

    are organized as a class hierarchy where abstract concepts

    will be reﬁned with more concrete ones speciﬁc to each

    domain application. They are also described with properties

    and connected to other concepts with semantic relations. We

    tried not to reinvent the wheel, so we further reuse existing

    ontologies (see Sect. 4.2).

    The design process of EdgeOnto is based on:

    • the formal speciﬁcation of the functionalities achieved

    by EdgeOnto. It reuses both DUL, IoT-O and DO [31]

    ontologies and describe the main concepts related to IoT

    domain applied in the context of edge computing (see

    Sect. 4.1).

    • the formal speciﬁcation of what precisely the EdgeOnto

    needs/requires for identifying time, location and QoS,

    edge, cloud. In fact, EdgeOnto covers the conceptual

    requirements CR1, CR2, CR3, CR4, CR5 and CR6.

    . After importing reused ontologies, a matching process is

    undertaken to integrate (i) new concepts to added and (ii)

    align concepts reused.

    EdgeOnto is based on three modules:

    • IoT module: describes the main concepts related to IoT

    (IoT-Thing, device, actuator, sensing device, etc.) and

    edge computing (edge, cloud).

    • Time and location module: describes the main concepts

    related to time and location of each object in EdgeOnto

    (for example, location of an IoT-Thing in point of time,

    location of an edge node in instant t, location of a cloud

    node, etc.)

    • QoS module: describes the quality of service between

    EdgeOnto objects (IoT devices, edge and clouds).

    A set of semantic relations are deﬁned in EdgeOnto rep-

    resented in Table 2.

    5.1.1 IoT module

    This dimension encompasses four main concepts, namely

    EdgeOnto:Cloud,EdgeOnto:Edge,EdgeOnto:Resourceand

    IoT-O:IoT-Thing (Fig. 3).

    Fig. 3 EdgeOnto concepts related to IoT

    • IoT-Thing refers to device (IoT-O:Sensing_device,

    EdgeOnto:Actuator,

    EdgeOnto:Mobile_device

    and

    EdgeOnto:Computing_device)

    • DO:IoT-Resource which can be a server or an Iot -

    Gateway.

    • Aresourcecanbephysical(EdgeOnto:PhysicalResource)

    or virtual(EdgeOnto: VirtualResource) and is used by a

    cloud or an edge.

    • Cloud or edge (represented, respectively, by EdgeOnto

    by EdgeOnto:Cloudand EdgeOnto:Edge)arenodespro-

    grammed enabling recognition, processing or forwarding

    transmission to other nodes.

    – A node cloud (datacenter, database, server, etc.) is

    related to cloud computing which is deﬁned by NIST

    as “a model for enabling convenient, on demand

    network access to a shared pool of conﬁgurable com-

    puting resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,

    applications, and services) that can be rapidly provi-

    sioned and released with minimal management effort

    or service provider interaction”.

    – An edge node (switcher, router, small/macro base sta-

    tion, etc.) is a node that acts as an end user portal

    for communication with other nodes (cloud node or

    device node).

    – Edge

    nodes

    are

    located

    between

    device

    (EdgeOnto:Device) and cloud (EdgeOnto:Cloud)

    and can facilitate computations nearer to the source

    of data (or where data is generated) and can incorpo-

    rate strategies for remotely enhancing capabilities of

    front-end devices [30].

    The concepts proposed in this dimension are inherited from

    the DUL ontology (Fig. 4). For time dimension, we reuse

    mainly the concept of DUL:Time Interval deﬁned as “any

    region in a dimensional space that aims at representing time”.

    For representing location, three types of place can be dis-

    tinguished:

    • Dependent location (represented by DUL: Place): is geo-

    graphic entities and non-material locations determined

    by the presence of other entities or of pivot of events and

    signs as well as identiﬁed as complement to other entities.

    For example, the area where the mobile phone is located,

    surrounding of a temperature sensor

    • Non-dependent location (represented by DUL: Physical

    place): can exist independently. It refers to a physical

    place where a physical object is inherently located. For

    example, a room, a building.

    • Abstract or dimensional location (represented by DUL:

    Space Region): is any speciﬁc region in a dimensional

    spacethatisusedtolocalizeanentity(forexample,cloud,

    edge node, device, etc.).

    The semantic relation DUL: is region for is deﬁned

    between DUL:Region and DUL: Entity. In EdgeOnto, this

    relation is available between DUL:Space Region, which is a

    DUL:Region and DUL: Entity.The inverse relation of DUL:Is

    region for is DUL:Has region

    Thesemanticrelation DUL:Haslocationisdeﬁnedbetween

    DUL:Entity and DUL:Entity. In EdgeOnto, this relation

    is available between any entity (like EdgeOnto:Cloud,

    EdgeOnto:Edge, EdgeOnto:Device, etc.) and DUL: Place or

    DU:LPhysical place which are DUL:Entity. The inverse rela-

    tion of DUL:Has location is DUL:Is location of. To ensure

    a consistent instantiation of concepts, Semantic Web Rule

    Language (SWRL) rules (including axioms) help enforce

    restrictions on attribute values and semantic relations, as

    well. Hereafter, we only exemplify SWRL rules referring to

    concepts. For example, Eq. 1 formally reﬂects the following

    statement: “Any EdgeOnto (?x) has location a place (?y) or a

    physicalplace(?z)andhasregionsomespaceregion(?p)dur-

    ing a time interval (?t)”. Informally, each concept related to

    EdgeOnto (like Edge, Cloud or device) should have at least a

    location (which can be a physical place or a dependent place)

    during a time interval or a point of time.

    EdgeOnto(?x) →

    hasLocation(?x, (place(?y, ?x) |

    physicalplace(?z, ?x)))∧

    hasRegion(?t, SpaceRegion(?x, ?p),

    TimeInterval(?t))

    (1)

    5.1.3 QOS management module

    QoS is the description or measurement of the overall perfor-

    mance of a particularly the performance seen by the users of

    the network.

    Different measurements are taken into account to char-

    acterize and evaluate QoS like availability, performance,

    reliability, scalability, and security.

    deﬁnetheconceptofQualityofService(DO:QualityOfService)

    as a DUL:Information Object.

    In IoT-O, reference [29] reuses also the DUL:Information

    Object which ”is a piece of information, be concretely real-

    ized or not. It is intended to bypass the ambiguities of many

    data or text”.

    and

    IoT-O,

    DO:

    QualityOfServiceistreatedinthispaperasan DUL:Information

    Object which is DUL:Information Entity (Fig. 5).

    In IoT-O, a semantic relation IoT-O:hasQoS is deﬁned

    between IoT-O:Service and DO:QualityOfService. In [29],

    IoT-O:Service is “a set of operation and provides a user a way

    to issue requests through an interface. Underlying implemen-

    tation need not to be known by the end user”.

    SWRL rules are deﬁned to infer new semantic relations

    between instances during concept instantiation related to

    QoS dimension. For instance, Eq. 2 formally reﬂects the fol-

    lowing statement: “Any EdgeOnto (?x) that offers a service

    (?y) should has a speciﬁc quality of service (?u)”. Informally,

    each EdgeOnto concept deﬁned as an object (like device,

    cloud, or edge) offers a certain service which has a quality.

    The quality of service offered is already measured by differ-

    ent metrics in the literature.

    EdgeOnto(?x) ∧ of f ers(?x, Service(?y))

    → hasQoS(?x, QualityO f Service(?z, ?u))

    (2)

    - x corresponds to the EdgeOnto instance(s) to be retrieved.

    5.2 User request building

    We deﬁne requirement (REQ) as a set of concepts in

    EdgeOnto requested by the user Ui. We have already detailed

    the set of requirement in Sect. 3. Formally, Eq. 3 represents

    the syntax used for specifying REQ.

    RE Qi = EdgeOnto(?x)[∧Concept j(?x, y)] j=1..n

    (3)

    where

    • Concept j ∈ EdgeOnto (concepts related to this ontol-

    ogy).

    • Note Ui can reﬁne EdgeOnto into concrete concepts

    related to a speciﬁc domain.

    5.3 Semantic matching

    Semantic matching is a technique used to identify informa-

    tion (concepts in the case of ontology) which is semantically

    related. The semantic match maker algorithm takes an OWL-

    S request for the user as input and iterates every OWL-S

    advertisement in its repository in order to determine a match

    [6]. In the OWL-S approach, functionality of a service is

    described in terms of inputs, outputs, preconditions and

    effects. Input and output terms of the service are expressed as

    concepts belonging to a set of ontologies. An advertisement

    (Advt) and a query (Query) match if their outputs and inputs

    match.

    • For every input parameter in Advt, there is one input

    parameter in query. Let Queryin and Advtin represent

    the list of input concepts of query and the advertisement,

    respectively. The service can correctly perform the task

    if all the input concepts deﬁned in the advertisement are

    satisﬁed by the requester (Eq. 4).

    • For every output parameter in Query, there is one output

    parameter in Advt. Let Queryout and Advtout represent

    the list of output concepts of query and the advertisement,

    respectively. The service can be used by the requester if

    all the output concepts deﬁned in the query are satisﬁed

    by the advertisement (Eq. 5).

    ∀c ∈ Advtin, ∃d ∈ Queryin, s.t.match(c, d) ̸= Fail (4)

    ∀c ∈ Queryout, ∃d ∈ Advtout, s.t.match(c, d) ̸= Fail (5)

    6 Use case implementation and

    experimentation

    This section brieﬂy describes the considered test collection

    and presents the EdgeOnto’s population. Then, it discusses

    the performed experiments to evaluate and validate our ﬁnd-

    ings. Finally, it presents the obtained measurements in terms

    of performance and robustness.

    6.1 Test collection

    Table 3 shows an excerpt of EdgeOnto’s population. There

    are three dimensions: IoT, location, time and QoS dimen-

    sions. To conduct experiments on EdgeOnto semantic dis-

    covery, we ﬁrst proceed with the test collection creation.

    For a clarity purpose, Table 4 presents an excerpt of the

    case introduced in the Sect. 1.

    SWRL rules are deﬁned to infer new semantic relations

    between instances during EdgeOnto’s population.

    For instance, Eq. 6 states that “Any Device (?x) that offers

    a Service (?y) at a point of time or Interval Time (?t) located

    onaPhysicalplaceorPlaceorSpaceregion(?l)shouldaccess

    to some Edge (?z) the nearest to this device.

    → ∃Edge(?z) ∧ access(?x, Edge(?z))

    ∧nearT o(?x, Edge(?z))

    (6)

    6.2 Performance analysis

    To assess the proposed approach’s performance, we use two

    metrics, namely completeness and efﬁciency. The former

    describes how well our Protégé matchmaker identiﬁes the

    relevant EdgeOnto concepts compared with the total number

    of such EdgeOnto concepts that exist in the test collection.

    The latter describes how well Protégé identiﬁes only those

    relevant EdgeOnto concepts, by comparing the number of

    target EdgeOnto-identiﬁed concepts with the total number

    of EdgeOnto-retrieved concepts. The main preference met-

    rics are True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), and False

    Negative (FN) where

    123

    36

    Service Oriented Computing and Applications (2023) 17:25–37

    • TP contains the retrieved EdgeOnto concepts that are rel-

    evant

    • FP contains the retrieved EdgeOnto concepts that are not

    relevant

    • FN contains the relevant EdgeOnto concepts that are not

    retrieved (i.e., discarded by the matchmaker).

    Once the sets mentioned above are established, two pop-

    ular performance measurements, in the semantic web and

    machine learning communities, are calculated, namely recall

    and precision. These performance measurements implement

    completeness and efﬁciency metrics and are deﬁned, respec-

    tively, as follows:

    • Recall is the quantity’s measure in the response (how

    close was the result to the actual response). It refers to

    the ratio between the number of true-positive EdgeOnto

    concepts and the number of relevant EdgeOnto concepts,

    including true-positive EdgeOnto concepts and false-

    negative EdgeOnto concepts (Eq. 7).

    Recall =

    TP

    TP + FN

    (7)

    • Precision is the quality’s measure of the response (how

    much the response is correct). It refers to the ratio

    between the number of true-positive EdgeOnto concepts

    and the total number of retrieved EdgeOnto concepts,

    including true-positive and false-positive EdgeOnto con-

    cepts (Eq. 8).

    Precision =

    TP

    TP + FP

    (8)

    6.3 Robustness evaluation

    This section discusses the performed experiments to evaluate

    and validate our ﬁndings. It presents the analyzed obtained

    measurements in terms of performance and robustness by

    applying Eqs. 8 and 7:

    Precision = 0.875 and Recall = 0.954

    These measurements depict that EdgeOnto reach good accu-

    racy for requests’ response (75%) Compared with other IoT

    ontologies, none of the user requests mentioned in Table 4

    can give relevant responses and satisfy user requests. This is

    justiﬁed by many reasons:

    • Lack of concepts in relation with mobility

    • Lack of concepts in relation with context, location and

    time awareness

    • Lack of concepts related to edge, cloud, and device types.

    • Lack of concepts describing quality of service .

    In fact, the proposed ontology EdgeOnto clearly outperforms

    the other IoT ontologies and can provide much better accu-

    racy.

    7 Conclusion and future work

    IoT domain relies, nowadays on hybrid cloud/edge environ-

    ment for faster communication, lower bandwidth and better

    local treatment.

    Compared with existing works, most of them don’t sat-

    isfy the requirements already deﬁned about time, location,

    mobility, and quality of service.

    In this paper, we propose a semantic model (EdgeOnto)

    which highlights all concepts related to IoT applied in the

    context of edge computing. Its main goal is to support the

    automation of the QoS management procedures in hybrid

    cloud/edge environment and the discovery of the relevant

    edge nodes that are suitable to host and execute IoT services

    considering their requirements.

    The illustrative use case is smart strawberry farming [12],

    and the proposed edge platform aims to be an all-in-one

    IoT platform to enable the intelligent farm on strawberries

    cultivation with wireless sensor network (WSN), computer

    vision (CV), machine learning (ML), and long-range (LoRa)

    communication capabilities. The platform makes available

    to the user all the captured metrics for manual analysis and

    data-driven decisions. This platform studies only the com-

    munication between devices and edges where devices and

    edges are static and have the same location during the straw-

    berry farming scenario. In addition to these limitations, the

    current edge framework lacks of automation when imple-

    menting steps that make up the IoT services life cycle in

    hybrid cloud/edge environment. Edge nodes are often manu-

    ally selected during deployment time and most of the regular

    QoS management procedures remain difﬁcult to implement.

    In future works, we study deeply the problem of optimal

    placement where edge and device are simultaneously mobile.

    In fact, when device node is mobile, we should ﬁnd the opti-

    mal edge node the nearest to this device node ensuring a

    sufﬁcient and acceptable quality of service.

  analysis: Integrating data fusion strategies into end-to-end automated irrigation
    control frameworks can address the varying data quality requirements of different
    irrigation management applications. Adaptive weighted fusion, Kalman fusion, and
    Naïve fusion are compared in this context, with Kalman fusion showing potential
    for use in applications that require high overall data quality and can tolerate
    higher computational burden, while adaptive weighted fusion is suitable for more
    resource-constrained applications and Naïve fusion is a simple approach that can
    be used when application requirements are not well-defined.

    \ been shown to be crucial for the development of IoT-\nbased applications. Different\
    \ IoT applications’ varying data quality requirements pose a challenge,\nas each\
    \ application requires a unique data quality process. This creates scalability\
    \ issues as the\nnumber of applications increases, and it also has ﬁnancial implications,\
    \ as it would require a separate\ndata pipeline for each application. To address\
    \ this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach\nintegrating fusion methods\
    \ into end-to-end data quality assessment to cater to different applications\n\
    within a single data pipeline. By using real-time and historical analytics, the\
    \ study investigates the\neffects of each fusion method on the resulting data\
    \ quality score and how this can be used to support\ndifferent applications. The\
    \ study results, based on two real-world datasets, indicate that Kalman\nfusion\
    \ had a higher overall mean quality score than Adaptive weighted fusion and Naïve\
    \ fusion.\nHowever, Kalman fusion also had a higher computational burden on the\
    \ system. The proposed\nsolution offers a ﬂexible and efﬁcient approach to addressing\
    \ IoT applications’ diverse data quality\nneeds within a single data pipeline.\n\
    Keywords: data quality; internet of things (IoT); trust; big data model; data\
    \ fusion\n1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) has played a pivotal role\
    \ in developing applications in\nmany industries, from smart agriculture to transportation,\
    \ health care, and homes. At its\ncore, IoT is the integration of information\
    \ and communication technologies into everyday\nprocesses [1]. Sensors interact\
    \ with the environment and collect data, and actuators receive\ncontrol signals\
    \ from controllers. It is estimated that over 55.7 billion devices will be\nconnected\
    \ to the Internet, producing over 73.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data by 2025 [2]. From\n\
    these IoT deployments, a vast amount of data are collected and used to advance\
    \ innovations\nand improve decision marking.\nLike many IoT solutions, however,\
    \ deployments are often composed of heterogeneous\nsensor systems to ensure data\
    \ collection [3]. The resulting data can suffer from high\nvariability, inconsistencies,\
    \ and gaps. As data are at the center of inferring new insights,\nit is essential\
    \ to assess the quality of the data from which decisions are made. A poor\nunderstanding\
    \ of the quality of the data can lead to poor decisions. Therefore, data quality\n\
    assessment solutions have been proposed [4–7].\nThe factors (issues) that degrade\
    \ the quality of IoT data exist at various stages through-\nout the big data cycle.\
    \ Karkouch et al. [5] deﬁne several of these factors (sensor faults,\nresource\
    \ limitations, network connectivity, security, and privacy) and illustrate their\
    \ place-\nment into and through the big data cycle. Figure 1 shows how various\
    \ issues exist at\ndifferent stages. Therefore, data quality assessment should\
    \ also be carried out continuously\nSensors 2023, 23, 5993. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23135993\n\

    \ the big data cycle. Quantifying, understanding, and making these data quality\n\
    issues visible throughout the big data model is essential for effective insight.\n\

    \ presents have led to the development of many data\nquality assessment solutions\
    \ to mitigate the effects of poor data quality. Yang et al. [8]\nproposed data\
    \ quality assessment data based on deep learning for effective pest identiﬁca-\n\
    tion in smart agriculture. Fizza et al. [9] proposed a conceptual data quality\
    \ assessment\nframework that is applied to monitor milk conditions for dairy farms.\n\
    More general solutions have also been proposed. Khokhlov et al. [10] proposed\
    \ a\nframework that uses a knowledge graph to connect various DQ metrics for IoT\
    \ applications.\nMante et al. [11] implemented a 5D-IoT framework for heterogeneous\
    \ IoT systems using\nthe semantic descriptions of sensor observations to assess\
    \ the data. Several other solutions\nhave also been reported [12]. A common feature\
    \ of all these solutions is that they all\nassume data quality is an isolated\
    \ problem that affects a single stage of the big data cycle.\nData quality challenges,\
    \ however, exist at various stages throughout the big data cycle [4].\nEvaluating\
    \ at a single stage misrepresents the quality of the processing chain with respect\n\
    to the applied data. This affects the end user applications in two ways: (1) Using\
    \ data with\nincorrectly calculated quality assessment. (2) Lack of knowledge\
    \ of where in the chain the\ndata quality suffers, or indeed, is enhanced.\nEffective\
    \ data quality assessment is based on a consumer’s (application) fitness for\n\
    use requirements, and indeed, this changes from one user to another [13]. Previous\
    \ re-\nsearch [14,15] has used the phrase fitness for use and data quality interchangeably.\
    \ This\ndefinition of data quality suggests that it is strongly influenced by\
    \ the end user applica-\ntion. Each application has its own unique combination\
    \ of data quality dimensions (DQD)\nthroughout the big data cycle. This forms\
    \ its fitness for use requirements. DQDs provide an\nacceptable way to measure\
    \ data quality, for example, timeliness, accuracy, and completeness.\nExisting\
    \ solutions consider data quality assurance to be a necessary step at a single\n\
    stage (data preprocessing) [13], applied like a Quality Gate with a predeﬁned\
    \ end point.\nOnce the objective is satisﬁed, they assume a lasting standard of\
    \ data quality [13]. It is,\nhowever, a common practice in most IoT deployments\
    \ to use the same data for different\napplications and use cases, or enrich the\
    \ data with external data sources, hence different\nﬁtness for use requirements.\
    \ Such processes are essential for domain-speciﬁc applications [4].\nAs the data\
    \ changes through the big data cycle, so should data quality considerations. None\n\
    of the existing solutions account for the changing nature of data, and hence data\
    \ quality\nthroughout the big data cycle in a single data pipeline.\nThis paper\
    \ implements a data quality assessment solution that uses data fusion strate-\n\
    gies to ensure continuous end-to-end data quality assessment throughout the big\
    \ data\ncycle. More speciﬁcally, this paper seeks to deﬁne a tangible link between\
    \ data quality, data\nquality stages, and their effect on the data through the\
    \ stages in the big data model using data fusion.\nSensors 2023, 23, 5993\n3 of\
    \ 18\nThis builds on previous research that uses trust to evaluate data quality\
    \ [4,16]. This paper,\ntherefore, uses data fusion strategies to combine quality\
    \ scores at each stage into a single\nscore, while maintaining the contribution\
    \ of each stage.\nEach stage has unique data quality properties, and how these\
    \ are combined deter-\nmines the ﬁtness for use for different applications. To\
    \ deliver this unique experience for\neach application within a single data pipeline\
    \ requires a custom fusion strategy for each\napplication. Section 2 gives a detailed\
    \ motivation using two example applications: real-\ntime analytics and historical\
    \ analytics. It also highlights the importance of evaluating the\ncomputational\
    \ efﬁciency of the different fusion strategies. To this end, the following are\
    \ the\ncore contributions of this paper:\n1.\nReview data fusion strategies and\
    \ implement a fusion engine that can integrate\ninto big data data quality assessment\
    \ frameworks for IoT applications. This paper\ncompares three fusion strategies,\
    \ Adaptive weighted fusion, Kalman’s fusion, and a\nNaïve fusion strategy. These\
    \ are compared in terms of computational resources.\n2.\nUsing real-time analytics\
    \ and historical analytics as examples, this paper illustrates\nhow different\
    \ fusion strategies can be harnessed to support different IoT applications’\n\
    unique data quality needs. Different applications can have varying data quality\
    \ needs.\n3.\nIntegrate various industry standard data processing tools (e.g.,\
    \ Hadoop, Spark, and\nKafka) to implement a real-time data quality assessment\
    \ solution and also evaluate the\ncomputation resource efﬁciency associated with\
    \ the fusion methods in an end-to-end\ndata pipeline.\nThe rest of this paper\
    \ is structured as follows: Section 2 highlights the need to integrate\ndata fusion\
    \ into big data quality assessment. Section 3 introduces data quality, trust,\
    \ and\ndata fusion. These are the core concepts of this paper. It also highlights\
    \ related work.\nSection 4 outlines the theoretical and mathematical deﬁnition\
    \ of the framework. Section 5\nhighlights the two evaluating strategies used in\
    \ the paper, and ﬁnally, Section 6 gives the\nsummary and conclusive remarks.\n\
    2. Motivation\nThis section presents the motivation for integrating data fusion\
    \ strategies into end-\nto-end big data quality assessment for IoT applications\
    \ and evaluating the computational\nefﬁciency of each fusion strategy. Data quality\
    \ assessment is a complex and multidimen-\nsional process [17]. An organized methodology\
    \ ensures big data quality throughout its\nentire lifecycle. This methodology\
    \ must include a comprehensive view of quality metrics\nfrom the start of data\
    \ acquisition to the implementation [18]. To this end, an end-to-end\ndata quality\
    \ assessment framework has been deﬁned [16].\nThis proposed approach evaluates\
    \ various data quality dimensions at different stages\nof the big data cycle,\
    \ ultimately resulting in a single quality score that applications can\neasily\
    \ apply. This provides visibility of the individual quality factors at each stage.\
    \ IoT\napplications, however, have varying ﬁtness for use requirements. Consider\
    \ two broad\nclasses of applications, real-time analytics and historical analytics,\
    \ and three data quality\ndimensions, timeliness, accuracy, and completeness.\
    \ Real-time applications require instan-\ntaneous input and fast analysis to make\
    \ decisions or take actions within a speciﬁc time\nframe. Processing data quickly\
    \ with minimal latency is essential for the development and\ndeployment of real-time\
    \ applications [19]. Some examples of this include smart intelligent\ntransportation,\
    \ fraud detection, ﬁnancial trading, and many others. Real-time analytics has\n\
    an essential requirement for timely data. Accuracy and completeness are considered\
    \ desir-\nable. Historical big data analytics, on the other hand, do not require\
    \ timely data [19]. Some\nexamples of it include yield prediction is smart agriculture,\
    \ weather predictions, and many\nothers. Such applications have an essential requirement\
    \ for completeness. Each application\nhas a unique ﬁtness for use requirement\
    \ and hence varying data quality requirements.\nTable 1 summarizes the ﬁtness\
    \ for use differences between real-time and historical analytics\napplications\
    \ based on the above requirements.\nSensors 2023, 23, 5993\n4 of 18\nTable 1.\

    Desirable\nEssential\nA challenge therefore exists. Given a single data stream\
    \ within an IoT data shared\nenvironment, how might a single data pipeline be\
    \ developed that combines the various\nDQDs at different stages of the big data\
    \ cycle to achieve a customize data quality score\nthat uniquely satisﬁes each\
    \ application. Currently, a few options exist: (1) A different data\nquality assessment\
    \ process can be developed for each unique application and integrated\nwithin\
    \ a single data pipeline. This is illustrated as option 1 in Figure 2. (2) Each\
    \ unique\napplication can have its data pipeline integrated with data quality\
    \ assessment that meets\nits unique requirements. This is illustrated as option\
    \ 2 in Figure 2. The ﬁrst case requires\nmaintaining two data quality assessment\
    \ processes, and the last requires maintaining two\ndata pipelines, each with\
    \ its data quality assessment process. Therefore, as the number of\nuse cases\
    \ increases, so would the need to scale the pipelines. This, however, introduces\n\
    redundancy, creating difﬁculties in consistency, and it has ﬁnancial implications.\n\

    \ Illustrations of the different way to cater to each application’s ﬁtness for\
    \ use requirements.\nIt is crucial to deliver high-quality data through a single\
    \ data pipeline, but there are\nadditional requirements that must be taken into\
    \ account. Many IoT applications have the\nability to off-load certain analytical\
    \ processes to the lower layers of the application, for\nexample, fog and edge\
    \ [20]. Such analytical processes might require data quality assessment.\nA challenge\
    \ exists in these kind of applications. Given various fusion strategies, when\
    \ is it\nappropriate to choose a given strategy based on their computational resource\
    \ utilization?\nFor example, Kalman’s fusion has been reported to be computationally\
    \ expensive [21],\nand therefore, it might not be efﬁcient for edge applications\
    \ that are characterized by low\ncomputational resources.\nThis paper proposes\
    \ an approach that uses fusion within a single data pipeline to\ndeliver a unique\
    \ experience for each application. As the use cases increase, so might the\nfusion\
    \ engine scale to support them. Fusion techniques have been widely used to combine\n\
    different parts of the same or sometimes different systems to complement or beneﬁt\
    \ from\nthe advantages of each. Fusion has an advantage that allows for the weighting\
    \ of the combi-\nnation of the DQDs to be tailored to speciﬁc applications. Therefore,\
    \ this paper investigates\nhow various fusion techniques can be integrated into\
    \ big data quality assessment to deliver\na single data pipeline that can uniquely\
    \ cater to each application’s data quality needs. It\nalso assesses the computational\
    \ resource utilization of the fusion techniques.\nSensors 2023, 23, 5993\n5 of\
    \ 18\n3. Background and Related Work\nThis paper builds on previous research on\
    \ data quality assessment using trust and\ncompares the performance of different\
    \ data fusion strategies. This section deﬁnes key\nconcepts that form the basis\
    \ for the remainder of the paper.\n3.1. Data Quality\nIoT data are a crucial part\
    \ of many systems today and are used to aid decision making\nand create innovations.\
    \ Much of the data used, however, are curated by low-cost sensors,\nwhich can\
    \ be unreliable or inaccurate [22]. Assessing the quality of such data before\
    \ use\nis therefore important. Data quality has been deﬁned differently by several\
    \ authors due\nto its subjective nature. Heravizadeh et al. [23] deﬁne data quality\
    \ as the totality of an\nentity’s characteristics (data) that bear on its ability\
    \ to satisfy stated and implied needs.\nSidi et al. [24] deﬁne data quality as\
    \ appropriateness for use or meeting user needs. This\ndeﬁnitions aligns with\
    \ the illustration given in section 2. Not all applications have the same\ndata\
    \ quality requirements.\nLee et al. [25] present a structured method to represent\
    \ and apply a wide range of\nmetrics, possibly subjective to coefﬁcients. This\
    \ uses the concept of data quality dimensions\n(DQDs). DQDs provide a framework\
    \ to associate wide-ranging data quality metrics to data.\nA DQD is a characteristic\
    \ or feature of information for classifying information and data\nrequirements\
    \ [25], for example, accuracy and completeness. DQDs exist at different stages\n\
    of the big data cycle. Each application has a unique weight for each DQD throughout\
    \ the\nbig data cycle. To satisfy such requirements, different fusion strategies\
    \ have to be applied.\nIn IoT and big data, various solutions have been proposed\
    \ to address the challenges\nof inadequate data quality. For instance, Kuemper\
    \ et al. [26] introduced a framework\nthat leverages the capabilities of IoT infrastructure\
    \ and interpolation algorithms to val-\nidate crowdsourced data through sensor\
    \ fusion. The authors employ machine learning\ntechniques to validate the resulting\
    \ data quality, relying on data obtained from neigh-\nboring sensors. However,\
    \ a signiﬁcant challenge faced by this and other data quality\nsolutions [9,27]\
    \ is the requirement for a gold standard for validation.\n3.2. Data Fusion\nThe\
    \ terms data and information fusion have been used interchangeably in many ﬁelds.\n\
    In some, a distinction occurs, with data fusion referring to raw, unprocessed\
    \ data and\ninformation fusion referring to processed data. Several deﬁnitions\
    \ of data fusion exist. In a\nmore concise deﬁnition, data fusion can be deﬁned\
    \ as a combination of multiple sources to\nobtain improved information; in this\
    \ context, improved information means less expensive,\nhigher-quality, or more\
    \ relevant information [28]. Data fusion is a multidisciplinary area\nthat involves\
    \ several ﬁelds, and it is not easy to establish a clear and strict classiﬁcation\
    \ [28].\nIn the context of this work, since the interest is to determine the relationship\
    \ between data\nquality properties across the big data model and how these propagate\
    \ throughout the\ncycle, this paper adopts an approach proposed by Durrant-Whyte\
    \ et al. [29]. Here, fusion\nis deﬁned according to the relations between the\
    \ input data sources. Three approaches\nare deﬁned:\n1.\nComplementary: The information\
    \ provided by the different sources represents differ-\nent parts of the system\
    \ and fusing it results in a complete representation of the system.\n2.\nRedundant:\
    \ The same target is measured by two different processes, and fusing of the\n\
    resulting information can lead to increased conﬁdence.\n3.\nCooperative: The result\
    \ of the fusion process is said to produce new information that\nis typically\
    \ more complex than the original information.\nFigure 3 summaries Whyte’s three\
    \ classiﬁcation strategies based on the relationships\nbetween the data sources\
    \ and shows how different sources can be combined under scenarios.\nA more detailed\
    \ description can be found here [28].\nSensors 2023, 23, 5993\n6 of 18\n(a + b)\n\

    \ over the past years, with several\ntechniques reported and used in many applications\
    \ [30]. Traditional fusion methods such\nas least square estimation and arithmetic\
    \ mean have been reported to have low accuracies\nin many situations [31,32].\
    \ Commonly used techniques such as fuzzy logic, Kalman ﬁlter,\nand Bayesian inference\
    \ also suffer from their own limitations [33–35].\nKalman ﬁlter is a form of statistical\
    \ interpolation that uses a model of dynamics and\nonboard sensor measurements\
    \ to recursively determine estimates for data fusion [36]. This\ntechnique requires\
    \ the system to provide the accurate state, observation equations, and\nprior\
    \ knowledge of the statistical characteristics of the system and observation noise\
    \ [30,37].\nKalman ﬁlters exist in several forms. There is the basic Kalman ﬁlter,\
    \ which was designed\nfor linear systems [38]. Other ones include the extended\
    \ Kalman ﬁlter and unscented\nKalman ﬁlter. Each of the preceding ﬁlters tries\
    \ to mitigate the weakness of its predecessor.\nHamouda et al. [39] applied the\
    \ extended Kalman ﬁlter to measure and predict agri-\ncultural parameters, including\
    \ soil moisture and temperature, to ﬁlter noisy measurements\nin smart heterogeneous\
    \ precision agriculture from energy sensor nodes deployed on a\nfarm. Lai et al.\
    \ [40] proposed a low-cost air quality monitoring and real-time prediction\nsystem\
    \ based on IoT and edge computing employing a prediction algorithm that is based\n\
    on a Kalman ﬁlter. This helps improve low-cost sensors’ accuracy by 27% on the\
    \ edge\nside. Abioye et al. [41] applied a Kalman ﬁlter to a subsurface ﬁbrous\
    \ capillary irrigation\nsystem. It was used to reduce the sensor noise and help\
    \ improve the accuracy of water\nlevel estimation.\nThe Bayesian inference uses\
    \ Bayes’ formula to combine sensor data [42]. Bayes’ for-\nmula helps deﬁne the\
    \ relationship between the a priori, a conditional, and a posteriori\nprobabilities\
    \ given in a hypothesis [42]. The downside of this method is that it is sensi-\n\
    tive to prior probability distribution [33]. Razaﬁmandimby et al. [43] applied\
    \ Bayesian\ninference to reduce the amount of high spatiotemporal correlated data\
    \ which are sent\nto the cloud for smart agricultural applications. Their results\
    \ show a reduction in the\namount of transmitted data and energy consumption,\
    \ while maintaining an acceptable\nlevel of data prediction accuracy. Gevaert\
    \ et al. [44] proposed a novel spectral–temporal\nresponse surfaces methodology\
    \ which uses Bayesian inference to impute missing spectral\ninformation in the\
    \ multispectral imagery and introduces observation uncertainties into the\ninterpolations.\
    \ This is applied to a ﬁeld of potatoes for experimentation.\nThe fuzzy logic\
    \ theory allows the uncertainty in multisensor fusion to be directly\nrepresented\
    \ in the inference process [45–47]. When observational evidence highly conﬂicts\n\
    with itself, however, the fusion result may be unacceptable [33]. Manjunatha et\
    \ al. [48]\nused fuzzy logic to propose an algorithm for event detection applications\
    \ in wireless sensor\nnetworks. The results show that multiple data fusion improves\
    \ the reliability and accuracy\nof the sensed data.\nSensors 2023, 23, 5993\n\
    7 of 18\nWeighted fusion algorithms have gained much traction from the data fusion\
    \ commu-\nnity [21,49–51]. These work by assigning a weight factor to each sensor\
    \ input [21]. The core\nadvantages include optimality, unbiasedness, and minimum\
    \ mean squared error [52,53].\nMoreover, compared with the Kalman ﬁlter, Bayesian\
    \ estimation, and fuzzy logic theory,\nit can generate results without the requirement\
    \ of any prior knowledge of the system or\nobservation noises [21,49]. In the\
    \ case of the proposed application, the fusion’s weight-\ning strategy would help\
    \ deliver unique ﬁtness for use requirements for each application.\nTable A2 summarises\
    \ the advantage and disadvantage of the various strategies.\n4. Framework Implementation\n\
    The end-to-end implementation of the system comprises two fundamental compo-\n\
    nents. The ﬁrst component is the data quality assessment (DQA), crucial in real-time\
    \ data\nquality evaluation. The DQA component is responsible for assessing the\
    \ data quality in\nreal-time. It operates through three stages, as shown in Figure\
    \ 4. Each has unique data qual-\nity dimensions: accuracy, completeness, consistency,\
    \ and timeliness. Previous research [16]\ndescribes this in more detail.\nData\

    \ of the implementation is the data fusion engine. This\ncomponent plays a vital\
    \ role in integrating and consolidating the results obtained from the\nthree stages\
    \ of the DQA. It takes the intermediate quality assessment outputs from each\n\
    stage and returns a single quality score. The data fusion engine operates independently\
    \ and\ncan be conﬁgured with different fusion strategies, providing ﬂexibility\
    \ and adaptability to\nmeet the speciﬁc needs of different applications. By combining\
    \ the outputs from the DQA\nstages, the data fusion engine provides a holistic\
    \ view of the data quality, enabling support\nfor different application needs.\
    \ Both components are modular and can apply assessments of\nfusion strategies\
    \ independently. The following sections highlight each component in detail.\n\
    4.1. Data Quality Assessment (DQA)\nThe DQA is responsible for assessing the quality\
    \ of the data from data streams before\nthey are shared in real-time. This is\
    \ based on previous research [16] that uses trust to\nevaluate data quality. The\
    \ previous study has built and tested an end-to-end DQ assessment\nframework that\
    \ integrates DQ assessment into the big data cycle for data-shared IoT\nSensors\
    \ 2023, 23, 5993\n8 of 18\napplications [4,16]. Trust is a well-established metric\
    \ that has been used to determine the\nvalidity of a piece or source of data in\
    \ crowdsourced or other unreliable data collection\ntechniques. In this paper,\
    \ the terms trust score and quality score are used to mean the\nsame thing.\n\
    Figure 4 shows the detailed internal implementation of the DQA and how it inte-\n\
    grates with the data fusion engine to complement its functionality. The DQA is\
    \ based\non industry-standard data pipeline tools. A detailed description and\
    \ implementation of\nthe DQ assessment framework and the use of trust to evaluate\
    \ DQ for data-shared IoT\napplications can be found here [4,16].\nAs the data\
    \ stream through the framework, they are evaluated for at each stage. In\nFigure\
    \ 4, this is represented by the Trust computation blocks. Each block has a set\
    \ of unique\nDQDs used to evaluate data quality. For example, the trust block\
    \ during data preprocessing\n(T1) will evaluate intrinsic data quality, which\
    \ in our example is timeliness. Trust evaluated\nduring processing (T2) evaluates\
    \ investigative trust, accuracy, and completeness in our\nexample. This computation\
    \ results into a single trust score (T1, T2, and T3) for each stage. T3\nis not\
    \ used in this example, as it is still an element for future research. This requires\
    \ deﬁning\na feedback loop from each application back into the data quality assessment\
    \ framework.\nHowever, it can later be integrated into the framework without any\
    \ modiﬁcations. The\nresulting score must be combined into a single score that\
    \ represents the unique ﬁtness for\nuse for each end-user application.\n4.2. Data\
    \ Fusion Engine\nThe data fusion engine takes the output of all three trust stages\
    \ and returns a single\nscore representative of all the stages. Depending on the\
    \ fusion strategy used, the resulting\nscore should be able to satisfy the data\
    \ quality requirements for each application in a\nhomogeneous data pipeline. Fusion\
    \ allows the facility to control how each stage can be\nweighted to achieve this\
    \ objective. This paper uses an Adaptive weighted fusion strategy\nand compares\
    \ it with other fusion strategies.\n4.2.1. Mathematical Formulation for Adaptive\
    \ Weighted Fusion\nAssuming there are n trust stages with a different trust score\
    \ at each stage, the resulting\nweighted data fusion model is shown in Figure\
    \ 5. Moreover, assume that the mean squared\nerrors of each trust score for each\
    \ stage are σ2\n1, σ2\n2, . . . , σ2\nn, and the calculated trust scores\nare\
    \ T1, T2, . . . , Tn. The corresponding weight factors for the trust scores are\
    \ W1, W2, . . . , Wn,\nrespectively. Since each trust score is independent of\
    \ the other, and all belong to the\nunbiased estimation of T∗, the trust score\
    \ factor and weight of T∗ after fusion satisfy the\nfollowing relationship:\n\
    T∗ =\nn\n∑\ni=1\nWiTi ,\nn\n∑\ni=1\nWi = 1\n(1)\nTherefore, the total mean square\
    \ error is\nσ2 = E\nh\n(T − ¯T)2i\n= E\n\n\n \nn\n∑\ni=1\nWiT −\nn\n∑\ni=1\n\
    WiTi\n!2\n\n= E\n\"\nn\n∑\ni=1\nW2\ni (T − Ti)2\n#\n=\nn\n∑\ni=1\nW2\ni σ2\n\
    i\n(2)\nSensors 2023, 23, 5993\n9 of 18\nFollowing Equation (2), the mean square\
    \ error σ2 is a multivariate quadratic func-\ntion. Therefore, σ2 must have a\
    \ minimum value. Using the extreme value theory of the\nmultivariate function,\
    \ the minimum weight factor is\nW∗\ni =\n1\nσ2\ni ∑n\ni=1\n1\nσ2\ni\n(3)\nCorrespondingly,\
    \ the minimum mean square error is\nσ2\nmin =\n1\n∑n\ni=1\n1\nσ2\ni\n(4)\nFor\
    \ of any number of the trust stages j(j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , n), it can be concluded\
    \ that\nσ2\nmin < σ2\nj\n(5)\n   Initial Trust, \nInvestigative Trust, \n   Result\
    \ Trust, \n \n \n \nFigure 5. Adaptive weighted data fusion model.\nTherefore,\
    \ the overall mean square error is smaller than the mean square error of any\n\
    given single stage. Moreover, the overall fused trust score will be improved compared\
    \ with\nthe trust score of a single stage. The data quality properties of each\
    \ stage are reﬂected into\nthe ﬁnal score. Their contribution, however, is weighted\
    \ depending on the ﬁtness for use\nfor each application. Table A1 summarises all\
    \ the notations used.\n4.2.2. Kalman Fusion\nIn 1D Kalman fusion, the system’s\
    \ state and measurements are scalar values. The ﬁlter\nmaintains two estimates\
    \ of the system’s state: the predicted state, based on the previous\nstate and\
    \ the system’s dynamics, and the ﬁltered state, based on the predicted state and\n\
    the most recent measurement [54]. The Kalman fusion process utilizes these two\
    \ estimates,\nthe predicted state and the ﬁltered state, to continuously update\
    \ its understanding of\nthe system’s state over time. As new measurements become\
    \ available, the ﬁlter reﬁnes\nits estimates by iteratively adjusting the weights\
    \ assigned to the predicted state and the\nmeasurement. This iterative update\
    \ mechanism allows the Kalman ﬁlter to adapt and\nprovide increasingly accurate\
    \ state estimates as more data are assimilated. Figure 6 shows\nthe process of\
    \ measurement update and prediction.\nBy iterating through these equations over\
    \ time, the Kalman fusion combines measure-\nments with predictions to estimate\
    \ the true state of a system. A detailed description and\nmathematical illustration\
    \ of Kalman fusion can be found here [54].\nSensors 2023, 23, 5993\n10 of 18\n\
    Measurement \nUpdate\nPrediction\nFigure 6. Steps of the Kalman fusion.\n5. System\
    \ Evaluation\nTwo experiments were carried out to assess the proposed system,\
    \ each serving a\ndifferent purpose. The initial experiment aimed to demonstrate\
    \ each fusion method’s\nimpact on the resulting data quality score and examine\
    \ how this can be used to support a\nspeciﬁc application.\nVarious fusion methods\
    \ employ distinct weighting schemes. For instance, when\npresented with two inputs,\
    \ a fusion method could assign a greater weight to an input\nwith a lower standard\
    \ error and a lesser weight to one with a higher standard error. As\na result,\
    \ diverse fusion methods can produce varying data quality scores. Rather than\n\
    incorporating numerous data quality assessment procedures into a single pipeline\
    \ or\nconstructing multiple pipelines, different fusion methods can be utilized\
    \ to aid different\napplications by simply integrating a new fusion method or\
    \ implementing a novel weighting\nscheme that is custom tailored to the application.\n\
    The objective of the second experiment is to evaluate and compare the computational\n\
    resource consumption of the different fusion methods. While it is crucial to deliver\
    \ person-\nalized data quality scores, it is also vital to assess the impact of\
    \ each fusion method on the\napplication in terms of computational resources.\
    \ Different applications perform analytics\nthat necessitate quality assessment\
    \ at varying layers. Particular layers, such as the edge,\nhave resource constraints.\
    \ This experiment, therefore, aims to facilitate improved service\nplacement within\
    \ IoT application architectures.\nThe experiments were conducted separately because\
    \ each dataset has speciﬁc features\nsupporting only one experiment. In the ﬁrst\
    \ case, a dataset with a gold standard was used\nto assess ﬁtness for use by varying\
    \ DQDs. In the second case, a dataset collected over a\nmore extended period was\
    \ used. Detailed descriptions of each dataset and experimental\nsetup are provided\
    \ in the following sections.\n5.1. Dataset Description\nTwo datasets where used\
    \ to evaluate the proposed system. Both are collected from\nreal-world IoT deployments.\
    \ The ﬁrst is based on data collected in an air quality deploy-\nment. This dataset\
    \ is publicly available [55]. A multisensor device was co-located with a\nconventional\
    \ air pollution analyzer. This was used to provide the true concentration values\n\
    of the target pollutants at the measurement site. These values were hence used\
    \ as a gold\nstandard. This study uses data from the CO sensor. This was collected\
    \ over a one year\nperiod. This dataset is used to evaluate the ﬁtness for use\
    \ as it contains gold-standard data.\nThis ensures that the accuracy metric can\
    \ be determined and held constant, as its only a\ndesirable DQD.\nThe second dataset\
    \ consists of weather data collected from a real-world setup of\nweather stations\
    \ installed across the United Kingdom between 2014 and 2020. The dataset\nencompasses\
    \ over 100 weather stations, each recording air temperature, rainfall, relative\n\
    humidity, and wind values, as well as an average of 30,000 data points yearly.\
    \ This\ndataset serves as a test case for evaluating the system performance of\
    \ the proposed fusion\ntechniques for big sensor data systems, covering real-time\
    \ and batch processing scenarios.\nSensors 2023, 23, 5993\n11 of 18\nIts deployment\
    \ scale and longevity make it ideal for assessing the effectiveness of the\nproposed\
    \ techniques.\n5.2. Experiment 1\nThe goal of this experiment is to show the effects\
    \ each fusion method has on the\nresulting data quality score and how this can\
    \ be used to support various applications. The\ndata undergo processing via the\
    \ system illustrated in Figure 4. A Kafka producer reads\nand preprocesses the\
    \ data, then sends them to Apache Spark for further processing and\nanalytics.\
    \ Preprocessing involves calculating quality score T1, which assesses timeliness\n\
    DQD, while data processing and analytics calculate the quality score, T2, based\
    \ on accuracy\nand completeness DQDs. These scores are sent to the fusion engine,\
    \ which generates a\nsingle, usable score, as depicted in Figure 4.\nTo investigate\
    \ varying data quality requirements, the experiment explores two scenar-\nios\
    \ by modifying essential DQDs. In the ﬁrst scenario, T1 values are varied while\
    \ T2 is held\nconstant. T1 values are varied by regulating the rate at which the\
    \ Kafka producer transmits\ndata to the consumer, thereby introducing delays in\
    \ the data pipeline. This is expected to\nimpact the data quality of the real-time\
    \ analytics application by lowering timeliness.\nThe second scenario entails changing\
    \ T2 values while keeping T1 constant, which\ninvolves introducing missing values\
    \ into the dataset to impact the completeness of DQD.\nThis manipulation can vary\
    \ quality scores for T2 depending on the rate of missing values.\nBy virtue of\
    \ the data requirements on the historical application, this manipulation should\n\
    affect the overall quality score for the application.\nAfter calculating the scores,\
    \ a distinct fusion strategy is employed for each application\nto enable varying\
    \ weighting of the scores and produce unique, usable quality scores. As\na result,\
    \ two quality score curves are generated, one for each application, using a speciﬁc\n\
    fusion strategy. The resulting curves for the two scenarios are shown in Figure\
    \ 7a and\nFigure 7b, respectively.\n2004-03\n2004-05\n2004-07\n2004-09\n2004-11\n\

    \ for the various fusion methods.\nThis is carried out for both real-time and\
    \ batch processes. This measures the CPU and\nmemory utilization. In this setup,\
    \ there were no modiﬁcation to the data or the DQDs. The\ndata are processed as\
    \ is. As the data are evaluated for quality, the experiment measures the\nCPU\
    \ and memory utilization of the fusion engine. It is important to note that the\
    \ results\nreported here are only for the fusion engine. The other parts of the\
    \ system have been\npreviously evaluated [16]. This is represented in Figures\

    \ and Analysis\nFigure 7 shows the resulting quality scores that take into account\
    \ ﬁtness for use\nrequirements for the two categories of applications. Figure\
    \ 7a shows the resulting effect of\ncontinuously reducing timeliness and its effect\
    \ on both application categories. Adaptive\nweighted fusion and Kalman fusion\
    \ were able to maintain a more stable quality experience\neven when timeliness\
    \ was reduced. Kalman fusion presents an overall mean quality score\nof 0.987\
    \ and standard deviation of 0.009. Adaptive weighted fusion presents an overall\n\
    mean quality score of 0.984 and standard deviation of 0.01. Although the difference\
    \ between\nKalman fusion and Adaptive fusion is relatively small, the characteristics\
    \ they show can\nbe used to deliver a different quality experience to different\
    \ application with varying data\nquality needs where timeliness is not a stringent\
    \ requirement. Naïve fusion, however, was\nimpacted by a reduction in timeliness,\
    \ therefore resulting in lower data quality. It had an\noverall mean quality score\
    \ of 0.886 and standard deviation of 0.05. In an application where\ntimeliness\
    \ is a stringent requirement, this can be useful to show the reduced data quality\n\
    while taking timeliness into consideration.\nFigure 7b shows results of varying\
    \ completeness. The highlighted area shows the\neffect each fusion method has\
    \ on the resulting quality scores. A reduction in T2 did not have\na signiﬁcant\
    \ impact on Kalman fusion. Unlike the above case, Adaptive weighted fusion\npresents\
    \ lower quality scores at some point compared with Naïve fusion, thus showing\n\
    the dynamic capacity of the fusion schemes over the Naïve approach. Overall, Kalman\n\
    fusion presents a mean quality score of 0.984 and standard deviation of 0.011\
    \ compared\nSensors 2023, 23, 5993\n13 of 18\nwith Adaptive weighted fusion, with\
    \ a mean of 0.97 and standard deviation of 0.02. As\nin the above case, these\
    \ differences in the resulting quality score for each fusion method\ncan be used\
    \ to deliver different quality experience to IoT applications with varying data\n\
    quality needs within a single data pipeline.\nAs illustrated above, each fusion\
    \ method had a different effect on the resulting quality\nscore. This paper has\
    \ compared only a few fusion methods and how this can help deliver\nunique ﬁtness\
    \ for use to two broad categories of applications. The system can easily be\n\
    extended to include other fusion methods that can have custom weighting strategies\
    \ to\ndeliver data quality scores to very speciﬁc applications in IoT.\n5.5. System\
    \ Performance\nSystem performance was evaluated for the fusion engine’s CPU time\
    \ and memory\nutilization. These metrics have been suggested as the most appropriate\
    \ when evaluating\na fusion strategy [28]. The evaluation was performed for both\
    \ real-time streaming and\nbatch-processing data pipelines. It is important to\
    \ note that the evaluation results reported\nhere are only for the fusion engine.\
    \ The other part of the system has been evaluated in a\nprevious study [16].\n\
    5.5.1. Real-Time Streaming\nThe fusion engine node is completely decoupled from\
    \ the rest of the system; there-\nfore, its resources can be fully customized\
    \ depending on the workload. The fusion node\nwas conﬁgured for the real-time\
    \ streaming pipeline with 5 CPUs, each at 2.40 GHz and\n32 GB of RAM. CPU utilization\
    \ is measured in percentage usage, while memory is in\nmegabytes consumed.\nFigure\
    \ 8a shows the comparison results for CPU utilization for three fusion strategies:\n\
    Adaptive weighted fusion, Kalman fusion, and Naïve fusion for a single real-time\
    \ stream\njob. As shown, Kalman and Adaptive weighted fusion have the highest\
    \ comparable\npercentage of CPU utilization, with means of 22.44% and 22.54% and\
    \ standard deviations\nof 4.39 and 4.14, respectively. Naïve fusion had the lowest\
    \ values, with a mean of 8.75%\nand a standard deviation of 5.04. All three methods\
    \ had high viability, as shown in the\ngraph, and high and comparable standard\
    \ deviation values.\nFigure 8b shows the comparison results for memory utilization\
    \ for the three fusion\nstrategies. Unlike CPU utilization, Kalman fusion had\
    \ the lowest values, with a mean of\n10.93 MB and a standard deviation of 0.04.\
    \ Kalman fusion has been suggested to be more\nresource-effective for smaller\
    \ data sizes [56]. However, overall, all three fusion strategies\nhad values within\
    \ a close range, with means and standard deviations of 11.33 MB and\n0.132 and\
    \ 11.49 MB and 0.03 for Adaptive weighted and Naïve fusion, respectively. This\
    \ is\nbecause, for real-time streaming jobs, a small amount of data are processed\
    \ at a given time.\n5.5.2. Batch Processing\nThe system was also evaluated for\
    \ batch processing workloads. The results in this\nsection compare two fusion\
    \ strategies: Adaptive weighted and Kalman fusion. They were\nevaluated for CPU\
    \ time and memory utilization as data size increased. The data size was\nmeasured\
    \ in the number of months. This was performed on a single node with 5 CPUs,\n\
    each at 2.40 GHz and 32 GB of RAM.\nFigure 9a,b compares CPU time and memory utilization\
    \ between Adaptive weighted\nfusion, Kalman fusion, and Naïve fusion, respectively,\
    \ as data size increases for batch\nprocessing. As shown, as data size (in months)\
    \ increases, so does consumption for both\nCPU and memory. Adaptive weighted fusion\
    \ and Naïve fusion had lower values compared\nwith Kalman fusion. As previously\
    \ reported, Kalman fusion is a highly computational\nfusion strategy [21].\nAs\
    \ compared with real-time streaming, batch processing had lower memory consump-\n\
    tion. This is partly due to the frequent memory reads and writes that streaming\
    \ jobs incur.\nSensors 2023, 23, 5993\n14 of 18\nBatch processing had high CPU\
    \ percentage usage compared with real-time streaming, with\naverages of up to\
    \ 95%.\nThe system was also evaluated for scalability with different compute conﬁgurations.\n\
    These are summarized in Table 2. The results indicate that the fusion engine could\
    \ not be\nscaled. Increasing compute resources yielded the same average delay\
    \ in CPU time and\nmemory utilized. It should be noted, however, that this constraint\
    \ is inherent in the fusion\nalgorithms rather than the overall system. This is\
    \ because, during the fusion stage, all the\ndata have to be processed in a single\
    \ stage. It should also be noted that the scalability of\nthe DQA was reported\
    \ in previous research [16]. The results show that it could scale both\nhorizontally\
    \ and vertically.\nTable 2. System resource conﬁguration for batch data pipelines.\n\

    64\n5.6. Discussion\nThis paper compares three fusion strategies which combine\
    \ quality scores for a given\ndata stream or data inputs. It can be argued that\
    \ each fusion technique is suitable for a\ngiven application; that is, it presents\
    \ a suitable representation of the data quality for the\ngiven application. The\
    \ application of a given fusion strategy will depend on how the\napplication views\
    \ quality. For example, some applications might require consistent data\nquality,\
    \ requiring a dynamic means to represent quality, while others might handle patches\n\
    of ﬂuctuating data quality but require overall quality above a given threshold.\
    \ This can be\nuseful to support data from sensors in difﬁcult communication situations.\n\
    Each fusion method has a different weighting strategy which affects the ﬁnal score.\n\
    In Kalman fusion, higher error rates are penalized highly [52]. This can be useful\
    \ in\napplications where a change in a single data quality dimension (for example,\
    \ timeliness)\nshould not affect the overall quality of needs of the application.\
    \ Using Kalman fusion,\ntherefore, a higher penalty would be applied to that data\
    \ quality dimension to deliver\nthe desired quality experience for that application.\
    \ For example, in real-time analytics,\nsometimes, the data can be late; however,\
    \ this should not affect the overall quality. These\ndata can be used to calculate\
    \ intermediate results, which can be updated later. Using this\nkind of fusion\
    \ strategy, such applications can be supported.\nAdaptive weighted fusion can\
    \ determine the optimal weights for each source. This\nallows the differences\
    \ between each data source’s error rate to be ﬂexibly considered [57].\nThey can\
    \ be useful in dynamic environments where the error rates between several data\n\
    sources must be considered. This would help maintain a quality score that adapts\
    \ to the\nerror rate. This can be useful to support applications (for example,\
    \ smart agriculture) that\nrely on data from network-constrained environments\
    \ by offering a more dynamic data\nquality assessment experience.\nNaïve fusion\
    \ would assign equal weights. This can be useful in cases where we do\nnot know\
    \ the application’s needs. For scalability and resource-constrained environments,\n\
    however, Adaptive weighted fusion is a better choice compared with Kalman fusion.\n\
    The goal of this work is not to imply that a given fusion method is better than\
    \ the\nother in all general cases but rather to show that a given fusion method\
    \ can deliver a better\nquality experience that satisﬁes a given application requirement.\n\
    6. Summary and Conclusions\nThis paper discussed different IoT applications’ varying\
    \ data quality needs, called\nﬁtness for use. The solution integrates different\
    \ fusion methods to cater to different applica-\ntions’ unique data quality needs.\
    \ The study investigates the impact of these fusion methods\nSensors 2023, 23,\
    \ 5993\n15 of 18\non data quality scores and their applicability in supporting\
    \ diverse applications. It also\nevaluates the computational efﬁciency of the\
    \ fusion methods to optimize service placement.\nHowever, it is essential to note\
    \ some limitations of the study. Firstly, the real-time\nand historical analytics\
    \ comparison may not capture all potential scenarios and variations\nin data quality\
    \ requirements. Different applications may exhibit distinct patterns and\ndata\
    \ characteristics, which could inﬂuence the performance of fusion methods differently.\n\
    Additionally, the study focuses on only three fusion methods—Kalman fusion, Adaptive\n\
    weighted fusion, and Naïve fusion—limiting the exploration of other potential\
    \ fusion\ntechniques that could enhance data quality.\nIn conclusion, this paper\
    \ offers an insightful approach to addressing the diverse data\nquality needs\
    \ of IoT applications through the ﬁtness for use solution and fusion methods.\n\
    However, limitations regarding the representativeness of the comparison scenarios,\
    \ the\nlimited exploration of fusion methods, and the lack of detailed resource\
    \ requirements\nand scalability considerations should be considered when interpreting\

    Data Quality\nDimensions (DQDs)\n•\nDQDs provide an\nacceptable, standardised,\
    \ ﬂexible, and\nmeasurable set of quality metrics to measure\ndata quality.\n\
    •\nThey require domain knowledge to deﬁne.\n•\nThey are a nonexhaustive list which\
    \ can be hard to\ndeﬁne for IoT applications because each use case is\nunique.\n\
    Fuzzy logic\n•\nIt is simple and capable of dealing with\nimprecise information\
    \ and possibly including\nheuristic knowledge about the phenomenon\nunder consideration\
    \ [58]\n•\nIt can produce unacceptable results if there is\nconﬂict between the\
    \ input observations [33]\n•\nIt is computationally expensive [21]\nKalman ﬁlter\n\
    •\nKalman ﬁlter provides an unbiased and optimal\nestimate of a state-vectorin\
    \ the sense of\nminimum error variance [58]\n•\nRequires the system to provide\
    \ the accurate state,\nobservation equations, and prior knowledge of the\nstatistical\
    \ characteristics of the system and\nobservation noise [30,37]\n•\nIt is computationally\
    \ expensive [21]\nBayesian inference\n•\nIt is simple and easy to setup\n•\nThis\
    \ method is sensitive to prior probability\ndistribution [33]\nReferences\n1.\n\

  limitations: The authors acknowledge that real-time and historical analytics may
    not capture all potential scenarios and variations in data quality requirements,
    and that the study focuses on only three fusion methods. Additionally, the computational
    resource requirements and scalability of the fusion engine are not discussed in
    detail.

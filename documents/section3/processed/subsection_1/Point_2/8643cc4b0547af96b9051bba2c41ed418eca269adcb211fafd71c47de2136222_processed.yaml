    • Ongoing challenges and future perspectives of IoT in agriculture are discussed.
    The increasing demand for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised
    the need for intensification and industrialisation of the agricultural sector.
    The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which
    is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture.
    Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a
    race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business
    stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT
    becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already
    very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to
    sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices.
    The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes,
    predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the
    concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation
    of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created
    and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network.
    The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies
    and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey
    of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector,
    their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards
    its propagation is presented. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction and motivation The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a term first
    coined by a British visionary, Kevin Ashton, back in 1999. As the phrase “Internet
    of Things” reveals, the IoT paradigm will provide a technological universe, in
    which many physical objects or “Things”, such as sensors, everyday tools and equipment
    enhanced by computing power and networking capabilities will be able to play a
    role, either as single units or as a distributed collaborating swarm of heterogeneous
    devices. Agriculture is one of the sectors that is expected to be highly influenced
    by the advances in the domain of IoT. The Food and Agricultural Organization of
    the United Nation (FAO) predicts that the global population will reach 8 billion
    people by 2025 and 9.6 billion people by 2050 (FAO, 2009). This practically means
    that an increase of 70% in food production must be achieved by 2050 worldwide.
    The great increase in global population and the rising demand for high-quality
    products create the need for the modernisation and intensification of agricultural
    practices. At the same time, the need for high efficiency in the use of water
    and other resources is also mandatory. One of the most promising concepts, which
    is expected to contribute a lot to the required increase of food production in
    a sustainable way, is precision agriculture (PA) (Zhang, Wang, & Wang, 2002).
    Precision agriculture aims to optimise and improve agricultural processes to ensure
    maximum productivity and requires fast, reliable, distributed measurements in
    order to give growers a more detailed overview of the ongoing situation in their
    cultivation area, and/or coordinate the automated machinery in such way that optimises
    energy consumption, water use and the use of chemicals for pest control and plant
    growth. At a higher level, having gathered information from many heterogeneous
    systems, well-evaluated scientific knowledge can be organised in the form of smart
    algorithms to provide a better insight into the ongoing processes, do the reasoning
    of the current situation and make predictions based on heterogeneous inputs, produce
    early warnings about potential dangers that threaten the cultivars, and improved
    automated control signals, based on plant responses (Kacira et al., 2005, Körner
    and Van Straten, 2008). The algorithms required to handle the distributed data
    in real time are far too complicated to run locally on a low-power Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) node. However, in the context of IoT, all the objects will be interconnected,
    and therefore the computational overhead can be easily shifted to the cloud or
    be distributed among more than one interconnected devices. The greatly increasing
    interest in IoT in agriculture can be roughly seen in Fig. 1. The increase in
    the appearance of the term “IoT” along with the term “Agriculture” in the international
    scientific literature is rather indicative. These data motivated us to present
    an overview of the state-of-the-art research on IoT in its various forms, appearing
    in the agricultural sector, rather than a generic review. For this reason, a research
    methodology was adopted derived from the existing guidelines used by medical researchers,
    adapted and optimised for software engineering matters (Kitchenham, 2004). According
    to this methodology, a selection of recent literature was done, setting the year
    2010 as starting point. The 2010 starting point year was determined because it
    is then when a significant number of publications appeared. Moreover, technologies
    and approaches before 2010 are quite obsolete at the time of writing the present
    manuscript. Other selection criteria included the multidisciplinary nature of
    a publication. Works utilising more than one technology in order to synthesise
    their solutions were considered as IoT-oriented; for instance, cloud and embedded
    devices/wireless sensors, or, works that make use of more than one type of end
    devices (things) within the same network. Having none of the aforementioned restrictions,
    the reviewed literature area would be too wide and out of the scope of this work.
    Moreover, this paper seeks to present research that adopts newer architectures,
    closer to the principles of IoT. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download

    to “IoT in Agriculture”, as they appear in Scopus. This paper begins with an introduction
    in the recent trends in the technologies, which represent the building blocks
    of IoT, such as the Radio Frequency Identification Radio Frequency Identification
    (RFID), wireless sensor networks, the addressing of the “things” in a common network,
    as well as the applications running on the cloud. Following the same categorisation,
    several works are presented, which incorporate one or more of the IoT aspects
    and focus on the agricultural sector. Some of the most popular hardware platforms,
    met in agricultural deployments, is also surveyed. The review closes with a discussion
    on future challenges and their effect on IoT spreading, which has effects on the
    adoption of IoT in the agricultural sector too. One of the goals of this work
    is to provide the members of a multidisciplinary community, such as the researchers
    working on deploying innovative monitoring, tracking, decision support and control
    systems, with a handful manuscript that summarises the latest advances in embedded
    devices, sensor modules, wireless communication technologies, programming paradigms
    and cloud services suitable, or optimised, for use in agriculture. Some of the
    most common keywords appearing in the presented literature are presented in Fig.

    Keyword distribution in the presented literature. 2. Internet of Things enabling
    technologies The structure of IoT is based on three layers; namely, the perception
    layer (sensing), the network layer (data transfer), and the application layer
    (data storage and manipulation). Despite great improvements, IoT is still evolving,
    trying to obtain its final shape, as can be seen in several reviews (Atzori et
    al., 2010, Botta et al., 2014, Gubbi et al., 2013, Miorandi et al., 2012). As
    the term “Internet” implies, networking capability is one of the core features
    of the IoT devices. The internet as we know it today is mostly an internet of
    human end-users, while the IoT will be an internet of non-human entities, therefore
    a lot of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication will take place. 2.1. Layer 1:
    the perception layer At the perception layer, we meet technologies such as WSN,
    RFID and, recently, Near Field Communications (NFC). There is some overlap between
    WSN and RFID technologies, since semi-passive and active RFID tags can also be
    regarded as wireless nodes with lower computational and storage capacity. Typically,
    a wireless sensor node consists of a processing module, usually a low-power microcontroller
    unit (MCU), one or more sensor modules (embedded or external analogue or digital
    sensing devices) and an RF communication module, usually supporting a low-power
    wireless communication technology (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image
    (202KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The architecture of a typical
    wireless sensor node. Apart from monitoring and control during the production
    process, there is a need for monitoring, identification and tracking of agricultural
    and livestock products after harvest. WSNs are often met in several works related
    to monitoring and climate control of storage and logistics facilities. RFID technology
    is considered the first, and most basic, example of interconnected “Things”. RFID
    tags contain data in the form of the Electronic Product Code (EPC) and the RFID
    Readers are triggering, reading and manipulating a large number of tags. Offering
    object identification, tracking and data storage on active or passive (without
    the need for embedded power supply) tags, RFID and NFC technologies play an important
    role in the agricultural domain. Typical user scenarios include products or livestock
    monitoring, supply chain and quality control tracking and lifecycle assessment
    of agricultural products (Welbourne et al., 2009). 2.2. Layer 2: the network layer
    At the second layer of IoT, wireless sensor nodes interacting with physical objects
    and/or their environment, communicate with their neighbouring nodes or a gateway,
    building networks through which the data are usually forwarded towards a remote
    infrastructure for storage, further analysis, processing and dissemination of
    the valuable knowledge that can be extracted (Gubbi et al., 2013). When it comes
    to wireless communications, a large scientific literature has been created on
    sensor networks, addressing several problems, such as energy efficiency, networking
    features, scalability and robustness (Atzori et al., 2010). Communication protocols
    built over wireless standards, such as 802.15.4, facilitate the device networking
    and bridge the gap between the internet-enabled gateways and the end-nodes. Such
    protocols include ZigBee, ONE-NET, Sigfox, WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and 6LowPan,
    to name a few (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE), LoRa/LoRaWAN, DASH7 and low-power WiFi have also appeared in
    several deployments recently. 2.3. Layer 3: the application layer The application
    layer is the third layer of the IoT. It is of high importance and, in many ways,
    it is this that facilitates the realisation of the IoT. The application layer
    faces several issues which have to be resolved, such as the identification of
    the devices as unique entities. Identifying and addressing billions of devices
    around the globe will provide a direct, internet-like access and control over
    them through the future internet. The uniqueness of identity, reliability, persistence
    and scalability represent important features of the addressing schema (Gubbi et
    al., 2013). IPv6, with its internet mobility aspects, could alleviate some of
    the device identification problems and is expected to play a vital role in this
    field (Botta et al., 2014). However, the heterogeneous nature of wireless nodes,
    the variability of data types, concurrent operations and confluence of data from
    the devices amplifies the problem even further (Zorzi, Gluhak, Lange, & Bassi,
    2010). Meta-data and context-aware addressing, supplementary to IPv6, are expected
    to contribute a lot while dealing with the above-mentioned challenges (Kalmar,
    Vida, & Maliosz, 2013). Heterogeneity is another big challenge in the IoT world.
    The vision of IoT is to allow billions of devices, with great diversity in their
    technical specifications (form factor, power supply, environmental capabilities,
    compatibility with other devices), computing power, peripheral devices and networking
    subsystems to co-exist in one inter-network. Middleware is a software layer, composed
    of sub-layers located between the devices and the application layer, abstracting
    the device functionalities and technical specificities and providing developers
    with sets of more generic tools to build their applications (Fig. 4). Middleware
    has gained much attention due to its major role in simplifying the development
    of new services and the integration of legacy technologies into new ones (Atzori
    et al., 2010). Furthermore, middleware is the mechanism that combines the cloud
    infrastructure with a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the sensor networks
    in a generic manner, ready to provide appropriate tools for any type of deployment
    (Ghosh & Das, 2008). SOA approach benefits the enterprise by reducing the time
    invested in adapting itself to the changes imposed by the market and allows software
    and hardware reuse, since it is technology independent, when it comes to service
    implementations (Pasley, 2005). Future agricultural IoT interconnected devices
    may include sensors, connected machinery and vehicles, weather stations, internet
    gateways, network storage, RFID scanners, smartphones, tablets, wearables and
    many other devices. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Software layers over heterogeneous devices and operating
    systems presenting how the Middleware layer serves in order to make it possible
    for a single/common application to run seamlessly on several platforms and operating
    systems. Finally, in order for the sensed data to have a real value for the end-user
    or another system (in case of M2M scenarios) they have to be stored, analysed,
    synthesised and presented in an understandable and intuitive manner. Big Data
    is one side-effect of the continuous data flow coming from billions of geo-distributed
    devices and has three dimensions, namely volume, variety and velocity (Beyer,
    2011). The Cloud with its virtually unlimited computational and storage capacity
    is the only technology capable of withstanding the IoT workload. In modern agricultural
    scenarios, stored data are automatically processed, corrected and used or combined
    under artificial intelligence algorithms, machine learning technologies, and decision-making
    systems based on models, in order to extract knowledge about phenomena, which
    cannot be directly measured. These systems can either propose the optimal tactic
    to the end-user, or produce the appropriate control signals for actuator devices,
    offering fully-automated sensing and control solutions. Plenty of studies have
    focussed on the standardisation of the IoT core technologies (Jazayeri et al.,
    2015, Sawant et al., 2014). The classical WSN/WSAN (Wireless Sensor-Actor Network)
    paradigm, i.e. distributed smart devices sensing and transferring data to a sink
    and/or driving one or more actuators, moves one step further towards interoperability
    of devices and objects. Other aspects of IoT include technologies that support
    the intercommunication among devices and/or end-users, as well as the platforms,
    the software, the hardware abstractions and the programming tools, over which
    developers and providers can build new applications and services (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Miorandi et al., 2012). The IoT paradigm is driven by the principles: “Anything
    communicates – anything is identified – anything interacts”. 3. Internet of Things
    hardware, platforms and sensors in agriculture 3.1. Low-power wireless sensor
    networks In the recent literature, a large number of embedded programmable devices
    have been used. Some are custom-built, while others are either commercial programmable
    boards or complete, closed-source sensing/monitoring solutions. Researchers choose
    their equipment depending on the research priorities set, or the main focus of
    each study. Commercial sensing solutions provide a number of features out of the
    box, allowing researchers to focus on other aspects of IoT deployments, like meta-processing,
    smart algorithms for monitoring and control, cloud interoperability, etc. (Edwards
    Murphy et al., 2015, Mamduh et al., 2012, Yu et al., 2011). Programmable, open
    solutions, on the other hand, provide developers the flexibility to have full
    control over the behaviour of the nodes and the network and program new peripheral
    devices to make them compatible with the nodes, like new sensor or actuator modules
    (Akshay et al., 2012; Wu, Li, Ma, Qiu, & He, 2012; Hou and Gao, 2010, Jayaraman
    et al., 2015a, Jimenez et al., 2012, Park and Park, 2011). The potential applications
    of IoT in agriculture cover a large number of scenarios. Barcelo-Ordinas, Chanet,
    Hou, & Garcia-Vidal (2016) categorise them in networks of scalar sensors, utilised
    in sensing and control of agricultural infrastructures, such as greenhouses, multimedia
    sensor networks for the remote image capturing and processing for the detection
    of insects and plant diseases, and tag-based networks (RFID, NFC) for product
    tracking and remote identification. Especially in the case of WSN in agriculture,
    the specific characteristics of the situation and the environment, in which the
    nodes will be deployed, should be taken into account. Crops, or other obstacles
    in farmlands whose positions may move, cause considerable interference in the
    communication between nodes. This varying movement of obstacles affects the connection
    quality of links, making it variable with space and time, affecting the deployment,
    routing, failure diagnosis, and other aspects of WSN. Harsh environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and high solar radiation, the effect of
    shading by the plant leaves, as well as the noise produced by building structures,
    such as greenhouses, extend the spatiotemporal climatic variation, greatly affecting
    the links and communication quality among the nodes (Wang, Yang, & Mao, 2017).
    The periodic nature of the recorded phenomena in agricultural installations usually
    drive the development of the applications. This characteristic sets the requirements
    and provides opportunities for novel duty-cycle control, sampling scheduling,
    data reconstructions, as well as data storage and query, intelligent control,
    and so on (Ahonen et al., 2008, Mottola and Picco, 2011; Pawlowski et al., 2008).
    Therefore, the choice of the correct IoT platform to build a deployment could
    affect the overall success of the project. A summary of some of the popular programmable
    boards and embedded platforms used in recent deployments is presented in Table

    for agricultural Internet of Things/Wireless Sensor Network deployments Although
    many theoretical aspects of WSN have been extensively studied in literature, realistic
    IoT/WSN deployments in agricultural sector are quite demanding and remain a challenging
    task. Sensor modules need to be accurate enough, with the appropriate measuring
    range for the situation at hand, and shielded against environmental factors which
    can either create false readings or even destroy the sensor permanently. Due to
    the distributed nature of IoT, in cases of battery-operated nodes, placed in open
    fields or other agricultural facilities, replacing the power source can be a very
    difficult task, if not impossible. Therefore, very strict power constraints affect
    the selection of hardware and the low-power features of the selected peripheral
    devices are always considered when designing a new system. Software-wise the components
    which are to be integrated in order to implement the functionality of an end-device
    have to be carefully inspected. The final functional code requires deep embedded
    software engineering knowledge and sufficient testing to avoid failures in the
    field (Barrenetxea et al., 2008, Langendoen et al., 2006). . Other characteristics
    making a low-power, embedded device selectable for a deployment are its long-term
    stability, the number of digital and analogue inputs/outputs which determines
    the number of peripheral devices (sensors and actuators) that can be supported,
    the ability to be sustainable through power harvesting modules, and, the effort
    required for its programming. 3.3. Wireless communication protocols in agriculture
    The dominant wireless technologies in the domain of IoT are separated into seven
    main categories, namely, Global System for Mobile Communications (Groupe Spécial
    Mobile – GSM) offered by authorised operators, Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (WPAN), Wireless Regional Area Networks (Cognitive Radio/WRAN), Mesh, Point-to-Point
    (P2P) and Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPN/LPWAN). GSM standard is further divided
    into GSM EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) and UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network
    (UTRAN). Numerous wireless devices have been developed upon the various wireless
    standards. As in many aspects of IoT, interoperability is the biggest challenge.
    Another challenge, which is common in the wireless communications, is the interference
    among devices that operate in the same band (Bluetooth, ZigBee and WiFi, for instance)
    or in neighbouring bands. An attempt to summarise the most popular IoT wireless
    standards is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary table of the most popular

    40 mW/4 W 128 bit As can clearly be seen in Table 2, IoT wireless communications
    provide a wide variety of bandwidth, communication range, power consumption and
    security measures. The variety of technologies and standards, as well as the differentiation
    among the IoT projects and their specific requirements, hamper interoperability
    at the networking layer. When it comes to agricultural deployments, high temperature,
    and high humidity are two very common phenomena. Based on the observations of
    Bannister, Giorgetti, and Gupta (2008), temperature has a significant effect on
    the received signal strength (RSS) when it rises from 25 °C to 65 °C. Similar
    results were presented by Boano, Tsiftes, Voigt, Brown, and Roedig (2010). Furthermore,
    humidity can also be very high in agricultural deployments. In the case of open
    fields, the wireless nodes are directly exposed to rain or irrigation systems.
    In greenhouses, relative humidity can be over 80% for long periods too. Humidity
    has been shown to strongly affect radio wave propagation (Room and Tate, 2007,
    Thelen, 2004). Therefore, the number of nodes, the distance between them, the
    height of the antenna, and the operating frequency based on the desired size of
    messages are serious matters to be taken into consideration, when choosing a wireless
    transceiver for an agricultural deployment. 4. Applications in agriculture The
    general overview of IoT structural elements presented in Section 2 clearly reveals
    the great potential of these technologies in the domains of Agriculture and the
    recent trend of Precision Agriculture (PA). Recent advances in sensor technology,
    along with the miniaturisation of electronics and the great drop in their cost
    have contributed a lot to the technological evolution of traditional agriculture
    to precision and micro-precision agriculture (Kacira et al., 2005). Climate sensors,
    ground sensors, radiation sensors, weather stations (made of sensors) emphasise
    that it is all about sensors and sensor data flows, which are stored and used
    for monitoring, knowledge mining, reasoning, and control. Additionally, in recent
    years, there is an increasing demand for high quality and safe agricultural products.
    This trend has yielded the need for interoperable, distributed, robust, and accurate
    logistics traceability systems. The IoT family of technologies provides all the
    appropriate tools for building and maintaining such infrastructure and services,
    specially designed to support supply chains in agricultural and floricultural
    sectors (Verdouw, Beulens, & van der Vorst, 2013). 4.1. Agricultural monitoring
    and control Sensors, in the form of wired and wireless sensors, have been widely
    used in agriculture during the last decades. Sensing the environment in which
    production occurs, and, more recently, the responses of the plants to the climate
    (Nishina, 2015), is crucial for taking the correct and more precise decisions,
    optimising productivity and quality of the cultivars. The traditional WSN have
    recently evolved to IoT-friendly-WSN, by adopting more generic standards in terms
    of communication, allowing remote access to the internet and implementing smart
    algorithms for meta-processing of the data aiming to improve monitoring and/or
    control. Versatile devices, with high computational abilities, very convenient
    form factor and low cost, can nowadays be used, on batteries, and operate for
    long periods, with or without the assistance of power harvesting modules. In addition,
    modern embedded devices have sufficient resources to support more demanding sensors,
    such as image sensors, and the support of more sophisticated networking protocols,
    such TCP/IP, extending the traditional WSN networking capabilities. A rough classification
    of literature on monitoring and control could be: - Monitoring and, in some cases,
    creation of early warnings, via simplified rules. This includes multi-point monitoring
    for catching and absorbing climatic gradients in greenhouse cultivation (Katsoulas
    et al., 2017a, Tolle et al., 2005). - Monitoring, meta-processing (algorithm/model
    implementations on the server/cloud side) and control, including control suggestions
    to the user and fully automated control (Aiello, Giovino, Vallone, Catania, &
    Argento, 2017). - Monitoring using more computationally demanding sensors, such
    as image sensors and more powerful end-nodes. Captured images are used either
    for plain monitoring of the system, or utilised for image processing on-board,
    at the edge of the network (Fog computing) or on a cloud/server-based infrastructure
    (Katsoulas et al., 2016, Ravikanth et al., 2017, Senthilkumar et al., 2016). Sensing
    is of high importance in agriculture. WSNs have been widely used in climate and
    soil monitoring deployments both in open field and in controlled environment agriculture.
    4.2. Controlled environment agriculture Greenhouses have been shown to present
    significant climate variability, which affects the productivity of the plants
    (Kittas, Bartzanas, & Jaffrin, 2003), if not harming them. Greenhouse cultivation
    is more intense, therefore, in many cases, it requires higher precision in terms
    of monitoring and control (Fig. 4). Several studies have focussed only on localised
    and remote monitoring. In most cases data are stored and represented in various
    graphical ways (Wu et al., 2012; Jimenez et al., 2012; Katsoulas, Bartzanas, &
    Kittas, 2017; Yu et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2010). In addition to the high-precision
    monitoring, there have been studies presenting systems which incorporate meta-processing
    procedures with data transferred on remote infrastructures through the internet.
    Utilising well-evaluated equations, crop and climate models, such systems produce
    assessments of the climate and/or crop status in order for the grower to take
    better decisions or get early warnings (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Fernandes et
    al., 2013, Hernandez and Park, 2011, Hu and Qian, 2011, Jiao et al., 2014, Katsoulas
    et al., 2017b, Ma et al., 2011, Suciu et al., 2015, Tuli et al., 2014, Yu and
    Zhang, 2013, Zhou et al., 2013). Agricultural-cloud IoT solutions for greenhouse
    monitoring and control are more and more common. End-nodes collect various data
    which are uploaded to a cloud infrastructure where these data are analysed deeply,
    in a faster way, at a lower cost, reliably and efficiently (Jiawen et al., 2013,
    Keerthi and Kodandaramaiah, 2015, Wang et al., 2013a). Since plant factories are
    becoming more popular in the wider frame of urban CEA in smart cities, there have
    been a number of studies focussing on artificial growth systems (Kozai and Fujiwara,
    2016, Lee and Yoe, 2015). Katsoulas, Bartzanas, et al. (2017) presented a system
    for online precise irrigation scheduling for greenhouses (OpIRIS) based on well-evaluated
    scientific knowledge organised in the form of a web application communicating
    with remote sensors installed in greenhouses. The system integrated industrial-grade
    climate sensors and machinery including fertigation valves/controllers and sensors
    for automatic drainage sampling and forwarding the data to the cloud infrastructure
    for further analysis. The system proved very accurate in predicting the crop water
    needs and provided growers with very efficient indications about when to irrigate
    and how much nutrient solution to apply. Similar attempts to automate irrigation
    have been based on an agricultural information cloud and a hardware combination
    of IOT and RFID (Tongke, 2013), the system achieving dynamic distribution of resource
    and load balancing. As a result, authors report high efficiency of resource use
    and significant improvement in water quality. There have also been studies that
    implement control of one or more of the actuator systems in greenhouses, such
    as climate, or, irrigation controllers, also known as WSANs (Moga et al., 2012,
    Sabri et al., 2011). The control can be done remotely in two ways. The first is
    manual control by the farmer. In these cases, system administrator, based on the
    suggestions made by a Decision Support System/Expert System, chooses to control
    the machinery. Applications in this monitoring and control category include Integrated
    Pest Management (IPM) (Chougule, Kumar, & Mukhopadhyay, 2016), remote monitoring,
    warning and control in open field (Chu et al., 2013, Dinh Le and Tan, 2015), and
    in controlled environment agriculture (Ferentinos et al., 2015, Pahuja et al.,
    2013, Qiu et al., 2013). There also plenty of studies attempting fully-automated
    control by communicating the control signals, produced after processing the sensed
    data, directly to the actuators succeeding a closed-loop control (Kassim et al.,
    2014, Nikolidakis et al., 2015, Rajaoarisoa et al., 2012, Yin et al., 2014, Yongheng
    and Feng, 2014). 4.3. Open-field agriculture In open-field deployments researchers
    usually measure climate conditions, but also focus a lot in soil monitoring. In
    many cases authors use more than one sensors in the ground, at different depths.
    Optimising irrigation by providing exactly as much water as the plant needs is
    the only way to preserve water, since all the extra amount or irrigation is either
    lost into the ground, or in the atmosphere through evaporation (Fig. 5) (Sivakumar,
    GunaSekaran, SelvaPrabhu, Kumaran, & Anandan, 2012). Optical sensors have been
    used for additional information on crop reflectance or remote temperature sensing,
    as well as, mapping of the situation in the field (Fisher and Kebede, 2010, Inoue
    et al., 2012, Moshou et al., 2011, O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010). Integration
    of IoT and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has been proposed in cases where
    precision of mapping of the sensed data is important (Li et al., 2012, Wang et
    al., 2013b, Ye et al., 2013). Another aspect of WSNs in agriculture are the Underground
    Wireless Sensor networks, which present significant advantages, especially in
    open field applications (De Lima et al., 2010, Dong et al., 2013, Silva and Vuran,
    2010). Download : Download high-res image (188KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. A modern example of Cloud IoT solutions for climate monitoring and
    climate optimisation based on cloud analytics services. Data fusion is realised
    on the cloud. These data come from various sources, like sensors inside and outside
    the facilities, weather stations, historical data from data bases. User can interact
    remotely with the system through a wide variety of devices (laptops, tablets,
    smartphones, etc.). As mentioned earlier, the advances in embedded device technology
    have made very powerful platforms available at very convenient prices. This has
    given the chance to researchers to implement more sophisticated end-devices, such
    as Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks, incorporating sensing nodes with much
    bigger computational capabilities, enough to support highly demanding peripheral
    devices, such as image sensors. This kind of node allows heavier local processing
    at the edge of the network, in fog-network-like manner. These works either use
    cameras for simple security or facility monitoring purposes (Cai et al., 2011,
    Zhang et al., 2011), or implement various image processing algorithms in order
    to track invading animals (Baranwal & Pushpendra, 2016), insects or other plant
    threats (Dang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2014) and crop growth (Rodriguez de la
    Concepcion, Stefanelli, & Trinchero, 2014). 4.4. Livestock applications Several
    deployments have been realised in the fields of livestock. Optimal environment
    which absorbs extreme climate conditions known to have negative effects on animals
    productivity is a serious matter for many authors (Corkery et al., 2013, Ilapakurti
    and Vuppalapati, 2015, Wang and Lee, 2012, Zhang et al., 2016). Livestock IoT
    includes not only animal and animal climate monitoring and control, but, in some
    cases includes field monitoring for optimal feeding practices (Fig. 6) (Bhargava,
    Ivanov, & Donnelly, 2015). Another aspect of livestock IoT includes the instrumentation
    and analysis of beehives (Edwards Murphy et al., 2015). Wireless sensors have
    been used in animal tracking and behavioural analysis (Asikainen et al., 2013,
    Huircán et al., 2010, Jeong and Yoe, 2012, Kwong et al., 2012, Nadimi et al.,
    2012) as well as odour and hazardous gas monitoring (Mamduh et al., 2012). There
    are also studies that focus on optimising the performance of the equipment used
    in livestock deployment, based on the imposed challenges of the situation at hand
    (Jeong & Yoe, 2012). Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download

    overview. 4.5. Food supply chain tracking Modern agriculture tends to be more
    and more industrialised. Therefore, standardisation mechanisms at each step for
    the product, from the grower to the consumer, have to be adopted in order to assure
    food safety and quality (Fig. 8). This need has led to a growing interest in food
    supply chain traceability systems. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies include
    plenty of solutions to contribute greatly to the construction, support and maintenance
    of such systems. In the reviewed literature, solutions focus either on the business
    side of Food Supply Chain (FSC) or technology. There are some works, though, which
    attempt to propose solutions for both sides. Recent developments in e-commerce
    have given a boost to various Supply Chain research activity. In this review,
    however, a focus only on FSC was attempted, since they are optimised for food
    supplies. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 8. Schematic representation of the food supply chain from the production
    phase until the final consumer. RFID is the most common IoT technology found in
    Food Supply Chain (FSC). RFID tags, acting as enhanced barcodes, enable the tracking
    of agricultural products. Recent research, following the IoT paradigm, has combined
    more than one sensor to enrich the information of product status whenever this
    is recorded through its RFID (Maksimovic et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013). A common
    issue in IoT is its distributed nature and the asynchronous and heterogeneous
    flow of information. Therefore, naming is vital for the accurate and fast retrieval
    of information when it comes to FSC tracking services (Liu et al., 2015). The
    realisation of IoT-based infrastructure leads to the virtualisation of the supply
    chains, since physical proximity is no longer required (Verdouw et al., 2013).
    Various models analysing the FSC issues and the way IoT technologies tackle them
    appear in literature (Lianguang, 2014, Zhang, 2014). Technological evolution,
    combined with the increasing robustness and maturity of several technologies met
    in IoT, have given researchers the chance to develop complete systems, which incorporate
    sensing modules and software infrastructures. The software part of these systems
    is either hosted on cloud providers or shared among distributed shareholders.
    Complete systems offer automated services, intelligent schemes and automatic reasoning
    based on the measured phenomena and artificial intelligence (Chen, 2015, Jiang
    and Zhang, 2013, Xu et al., 2011). Other works present approaches on how to organise
    a complete FSC information management system (Li, Chen, & Zhu, 2013) or how to
    design the system in such a way that it maximises the economic profit (Pang, Chen,
    Han, & Zheng, 2015). 4.6. Internet of Things middleware and interoperability Interoperability
    at all levels is a key concept in the developing IoT world. Middleware is an approach
    that aims to facilitate interoperability (Fig. 9). The concept of interoperability
    in IoT can be expressed in many ways. Modern agriculture has evolved into a highly-intensive
    industry, expanding from the level of single grower up to international organisations.
    Therefore, agricultural-oriented IoT research offers literature in all aspects
    of interoperability, namely technical, syntactical, semantic and organisational
    interoperability . Download : Download high-res image (99KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. The dimensions of interoperability (Serrano et al., 2015).
    Technical interoperability is associated with hardware and software components,
    aiming to provide seamless exchange of information between systems (M2M). Syntactical
    interoperability has to do with data formats, i.e. the syntax that messages should
    have, in order to be exchanged between the systems, in the form of bit-tables
    or high level languages (HTML, XML, etc.). Semantic interoperability has a special
    value for end users, since it has to do with the human interpretation and understanding
    of the content produced by IoT systems. Finally, organisational interoperability
    is of high importance when it comes to IoT scalability. The ability to communicate
    effectively and transfer meaningful data, over highly varying systems and/or geographic
    regions is the key to success of distributed, global-IoT infrastructures (Serrano
    et al., 2015). Hu, Wang, She, and Wang (2011a) present a middleware to promote
    data (Technical) interoperability among various grain storage systems. Technical
    interoperability is the absolute basic type of interoperability a system must
    satisfy. At a higher level of intercommunication among systems, syntactical interoperability
    has to be implemented, in more generic, understandable and human-friendly messages.
    The incorporation of new, high-end, technologies, such as IoT, within a traditional
    productive sector, such as agriculture, and the trend of precision agriculture
    has given Semantic interoperability middleware an extra value. This is because
    Semantic interoperability middleware makes technology more intuitive and easier
    to understand, for both growers and agronomists (Jayaraman et al., 2015b, Sawant
    et al., 2014). Knowledge retrieval is a second feature of Semantic middleware.
    Data flows are organised and synthesised, allowing for better reasoning and management
    in agricultural (Perera et al., 2013, Yuan et al., 2013) and livestock (Saraswathi
    Sivamani, Park, Shin, Cho, & Cho, 2015) deployments. Moving one step further towards
    the realisation of large-scale national, or international cooperative deployments,
    organisational interoperability has been studied (Hu et al., 2011b, Sivamani et
    al., 2013). Providing the base for seamless cooperation between organisations
    presents numerous advantages, ranging from the technical level, for instance,
    quality improvement in sensing, reasoning and control systems by automatic exchange
    of knowledge between self-learning and self-improving systems, up to economic
    and business level by adapting the production rate according to market trends.
    4.7. Multi-layer deployments and commercial solutions IoT allows for the interoperability
    of the systems and organisations. Therefore, it makes it easier to interconnect
    systems involved in the various phases of a product''s lifecycle and several studies
    have presented systems which integrate numerous platforms that monitor, control
    and track agricultural products. Fu (2012) presents in short an intelligent agricultural
    system which could potentially be used in optimal melon and fruit production and
    management, as well as internet trading and supply chain tracking of organic goods.
    IoT concepts and technologies have been widely applied in many aspects of the
    transportation and storage of goods from the producer to the wholesale reseller
    to the consumer, from post-harvest treatment optimisation, storage facilities
    monitoring and management, and controlled environment shipping containers (Dittmer
    et al., 2012, Moon et al., 2015) to swarms of delivery drones (Yu, Subramanian,
    Ning, & Edwards, 2015), autonomous trucks and ships. IoT applications are there
    to drive future changes (Hribernik, Warden, Thoben, & Otthein, 2010). Several
    vendors have moved towards providing solutions either in the form of service or
    solutions that also include the hardware to do the monitoring. In all these cases
    cloud-based applications do the analysis of the data providing suggestions, warnings
    or control signals. These solutions do not only focus on large-scale production,
    but also on individual gardening and home production. Bitponics is cloud-based
    solution offering automated advisory services for garden care (Bitponics, 2016).
    Plantlink offers a solution for connecting garden to home users integrating sensors
    and irrigation controller in one network (Plantlink, 2016). Growtronix is a modular
    system that can monitor almost every aspect of indoor gardens and plant factories
    (Growtronix, 2016). Some promising smart greenhouse monitoring and control solutions
    are offered by Sensaphone, Monnit and GetSenso (GetSenso, 2016, Monnit, 2016,
    Sensaphone, 2016). These solutions aim to optimise climate in greenhouses minimising
    the risk of yield losses through a more optimal climate for the crops. In addition,
    Fieldclimate appears to be a rich platform providing both hardware (weather stations,
    sensor nodes) and cloud-based software solutions (weather forecast, irrigation
    management, disease models etc.) (FieldClimate, 2016). CropX is a complete system
    including field ground sensors measuring soil moisture and temperature, uploading
    the data to the cloud and offer a mapping and optimal irrigation planning as a
    service to the grower through a mobile application (CropX, 2016). Microsoft has
    recently launched its end-to-end IoT platform for agriculture. FarmBeats consists
    of UAV drones and sensors, connectivity support, and cloud infrastructure which
    includes machine learning-based backend analytics with predictive features, and
    cloud storage (Microsoft, 2015). 5. Discussion 5.1. Internet of Things hardware
    & software challenges in agriculture When it comes to IoT in agriculture, several
    challenges arise. Firstly, the equipment residing at the perception layer has
    to be exposed directly to harsh environmental phenomena, like high solar radiation,
    extreme temperatures, rain or high humidity, strong winds, vibrations and other
    dangers capable of destroying the electronic circuits. The end-devices will have
    to stay active and function reliably for long periods relying on the limited power
    resources of batteries. Therefore, appropriate programming tools and low-power
    capabilities are mandatory, since the frequent battery replacement or reset of
    the stations (in case of a program failure), for example in a large-scale open
    field deployment, is not easy. Power harvesting can be a solution to some extent,
    however, the power consumption has still to be within the power budget of small
    power harvesting modules (e.g. solar panels, wind turbines etc.). Furthermore,
    the large number of interconnected (in an internet-like manner) devices produces
    an incredibly large amount of data, which will soon be beyond the resource capacities
    of small-scale server infrastructures to handle (Atzori et al., 2010, Ziegeldorf
    et al., 2014). 5.2. Organisational challenges & interoperability When it comes
    to logistics for the food and agricultural sector, this infrastructure aims to
    facilitate the exchange of information and the transportation of goods, optimising
    the production process and the supply chain networks globally. IoT is gradually
    transforming business processes by providing more accurate and real-time visibility
    to the flow of materials and products (Lee & Lee, 2015). Cloud Computing provides
    high quality services, hardware-agnostic application development tools and sufficient
    storage and computational resources to store and process the data produced at
    the edge of the network. Therefore, it seems like an ideal complement for the
    IoT technologies towards the composition of “CloudIoT” paradigm (Botta et al.,
    2014). The huge amount of data produced at the edge of the network, however, can
    incur a severely high cost to be transferred to the cloud, both in terms of money
    and latency. Therefore, the optimal balancing between the edge storage and processing
    and the part of the workload that is to be done on the cloud is a serious matter.
    Fog Computing is an extension of the Cloud Computing paradigm, expanding cloud
    technologies and tools, as well as, the horizons of application development (Bonomi,
    Milito, Natarajan, & Zhu, 2014). 5.3. Networking challenges The characteristics
    of the environment do not only impose challenges to the hardware, but also to
    the network layer. Wireless communication is the most common in agricultural deployments,
    due to the lack of wiring costs. Environment is known to be one of the major factors
    which lead to low wireless link quality, through the multi-path propagation effects
    and its contribution to background noise (Wang et al., 2017). Real-world deployments
    have shown that the performance of popular transceivers is affected by temperature
    (Bannister et al., 2008, Boano et al., 2010), humidity (Thelen, 2004), human presence
    and other obstacles within the space in which a wireless node attempts to communicate.
    Therefore, data have to be transferred using robust and reliable technologies,
    according to the requirements and challenges of the rural environment. 5.4. Security
    challenges The transfer to an interconnected internet of “smart things” must ensure
    the security, authenticity, confidentiality and privacy of the stakeholders involved
    in this network. In other words, IoT must be secure against external attacks,
    in the perception layer, secure the aggregation of data in the network layer and
    offer specific guarantees that only authorised entities can access and modify
    data in the application layer. Security in IoT is summarised in three requirements:
    authentication, confidentiality and access control (Sicari, Rizzardi, Grieco,
    & Coen-Porisini, 2015). In the perception layer the most common security issues
    include information acquisition security and physical security of the hardware.
    The latter one is quite important in the case of agriculture, since the devices
    can be deployed in open fields and function without surveillance for long periods.
    Due to the distributed nature of IoT and the fact that its devices may be deployed
    in diverse environments, a single security protocol is, usually, not enough (Li,
    2012). RFID security issues are usually related to leakage of information, which
    can unveil the location and other sensitive data. Security countermeasures include
    data encryption, use of blocker tags, tag frequency modification, jamming and,
    finally, tag destruction policy, in other words the physical ending of a tag''s
    life (Matharu, Upadhyay, & Chaudhary, 2014). Sensor nodes differ from RFID tags,
    in the way that sensors are active and relate to dynamic properties of things.
    Therefore, encryption algorithms, key distribution policies, intrusion detection
    mechanisms and security routing policies have to be deployed, always keeping in
    mind the hardware restrictions of smart devices. In the current IoT concept, data
    flow from the end devices to a gateway, which is in charge of uploading these
    data to other infrastructures, such as the cloud. Various security policies for
    sensor terminals exist, including cryptographic algorithms, identity authentication
    mechanisms, data flow control policies, data filtering mechanisms etc. (Li, 2012).
    Moreover, the perception layer requires information acquisition security measures
    too. Wiretapping, tampering, cheating, and replay attacks are just a few of the
    security threats. Therefore, authenticity, confidentiality and data integrity
    have to be ensured during the phase of data acquisition, and key management protocols
    and secure routing policies should be adopted and sensor node authentication policies
    must be leveraged to prevent data access by unauthorised entities (Gou, Yan, Liu,
    & Li, 2013). 5.5. Stack challenges Middleware is another part of IoT presenting
    specific requirements for increased security, since it stands between the network
    and application layers and is responsible both for data processing and communication
    interface between these two layers. Security in the middleware layer requires
    confidentiality and secure data storage. Wireless medium is challenging, when
    it comes to security in transmissions, even for more sophisticated hardware than
    the platforms met in IoT deployments. Therefore, the IoT architecture can easily
    be exposed to risks, such as denial of service attacks, unauthorised access, man-in-the-middle
    attacks, and virus injections which target and affect confidentiality and data
    integrity. Authentication, intrusion detection, key management and negotiation
    mechanisms could possibly provide solutions against the network layer threats.
    Application layer is the top layer in the IoT vision. It is the place where enormous
    flows of data streams end, requiring increased storage and computational resources.
    This is why the application layer is so closely-related with the cloud. The security
    issues here are not very different from the security issues of the cloud itself,
    including data security, privacy, backup and recovery. Control mechanisms need
    to administer the privileges and ownership of data and manage the access rights
    to all, or part of the information, both for physical users and between machines,
    or even organisations. 5.6. Potential value of IoT in agriculture Internet of
    Things is rapidly evolving and many novel applications and services are emerging
    from it. A great amount of research is being conducting towards the integration
    of various heterogeneous systems, the security assurance at various levels of
    IoT and the analytics, which will give a better insight into the “Big Data” in
    order to optimise various business processes. National policy of governments around
    the world for increased production rate of fresh-cut vegetables and meat, at lower
    price, with higher quality standards, as well as, the consumers'' demand for transparency
    in the production cycle and the environmental footprint of the products they buy,
    provide IoT a huge field for development and diffusion. According to Bradley,
    Barbier, and Handler (2013), the estimates from 2013 to 2022 of potential IoT
    value vary significantly, ranging from a minimum of $1 trillion up to more than
    $15 trillion, not including the increased revenues, the benefits of cost reduction
    among companies and industries and the general economic activity due to IoT. Much
    of the added-value of IoT comes from the flexibility and the optimisation and
    precision that it introduces into the production processes of industry and production
    units of all types. Therefore, it is not so risky to forecast that agricultural
    sector processes at all levels will drastically change in the very near future.
    Obviously the economic numbers related to IoT are very big, tempting some very
    serious players to invest in it. Examples, like the recent purchase of Nest Labs,
    a company specialising in IoT for home automation, by Google for $3.2 billion
    in cash and the purchase of Jasper Technologies, developer of and IoT cloud platform,
    by Cisco for $1.4 billion, reveal the great potential of IoT and prove that it
    is highly attractive to big investors and behemoth technological firms. The partnership
    formation, however, is not so trivial. This is due to the fact that the companies
    involved in IoT invest in one or a few aspects of it, because of its wide nature.
    Therefore, sooner or later, they will have to cooperate with each other, putting
    aside any competition, or the notion of who is more important, in order to introduce
    some universal standards in the evolving IoT hype. 6. Conclusion When it comes
    to agriculture, IoT is expected to optimise the production by many means. Farmlands
    and greenhouses are about to move from precision to a micro-precision model of
    agricultural production. Distributed, pervasive computing and precise monitoring
    of the facilities will provide the optimal growing or living conditions for both
    vegetables and animals. Autonomous systems will be able not only to command the
    actuators in the most efficient way, optimising the utility and resource usage,
    but also to control the production in accordance to the market situation, maximising
    the profit and minimising the costs in every possible way. On the other hand,
    food supply chains, equipped with WSN and RFID equipment, will be able to monitor
    each stage in the life of a product, make automatic reasoning, in case of a faulty
    product and increase consumer''s feeling of safety, through a transparent product
    lifecycle information system. All the above is the optimistic approach of the
    IoT integration in agriculture. However, in this concept, plenty of individual
    players are about to participate. First of all, local networks have to be secured
    against interference from other networks, especially as these technologies reach
    their full potential. In a real IoT scenario, most of the players will use different
    equipment, with different technical specifications and/or sensor characteristics.
    Obviously, the interoperability, the filtering and the semantic annotation of
    the data, coming from each producer, has to be made to some extent. This is the
    only way in which the data, coming from vastly heterogeneous sources, can be used
    to optimise a shared decision support or expert system. Security, anonymity and
    control over the access rights on the information is vital for such a system to
    be adopted. In a wider perspective, many of the data related to business/institution
    strategic planning cannot be disclosed or retrieved by non-authorised entities,
    so that the market is safe against unorthodox tactics. References Ahonen et al.,

  analysis: '**Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)**
    are continuously sampled by stationary and moving sensors on vehicles and implements.
    **The collection and use** of this large amount of **heterogeneous spatial data**
    is a challenge for current IoT architectures. IoT systems have to handle **both
    spatial and temporal data**, increasing the complexity of the data processing.
    **Highly varying and uncertain environmental conditions**, as annual crops are
    more susceptible to weather changes than permanent crops, add to the problem.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle **both spatial and temporal data**, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing. **Larger amounts of heterogeneous spatial
    data** generated at **different rates** and from very disparate sources also need
    to be intelligently integrated;


    **Data can follow different paths** and does not necessarily go through all the
    steps listed. In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through
    three main processes: machine generated, process-mediated, and human-sourced.
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyze and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process.


    IoT has recently been **gaining momentum in the farming industry** as it can fulfil
    the urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Fig. 3): device, network and application layers (Fig.
    3).


    **Six main stages regarding data flow** have been identified in the literature
    reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer, storage, processing,
    analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order of the stages is different
    depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing techniques used, e.g. fog
    and edge computing processes the data before communicating it to the cloud, while
    cloud computing processes the data in the cloud.


    The great variety of technologies, standards and frequency bands used exposes
    the relevant interoperability and application challenges found when applying IoT
    technologies. Potential communication standards for smart farming can be classified
    into short-range and long-range according to their communication distance, which
    determines their specific usability in different requirement settings.


    Regarding other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can
    be integrated into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency
    transceiver (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used
    to a great extent in agricultural research and industry (e.g. Kamilaris et al.,
    2016), especially for animal production (e.g. Rodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017);
    however, in arable farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used
    for irrigation scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for
    agrochemical traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle
    monitoring (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for
    soil temperature monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Finally, the latest generation
    of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates, large coverage areas,
    higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which can open new possibilities
    and may solve some of the challenges encountered by many IoT solutions (Alahmadi
    et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016).


    IoT middleware platforms are gaining interest due to its potential for solving
    different challenges found in the application of IoT, especially interoperability.
    IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex communication through the
    cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications and networks, by using enablers
    like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez et al.,
    2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD,
    UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud, Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with
    focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN and SIRENA, with more focus
    on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet and FIWARE, with a
    wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A, OpenIoT, or ArrowHead
    (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et al., 2016, Kamilaris
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Even
    if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market, an intelligent middleware
    solution that addresses most issues observed in smart farming successfully is
    yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016).


    Most IoT-based systems include at least two of these applications and isolated
    applications are seldom seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to
    FMIS and associated decision support to improve operations and production processes
    involving vehicle positioning analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are
    key elements in arable farming (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and
    have consequently got a section of their own.'

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size

    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    on Sensors and IoT Systems for Irrigation in Precision Agriculture**

    Lorenz



    **Abstract:** Water management is paramount in countries with water scarcity.
    This also aﬀects agriculture, as a large amount of water is dedicated to that
    use. The possible consequences of global warming have led to the consideration
    of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for
    food production and people and to maintain ecosystems. Thus, studies aimed at
    saving water usage in irrigation processes have increased over the years. Typical
    commercial sensors for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very
    expensive, making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of
    system on their farms. However, manufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors
    that can be connected to nodes to implement aﬀordable systems for irrigation management
    and agriculture monitoring. Due to the recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies
    that can be applied in the development of these systems, we present a survey aimed
    at summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart irrigation systems.
    We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding
    water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions, and fertilizer
    usage. We provide an overview of the most utilized nodes and wireless technologies
    employed to implement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation systems. Lastly, we discuss
    the challenges and the best practices for the implementation of sensor-based irrigation
    systems.

    \ sensors\n1. Introduction\nThe lack of fresh water is a rising concern, particularly\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries or southern\nAsian countries such as India. Among\
    \ the countries in Europe, the Mediterranean countries are the\nmost vulnerable\
    \ to drought [1]. A connection has been established between climate policies and\
    \ water\nmanagement. Water management can be aﬀected by diﬀerent variables such\
    \ as the water demand\nfrom the diﬀerent sectors or the consequences of some degrees\
    \ of warming on hydrological resources.\nClimate change and its eﬀects are a recurrent\
    \ topic in research papers regarding water resources and\nagriculture. The possible\
    \ consequences of global warming have led to the consideration of creating\nwater\
    \ adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production\
    \ and people and\nto maintain ecosystems [2]. Furthermore, the safety of the water\
    \ to be consumed by humans and\nto be returned to the environment must be ensured.\
    \ The possible risks of climate change are an\nincrease in water shortage, the\
    \ reduction of water quality, the increase in water and soil salinity,\nthe biodiversity\
    \ loss, the increase in irrigation requirements or the possible cost of emergency\
    \ and\nremediation actions. These reasons have led to an increase in the number\
    \ of studies focused on\nreducing water usage in irrigation processes. Some of\
    \ these studies suggest the implementation of\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042; doi:10.3390/s20041042\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n2 of 48\nsocial, economic\
    \ and climate change policies, as well as the implementation of technological\
    \ innovations\nto improve water management.\nThe agricultural sector is one of\
    \ the most important economic resources in these countries\nadding to the importance\
    \ of managing well the available water resources to ensure the continuing\nof\
    \ this economical sector. In India, 10% of the area of the country is covered\
    \ by rice plantations [3].\nFurthermore, 20% of the Indian population is below\
    \ poverty levels and 15% is food insecure. Therefore,\nlow food production aﬀects\
    \ both the population and the economy. In 2002, the monsoon season\nproduced the\
    \ least amount of precipitation in the last 130 years. That resulted in a loss\
    \ of rice production\ndue to the lack of fresh water. To determine the drought\
    \ caused by anomalies in surface water, the\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index (SPEI) was utilized. These indexes and the\ninformation gathered from\
    \ sensors that monitor the environment, the soil and the water can be utilized\n\
    to determine the current state of the water and the possibility of covering all\
    \ the freshwater needs.\nCountries with higher funds are already implementing\
    \ systems for water management and water\nreuse aiming to optimize water usage\
    \ and reduce the environmental impact caused by utilizing great\namounts of water.\
    \ However, some countries may ﬁnd these solutions to be costly.\nCommercial sensors\
    \ for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very expensive,\nmaking\
    \ it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system on their\
    \ farms. However,\nmanufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can\
    \ be connected to nodes to implement\nlow-cost systems for irrigation management\
    \ and agriculture monitoring. Furthermore, due to the\ninterest in low-cost sensors\
    \ for monitoring agriculture and water, new low-cost sensors are being\nproposed\
    \ in researches such as a leaf water stress monitoring sensor [4], a multi-level\
    \ soil moisture\nsensor comprised of copper rings placed along a PVC pipe [5],\
    \ a water salinity monitoring sensor\nmade with copper coils [6] or a water turbidity\
    \ sensor made with colored and infrared led emitters\nand receptors [7].\nDue\
    \ to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation systems\
    \ for agriculture\nand the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that can be applied\
    \ in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing\
    \ the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems. In this survey,\
    \ we are going to provide an overview of the state of the research\nregarding\
    \ irrigation systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation\n\
    systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions,\
    \ and fertilizer\nusage. We will provide an overview of the most utilized nodes\
    \ and wireless technologies employed to\nimplement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation\
    \ systems. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the\nbest practices for\
    \ the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.\nOther authors have performed\
    \ studies with a focus on irrigation systems, water management\nor precision agriculture\
    \ systems. However, the other available surveys on smart irrigation systems\n\
    analyzed quite a few papers [8–12] and therefore do not provide an in-depth analysis\
    \ of the state\nof the art regarding irrigation systems. Others are focused on\
    \ speciﬁc aspects regarding irrigation\nsuch as software for irrigation systems\
    \ [13], pivot-center speciﬁc irrigation systems [14] or irrigation\nsystems for\
    \ greenhouses [15]. Lastly, there are surveys that focus on precision agriculture\
    \ [16–21], crop\nmonitoring [22] and the agro-industrial and environmental ﬁelds\
    \ of agriculture [23] that comment on\nirrigation agriculture. In this survey,\
    \ we provide an overview of the current advances in irrigation\nsystems and the\
    \ utilized sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we provide discuss the most utilized\n\
    nodes and the wireless technologies employed for the communication and transmission\
    \ of the data\ngathered by the sensors. This way, with this work we address the\
    \ current gap in literature with a\nsurvey that provides an overview of IoT-based\
    \ smart irrigation systems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents the methodology employed to\nperform the survey. Section 3 presents\
    \ the water management techniques utilized in current studies, the\nparameters\
    \ that are utilized to determine the irrigation schedule and the related actuators.\
    \ The sensors\nand parameters considered for the soil monitoring aspects of the\
    \ evaluated smart irrigation systems\nare depicted in Section 4. The most monitored\
    \ weather parameters and the sensors that monitor\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n3 of\

    \ nodes for IoT and WSN\nirrigation systems and the most popular wireless communication\
    \ technologies and cloud platforms.\nThe discussion of the current trends regarding\
    \ IoT crop irrigation systems is presented in Section 7.\nLastly, the conclusion\
    \ and future work are presented in Section 8.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this\
    \ section, the process followed to elaborate this paper is presented. To perform\
    \ this study,\nthe following research questions were considered: What are the\
    \ current IoT solutions for smart\nirrigation for agriculture? What sensors, actuators,\
    \ nodes, and wireless technologies are being utilized\nto develop IoT irrigation\
    \ systems? Search engines and digital libraries were utilized by the authors to\n\
    search manually for papers suitable for this survey. A total of 283 papers were\
    \ obtained from Google\nScholar [24], IEEE explore [25], Scopus [26] and the digital\
    \ library of Sensors [27]. The keywords\nemployed to obtain the total number of\
    \ papers to be analyzed were IoT irrigation, IoT irrigation system,\nand smart\
    \ irrigation. Furthermore, all papers were checked to ensure they included the\
    \ keywords\nirrigation or water and IoT or smart in their content.\nIn order to\
    \ discern which papers to use, only papers written in English were considered.\n\
    Furthermore, to observe the recent evolution in this ﬁeld, the selected papers\
    \ were published from\nthe years 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Finally,\
    \ a total of 178 papers were utilized to compile\nthis review.\nAfter the selection\
    \ process, all papers were classiﬁed manually into IoT irrigation systems and\n\
    architecture, protocol and sensor proposals that were not used to create the ﬁgures\
    \ in this paper but\ndiscussed relevant information. The papers from the ﬁrst\
    \ group (160) were then analyzed to determine\nthe sensors and actuators that\
    \ were employed to develop the IoT irrigation system, the parameters\nthat were\
    \ monitored, the type of irrigation and agriculture, the type of node, the type\
    \ of wireless\ntechnology and data visualization technique that was utilized to\
    \ access the data and to manually\nchoose the actions of the irrigation system.\
    \ All the collected data has been then classiﬁed into diﬀerent\nsections and converted\
    \ into graphs and tables to provide a complete overview of the actual state of\
    \ the\nart regarding IoT irrigation systems.\nThe distribution of the papers regarding\
    \ the country of the ﬁrst author is presented in Figure 1.\nAs it can be seen,\
    \ the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries where\
    \ agriculture\nis a major economic source. India is the country with the highest\
    \ number of papers with a total of\n92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China and Spain\
    \ are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, Ecuador,\nIndonesia Thailand, and\
    \ the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the countries that\n\
    have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\nIt is remarkable\
    \ that only one out of the ﬁve countries with the highest agricultural land area\n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top ﬁve countries\
    \ of our survey\nin terms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers\nthat presents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area.\nWith regard to the top\
    \ six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three of\n\
    them (India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water scarcity\
    \ problems. Again,\nthere are some countries with regions aﬀected by water scarcity\
    \ that use irrigation systems in their\nagriculture and have published fewer papers\
    \ on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does\nnot mean that in these\
    \ countries no eﬀorts are done in order to reduce water use in agriculture. It\
    \ is\npossible that in these countries the major eﬀorts are done by enterprises\
    \ and their ﬁndings are directly\npatented and distributed in the marked. Most\
    \ of the papers are published by authors who come from\ndeveloping countries.\n\
    As per the number of papers per year of publication, see Figure 2, the interest\
    \ in this topic has\nbeen increasing over the years. The lower amount of papers\
    \ for 2019 is due to the year not being\nﬁnished when the selection process of\
    \ the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers performed\nin 2019 had been\

    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present different\
    \ \ntechniques for water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers \nthat include any sort of water pumping actuator as\
    \ an irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated \npapers, 107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the \n\
    ones that just offer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in\
    \ this section.  \nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known\
    \ as irrigated agriculture, there are \ndifferent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The different options present different efficiency and, in \nsome cases, a specific\
    \ manner should be used for a specific crop. The specific manners to irrigate\
    \ have \na great variety but we can divide them into the following categories:\
    \ Attending to the way of water \nis distributed we can consider: (i) flood irrigation,\
    \ (ii) spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation, and (iv) \nnebulizer irrigation.\
    \ Regarding the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation without\
    \ \nany consideration, when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated,\
    \ (ii) scheduled irrigation, \nwhen the water is supplied according to the estimated\
    \ needs in a period of year, (iii) Ad hoc irrigation, \nwhen the amount of water\
    \ is calculated based on the sensors measurements. The vast majority of the \n\
    papers included in this section propose to use pumps and valves to distribute\
    \ the water in \nconjunction with sensors to measure environmental parameters\
    \ in order to calculate the water needs. \nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this\
    \ section, 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation \nsystem, the\
    \ other six only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure\
    \ 3. Those 83 \ninclude different levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only\
    \ indicate that there are motor/pumps in \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\

    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present diﬀerent\
    \ techniques\nfor water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers that include\nany sort of water pumping actuator as an\

    \ irrigated agriculture, there\nare diﬀerent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The diﬀerent options present diﬀerent eﬃciency and,\nin some cases, a speciﬁc\
    \ manner should be used for a speciﬁc crop. The speciﬁc manners to irrigate\n\
    have a great variety but we can divide them into the following categories: Attending\
    \ to the way\nof water is distributed we can consider: (i) ﬂood irrigation, (ii)\
    \ spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation,\nand (iv) nebulizer irrigation. Regarding\
    \ the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation\nwithout any consideration,\
    \ when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated, (ii) scheduled\nirrigation,\
    \ when the water is supplied according to the estimated needs in a period of year,\
    \ (iii) Ad\nhoc irrigation, when the amount of water is calculated based on the\
    \ sensors measurements. The vast\nmajority of the papers included in this section\
    \ propose to use pumps and valves to distribute the water\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\

    \ most used sensor in the systems is the soil moisture sensor, it is used in 76\n\
    papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze the data from soil\
    \ and plant sensors. The soil\ntemperature is much less considered in these systems,\
    \ it is only measured in seven proposals. Attending\nto the soil characteristics,\
    \ in one proposal the authors use a sensor that monitored the nutrients of the\n\
    soil [80]. There are 14 proposals of IoT for irrigation management that include\
    \ a pH sensor. However,\nnot all of them specify if the pH sensors are for the\
    \ soil or for the water [31,42,49,54,68,70,74,75,81,82],\nonly four of them indicate\
    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one for water [69]). Only four papers\n\
    consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter is the plant height\
    \ [64,83], using an\nultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf wetness\
    \ was considered in their system [46,84,85].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n7 of 48\n\

    \ [84] used a sensor based on optical \nsignals while [46] utilized a commercial\
    \ FC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).  \nNow, the data from the\
    \ water sensor are presented. In this case, we will consider for the \ncommentaries\
    \ not only the data of the graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also\
    \ the \ninformation of the paper which measures the water quality, having or not\
    \ the actuators for the \nirrigation system. The water level in the tanks is measured\
    \ in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92] out \nof 88 papers that have a pumping\
    \ system. There are different methods to monitor the water level in \nthe tanks\
    \ and the most used is the one based on ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology\
    \ is \nused in one case [36], the rest of cases do not offer information of how\
    \ the data is measured. In the \ncase of sensors based on ultrasound methods,\
    \ the most utilized sensor is the HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi \nguoyun dianzishangwu\
    \ youxiangongsi , Shenzhen, China, used in [69]). In addition, there are six \n\
    papers that do not include an actuator for the irrigation system even when they\
    \ have water level \nsensors [60,93–97]. There are nine papers where sensors for\
    \ monitoring water flow are utilized \n[14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82]. The sensors\
    \ used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems \nFT110 G3/8 sensor\
    \ (Gems Sensors and Controls, Mumbai, India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 \n\
    (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi jishu youxian gongsi , Wuhan, China) in the proposal\
    \ presented in \n[76]. Both sensors are based on a Hall effect turbine. They have\
    \ different prices and similar \noperational ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8 can measure\
    \ flows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other \nsensor, the YF-S402, is capable of\
    \ measuring flows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover, water flow \nsensors are used\
    \ in three other proposals that do not include actuators for irrigation systems\
    \ [5,98,99]. \nRegarding water quality, the water conductivity is monitored in\
    \ four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in \none case [75], the authors indicate\
    \ the used sensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH \nand conductivity\
    \ from B&C Electronics (Carnate , Italy). \n  \nFigure 7. Monitored parameters\
    \ from the soil, water, and plants in papers that propose an irrigation \nsystem.\
    \ \nAdditionally, there are two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems\
    \ that include in \ntheir proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless,\
    \ no data regarding the equipment \nused are given. Regarding the pH of water,\

    \ In this case, we will consider for the\ncommentaries not only the data of the\
    \ graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also the\ninformation of the\
    \ paper which measures the water quality, having or not the actuators for the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem. The water level in the tanks is measured in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92]\
    \ out of 88 papers\nthat have a pumping system. There are diﬀerent methods to\
    \ monitor the water level in the tanks\nand the most used is the one based on\
    \ ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology is used in\none case [36],\
    \ the rest of cases do not oﬀer information of how the data is measured. In the\
    \ case of\nsensors based on ultrasound methods, the most utilized sensor is the\
    \ HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi guoyun\ndianzishangwu youxiangongsi, Shenzhen, China, used\
    \ in [69]). In addition, there are six papers that\ndo not include an actuator\
    \ for the irrigation system even when they have water level sensors [60,93–97].\n\
    There are nine papers where sensors for monitoring water ﬂow are utilized [14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82].\n\
    The sensors used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems FT110 G3/8\
    \ sensor (Gems\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n8 of 48\nSensors and Controls, Mumbai,\
    \ India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi\njishu\
    \ youxian gongsi, Wuhan, China) in the proposal presented in [76]. Both sensors\
    \ are based on a\nHall eﬀect turbine. They have diﬀerent prices and similar operational\
    \ ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8\ncan measure ﬂows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other\
    \ sensor, the YF-S402, is capable of measuring\nﬂows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover,\
    \ water ﬂow sensors are used in three other proposals that do\nnot include actuators\
    \ for irrigation systems [5,98,99]. Regarding water quality, the water conductivity\n\
    is monitored in four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in one case [75], the authors\
    \ indicate the used\nsensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH and\
    \ conductivity from B&C Electronics\n(Carnate, Italy).\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems that include in their\n\
    proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless, no data regarding\
    \ the equipment used are\ngiven. Regarding the pH of water, it is monitored in\
    \ another three papers (apart from [69]) [99,101,102].\nIn one case [99], the\
    \ authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron, Taipei, Taiwan).\n\
    The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals [51,69]. Only in one\
    \ case [69] did the\nauthors specify that the used sensor is the DS18B20 (Adafruit\
    \ Industries, New York, NY, USA). No other\nproposals evaluated in this survey\
    \ (having or not irrigation system) presented the use of temperature\nsensors\
    \ for the water.\nOn the other hand, with regard to the proposals that monitored\
    \ the atmospheric parameter,\nthe data is presented in Figure 8. Next, we are\
    \ presenting the importance of these sensors for irrigation\nsystems. No details\
    \ of which sensors are used in which papers are given in this section. This information\n\
    will be further discussed in Section 5. The air temperature is the most measured\
    \ parameter, it is\nmonitored in 58 papers. A total of 51 proposals include a\
    \ humidity sensor. Other parameters are less\nmeasured such as the rain, which\
    \ is measured in eight out of 89 papers that proposed an irrigation\nsystem, or\
    \ the wind, measured in only one paper. Meanwhile, there are 15 proposals that\
    \ consider the\nweather forecast. From those 15 proposals, 10 of them use the\
    \ data from the forecast in conjunction\nwith the data gathered by sensors and\
    \ ﬁve proposals use the weather forecast as the sole information\nfor weather\
    \ data/atmospheric parameters.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n8 of 48 \n[99,101,102].\
    \ In one case [99], the authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron,\

    \ only the irrigation system as an actuator.\nThere are seven papers (8% of cases)\

    \ Since we are considering only\nthe papers that include an irrigation system,\
    \ the most used actuator in the diﬀerent irrigation systems.\nTherefore, we do\
    \ not include the use of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized\
    \ actuator is\nthe sound emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103].\
    \ It is generally used as an alarm for the\nfarmers or as a dissuasive measure\
    \ to prevent the entry of animals into the farming lands. In second\nposition,\
    \ we found the use of artiﬁcial light systems. They are used in six cases [36,38,50,71,72,75].\n\
    The use of artiﬁcial light is mainly related to the generation of artiﬁcial photo-\
    \ periods to increase\nproductivity, but they can also be used for operational\
    \ purposes. Fans are included in ﬁve proposals\nand their use is related to modifying\
    \ the atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity or even the\nbalance between\

    \ in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators. Since we are considering\
    \ \nonly the papers that include an irrigation system, the most used actuator\
    \ in the different irrigation \nsystems. Therefore, we do not include the use\
    \ of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized \nactuator is the sound\
    \ emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103]. It is generally used as\

    \ can estimate the potential ET given a location. For ET monitoring, remote sensing\
    \ is the\nbest option as many papers point out [106–108]. Among the possibilities\
    \ for ET monitoring with sensors,\nthe integration of soil moisture changes can\

    \ complex; it can be estimated with the data of sensors that measure radiation,\n\
    leaf area index, and vapor pressure deﬁcit [109]. Due to the complexity of its\
    \ measurement, it is not\nincluded as a monitored variable in most of the papers\

    Most of those proposals use similar sensors based on the conductivity between\
    \ two electrodes.\nDiﬀerent models of the aforementioned sensor have been used\
    \ in the proposals (see Figure 13). The most\nused sensor, based on conductivity,\
    \ is the YL69 (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It has been\nused in nine\
    \ proposals [44,56,71,87,95,115–118]. This sensor is characterized by a low price\
    \ and it is\ncreated speciﬁcally to operate with Arduino (and similar nodes).\
    \ The output voltage goes from 3.3\nto 5 V and the output values are related to\
    \ soil moisture (0 to 300 for dry soil, 300 to 700 humid soil).\nNevertheless,\
    \ it is not possible to have a measure that indicates exactly the value of moisture\
    \ without\nperforming new tests and calibration of the sensor. The same range\
    \ of measure is found in the other\nused sensor based on the same principle, the\
    \ FC-28 (Uruktech, Baghdad, Iraq, used in [34,72,76]) and\nthe SEN0114 (DFRobot,\
    \ Shanghai, China, used in [46]). The S-XNQ-04 sensor (XNQ Electric Company\n\
    Store, Beijing, China), used in [55] has a similar operation principle. However,\
    \ it is composed of three\nelectrodes. In this case, the sensor output voltage\
    \ goes from 0 to 2 V and the sensor is capable of\nmeasuring the soil moisture\
    \ giving as a response the relative saturation moisture content expressed\nin\
    \ percentage (%). This sensor has an accuracy of 3% and it can measure from 0\
    \ to 100% of relative\nsaturation. It can operate from −40 to 85 ◦C.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, x \n12 of 48 \nsensors goes from −40 °C to 85 °C and its accuracy\
    \ is ±0.5 °C. The operation principle of this sensor is \nnot specified in the\
    \ datasheet.  \n \nFigure 13. Number of papers that used different models of soil\
    \ moisture sensors. \nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three papers include\
    \ in their proposals sensors for \nmonitoring this variable [5,80,102]; nonetheless,\
    \ not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only \npaper that clearly indicates\
    \ the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes an 1185 \nSunRom\
    \ color sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor is based on\

    \ time, the VH400 (Vegetronix,\nInc., Riverton, UT, USA), is utilized in [37,40,89,96,119,120].\
    \ These sensors can be used from 40 ◦C to\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n12 of 48\n\
    85 ◦C, but the accuracy and operational range of the sensor probe are not indicated\
    \ in its datasheet.\nThe operational principle of this sensor is based on the\
    \ measurement of the dielectric constant of the\nsoil using transmission line\
    \ techniques to measure the moisture in any type of soil notwithstanding\nsoil\
    \ salinity. The output voltage of this sensor goes from 0 to 3 V. This output\
    \ voltage is related to\nthe volumetric water content in the soil. The sensor\
    \ does not oﬀer a linear relationship between the\noutput voltage and the volumetric\
    \ water content, but the sensor can measure from 0 to up to 60% of\nvolumetric\
    \ water content in the soil. This sensor has a relatively low price and can be\
    \ implemented in\nArduino systems (and similar).\nA sensor with completely different\
    \ operational principles, the 200SS (HYPERION TECHNOLOGIES\nB.V., Delft, The Netherlands),\
    \ is used in two proposals [14,121].\nIt is a solid-state electrical\nresistance\
    \ sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension.\nThe 200SS has a\
    \ pair of\nhighly corrosion-resistant electrodes, as a resistive device, the resistance\
    \ of the sensor changes with the\nsoil moisture. The electrodes are embedded within\
    \ a granular matrix. The output values of the sensor\ngo from 0 to 199 centibars.\
    \ The higher the value of centibars the lower the water availability for the\n\
    plants. The system presented in [54] uses an SM300 sensor. This device is able\
    \ to measure two soil\nparameters (moisture and temperature). The SM300 measures\
    \ the soil moisture and temperature based\non the generation and propagation of\
    \ the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the soil. The sensors measure\nthe soil moisture\
    \ as the volumetric water content, the operating range goes from 0 to 100% and\
    \ the\naccuracy is ±2.5%. This sensor is manufactured by Delta-T Devices Ltd.\
    \ (Cambridge, UK). This sensor\nis not speciﬁcally created to be integrated in\
    \ an Arduino measuring system, even though it can be\nadapted since the output\
    \ voltage goes from 0 to 1 V.\nFinally, the system detailed in [122] used the\
    \ HA2002 sensor, but no information is available\non the internet about this sensor\
    \ in terms of operational principle nor range of measuring. The sole\ninformation\
    \ that was found was that the sensor is an HA2001 sensor manufactured by Handan\
    \ Dingrui\nElectronics Co., Ltd. (Handan, China).\nRegarding the sensors used\
    \ for monitoring the soil temperature, which are mentioned in [37,40,\n45,54,63,67,94,122,123],\
    \ the diﬀerent sensors are detailed in this paragraph. There are ﬁve papers that\n\
    do not specify the sensors used [45,63,67,94,123]. The other four proposals indicate\
    \ in the paper the\nsensors selected. Although in one paper no information could\
    \ be found about the sensor utilized [122],\nthe authors indicate that their system\
    \ includes the HA2001 sensor.\nIn other cases, the information of the selected\
    \ sensors is detailed. The proposal presented in [54]\nused an LM35 sensor. This\
    \ device is able to measure temperature. The operating range is −40 to\n+125 ◦C\
    \ and the accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The sensors oﬀer an analogic signal and it is manufactured\
    \ by\nTexas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA). The proposals presented in [37,40]\
    \ selected the THERM200\n(Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) to measure the\
    \ temperature. The operational range of these\nsensors goes from −40 ◦C to 85\
    \ ◦C and its accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The operation principle of this sensor is\n\
    not speciﬁed in the datasheet.\nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three\
    \ papers include in their proposals sensors for monitoring\nthis variable [5,80,102];\
    \ nonetheless, not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only paper that\n\
    clearly indicates the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes\
    \ an 1185 SunRom\ncolor sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor\
    \ is based on RGB color detection,\nin [80] authors relate the color of the soil\
    \ with the nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured in four\nproposals [66,67,72,110].\
    \ However, none of these proposals indicates the selected device or equipment\n\
    in the paper.\n5. Weather Monitoring\nAn overview of the weather parameters monitored\
    \ in IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the\nmost utilized sensors to monitor\
    \ these parameters is provided in this section. The weather conditions\nare a\
    \ key factor both in irrigation needs and in the performance of crops. Figure\
    \ 14 shows the most\nmonitored weather parameters in the currently available smart\
    \ irrigation proposals. Temperature\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n13 of 48\nand humidity\
    \ aﬀect the evapotranspiration of the water in the soil. Air temperature is deﬁned\
    \ as the\nthermic level of the atmosphere and is usually measured in Celsius,\
    \ Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.\nIt is the most monitored weather parameter with\
    \ one hundred papers monitoring it. Humidity is the\npresence of water vapor in\
    \ the air. The amount of water vapor in the air is expressed in percentage (%).\n\
    It is the second most monitored weather parameter with 86 papers. Furthermore,\
    \ luminosity is paired\nwith temperature as direct radiation from the Sun raises\
    \ the temperature and leads to more water loss in\nthe soil. It is deﬁned as the\
    \ intensity or brightness of the light. It is measured in Lux. It is the third\
    \ most\nmonitored parameter with 28 papers. The amount of precipitation determines\
    \ whether the irrigation\nis needed or not and the amount of water to be employed\
    \ in the case of irrigation being necessary.\nIt considers any form of hydrometeor\
    \ that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the earth’s surface.\nFurthermore,\
    \ it includes rain and snow. A total of 14 papers considered precipitation monitoring.\n\
    Although temperature, relative humidity, luminosity, and precipitations are the\
    \ most important factors\nregarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture, many\
    \ systems propose the monitoring of other\nenvironmental parameters. Table 1 details\
    \ all the papers that utilized these parameters.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n13 of\

    \ wet, the intensity of the\nreceived IR light decreases. It is manufactured by\
    \ Bosch (BOSCH, Gerlingen, Germany) and it is\ncommonly used in the automotive\
    \ industry. The SEN-08942 is a meteorology station manufactured\nby Sparkfun (SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It allows monitoring both wind speed and\ndirection\
    \ and it incorporates a pluviometer [46]. The PRD180 is comprised of a rain detecting\
    \ board\nwith two separate PCB tracks and a control module that provides a digital\
    \ and an analog output [48].\nThe operating voltage is from 3.3 V to 5 V. It is\
    \ manufactured by Elecmake (India). Like the PRD180, the\nYL83 (Vaisala, Vantaa,\
    \ Finland) is comprised of a series of conductive strands printed onto a Bakelite\n\
    plaque [76]. The water creates a short-circuit oﬀering a low resistance between\
    \ the lines connected to\nthe ground and the lines connected to the positive polarity.\n\
    The type of agriculture most concerned with air and wind as a parameter concerning\
    \ weather\nis greenhouse agriculture. For example, one of the aims of [68] is\
    \ the sanitation of the air of the\ngreenhouse from pathogens and chemical contaminants.\
    \ This is then closely related to the activation\nof the actuators necessary to\
    \ the regulation of the quality of the air. The contaminants that can aﬀect\n\
    the quality of the air are CO, CO2, O3, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10, among others [64].\
    \ In the context\nof agriculture, air contaminants are monitored with the use\
    \ of sensors that can be low-cost sensors\nsuch as the MQ135 (SHENZHEN INVENTOR\
    \ ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGYCO., LTD., Shenzhen,\nChina), MQ131, MQ2 or MQ9 sensors\
    \ or commercial sensors that can be found in professional weather\nstations. The\
    \ MQ135 [64,143], used for benzene, alcohol, smoke, NH3, NOx and CO2 monitoring,\
    \ and\nthe MQ2 [64,95], used for gas monitoring (propane, hydrogen, and LPG),\
    \ are the most utilized low-cost\nsensors for air quality monitoring. The MQ131\
    \ is utilized for ozone, Cl2, NO2 monitoring [64] and\nthe MQ9 is utilized for\
    \ CO/combustible gas, methane, carbon monoxide and LPG monitoring [64].\nAnother\
    \ sensor that can be used to monitor CO2 is the CDM4161A (Toshniwal Sensing Device\
    \ Private\nLimited, Ajmer, India) [145].\nWind speed and direction may be of interest\
    \ to IoT irrigation systems such as for the proposal\nin [46], that utilized the\
    \ SEN-08942 sensor manufactured by Sparkfun. Barometric pressure can be of\ninterest\
    \ as well and can be measured by the BME280 sensor manufactured by Bosch [157].\n\
    Movement detection is often related to security measures or to the aim of scaring\
    \ animals to\navoid crop damage. The most utilized sensor for movement detection\
    \ is a passive infrared (PIR)\nsensor [42,95]. This sensor measures the infrared\
    \ light that radiates around the objects placed at the\nfront of the sensor. The\
    \ change in infrared radiation is converted into changes in voltage that trigger\n\
    the detection. It is often utilized for intrusion and pest detection. Ultrasonic\
    \ sensors are often utilized\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n18 of 48\nto detect movement,\
    \ such as the robot proposed in [65] that is able to perform some actions to scare\
    \ the\nanimals that may enter the ﬁelds. These sensors are comprised of a transmitter\
    \ and a receiver that\noperate at the 40 kHz frequency. Its range is from 10 cm\
    \ to 30 cm. Ultrasound at lower frequencies was\nutilized in [60] to repel the\
    \ animals. Insects may cause great damage to the crops, for that reason some\n\
    systems such as [45] include a pest warning functionality. The system in [133]\
    \ is able to even detect the\ntype of insect pests that are damaging the crops.\
    \ These features are often accompanied by a buzzer to\ngenerate an alarm when\
    \ intruders or animals are detected [61].\nDepending on the type of agriculture,\
    \ the values from the measures for each environmental\nparameter can be utilized\
    \ to determine the actions of diﬀerent types of actuators. It can be part of a\n\
    model like the one proposed in [72] where the on-agriculture stage gathers the\
    \ data on temperature,\nhumidity, light, moisture and wind speed in order to activate\
    \ or deactivate fans, artiﬁcial light, a cooler\nand water pumps. Many IoT irrigation\
    \ systems have both a manual and an automatic mode to control\nirrigation. In\
    \ [64], the amount of water released by the water pumps or the duration of the\
    \ irrigation\ncan be selected in the manual mode. For the automatic mode, a preset\
    \ value is utilized at the beginning.\nThen, the data is analyzed to determine\
    \ the personalized settings. The most utilized actuators to\nmodify the conditions\
    \ of the climate that aﬀects the crops or to protect the crops from animals and\n\
    intruders are presented in Figure 20.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n18 of 48 \n \nFigure\

    \ a large number of wireless standards that are used\nin the communications of\
    \ IoT devices. A general classiﬁcation can be established between devices\nthat\
    \ communicate at short or long distances. Short distance communication standards\
    \ usually reach\ndistances of up to 100 m. Long-distance communication standards\
    \ reach distances of kilometers.\nAlso, another type of classiﬁcation can be established\
    \ based on the employed communication\ntechnology. In this way, three categories\
    \ can be established. The ﬁrst category is formed by those that\nconnect utilizing\
    \ Ethernet or cable and WAN technology. The second category is comprised of those\n\
    that connect via WiFi and WAN technology. Finally, the third category is formed\
    \ by those that connect\nusing both low power WiFi and WAN technology.\nIf the\
    \ spectrum band used is considered, we can classify them into technologies that\
    \ use the\nunlicensed spectrum or the licensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum bands\
    \ are known as Industrial,\nScientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM radio band bands, and\
    \ are deﬁned by article 1.15 of the International\nTelecommunication Union’s (ITU)\
    \ ITU Radio Regulations (RR) [184]. The ISM bands can vary according\nto the region\
    \ and its permits. Its main advantage is its ease of installation and the main\
    \ drawbacks are\nrelated to safety deﬁciencies and possible interferences. The\
    \ licensed spectrum bands are assigned\naccording to the diﬀerent proprietary\
    \ technologies. They oﬀer greater security, greater coverage, and\nfewer interferences.\
    \ However, the cost of using a licensed band is higher.\nThe most utilized communication\
    \ technologies among the reviewed papers are presented in\nTable 6. In many of\
    \ the proposals that we have studied, the authors combine several communication\n\
    technologies instead of using one single protocol. As an example, it is very common\
    \ for authors to\nstart using either a wired or a wireless technology to connect\
    \ the sensors with the nodes, and then, use\na wireless technology to send data\
    \ from nodes to remote or cloud storage centers.\nTable 6. Most utilized communication\

    \ to the descriptions provided by the diﬀerent authors of their own implementations,\n\
    we have veriﬁed that the most used communication technology in the diﬀerent proposals\
    \ is WiFi,\nas it can be seen in Figure 25. The reason could be due to is accessibility.\
    \ The currently available\nlow-cost devices for IoT usually support WiFi and,\
    \ although its range can be considered short for\nthe average expanse of a farm,\
    \ small farms could be able to provide enough wireless coverage with\nseveral\
    \ low-cost devices. GSM and ZigBee are widely spread wireless technologies as\
    \ well, with 25\nand 23 papers that use them respectively. GSM provides long-range\
    \ communication at the cost of a\nmobile plan of the service provider that operates\
    \ in the area. ZigBee provides low energy consumption\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\
    27 of 48\nand allows implementing networks with up to 65000 nodes. However, it\
    \ has lower data rates than\nother available technologies and its range would\
    \ imply the deployment of many nodes. Lastly, there\nare two new technologies\
    \ that have been getting popular recently. LoRa is able to provide very long\n\
    ranges, which makes this technology a very good option for secluded areas with\
    \ no service. Moreover,\nregarding speciﬁc protocols for IoT systems, it is a\
    \ little bit surprising that even though MQTT is\na widely spread protocol due\
    \ to its low power consumption and low overhead, it is not a popular\nprotocol\
    \ for IoT irrigation systems at the moment. It is observed that a relatively high\
    \ number of\npapers, exactly in 24 papers, did not describe the employed technology.\
    \ In Figure 25 this group has\nbeen named as Undeﬁned.\n \nwe have verified that\
    \ the most used communication technology in the different proposals is WiFi, as\
    \ \nit can be seen in Figure 25. The reason could be due to is accessibility.\
    \ The currently available low-\ncost devices for IoT usually support WiFi and,\
    \ although its range can be considered short for the \naverage expanse of a farm,\
    \ small farms could be able to provide enough wireless coverage with \nseveral\
    \ low-cost devices. GSM and ZigBee are widely spread wireless technologies as\
    \ well, with 25 \nand 23 papers that use them respectively. GSM provides long-range\
    \ communication at the cost of a \nmobile plan of the service provider that operates\
    \ in the area. ZigBee provides low energy \nconsumption and allows implementing\
    \ networks with up to 65000 nodes. However, it has lower data \nrates than other\
    \ available technologies and its range would imply the deployment of many nodes.\
    \ \nLastly, there are two new technologies that have been getting popular recently.\
    \ LoRa is able to \nprovide very long ranges, which makes this technology a very\
    \ good option for secluded areas with \nno service. Moreover, regarding specific\
    \ protocols for IoT systems, it is a little bit surprising that even \nthough\
    \ MQTT is a widely spread protocol due to its low power consumption and low overhead,\
    \ it is \nnot a popular protocol for IoT irrigation systems at the moment. It\
    \ is observed that a relatively high \nnumber of papers, exactly in 24 papers,\
    \ did not describe the employed technology. In Figure 25 this \ngroup has been\
    \ named as Undefined \n \nFigure 25. Communication technologies employed to implement\
    \ IoT irrigation systems. \n \n \nFigure 25. Communication technologies employed\
    \ to implement IoT irrigation systems.\nWe also observe that, in a large number\
    \ of works, the end-users access the data, obtained during\nthe monitoring process\
    \ or to carry out the control of the system, through APPs or WEBs. Most of these\n\
    communications are done through mobile devices using wireless technologies.\n\

    \ articles.\nIt is observed that most of the authors have not indicated the communication\
    \ module employed.\nFurthermore, it can be observed that the most utilized module\
    \ is the ES8266 WiFi module (SparkFun\nElectronics, Boulder, CO, USA) with 29\

    \ 2020, 20, 1042\n30 of 48\n7. Discussion\nIn this section, current trends regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture are going to\nbe presented.\n7.1. Big\
    \ Data Management and Analytics for Irrigation Optimization\nIoT systems, in general,\
    \ generate a great amount of data due to monitoring diﬀerent parameters\nin real-time,\
    \ and IoT irrigation systems generate big data as well. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to provide\nmechanisms to manage and analyze big data. Ahad et al. [202] comment\
    \ on the need for sustainable\nmanagement of big data to avoid overusing natural\
    \ resources. Using blockchain, powering IoT devices\nwith solar energy, selecting\
    \ useful data and discarding unnecessary and redundant data, employing\nclustering\
    \ techniques to reduce the volume of the information, implementing time-eﬃcient\
    \ algorithms\nand the utilization of sustainable resources as alternatives to\
    \ the components that are employed\nnowadays are some of the suggestions they\
    \ provide.\nAlthough the data gathered from the sensors is already a big source\
    \ of information, the analysis\nof this data is paramount to optimize the IoT\
    \ irrigation system according to the crop and the weather\nconditions. For this\
    \ purpose, Tseng et al. [203] presented a big data analysis algorithm to aid farmers\n\
    in the crop selection process. Their proposal satisﬁed the ﬁve Vs (volume, velocity,\
    \ variety, veracity,\nand value) of big data. They performed a 3D correlation\
    \ analysis that evaluated the irrigation cycle to\nidentify the irrigation practices\
    \ performed by the farmer. Then, they calculated the soil moisture content\nto\
    \ detect irrigation and to evaluate if the farmer applied pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ This information was\ncoupled with data on the weather conditions and other\
    \ aspects of the soil to provide the farmer with\nthe cultivation risks of each\
    \ type of crop. Nonetheless, there are other technologies that are currently\n\
    being utilized to analyze the big data produced by IoT irrigation systems for\
    \ agriculture.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is currently the type of technology\
    \ most companies are interested in for\nvarious purposes. In the case of irrigation,\
    \ the use of AI is tied to the optimization of the available\nresources such as\
    \ water, fertilizers or energy or to obtain information from the crops such as\
    \ the\npresence of diseases or the correct growth of the plants, vegetables, and\
    \ fruits. One of the techniques\nemployed to analyze the data gathered from the\
    \ sensors so as to perform decisions on the irrigation\nsystems is fuzzy logic.\
    \ Fuzzy logic has been employed to improve irrigation scheduling in greenhouses\n\
    and control the drainage implementing it on the controller of the system [100].\
    \ The fuzzy rules were\nprovided according to the water availability utilizing\
    \ the QtFuzzyLite software ((FuzzyLite Limited,\nWellington, New Zealand). Another\
    \ fuzzy logic controller is employed to determine the coverage\nerror for the\
    \ resources so as to determine if the eﬀective watering of the plants can be guaranteed\
    \ [96].\nThe system presented in [136] utilized fuzzy logic to determine the duration\
    \ of the irrigation process\nonce the soil moisture values go below the 20% threshold.\
    \ Light and temperature lead to the least\naccuracy in irrigation (40%) whereas\
    \ any combination with the soil moisture values reached an accuracy\nfrom 62 to\
    \ 81%. The authors conclude that the subsoil moisture sensor is the most important\
    \ sensor to\ndetermine irrigation. The irrigation time was predicted in [162]\
    \ as well, using the adaptive neuro fuzzy\ninterference system (ANFIS) to predict\
    \ the irrigation time. This fuzzy logic technique was implemented\nemploying the\
    \ MATLAB software. However, outdoor temperature and light are important to avoid\
    \ the\nevaporation of the water. Another irrigation system utilizes iterative\
    \ learning control (ILC) arithmetic\nto make decisions regarding the opening of\
    \ the water valves [67].\nMachine learning is another technique that is utilized\
    \ in irrigation systems to perform predictions.\nThe prediction algorithm in [120]\
    \ for soil moisture prediction obtained an accuracy of 96%. Prediction\ntechniques\
    \ can also be utilized to estimate the amount of available water for irrigation\
    \ such as the case\nof [119], where the authors employ Fisher’s LDA method for\
    \ that purpose. Water usage is predicted as\nwell in [50] employing regression\
    \ algorithms. The regression algorithms consider the temperature of\nthe environment\
    \ and the water ﬂow to produce a water consumption forecast that is then visualized\n\
    by the user through a mobile app.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n31 of 48\nFeedforward\
    \ neural networks and the structural similarity index were employed in [204] to\n\
    develop an optimized smart irrigation system. The authors compared gradient descent\
    \ and variable\nlearning rate gradient descent optimization techniques to predict\
    \ soil moisture and they determined\nthat the latter was the best one. Furthermore,\
    \ a study on machine learning applied to agriculture so as\nto perform predictions\
    \ on irrigation was performed in [205]. Diﬀerent machine learning techniques\n\
    were applied to the data on the soil and the environment collected from jojoba\
    \ plantations. The authors\nconclude that the boosted tree classiﬁer was the best\
    \ classiﬁcation model was and the gradient boosted\nregression trees was the best\
    \ regression model. They had a 95% and 93% accuracy respectively.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest as well that diﬀerent feature-sets would be better for diﬀerent plots\
    \ as some\nconﬁgurations achieved better results for diﬀerent types of plots such\
    \ as organic ones. Furthermore, the\nmodels considerably reduced their accuracy\
    \ when deliberated soil drying was performed. Moreover,\nthe authors state that\
    \ the data on the weather and the saturation could be not considered without it\n\
    substantially aﬀecting the accuracy of the models.\n7.2. Low-Cost Autonomous Sensors\n\
    As we have seen in Section 2, the majority of the countries that dedicate more\
    \ eﬀort to researching\nIoT irrigation systems are countries where the farmers\
    \ cannot aﬀord commercial solutions. Therefore,\nmost of the solutions for irrigation\
    \ management are comprised of low-cost sensors and controllers so\nas to increase\
    \ the scope of the beneﬁts of utilizing smart irrigation systems. Apart from individual\n\
    sensors, some shields integrate several sensors and connectors for irrigation\
    \ and agriculture speciﬁc\nIoT systems such as the OpenGarden shield ((Libelium\
    \ Comunicaciones Distribuidas S.L., Zaragoza,\nSpain) [136]. It can be connected\
    \ to an Arduino UNO and it is comprised of an LDR, a DHT22 connector\n(SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA), a soil moisture connector, a hydroponics connector,\
    \ digital\nand analog pins, a DS18B20 connector (Adafruit Industries, New York,\
    \ NY, USA) and an antenna\nconnector. This type of solution allows the easy implementation\
    \ of low-cost smart irrigation systems.\n7.3. Sustainable Irrigation Systems\n\
    Most irrigation systems do not have access to the power grid, therefore there\
    \ is a need for\nalternative means of powering up the devices that conform the\
    \ system. Even irrigation systems with\naccess to the power grid may only receive\
    \ power during a constrained time period. In India, for\nexample, the system presented\
    \ in [29] determines when access to electricity is available to turn on\nthe irrigation\
    \ motors. This system was designed to help farmers when access to electricity\
    \ happens\nat irregular hours or even at night, when farmers may not be present\
    \ in the ﬁeld. To address the\nneed for alternative ways of powering the irrigation\
    \ systems in agricultural ﬁelds that are too far to\naccess the power grid, many\
    \ systems incorporate a solar energy functionality, making the system\nmore sustainable\
    \ [41]. Furthermore, the use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs which\
    \ is\nan advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas.\nConsidering\
    \ those reasons,\na total of 22 of the surveyed papers chose to utilize solar\
    \ energy to power their proposed irrigation\nsystem [4,38,41,46,50,56,63,66,69,88,90–92,96,99,101,140,145,171,178,181].\n\
    7.4. Frequency of the Data Acquisition\nThe frequency at which the parameters\
    \ are monitored may be diﬀerent for each proposal. Real-time\nmonitoring [31,71]\
    \ has been surging as the cost of the devices, whether they are processors, devices\n\
    for data storage or sensors, has experienced a considerable reduction. Some proposals\
    \ decide not to\nmonitor the parameters in real-time so as to reduce energy consumption.\
    \ Some authors have decided\nto take a measure every 10 s [58].\n7.5. New Forms\
    \ of Data Acquisition\nThe advances in technology as lead to new ways of obtaining\
    \ the data from the sensors deployed\nin the ﬁelds. One of the new ways of gathering\
    \ data from the sensor nodes is by utilizing drones [31].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\
    32 of 48\nDrones also allow obtaining new data that could not be obtained in other\
    \ ways such as aerial images\nof the ﬁelds.\nAnother new form of data acquisition\
    \ is the use of robots that can incorporate both sensors and\nactuators to perform\
    \ activities such as soil moisture sensing, weeding, spraying water or scaring\
    \ the\nanimals [65]. Robots can be utilized for the irrigation of precise areas\
    \ due to their ability to travel to\nthe desired location [38]. This robot is\
    \ able to measure soil moisture and include proximity sensors\nto avoid collisions.\
    \ The robot has a sprinkler system to irrigate the desired area. Furthermore,\
    \ the\nwireless robot in [66] is comprised of both environmental and soil monitoring\
    \ sensors and performs\ntasks such as water spraying, scaring animals and moving\
    \ through the ﬁeld. In order to improve the\nnavigation of the robots for irrigation,\
    \ the authors in [55] provided the robot with a coverage path\nplanning (CPP)\
    \ algorithm that has a map of the static elements and environmental data. The\
    \ robot\noperating system (ROS) was utilized to develop the control system of\
    \ the robot which is divided into\nthree layers. The ﬁrst layer reads the data\
    \ from the sensors and controls the actuators, the second\nlayer performs the\
    \ communication among the elements of the system and the third layer performs\
    \ the\ndecision making and the path planning. This robot performs irrigation as\
    \ a linear shower. Furthermore,\nthese robots can be powered by solar panels [38,66]\
    \ to provide them with more autonomy.\n7.6. Security in IoT Systems for Irrigation\n\
    Depending on the characteristics of the environment where the implementation of\
    \ the IoT system\nis carried out, securing the system may become a challenging\
    \ task as diﬀerent types of threats must be\nconsidered. On the one hand, all\
    \ the security issues of any IoT system can be applied to an IoT irrigation\n\
    system for agriculture. Therefore, current works with their focus on securing\
    \ IoT describes the security\nchallenges that IoT irrigation systems may face.\
    \ For example, organizations such as the Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ study the diﬀerent problems that aﬀect this. Furthermore, authors\nsuch as Garcia-Morchon\
    \ et al. [206] present in their work the following list of security threats and\n\
    managing risks: vulnerable software/code, privacy threats, cloning of things,\
    \ malicious substitution\nof things, eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack, ﬁrmware attacks, extraction of private\ninformation, routing attack,\
    \ elevation of privilege, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regarding DoS\nattacks,\
    \ Kamienski et al. [50] highly stressed the importance of protecting the irrigation\
    \ system from\nDoS attacks or avoiding attackers from accessing the collected\
    \ data or the system with the intention of\ndamaging the crops.\nIn order to face\
    \ the above threats, it is necessary to apply the appropriate security measures,\
    \ but\nas new threats and attacks appear daily, [206] propose using methodologies\
    \ such as analyzing the\nbusiness impact of the attack, assessing the threats\
    \ considering their impact and probability, its impact\non the privacy of the\
    \ collected information and the process of reporting and mitigating incidents.\n\
    However, on the other hand, when considering just the currently available studies\
    \ on securing\nIoT irrigation systems speciﬁcally, it is possible to discern which\
    \ aspects of IoT security are prioritized\nfor this type of system.\nJimenez et\
    \ al. [207] identiﬁed the security threats speciﬁc to an intelligent wastewater\
    \ puriﬁcation\nsystem for irrigation. Apart from the previously mentioned security\
    \ threats [206], the authors of [207]\ncontemplate physical attacks that the IoT\
    \ deployment may face. The IoT devices must be protected\nfrom the weather and\
    \ possible animals that access the ﬁelds. However, strong weather conditions\n\
    such as ﬂoods or animals such as wilds boars may result in the IoT device being\
    \ damaged or lost.\nFurthermore, the IoT devices may also be damaged by the operators\
    \ when they are performing their\nactivities or be the aim of a person with malicious\
    \ intentions. Another threat to the devices deployed\non the ﬁeld is the possibility\
    \ of them being replaced to malicious nodes, providing the attacker with\naccess\
    \ to the network [29]. The deployed devices may also be susceptible to malicious\
    \ code and false\ndata injection, leading to wrong results and the malfunction\
    \ of the system. Sleep deprivation attacks\nare aimed at depleting the battery\
    \ of the devices. The deployed nodes are susceptible to booting attacks\nas well.\
    \ Furthermore, attackers may also perform eavesdropping and interfere with the\
    \ deployed\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n33 of 48\ndevices. The concern of securing\
    \ the physical devices deployed on the ﬁelds has led to many systems\nincorporating\
    \ PIR sensors, scarecrows, and buzzers to detect intruders, either humans or animals,\
    \ and\nto alert of their presence [59,208].\nPrivacy is another aspect to consider.\
    \ The data managed by IoT irrigation systems may not need as\nmuch privacy as\
    \ the data managed by other IoT applications such as those for health. In fact,\
    \ Jimenez\net al. [207] remark that it may not be necessary for the gathered data\
    \ of some irrigation IoT systems to\nremain private, but the correct performance\
    \ of the system must be ensured, which is avoiding DoS\nattacks. However, the\
    \ owners of the ﬁelds may be implementing new techniques they would prefer to\n\
    remain private or the water quality management system could be regarded as a critical\
    \ infrastructure\nas the produce that results from the ﬁelds irrigated with that\
    \ water would be consumed by people.\nTherefore, considering this aspect, Ahad\
    \ et al. [202] and Barreto et al. [209] remark the need for user\nprivacy, as\
    \ the obtention of this information may lead to attacks to the owner or the personnel\
    \ of the\nfarm. Ahad et al. [202] consider data and device privacy as well, because\
    \ of the need for guaranteeing\nthe ownership of the data to avoid repudiation\
    \ and ensuring data availability. Barreto et al. [209]\nremark on the burden that\
    \ could be originated from the exposure of the GPS locational data captured\n\
    by IoT devices as attackers may gain information on the location of the farm to\
    \ perform physical attacks.\nLastly, Ahad et al. [202] also comment on the need\
    \ for a secure storage system for the information,\nwith particular emphasis on\
    \ distributed data storage systems. Attacks such as SQL injections can lead\n\
    to the obtention of private information from storage systems [210].\nAs cloud\
    \ computing often goes hand in hand with IoT systems, threats to cloud services\
    \ may\ncompromise the IoT irrigation system as well. Flooding attacks and cloud\
    \ malware injection are some\nof the attacks that can be intentionally executed\
    \ to compromise the data and the performance of the\ncloud [210].\nRansomware\
    \ is another security threat that could aﬀect irrigation systems for agriculture\
    \ [209].\nAll the data regarding pesticides and the fertigation system could be\
    \ encrypted until a ransom is paid.\nFor this reason, having a back-up in a remote\
    \ location is greatly advised.\nBarreto et al. [209] also remark some security\
    \ threats that are not usually commented on when\ndiscussing the security of IoT\
    \ systems for agriculture. One of these threats is the damage that can be\ncaused\
    \ by social engineering as the users of the IoT irrigation system could provide\
    \ login information\nto people posing as technicians or click on malicious links\
    \ on their e-mails. The other threats are\nagroterrorism, cyber-espionage, mostly\
    \ related to accessing intellectual property or conﬁdential\ninformation regarding\
    \ aspects such as genetically modiﬁed crops.\nBlockchain is a new technique that\
    \ is being applied to secure IoT systems [210], which allows\nsecure data storage\
    \ and communication. In agriculture, it is mostly utilized to secure the supply\n\
    chain [211], although there are other proposals that use it to secure a greenhouse\
    \ [212] or to secure\nthe overall smart agriculture framework [213]. Regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture,\nblockchain has been applied in [214]\
    \ to track and trace the information exchange of their proposed\nsmart watering\
    \ system.\n7.7. Common Architecture Designs for IoT Irrigation Systems for Agriculture\n\
    In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent architectures for these systems\
    \ is going to\nbe discussed.\nMulti-agent architectures are popular in IoT solutions\
    \ for irrigation management [175,180].\nThese types of architectures make a distinction\
    \ among the diﬀerent elements they are comprised of.\nTypically, the distinction\
    \ is made according to the layer of the architecture the elements are encompassed\n\
    in. For example, nodes positioned higher in the hierarchy may act as a broker\
    \ for those lower in the\nhierarchy [175].\nMost architectures are divided into\
    \ layers or functional blocks that represent the main actions to\nbe carried out\
    \ [215]. These blocks or layers can be considered as generic and are utilized\
    \ in most of the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n34 of 48\navailable architecture designs\
    \ for IoT systems intended for irrigation management. The main elements\nof these\
    \ architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ and security.\nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain environment\
    \ to perform multiple\nactivities such as detection, monitoring, control, and\
    \ action. The devices must have interfaces that allow\ntheir connection with other\
    \ devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained through\ndiﬀerent\
    \ sensors will generally be treated and their results will be applied to diﬀerent\
    \ actuators. Then, it\nis necessary to transmit the monitored data and response\
    \ actions between the devices. Communication\nprotocols are used for this task.\
    \ In most cases, diﬀerent communication protocols are used working\ntogether on\
    \ the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such as device discovery,\
    \ device control\nor the analysis of the collected data, the use of services may\
    \ be necessary as well. The applications allow\nthe interaction of the user with\
    \ the system. From the applications, the user will be able to visualize\nthe information,\
    \ both obtained by monitoring and that extracted from the data once they have\
    \ been\nprocessed. On many occasions, the user can execute the actions that he\
    \ considers appropriate to the\nsituation presented by the data, the actions can\
    \ also be carried out automatically. Lastly, providing\nsecurity to the system\
    \ may also be considered.\nTraditionally, the IoT architecture has been considered\
    \ to be divided into three layers, which are\nthe perception, network, and application\
    \ layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between the\nnetwork and application\
    \ layers has been introduced in multiple studies. This layer, called service layer,\n\
    is employed to store and process data using cloud and fog computing. For the last\
    \ few years, authors\nsuch as Ferrández-Pastor [216] presented a new architecture\
    \ proposal, based on four layers: things,\nedge, communication, and cloud. In\
    \ these latest architectural proposals, the authors use the edge layer\nto locate\
    \ critical applications and perform basic control processes. Also, as indicated\
    \ by [216], cloud\n(internet/intranet) can provide Web services, data storage,\
    \ HMI interfaces or analytic applications.\nFigure 29 shows an image where one\
    \ can see the architecture models.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n34 of 48 \n \nelements\
    \ of these architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ \nand security.  \nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain\
    \ environment to perform multiple \nactivities such as detection, monitoring,\
    \ control, and action. The devices must have interfaces that \nallow their connection\
    \ with other devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained\
    \ \nthrough different sensors will generally be treated and their results will\
    \ be applied to different \nactuators. Then, it is necessary to transmit the monitored\
    \ data and response actions between the \ndevices. Communication protocols are\
    \ used for this task. In most cases, different communication \nprotocols are used\
    \ working together on the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such\
    \ as \ndevice discovery, device control or the analysis of the collected data,\
    \ the use of services may be \nnecessary as well. The applications allow the interaction\
    \ of the user with the system. From the \napplications, the user will be able\
    \ to visualize the information, both obtained by monitoring and that \nextracted\
    \ from the data once they have been processed. On many occasions, the user can\
    \ execute the \nactions that he considers appropriate to the situation presented\
    \ by the data, the actions can also be \ncarried out automatically. Lastly, providing\
    \ security to the system may also be considered.  \nTraditionally, the IoT architecture\
    \ has been considered to be divided into three layers, which are \nthe perception,\
    \ network, and application layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between\

    \ reviewed IoT systems for irrigation, both 3-layered [46,83,118,217,218] and\
    \ 5-\nlayered architectures [180] are available. Commonly, the lower layer is\
    \ comprised of the sensor nodes \nand the actuators. The middle layer is comprised\
    \ of a gateway and contemplates data transmission. \nLastly, the third layer is\

    \ cloud. For the case of IoUT, the sensors are deployed \nunderground. The authors\
    \ performed a study on wireless communication among above ground and \nunderground\
    \ devices. The path loss link between above ground and underground devices reached\
    \ -\n80 dBm for 50 m. The distance between underground devices reached approximately\
    \ 10 m for -80 \ndBm. The authors also comment on the effects of soil moisture\

    \ subsection, we present an architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system\
    \ for irrigation.\nIn order to ensure the correct performance of the IoT irrigation\
    \ system for precision agriculture, the\narchitecture should provide interoperability,\
    \ scalability, security, availability, and resiliency.\nAfter having carried out\
    \ an exhaustive study of works presented by other researchers, our\narchitecture\
    \ proposal is divided into four layers that we deﬁne as devices, communication,\
    \ services,\nand application, as shown in Figure 30. Furthermore, the aspects\
    \ related to management and security\nshould be treated jointly between the communication\
    \ and services layers.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n36 of 48 \n \nFigure 30. Architecture\
    \ proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture. \n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems \nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221]. It consists of \ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves \nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground \ncommunication. It\
    \ is especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture\
    \ IoT \nsystems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and\
    \ farmers and it would reduce \nthe amount of physical damage the nodes deployed\
    \ on the fields may receive. Although WiFi \nsurprisingly allows underground-above\
    \ ground communication in short distances and depths above \n30 cm [222], it would\
    \ be necessary to study the performance of other existing protocols or even the\
    \ \ncreation of a new protocol that employs lower frequency bands to transmit\
    \ the information through \nthe soil medium.  \nThe use of LoRa is increasing\
    \ for irrigation and precision agriculture applications due to its long-\nrange,\
    \ which allows wireless communication to remote fields. However, the advances\
    \ in 5G may lead \nto a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one\
    \ hand, if the designed irrigation system \nproduces lower amounts of data, as\
    \ these types of systems present low variability in the data, LoRa \npresents\
    \ itself as a very good solution. However, on the other hand, for IoT systems\
    \ that require the \ntransmission of large amounts of data, 5G would solve the\
    \ problem of the limited amount of data \nthat LoRa can transmit. Considering\
    \ these aspects, a possible future is the use of LoRa and 5G hybrid \nwireless\
    \ networks to attempt in satisfying those needs [223]. \nThere are diverse opinions\
    \ on the existence and effects of climate change on earth. However, \nthere is\
    \ no doubt that many governments, companies and the citizens themselves are increasing\
    \ their \nawareness regarding sustainable consumption. This not only affects their\
    \ view on the energy \nconsumption of IoT systems for irrigation but also, the\
    \ origin of the components of the devices and \nthe impact of IoT devices on the\
    \ environment and the fauna of the area where they are deployed. \nTherefore,\
    \ the reduction in energy consumption and the use of alternative powering methods\
    \ will \ncontinue to be a research trend. Furthermore, it may be a challenge to\
    \ find new materials that are \nweather-resistant and do not increase severely\
    \ the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable \nmaterials in some of the\
    \ elements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203]. \nAs it has further been\
    \ commented on Subsection 7 1 blockchain and AI will be incorporated into\nFigure\
    \ 30. Architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture.\nThe\
    \ ﬁrst layer is the Device layer, where all the devices that will perform the\
    \ functions of detection,\nmonitoring, control, and action are located. We would\
    \ have four types of nodes. The water monitoring\nnode would monitor water quality\
    \ to determine if the water is apt for the irrigation of the crops.\nThe soil\
    \ monitoring node would monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and other parameters\
    \ that\naid in the irrigation schedule decision process. The weather monitoring\
    \ node would measure air\ntemperature and humidity, precipitation, luminosity,\
    \ radiation, and wind parameters so as to aid in\nthe decision making process.\
    \ Lastly, the actuator nodes would perform the actions resulting from the\ndecision-making\
    \ process.\nThe second layer is the communication layer, comprised of three blocks.\
    \ The Hop-to-Hop\ncommunication block allows deﬁning data link layer technologies\
    \ and to transmit the frames that\ncontain the data of the device layer. From\
    \ this block the frames will be sent to the network communication\nblock, to reach\
    \ the remote locations. The routing function can be assumed in this block in mesh\n\
    networks, such as 802.15.4 networks. The end-to-end communication block is responsible\
    \ for delivering\nthe capabilities of the transport and application layers of\
    \ the TCP/IP model when communication\ncrosses diﬀerent network environments.\
    \ Finally, the network communication block is responsible for\nthe communication\
    \ (routing) between the networks, of the hop-to-hop at end-to-end blocks, using\n\
    the address, for example, IPv4 and IPv6, and the ID resolution. In addition, it\
    \ will be responsible for\nmanaging the QoS.\nThe next layer is the services layer,\
    \ which is comprised of three blocks. The services block includes\nthe IoT services\
    \ and operability for their discovery and search. The organization block performs\
    \ the\nassignment of the services according to the needs of the users or the available\
    \ resources. At last,\nin business environments that relate to IoT, the modeling\
    \ and execution of service block will be invoked\nfrom the execution of the applications.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1042\n36 of 48\nThere are two blocks, management and security,\
    \ that act on both the previously described\ncommunication and services layers.\
    \ The management block is based on the fault, conﬁguration,\naccounting, performance,\
    \ security (FCAPS) model and framework.\nThis is a model of the ISO\nTelecommunications\
    \ Management Network [220].\nThe security block guarantees both the security and\
    \ privacy of the systems and is comprised\nof four blocks. The authentication\
    \ block is responsible for the authentication of users and services.\nThe authorization\
    \ block manages access control policies. Furthermore, access control decisions\
    \ will\nbe made based on access control policies. The key exchange & management\
    \ block is used to achieve\nsecure communications between peers. Finally, the\
    \ trust & reputation block is responsible for scoring\nthe user and calculating\
    \ the level of trust of the service.\nThe last layer is the application layer.\
    \ It allows users to interact with the IoT system. From this\nlayer, users can\
    \ receive alarms, visualize the gathered data in real-time or activate the actuators\
    \ or\nactions that have not been programmed automatically.\n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems\nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221].\nIt consists of\ndeploying both underground and above\

    and do not increase severely the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable\
    \ materials in some of the\nelements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203].\n\
    As it has further been commented on Section 7.1, blockchain and AI will be incorporated\
    \ into most\nIoT services [210], including those aimed at irrigation and precision\
    \ agriculture. These technologies\nprovide not only increased security but also\
    \ optimization to the management of the IoT systems.\nThis will lead to an increased\
    \ understanding of the crops and a faster way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed\
    \ crops and the eﬀects of new fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, it will\
    \ aid in optimizing\nand reducing water consumption and improving the new mechanisms\
    \ that are being proposed to\ndetermine if treated wastewater can be used for\
    \ irrigation and which crops can be irrigated with\nwastewater depending on its\
    \ composition.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n37 of 48\nLastly, farmers usually have\
    \ a very small proﬁt and thus, these IoT systems may not be aﬀordable\nto them.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of IoT devices and the overall system implementation should\
    \ have a\ndecreasing tendency for these types of systems to have a commercial\
    \ future.\n8. Conclusions and Future Work\nWater management is paramount in countries\
    \ with water scarcity. This also aﬀects agriculture, as\na large amount of water\
    \ is dedicated to this use. The rising concerns about global warming have led\n\
    to the consideration of creating water management measures to ensure the availability\
    \ of water for\nfood production and consumption. Thus, the researches on water\
    \ usage reduction for irrigation have\nincreased over the years. In this paper,\
    \ we have provided an overview of the actual state of the art\nregarding IoT irrigation\
    \ systems for agriculture. We have identiﬁed the most monitored parameters to\n\
    characterize water quality for irrigation, soil and weather conditions. We have\
    \ also identiﬁed the most\nutilized nodes to implement IoT and WSN systems for\
    \ the irrigation of crops and the most popular\nwireless technologies. Furthermore,\
    \ the current trends in the implementation of IoT systems for crop\nmanagement\
    \ and irrigation have been discussed as well. We have provided a 4-layer architecture\n\

  title: 'IoT-Based Smart Irrigation Systems: An Overview on the Recent Trends on
    Sensors and IoT Systems for Irrigation in Precision Agriculture'
  verbatim_quote1: Typical commercial sensors for systems aimed for agriculture and
    its irrigation are very expensive, making it impossible for smaller farmers to
    implement this type of system on their farms. However, manufacturers are currently
    oﬀering low-cost sensors that can be connected to nodes to implement aﬀordable
    systems for irrigation management and agriculture monitoring.
  verbatim_quote2: Due to the recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can
    be applied in the development of these systems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing
    the current state of the art regarding smart irrigation systems.

    \ The agriculture sector is the backbone of Pakistan’s economy, reﬂecting 26%\
    \ of its GPD and\n43% of the entire labor force. Smart and precise agriculture\
    \ is the key to producing the best crop yield.\nMoreover, emerging technologies\
    \ are reducing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness for saving\nagricultural\
    \ resources in control and monitoring systems, especially for those areas lacking\
    \ these\nresources. Agricultural productivity is thwarted in many areas of Pakistan\
    \ due to farmers’ illiteracy,\nlack of a smart system for remote access to farmland,\
    \ and an absence of proactive decision-making\nin all phases of the crop cycle\
    \ available in their native language. This study proposes an internet of\nagricultural\
    \ things (IoAT) based smart system armed with a set of economical, accessible\
    \ devices and\nsensors to capture real-time parameters of farms such as soil moisture\
    \ level, temperature, soil pH level,\nlight intensity, and humidity on frequent\
    \ intervals of time. The system analyzes the environmental\nparameters of speciﬁc\
    \ farms and enables the farmers to understand soil and environmental factors,\n\
    facilitating farmers in terms of soil fertility analysis, suitable crop cultivation,\
    \ automated irrigation and\nguidelines, harvest schedule, pest and weed control,\
    \ crop disease awareness, and fertilizer guidance.\nThe system is integrated with\
    \ an android application ‘Kistan Pakistan’ (prototype) designed in\nbilingual,\
    \ i.e., ‘Urdu’ and ‘English’. The mobile application is equipped with visual components,\n\
    audio, voice, and iconic and textual menus to be used by diverse literary levels\
    \ of farmers.\nKeywords: smart farming; precision agriculture; IoT; sensor network;\
    \ semi-literate farmers; interactive\ninterface; User Interface (UI); Android\
    \ apps\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is considered the base for human living because\
    \ it is the primary food source\nand plays a crucial role in the global economy.\
    \ Pakistan is 79.6 million km2 and is home to a\npopulation of 192 million. The\
    \ contribution of the agricultural sector to gross domestic product\n(GDP) in\
    \ Pakistan gradually decreased to 19.3% in the year 2020–2021 from 22.04% previously\n\
    recorded in 2019 and generating employment opportunities for 38.5% of Pakistan’s\
    \ labor\nforce and valuable foreign exchange for the country [1–3]. It supports\
    \ the manufacturing and\nservices sectors of the economy by providing backward-forward\
    \ linkages in inputs-outputs\nmarkets and the most significant consumer of household\
    \ durables. Therefore, our agriculture\nsector can be considered an economic activity\
    \ in the country [4]. Farmers are facing issues in\nthe agriculture sector, so\
    \ it’s significant to research, develop of latest mechanisms, and adopt\nnew practices\
    \ to enhance production. Pressure on the agricultural system will increase with\n\
    the continuing expansion of the human population.\nMany areas of Pakistan are\
    \ trailing in agricultural productivity due to a lack of farmers’\nawareness,\
    \ timely access to crucial information, and proactive decision-making [5,6]. It\
    \ is\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12081277\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n2 of 23\n\
    vital for human development in these underdeveloped areas to utilize information\
    \ and\ncommunication technologies (ICTs), artiﬁcial intelligence techniques, machine\
    \ learning\n(ML), and deep learning (DL) to make such information more readily\
    \ accessible to farmers,\nsigniﬁcantly increasing crop production [7–13]. Climate\
    \ change and shortage of agricultural\nresources are also signiﬁcant concerns\
    \ for the downfall of agricultural performance resulting\nin food insecurity [14–17].\
    \ This lets farmers hamper soil with intensiﬁed pesticides, which\naffect agricultural\
    \ practices in a harmful manner. Finally, ﬁelds remain barren [18–22].\nThese\
    \ are reasons for crop failure, lower production due to diseases, unpredictable\
    \ climate\nchange, and loss of soil fertility [23,24].\nIn this scenario, the\
    \ traditional agriculture trends are insufﬁcient to increase agricul-\ntural growth.\
    \ Agriculture is also out of the reach of less conventional technologies. In\n\
    this context, digital agriculture, automation, and precision farming, now termed\
    \ smart\nfarming, have arisen as new scientiﬁc ﬁelds that use intense techniques\
    \ to drive agricultural\nproductivity while minimizing its environmental impact\
    \ [25–27]. Data generated by smart\nfarming operations is provided by various\
    \ sensors that enable a better understanding of\nthe operational environment (interaction\
    \ of dynamic conditions of the crop, soil, weather,\nand environmental factors)\
    \ and the operation itself, leading to more accurate and timely\ndecision-making\
    \ [28,29]. Variability in climate and labor shortage is increasing continu-\n\
    ously, providing better insights for agricultural machinery automation. Remote\
    \ monitoring\ntechnologies facilitate farmers to access every inch of the farmlands\
    \ by creating virtual\nfences to monitor, detect and protect crops in real-time\
    \ [30–32]. IoT-based technologies\nallow farmers, among other things, to gather\
    \ data on plants’ environmental conditions like\nclimate change, soil fertility\
    \ level, humidity, temperature, and light intensity to monitor\nﬁelds and farms\
    \ remotely. These technologies assist farmers in having know-how and\nstatus of\
    \ crops anywhere and anytime [33–36].\nIn Pakistan, most farmers have android\
    \ phones [37–41] but are regrettably under-\nutilized. Our preliminary literature\
    \ study compelled us to work to facilitate farmers for\nagriculture automation,\
    \ recommendations, and guidelines in their local language, i.e.,\nUrdu, by using\
    \ the internet of agricultural things (IoAT), also known as agricultural\ninternet\
    \ of things (Ag-IoT) and artiﬁcial intelligence technologies with transliteration\
    \ and\nvoice-speech support in the local language. IoAT is the network of complex\
    \ and diverse\nagricultural objects that compute, process, and recommend solutions\
    \ intelligently based on\ndata generated from every connectable thing [42].\n\
    Previous research shows that using graphical cues, audio, speech, and video in\
    \ mobile\ninterfaces helps low-literates better adapt [43,44]. Field study experiences\
    \ reﬂect that low-\nliterates feel more challenged in understanding and interpreting\
    \ textual information than\ntheir literate peers [45]. In our research, we try\
    \ to accommodate such users by introducing\naudio, speech, Urdu language support,\
    \ and an interactive graphical interface. Researchers\nalso talked about the improvements\
    \ in information dissemination systems for less literate\nfarmers via different\
    \ means [46–50]. However, none considered interface design and\nUrdu language-based\
    \ real-time updates about agricultural guidelines using the android\napplication\
    \ and user preferences. Our choice of Urdu in this work was made by observing\n\
    that 87% of farmers preferred Urdu as a medium of information dissemination [51].\
    \ Our\nresearch is an extended form of [52–54] and primarily focuses on developing\
    \ an IoT-based\nand user-friendly system with these utilities.\n1.1. Rationale\n\
    This section reﬂects the ﬁndings and an evaluation report on information found\
    \ in\nthe literature relevant to our research domain. It represents the overview\
    \ of different ap-\nproaches used by other researchers. Integrating the Internet\
    \ of Things into the agricultural\nsystem has led to the internet of Agricultural\
    \ things (IoAT) and advanced computing\ntechniques. The researchers applied this\
    \ to obtain maximum beneﬁts and also to improve\nthe production of agriculture,\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence, and IoT [55]. The agriculture domain is\nexperiencing\
    \ new evolution and revolution motivated by cloud technology, IoT, Edge and\n\
    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n3 of 23\nfog computing, sensors, IoT, and big data\
    \ [56]. A proposal was presented for agriculture\napplications by investigating\
    \ integrated platforms, including cloud computing, IoT, and\ndata mining techniques\
    \ [57]. An IoT-based smart agricultural system was developed using\ndeep learning\
    \ combined with a cloud environment comprised of four layers: data collection,\n\
    edge computing, data transmission, and cloud computing layer [58]. A scalable\
    \ network-\nbased architecture was proposed to monitor and regulate agricultural\
    \ farms in rural areas\nusing IoT-based wiﬁ, long-distance network, and fog computing\
    \ [59]. Agricultural data\nanalytics employed with IoT has transformed from speciﬁc\
    \ crops to any kind of crop. The\ndeveloped system could support various applications,\
    \ from controlling and monitoring the\ncrops to promoting them to market [60].\n\
    Literacy is the ability to read and write simple statements [61]. Illiteracy,\
    \ low education,\nand computer illiteracy are signiﬁcant concerns in developing\
    \ countries like Pakistan.\nStudies indicate that user interface (UI) would be\
    \ designed differently for literate, low-\nliterate, and illiterate users. A user\
    \ interface should also consider the cultural context, such\nas language and images.\
    \ The non-textual interface is more user-friendly than the textual\none for illiterate\
    \ users [62].\nThe inability to read and write and the illiteracy of small farmers\
    \ make them vulnerable\nto various workers and cause human health risks [63].\
    \ Previous research inferred that\ncomplex hierarchy and multi-screens become\
    \ difﬁcult for low-literates to understand\nhelpful information, so the visuals,\
    \ audio, video, speech, icons, and images are a better\napproach to passing complex\
    \ data and information to mobile users [64]. The research\nﬁndings shed light\
    \ on some user interface (UI) design guidelines for illiterate and semi-\nliterate\
    \ users that can help take advantage of information and communication technologies\n\
    ICT [51]. The most powerful design factors that should be incorporated into a\
    \ user interface\n(UI) for low-literate users are localization and graphics [65].\
    \ An android application with\naudio, textual, and visual components was designed\
    \ for farmers with diverse literacy\nlevels. It could facilitate them regarding\
    \ vital weather information [45]. Pakistani farmers\ntypically rely on traditional\
    \ sources of information, which could be a reason for their\ninformation deﬁciency.\
    \ Data analysis indicated that farmers had diverse demographic\nconditions, but\
    \ primary among them is the ordinary level of education (52.4% illiterate).\n\
    A high level of information deﬁciency was observed among farmers regarding fertilizers\n\
    application, seed rate, disease diagnosis, pests, and insects’ identiﬁcation,\
    \ and a medium\nlevel of lack in information regarding the selection of varieties,\
    \ harvesting, and pets’\nmanagement was observed [66]. Providing information access\
    \ to low-literate, linguistic\nminority, tech-shy, handicapped and marginalized\
    \ users using speech-based services is a\nviable solution. These services were\
    \ made the national weather hotline of Pakistan [50]. A\nsurvey data revealed\
    \ that farmers in the Vehari district of Pakistan have a low literary rate\nand\
    \ less technical knowledge. They are unable to read agricultural instructions,\
    \ unaware\nof pesticides persistence and toxicity (73%), unable to diagnose cotton\
    \ pests and diseases\n(86%), and unable to decide which crop to grow on cotton\
    \ adjacent farms (100%) [67]. The\nresearch was conducted to study knowledge,\
    \ attitude, and practices regarding pesticide\nusage by vegetable growers in three\
    \ districts; Dadu, Larkana, and Shikarpur of Sindh,\nPakistan. Results show that\
    \ most vegetable growers (40.90%) have low primary education\nliteracy, and 27.27%\
    \ possess a middle pass. That’s why most growers are unfamiliar with\npest and\
    \ insect damage indications and the safe handling of pesticides [68]. Pakistani\n\
    farmers’ awareness of the damaging effects of different pesticides can lead to\
    \ integrated\nand smart pest control and management [69]. Research ﬁndings reﬂect\
    \ farmers’ behavior\nand a low tendency towards reading the labels of the pesticides\
    \ due to low education,\nadvanced age, usage of too technical language, illegible\
    \ fonts, and unclear texts [70]. In [71],\nthe authors developed a basic interactive\
    \ voice response (IVR) system for agro-information\ndissemination, such as fertilizer,\
    \ pesticide information, and weather forecast. In terms\nof usability and information\
    \ extraction, their study reﬂected that simple menu-based\nnavigation interfaces\
    \ are relatively easy to use and understand.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n4 of\
    \ 23\nA remote agricultural monitoring platform was proposed in [72] after a detailed\n\
    literature study. Cyber security-based precision farming conceptual architecture\
    \ was\npresented in [73] for the frost prediction in peach production by analyzing\
    \ data captured\nby sensors implanted around an orchard. IoT-based precision farming\
    \ comprises multiple\ncontrol and monitoring applications like monitoring water\
    \ needs according to climate\nconditions, analyzing soil patterns, monitoring\
    \ crops disease and pest attacks, and assessing\noptimum time for planting, harvesting,\
    \ and tracking [74,75].\nAquaAgro offers IoT and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) enabled\
    \ solutions for precision\nfarming. Using a software or app embedded hardware,\
    \ the predictions will be made for\nthe Irrigation scheduling, Fertilizer requirement,\
    \ Pest attack prediction, and Plant disease\ndetection. The essential four services\
    \ that AquaAgro provides are irrigation scheduling,\nFertilizer requirement, Pest\
    \ attack prediction, and Plant disease detection. They have\nreceived an overwhelming\
    \ response from the people [76]. An android mobile application\nnamed ‘Mentha\
    \ Mitra’ was developed with an interactive interface with bilingual (Hindi\nand\
    \ English) for menthol mint growers [77]. Android application provides scientiﬁc\
    \ e-\nadvisories on crop-related diseases, high-yield varieties, pests, insects,\
    \ and improved\ndistillation units.\nAn IoT-based wireless sensor network (WSN)\
    \ framework was proposed to monitor\ncrops smartly by analyzing environmental\
    \ factors [78]. In [79], the authors utilized the\nbeneﬁts of IoT for the implementation\
    \ of precision agriculture by sensing required param-\neters from the ﬁeld and\
    \ making suitable decisions such as activation and deactivation of\nirrigation\
    \ valves. Parameters include soil moisture, temperature and light intensity, etc.\n\
    Sensors could also send the gathered data to the cloud, and an Android application\
    \ was\ndeveloped to access these parameters. An expert IoT-based system relies\
    \ on the stored\nknowledge base and real-time data for farmer recommendations\
    \ [80]. This system will help\nin proactive and reactive tasks to a minimum the\
    \ loss of water. Farooq et al. [81] performed\na comprehensive literature study\
    \ on state-of-the-art techniques in smart farming. They\ndiscussed agriculture\
    \ networks, platforms, architecture, and topologies to help farmers\nto enhance\
    \ the corps’ productivity. This survey paper shows that Government and many\n\
    other stakeholders are interested in deploying IoT in Pakistan’s agriculture ﬁeld.\
    \ To in-\ncrease agricultural productivity, the authors suggested that collaboration\
    \ between allied\nand agriculture activities can be built by integrating big data\
    \ into climate-smart agriculture\nwith resource utilization [82].\nIn [83], the\
    \ authors are more concerned about the water supply to the plants. They\nproposed\
    \ a system in which a farmer can water the plants with a push of a button on his\n\
    phone when he is out of the station. Machine learning algorithms and radio frequency\n\
    identiﬁcation (RFID) tags detect and measure moisture and humidity. Internationally,\n\
    many studies [12,84–86] have been conducted to improve agricultural processes\
    \ based on\nsoil fertility level, crops, weather patterns, and fertilizers. These\
    \ studies used IoT, Global\nPosition Systems (GPS), Global information systems\
    \ (GIS), Wireless Sensor Networks\n(WSN), and many machine learning techniques.\
    \ The implementation of studies results in\nincreased proﬁtability and self-sufﬁciency.\
    \ IoT enabled decision support systems based on\nreal-time farm sensors data,\
    \ improving the water consumption by crops [87–89]. Authors\nin [90] provided\
    \ the real-time farm data, weather, and crops data to a Penman-Monteith\nand crop-coefﬁcient\
    \ model to produce recommendations about irrigation schedules. An\nintelligent\
    \ approach for diagnosing crop disease was proposed in [91], capable of working\n\
    with android devices equipped with fuzzy decision-making at the backend. The system\n\
    interacts with farmers in their native language of Urdu for crop disease diagnosing.\
    \ ‘Padi2U’\nis an android application developed for farmers to manage paddy ﬁelds.\
    \ It provides\nguidelines related to paddy varieties, planting schedule, pest,\
    \ disease, weed, weather\nforecast, and yield information in their native language\
    \ ‘Malay’ [92]. In [93], the authors\ndeveloped an application named ‘BLYNK’ to\
    \ control the IoT-based hardware remotely. The\npurpose of ‘BLYNK’ was to automate\
    \ irrigation and fertilizer supply to farms. Their results\nreﬂect approximately\
    \ 50% water saving and a 35% increase in yield. Irrigation monitoring\nAgriculture\
    \ 2022, 12, 1277\n5 of 23\nand automatic control systems were developed using\
    \ fuzzy decision support to generate a\nmoisture content distribution map of soil\
    \ and enhance affectivity [53,94–98].\nSoil having an essential quantity of macro\
    \ and micro-nutrients would be capable of\ncultivating different crops. The soil’s\
    \ lack of signiﬁcant nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus,\nand Potassium) declines\
    \ crops’ cultivation, growth, and yield. To increase crop production,\nthe suitability\
    \ of a speciﬁc crop to be planted can be recommended by exploiting the soil’s\n\
    macronutrients [99–103]. Soil pH level is the major parameter for measuring soil\
    \ macronu-\ntrients (N, P, and K) and some of the micronutrients [104–108]. Smart\
    \ agro farms [109] use\nsolar power and a low-cost smart system, a perfect combination\
    \ of IoT, data mining, and\nAndroid application. The system monitors and extracts\
    \ a farm’s environmental factors\nsuch as soil moisture, humidity, and weather\
    \ and temperature parameters via data mining\nmodules, and provides optimized\
    \ guidance regarding crop cultivation, irrigation, and\nweather forecast in the\
    \ English language.\n1.2. Objectives and Hypotheses\nThe proposed system obtains\
    \ agricultural data through implanted IoT sensors, such\nas pH, soil moisture,\
    \ humidity, and temperature. The Internet plays a mediatory role in\ncommunication\
    \ and data exchange. We integrated agricultural data acquired from im-\nplanted\
    \ IoT devices with the cloud platform. Data is processed in a decision-making\
    \ system\nbased on learning prediction rules in conjunction with a rule-based\
    \ engine. Generally, a\nfarmer requires guidelines, even from the crop selection\
    \ phase to the harvesting stage. As\npresented in Figure 1, to facilitate low\
    \ literate farmers at each of these steps in their native\nlanguage, we performed\
    \ the following research objectives:\n•\nInvestigated traditional techniques and\
    \ systems with different agricultural interfaces\nto ﬁnd a research gap.\n•\n\
    Design and develop an interface in an easy-to-use format and Urdu for low-literate\n\
    farmers to facilitate their awareness and guidelines in their native language.\n\
    •\nDesign and develop a mechanism for measuring soil fertility of speciﬁc land\
    \ to recom-\nmend suitable crops according to soil fertility using fuzzy logic.\n\
    •\nProvide crops cultivation schedule, crop harvest schedule, automated irrigation\
    \ pro-\ncess, and watering guidelines to farmers.\n•\nFacilitate farmers concerning\
    \ guidelines for weeds and their eradication, pest attacks,\nand awareness of\
    \ best pesticides, crop diseases, and suitable fertilizers.\nAgriculture 2022,\

    \ most farmers are unfamiliar with the latest practices of\nagriculture as they\
    \ are not facilitated with new technologies to access agricultural information\n\
    and thus rely on traditional methods to grow their crops. Related studies indicate\
    \ that there is\nno such smart system providing an interactive interface to a\
    \ low literate or illiterate farmer\nand guidelines from the crop selection phase\
    \ to the harvesting stage. Significant barriers to\naccessing modern information\
    \ systems are the low literacy of farmers, the non-availability of\nlocal-language\
    \ information systems, and systems with fewer features. Our research identified\n\
    that it is essential to equip rural and semi-literate or illiterate farmers with\
    \ updated information\nthrough ICT, IoT, Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, and\
    \ Machine learning techniques, and\nprovide them guidance in almost every phase\
    \ of the crop cycle. It is necessary to develop\nUrdu-language-based information\
    \ smart systems to enhance farmers’ comprehension, crop\nproduction, and sustainable\
    \ agriculture.\nProposed System Design and Architecture\nThe overall design and\
    \ architecture of the solution proposed to cover smart agriculture\nare depicted\
    \ in Figure 2. It comprises three layers: crop (edge) layer, fog computing layer,\n\
    data analytics, and smart management at the cloud layer. The edge and cloud layers\
    \ are\ndesigned to be deployed respectively at local crop premises and remote\
    \ data servers. The\nintermediate fog computing layer comprises a set of virtualized\
    \ control modules in the form\nof Network Function Virtualization (NFV) nodes\
    \ that can be initiated along the network path\nfrom the farm facilities to the\
    \ cloud layer. NFV is a way to virtualize network services, for\nexample, firewalls,\
    \ routers, and load balancers that have traditionally been run on proprietary\n\
    hardware. The intermediate fog layer increases the versatility of deployed solutions\
    \ and\nconnectivity performances with the edge layer. At the crop premises, suitable\
    \ sensors like\nhumidity, temperature, soil moisture sensor, light intensity,\
    \ pH sensor, and actuators like\nwater pumps, valves, and activation of devices\
    \ for smart farming automation are deployed\nand connected with wireless nodes\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Sensors’ data is captured at the edge\nlayer through wireless\
    \ nodes and transmitted to the fog layer. This layered architecture lets\natomic\
    \ operations requiring high reliability and low latency between sensors and actuators\n\

    \ specific time\ninterval. The fog layer subsystem comprises the farm’s operative\
    \ control like irrigation,\nfarm monitoring, energy management, etc. The fog layer\
    \ is responsible for data fusion and\naggregation to offload analytics functions\
    \ that are usually performed. The fog layer control\nmodules are virtualized through\
    \ NFV techniques that communicate with edge nodes via IoT\nprotocols like constrained\
    \ application protocol (CoAP) and MQ telemetry transport (MQTT).\nAs depicted\

    \ via actuators. Our\nsystem provides access to an Android application for farmer\
    \ facilitation with the following\nmain features.\n3.1.1. Soil Nutrient Analysis\n\
    With increased emphasis on precision agriculture, economics, and the environment,\n\
    soil analysis is a tool to determine areas where adequate and excessive fertilization\
    \ has\noccurred.\nSoil analysis is also used to monitor past fertility practices\
    \ to changes in\na ﬁeld’s nutrient status.\nNutrient availability can be impacted\
    \ by soil chemical and\nphysical properties.\nIn determining soil nutrient contents,\
    \ soil pH analysis is one parameter. Soil pH refers\nto the acidity and alkalinity\
    \ of soil measured on a logarithmic scale; thus decrease in 1 unit\nof pH value\
    \ causes an increase in acidity by a factor of 10. Small changes in pH values\
    \ have\nsigniﬁcant consequences. Table 1 represents the range values deﬁned for\
    \ soil pH.\nTable 1. Soil pH range values.\npH Level\nRange Values\n<3.5\nUltra-Acidic\n\
    3.6–3.9\nExtremely Acidic\n4–5.5\nStrong acidic\n5.6–6\nMedium acidic\n6.1–6.5\n\
    Slightly acidic\n6.6–7\nVery Slightly acidic\n7.1–7.5\nVery Slightly alkaline\n\
    7.6–8\nSlightly alkaline\n8.1–8.5\nMedium alkaline\n8.6–10\nStrongly alkaline\n\
    Measuring the acidity and alkalinity of soil is essential for analyzing the number\
    \ of\nmacro-nutrients present in the soil, particularly nitrogen (N), potassium\
    \ (K), and phospho-\nrus (P). Crops need these macro-nutrients in their growth,\
    \ thrive, and combat diseases.\nRemoval of bases from the soil due to harvested\
    \ crops, leaching, and acidic residual left in\nsoil due to fertilizers causes\
    \ an increase in acidity of the soil. Soil acidity affects crops and\nplants in\
    \ many ways, such as whether the surface pH is very high or too low, when the\n\
    efﬁcacy of herbicides and chemical reactions may be affected. Soil analysis is\
    \ the best way\nto check pH levels, and maintaining at least a pH of 6.0 is a\
    \ realistic goal. When soil pH is\nvery low (acidity is high) following conditions\
    \ occur:\n•\nSoluble metals, especially Manganese and Aluminum, may be toxic.\n\
    •\nThe population of organisms and their activities accountable for transforming\
    \ N, P,\nand S to plant-available forms may be reduced.\n•\nDeﬁciency of Calcium.\
    \ The soil’s cation exchange capacity (CEC) is low.\n•\nSymbiotic N ﬁxation in\
    \ legume crops is signiﬁcantly impaired. The symbiotic asso-\nciation entails\
    \ a narrower range of soil reactions than does the growth of plants not\nrelying\
    \ on ‘N’ ﬁxation.\n•\nAcidic soil with less organic matter is poorly aggregated\
    \ and has poor tilt.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, 1277\n8 of 23\n•\nThe availability\
    \ of mineral elements in soil may be affected. Association between soil\npH and\
    \ nutrient availability to plants can be depicted in Figure 3. The wider the blue\n\
    bar, the greater the nutrient availability. For example, for a pH range of 5.5–7.5,\
    \ the\navailability of P is highest and drops below 5.5. If the soil pH is 6,\
    \ an amount of P\napplied to it will be more available than if the same amount\
    \ is used in soil with a pH\nless than 5.5. Soil with high pH (>7.4) reduces several\
    \ nutrients such as Fe, Mn, Zn,\nand P, which is not economical for growing agronomic\
    \ crops.\nAgriculture 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n9 of 24 \n \n \nFigure 3.\

    \  \nMacronutrients are essential for plant growth and an excellent overall plant\
    \ state. The \nprimary macronutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium\
    \ (K). Nitrogen is \na principal constituent of several essential plant substances\
    \ necessary for plant develop-\nment, energy metabolism, and protein synthesis.\

    \ It is necessary to ensure its sustainable growth\nover the years. We studied\
    \ traditional trends followed by farmers and investigated why\nproductivity lags.\
    \ The key barriers are information inadequacies, lack of information\nsystems\
    \ for illiterates or less-literates, and lack of a system that provides guidance\
    \ at\nevery stage of the crop cycle. This study was carried out to provide a smart\
    \ advisory\nsystem for illiterate and semi-literate farmers of Pakistan that could\
    \ provide them guidance\nfrom crop selection to the harvest stage phase. In this\
    \ research work, we built a cost-\neffective smart system equipped with multiple\
    \ sensors and devices related to the internet\nof things (IoT) technologies. We\
    \ also developed an android application named ‘Kistan\nPakistan’ that allows illiterate\
    \ and low-literate farmers to manage their farms remotely. The\ninterface of the\
    \ android application is interactive due to its visual, audio, voice, and iconic\n\
    components. The proposed solution is applicable globally as all information and\
    \ guidelines\nare disseminated in both the ‘Urdu’ and ‘English’ languages. Edge-cloud\
    \ computing\ndelivers more accurate guidelines in less time and in almost every\
    \ phase of the agricultural\ncycle, increasing productivity and making the agricultural\
    \ ecosystem more robust. We\nexperimented on a small-scale farm, but the results\
    \ reﬂect that it will be efﬁcient for medium\nto large-scale ﬁelds.\nAuthor Contributions:\

  title: 'IoAT Enabled Smart Farming: Urdu Language-Based Solution for Low-Literate
    Farmers'
  verbatim_quote1: "\"The proposed system obtains agricultural data through implanted\
    \ IoT sensors, such as pH, soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.\" The Internet\
    \ plays a mediatory role in\ncommunication and data exchange. We integrated agricultural\
    \ data acquired from im-\nplanted IoT devices with the cloud platform. Data is\
    \ processed in a decision-making system\nbased on learning prediction rules in\
    \ conjunction with a rule-based engine. Generally, a\nfarmer requires guidelines,\
    \ even from the crop selection phase to the harvesting stage. As\npresented in\

  analysis: The paper entitled "SIMETAW# - a Model for Agricultural Water Demand Planning"
    presents the SIMETAW# model for simulating evapotranspiration of applied water
    using the soil water balance method. The model is flexible and can simulate water
    balance in full irrigation, deficit irrigation, and rain-fed crops. It is also
    capable of accounting for climate change impacts. The paper evaluates the model's
    performance in estimating crop water requirements and evapotranspiration of applied
    water for three different crops and concludes that the model can be used efficiently
    to evaluate different irrigation strategies.

    water management scheme for irrigated crops requires an integrated approach, which
    accounts for water, soil, and crop management. SIMETAW# is a user friendly soil
    water balance model that assesses crop water use, irrigation requirements, and
    generates hypothetical irrigation schedules for a wide range of crops experiencing
    full or deficit irrigation. SIMETAW# calculates reference evapotranspiration (ETo),
    and it computes potential crop evapotranspiration (ETc), and the evapotranspiration
    of applied water (ETaw), which is the amount of irrigation water needed to match
    losses from the effective soil root zone due to ETc that are not replaced by precipitation
    and other sources. Using input information on crop and soil characteristics and
    the distribution uniformity of infiltrated irrigation applications in full or
    deficit conditions, the model estimates the mean depth of infiltrated water (IW)
    into each quarter of the field. The impact of deficit irrigation on the actual
    crop evapotranspiration (ETa) is computed separately for each of the four quarters
    of the cropped field. SIMETAW# simulation adjusts ETo estimates for projected
    future CO2 concentration, and hence the model can assess climate change impacts
    on future irrigation demand allowing the user to propose adaptation strategies
    that potentially lead to a more sustainable water use. This paper discusses the
    SIMETAW# model and evaluates its performance on estimating ETc, ETa, and ETaw

    impacts of precision irrigation on crop yield and in-field water management Article
    Open access 29 August 2017 1 Introduction Agriculture is vulnerable to weather
    conditions and future climate change can be detrimental (Jiménez Cisneros et al.
    2014). Especially in those areas already affected by water scarcity, the need
    for more water resources could grow, and increasing water scarcity will necessitate
    a more sustainable approach to water resource management. An accurate computation
    of the seasonal crop water requirement (CWR) is important for water resource planning,
    and the assessment of the evapotranspiration of applied water (ETaw) is even more
    important for developing crop management strategies that are economically convenient
    in terms of water usage, crop yield, and profits. The CWR is the amount of water
    that a crop needs for optimal production, which was defined by Doorenbos and Pruitt
    (1977) as the volume of water needed to meet the water loss from the root zone
    through evapotranspiration, whereas the ETaw is the volume of required irrigation
    water to infiltrate into the quarter of the cropped field receiving the least
    amount of water to achieve optimal production. Water shortages are common in the
    State of California, and in the early 2000s, this led the University of California,
    Davis (UCD) and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to develop
    the Simulation of Evapotranspiration of Applied Water (SIMETAW) application program
    (Snyder et al. 2004; Snyder et al. 2012a), which is a user friendly soil water
    balance model that is able to estimate the CWR, generate hypothetical irrigation
    schedules for a wide range of irrigated crops, and output ETaw for use in water
    resources planning. The SIMETAW application is used to assess the ETaw of crops
    in a microclimate area having approximately the same evaporative demand over the
    entire region. Later, a program to apply SIMETAW to all microclimatic regions
    in California, i.e., Cal-SIMETAW, was developed (Orang et al. 2013). While SIMETAW
    and Cal-SIMETAW are useful for irrigation planning in California, where adequate
    water supplies are available in most years, it is likely that water deficit will
    occur in the future. Also, deficit irrigation is common in many arid and semi-arid
    climates and rain-fed agriculture is common in many developing counties. Consequently,
    the SIMETAW model was modified and renamed “SIMETAW#” in collaboration with the
    University of Sassari (Italy). The improvements include revised crop coefficient
    (Kc) values to ETc, and stress coefficient (Ks) values to account for water deficit
    effects on evapotranspiration and yield. In addition, SIMETAW# corrects midseason
    Kc values for the effect of climate, which was not included in SIMETAW or Cal-SIMETAW.
    SIMETAW# also addresses the impact of rising CO2 concentration on reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo), so it is useful for planning responses to climate change. The earlier models
    stopped with the calculation of ETaw, and the seasonal irrigation water diversion
    was calculated separately. The ability to compute the seasonal water diversions
    for irrigation based on the distribution uniformity fraction (Du) of the irrigation
    systems and estimated surface runoff (Roff) was added to SIMETAW#. The ETaw, or
    irrigation requirement, represents the portion of CWR that is supplied by irrigation
    and not by water tables, effective precipitation, i.e., rainfall, dew, and fog
    (Moratiel et al. 2013), and the reduction in water storage in the crop root zone
    from pre- to post-season. Determining ETaw requires a daily water balance throughout
    the season to estimate effective precipitation, contributions from water tables,
    and the change in soil water content during the season. In SIMETAW#, the ETaw
    is calculated as the sum of the mean depth of water infiltrating into the low
    quarter of the irrigated field, but ETaw is also equal to the difference between
    the seasonal CWR and sources of water other than irrigation. For the irrigated
    crop, the mean depth of infiltrated water (IW) over the field is calculated as
    the quotient of ETaw and the Du. Then, the gross application (GA), or diverted
    irrigation water, is calculated as the sum of the IW and Roff, if any. Using this
    approach results in a net application (NA) depth that matches the mean infiltration
    of water into the low quarter of the soil. When adequate water is available, the
    NA should return the soil water content in the low quarter back to near field
    capacity. The remaining 75 % of the cropped soil infiltrates more water than needed
    to refill to field capacity, and the excess water mainly contributes to deep percolation
    of water below the rooting zone. For most crops, this approach to scheduling is
    likely to result in the highest productivity. This paper discusses the processes
    and features of the SIMETAW# model, assesses its potential applications, and reports
    on its performance. 2 The SIMETAW# Model Description In SIMETAW#, ETaw (mm) is
    determined as the sum of the net irrigation applications, but it can also be estimated
    as the seasonal cumulative total of daily crop evapotranspiration (CETc, mm) minus
    effective rainfall during the season, as well as the decrease in soil water content
    from the beginning to the end of the season, and any contributions to ETc (mm)
    coming from fog, dew, light rainfall, and water tables. Crop and soil characteristics,
    climate data, water contributions from all sources, and irrigation system distribution
    uniformities are the basic inputs needed to compute ETaw. 2.1 Climate Input Data
    and ETo Computations SIMETAW# computes ETo (mm d−1) using the daily (24-h) standardized
    reference evapotranspiration equation for short canopies (Allen et al. 1998; Allen
    et al. 2005b, 2006). At the time when the Penman-Monteith equation (Monteith 1965)
    was developed, the global CO2 concentration was about 372 ppm and it is projected
    to reach about 550 ppm by 2050 and more than 800 ppm by 2100 considering the most
    critical CO2 concentration pathway scenario (IPCC 2013). Studies have shown that
    the stomatal conductance (gs, mm s−1) of many C3 plants decrease by about 20 %
    when the CO2 concentration increases from 372 to about 550 ppm (Drake et al. 1997;
    Long et al. 2004; Ainsworth and Long 2005). Therefore, if the CO2 concentration
    changes from 372 to 550 ppm, the stomatal conductance of 0.12 m tall C3 species
    grass with a stomatal resistance (rs) of 100 s m−1 should decrease from about
    10 mm s−1 to 8 mm s−1. Assuming the relationship remains linear beyond the 550
    ppm concentration, Snyder et al. (2011) expressed the canopy resistance (rc, s
    m−1) as a function of CO2 concentration (ppm) as: $$ {\mathrm{r}}_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{1000}{1.44\left(14.18-0.0112\kern0.5em
    {\mathrm{CO}}_2\right)} $$ (1) This equation is used in SIMETAW# to adjust the
    canopy resistance for the effect of projected CO2 concentration. 2.2 Crop-Soil
    Input Data Soil characteristics and crop-irrigation management practices are input
    to the model to calculate the soil water balance and determine hypothetical irrigation
    schedules. The SIMETAW# model follows the basic soil water balance concepts as
    described in Snyder et al. (2012a) and Orang et al. (2013). The potential crop
    rooting depth (mm), the allowable depletion (AD, %) of available water, and the
    volumetric available water holding capacity (θA, mm mm−1) are input or selected
    and used to determine the plant available water (PAW, mm) within the soil rooting
    depth. There is a 50 % default value for AD which is widely used for many field
    and horticultural crops, but it can be overridden. A user can select whether to
    use only precipitation, deficit irrigation, or full irrigation. Default values
    for application rate (AR, mm h−1) and Du of infiltrated water (Center for Irrigation
    Technology 2011) are included in the program. 2.3 Crop Coefficient Values and
    Corrections In SIMETAW#, the seasonal crop coefficient trends are determined following
    a similar approach as was presented in Doorenbos and Pruitt (1977) and Allen et
    al. (1998). Default crop coefficient values are included in SIMETAW# using information
    provided by the FAO 24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt 1977), FAO 56 (Allen et al. 1998),
    and several recent papers. The SIMETAW# Kc method differs from the FAO methods
    in that the ends of the growth periods are identified as a percentage of the length
    of the season (Snyder et al. 2012a), whereas FAO uses estimates of the number
    of days within each growth periods to identify the end points. The advantage from
    using the percentages is that the number of days within growth periods is unknown
    for many crops and regions, and growers often have little or no information to
    identify when the trend changes from the midseason to late-season period. Initially,
    SIMETAW# extracts the tabular midseason Kc values from data stored in the program.
    Midseason Kc values, however, are known to vary depending on the climate (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt 1977; Allen et al. 2005a), so a climate correction was included. The
    climate correction equation is: $$ {\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{cmid}}={\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{ctab}}+0.261\left({\mathrm{ET}}_{\mathrm{o}}-7.3\right)\left({\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{ctab}}-1\right)
    $$ (2) where Kcmid is the corrected midseason crop coefficient and Kctab is the
    tabular midseason Kc value that is expected during midseason in a climate with
    ETo = 7.3 mm d−1 (Guerra et al. 2014). The SIMETAW# model also has corrections
    to determine the Kc values for immature trees and vines as percentage shading
    of the ground in relation to the growth date, and it has corrections for cover
    crops between the rows of orchards and vineyards as described in Snyder et al.
    (2012a). 2.4 Crop Evapotranspiration During the off-season and the initial-growth
    period, the SIMETAW# model estimates ETc as the product of ETo and Ke, which is
    the bare soil evaporation coefficient (Snyder et al. 2012a). Afterwards, based
    on crop data input, soil, and irrigation information, a Kc curve from the beginning
    of rapid growth to the end of late season is determined, and the daily crop evapotranspiration
    is calculated as the product of ETo and Kc. 2.5 Water Balance Calculations The
    SIMETAW# model computes the daily soil water balance for major crops. Because
    the soil water balance is calculated each day, rainfall runoff is ignored. The
    assumption is that storms with sufficiently heavy precipitation to have runoff
    are also likely to recharge the soil water content to field capacity after a heavy
    rainfall. The soil water depletion (SWD, mm) is updated daily using: $$ {\mathrm{SWD}}_{\mathrm{i}}={\mathrm{SWD}}_{\mathrm{i}-1}+{\mathrm{ET}}_{\mathrm{ci}}+{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{cpi}}+{\mathrm{C}}_{\mathrm{i}}-{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{i}}-{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{offi}}+{\mathrm{I}}_{\mathrm{i}}
    $$ (3) The variable ETc is the potential crop ET, Pcp is precipitation, C is capillary
    rise from water tables, D is deep percolation below the root zone, Roff is runoff,
    I is irrigation depth, the subscripts i and i-1 represent the current and previous
    day, respectively, and all units are in mm. In the model the SWDi is defined as
    θfc-θi, where θfc and θi are the soil water holding contents at field capacity
    and on the ith day (mm mm−1), respectively. For deficit irrigated crops, ETa is
    substituted for ETc in Eq. 3. Any in-season Pcp that is stored in the root zone
    and potentially contributes to evapotranspiration is called effective rainfall
    (Re). If rainfall occurs and the Pcp exceeds the SWD, the Re = SWD and the soil
    returns to field capacity. If the Pcp event does not exceed the SWD, the Re =
    Pcp and the SWD is reduced by an amount equal to the Re. Identifying the net irrigation
    application (NAc, mm) for a well-watered crop is the first step for the water
    balance computation. The NAc is estimated at the beginning of midseason (date
    C) as: $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_{\mathrm{c}}=\left(1-{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{off}}\right)\cdot
    \mathrm{R}\mathrm{T}\cdot \mathrm{A}\mathrm{R}\cdot {\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{u}}
    $$ (4) where RT is the irrigation system runtime (hh). During initial-growth (from
    date A to B), the NAc depends on the mean ETo rate, the crop coefficient for bare
    and nearly bare soil (Ke), and the days between irrigation. The Ke values were
    determined using the method of Ventura et al. (2006) with a typical soil hydraulic
    factor 2.6, mean daily ETo rates ranging from 1 to 10 mm d−1, and wetting frequencies
    of 2, 4, 7, 10, and 20 days. The equation for Ke based on the cumulative ETo (CETo,
    mm) is: $$ {\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{e}}=\frac{2.54}{\sqrt{\mathrm{CE}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{o}}}}
    $$ (5) Assuming that the ETc during initial-growth, i.e., with ground shading
    less than 10 %, is nearly equivalent to the evaporation from bare soil, the NAc
    during initial-growth is estimated as: $$ {\mathrm{NA}}_{\mathrm{c}}=\overline{{\mathrm{ET}}_{\mathrm{o}}}\cdot
    {\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{e}}\cdot {\mathrm{d}}_{\mathrm{e}} $$ (6) where de is the
    number of days from one irrigation to the next during initial-growth, and \( \overline{\mathrm{E}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{o}}}
    \)(mm) is the mean daily ETo rate during initial-growth. One option in SIMETAW#
    is to select if a crop is pre-irrigated or not. If a crop is pre-irrigated, then
    the SWD is set equal to zero on the day preceding the season. If it is not pre-irrigated,
    then the SWD on the day preceding the season is determined by the soil water balance
    during the off-season before planting or leaf-out. Some crops are frequently irrigated
    with sprinklers during the initial-growth period, and the irrigation frequency
    and mean ETo rate affect the initial-growth crop coefficient as was discussed
    earlier. Following the initial-growth period, irrigation events occur whenever
    the SWD reaches the “management allowable depletion” (MAD, mm). This approach
    forces the soil water depletion to generally fall between the yield threshold
    depletion (YTD, mm) and the permanent wilting point (PWP, mm) at the end of the
    season. A pressurized irrigation system normally maintains similar distribution
    uniformity regardless of the water amount applied, so during deficit water conditions,
    the best management practice is to maintain the same irrigation timing and reduce
    the depth applied for each irrigation event. Deficit irrigation will generally
    increase the application efficiency because less applied water goes to deep percolation
    and runoff. However, this may be untrue for surface irrigation if insufficient
    water is applied to obtain an even infiltration. SIMETAW# keeps the same irrigation
    dates for full and deficit irrigations, but less irrigation water is applied at
    each irrigation event. To do this, the program first calculates a schedule assuming
    there is adequate water available to avoid water stress. In this process, the
    model ‘estimates’ the ETaw for a well-watered crop (ETawe, mm) considering CETc
    during the season, (i.e., from growth date A to E for field crops or date B to
    E for orchard and vine crops) as: $$ {\mathrm{ET}}_{\mathrm{awe}}={\mathrm{CET}}_{\mathrm{c}}-\left({\mathrm{YT}\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{c}}-\frac{\mathrm{YT}{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{os}}}{2}\right)
    $$ (7) where YTDc and YTDos (mm) are the maximum yield threshold depletion estimates
    during midseason and off-season, respectively. During the off-season, it is assumed
    that only half of the PAW in the top 0.30 m of soil can be depleted, so the YTDos
    is estimated as the product of the θA and 300 mm. Because the seasonal water balance
    is unknown prior to the end of the season, it is impossible to determine the real
    ETaw until the seasonal soil water balance is computed. However, Eq. 7 provides
    an early estimate for ETaw assuming that there is little effective rainfall and
    the soil is fairly dry at the end of the season. The ideal number of irrigation
    events (Nic) for a fully irrigated field is computed as: $$ {\mathrm{N}}_{\mathrm{ic}}=\frac{\mathrm{E}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{awe}}}{{\mathrm{MAD}}_{\mathrm{c}}}
    $$ (8) where the MADc (mm) is the management allowable depletion for a well-watered
    crop during the midseason period, which is equal to NAc. Since water application
    to a cropped field is non-uniform, the SIMETAW# program divides the field into
    four quarters. The low (1st) quarter application is the mean depth of water applied
    to the one quarter of the field receiving the least amount of water. The high
    (4th) quarter application is the mean depth of water applied to the one quarter
    of the field receiving the most water, and the 2nd and 3rd quarters are the mean
    depths of water applied to the intermediate quarters of the field. After computing
    the MADc and Nic, the program calculates the soil water balance for a well-watered
    crop and the ETaw as: $$ {\mathrm{ET}}_{\mathrm{aw}}=\sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^{\mathrm{n}}{\mathrm{NA}}_{\mathrm{c},\mathrm{i}}
    $$ (9) for i = 1 to n, where n is the number of irrigation events and NAc,i (mm)
    is the net application or mean depth of water infiltrated into the low quarter
    on the ith day. Therefore, ETaw is equivalent to the seasonal mean depth of irrigation
    water infiltrated into the low quarter. Typical values for Du and Roff values
    are used to estimate the seasonal sum of gross application amounts (applied water)
    for the fully watered crop from the ETaw as: $$ \sum {\mathrm{GA}}_{\mathrm{c}}=\frac{\mathrm{E}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{aw}}}{{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{u}}}/\left(1-\frac{{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{off}}}{100}\right)=\frac{{\displaystyle
    \varSigma {\mathrm{NA}}_{\mathrm{c}}}}{{\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{u}}}/\left(1-\frac{{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{off}}}{100}\right)
    $$ (10) where Roff is the percentage of ΣGAc (mm) that contributes to runoff.
    For well-designed sprinkler, drip, and micro-sprinkler systems, the Roff should
    equal zero. The water allocation (WA, mm) is the mean depth of water that is available
    for the irrigation during a season. It is computed from the depths of infiltrated
    water (IW, mm) to the four quarters (IW1, IW2, IW3, and IW4): $$ \mathrm{W}\mathrm{A}=\frac{\mathrm{I}{\mathrm{W}}_1+{\mathrm{I}\mathrm{W}}_2+{\mathrm{I}\mathrm{W}}_3+{\mathrm{I}\mathrm{W}}_4}{4}=\sum
    {\mathrm{GA}}_{\mathrm{c}}\left(\frac{\mathrm{PIR}}{100}\right) $$ (11) where
    PIR is the percentage of the full irrigation requirement for the crop that is
    allocated for the cropping season. The user can set PIR = 100 for full irrigation,
    PIR < 100 % for water deficit conditions, and PIR = 0 for rain-fed crops. The
    low quarter mean depth applied is computed as: $$ {\mathrm{IW}}_1=\mathrm{W}\mathrm{A}\cdot
    {\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{u}} $$ (12) The high (4th) quarter mean depth applied is
    computed as: $$ {\mathrm{IW}}_4=\mathrm{W}\mathrm{A}+\left(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{A}-{\mathrm{IW}}_1\right)
    $$ (13) The 2nd quarter mean depth applied is equal to the sum of IW1 and 1/3
    of the difference between the high and low quarter mean depths applied, so: $$
    {\mathrm{IW}}_2={\mathrm{IW}}_1+1/3\left({\mathrm{IW}}_4-{\mathrm{IW}}_1\right)
    $$ (14) The 3rd quarter mean depth applied is equal to the sum of the low quarter
    depth and 2/3 of the difference between the high and low quarter mean depths applied:
    $$ {\mathrm{IW}}_3={\mathrm{IW}}_1+2/3\left({\mathrm{IW}}_4-{\mathrm{IW}}_1\right)
    $$ (15) When water deficit conditions are considered, the water allocation is
    less than for a fully irrigated crop (PIR < 100 %). Thus, the sum of the irrigation
    depths to the low quarter of a deficit irrigated crop (ΣNAa, mm) is computed as:
    $$ \Sigma {\mathrm{NA}}_{\mathrm{a}}=\sum {\mathrm{GA}}_{\mathrm{c}}\left(\frac{\mathrm{PIR}}{100}\right)=\mathrm{W}\mathrm{A}\cdot
    {\mathrm{D}}_{\mathrm{u}} $$ (16) When using pressurized irrigation systems, the
    number of irrigation events in water deficit conditions (Nia) is equal to Nic,
    and the MAD for the deficit irrigation (MADa, mm) is estimated as function of
    the PIR and MADc as: $$ {\mathrm{MAD}}_{\mathrm{a}}={\mathrm{MAD}}_{\mathrm{c}}\left(\frac{\mathrm{PIR}}{100}\right)
    $$ (17) Because the distribution uniformity of surface (gravity) irrigation depends
    greatly on the opportunity time to infiltrate water across the field, it is difficult
    to change the application amount for any given irrigation event. Therefore, SIMETAW#
    forces surface irrigation to have a similar management allowable depletion as
    the fully irrigated crop. During deficit water supply conditions, the number of
    irrigation events is reduced, but the depth of water applied is similar for each
    irrigation event. Therefore, for gravity irrigation, MADa = MADc and Nia < Nic,
    where Nia is the sum of the net applications in deficit condition divided by the
    management allowable depletion for the fully irrigated crop as: $$ {\mathrm{N}}_{\mathrm{ia}}=\frac{{\displaystyle
    \varSigma {\mathrm{N}\mathrm{A}}_{\mathrm{a}}}}{{\mathrm{MAD}}_{\mathrm{c}}} $$
    (18) 2.6 Determination of the Stress Coefficient and Fraction of Potential Yield
    Since the SIMETAW# program is able to compute the soil water balance in full irrigation
    and water deficit conditions, ETa is computed as the product of ETc and the stress
    coefficient. The Ks is computed as function of the SWD under deficit water conditions
    as: $$ {\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{s}}=1-\frac{100\left(\frac{\mathrm{SWD}}{\mathrm{PAW}}\right)-\mathrm{AD}}{100-\mathrm{AD}}
    $$ (19) If Ks = 1.00, there is no water deficit, while a Ks < 1.00 implies a water
    deficit. The CETc and cumulative actual crop evapotranspiration (CETa, mm) are
    computed by summing the daily ETa rates from the first through the last day of
    the season. Since water application to a cropped field is non-uniform, the SIMETAW#
    program estimates yield separately to each of the four quarters of the field based
    on infiltrated water. For a fully irrigated crop, with CETa = CETc, then IW1 =
    ETaw. When there is stress, CETa < CETc and IW1 < ETaw. SIMETAW# calculates the
    seasonal CETa for the deficit irrigated crop of the low quarter. The difference
    between CETa and IW1 is the amount of CETa coming from sources other than irrigation,
    e.g., effective precipitation, water table, dew and fog, and stored soil water.
    The ratio of CETa to CETc is computed for each quarter of the field, and reductions
    in yield due to water stress are computed for each of the four quarters of the
    field following the procedures in FAO 33 (Doorenbos and Kassam 1979). For each
    quarter, the actual to potential yield ratio (Ya/Yc) is computed as: $$ \frac{{\mathrm{Y}}_{\mathrm{a}}}{{\mathrm{Y}}_{\mathrm{c}}}=1-{\mathrm{K}}_{\mathrm{Y}}\left(1-\frac{\mathrm{CE}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{a}}}{\mathrm{CE}{\mathrm{T}}_{\mathrm{c}}}\right)
    $$ (20) where KY is a coefficient that relates the relative reduction in cumulative
    ET to the relative reduction in yield. Finally, the mean of the four yield ratios
    is computed to provide an estimate of yield as affected by deficit irrigation.
    This approach accounts for the irrigation system in addition to the irrigation
    deficit. The FAO 33 publication contains KY values for several crops, but KY values
    are not known for all crops. If the KY value is unknown for a particular crop,
    then KY = 1.0 is used in SIMETAW#. For crops with unknown KY values, assuming
    KY = 1.0 is equivalent to assuming that a 1 % reduction in transpiration due to
    stress will lead to a 1 % reduction in biomass production. For crops that produce
    reproductive parts rather than biomass alone, this is still a fair assumptions
    because, unless there is a severe irrigation deficit, the reduction in transpiration
    typically occurs later in the season when biomass is accumulating more in the
    reproductive parts. Thus, this modified version of the FAO 33 approach provides
    estimates of the actual to potential yield ratio for a large number of crops.
    2.7 Rain-fed Agriculture When a crop is grown in rain-fed conditions, the SIMETAW#
    program still calculates the daily water balance for a fully irrigated crop because
    the CETc information is needed to determine the well-watered yield for the crop.
    However, the stress function is determined using the SWD, AD, and PAW as previously
    discussed. The CETc and CETa are determined as in the deficit irrigated crop case.
    Finally, the Ya/Yc is still determined using the CETa and CETc calculations. 3
    Materials and Methods 3.1 Datasets The SIMETAW# model was designed to estimate
    the irrigation needs, thus its performance was tested employing data from three
    field studies. 3.1.1 Site 1 The first experimental study used in this paper was
    carried out by Bryla et al. (2005) in a peach field [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch],
    planted at the University of California Kearney Agricultural Research and Extension
    Center near Fresno, California (Johnson et al. 2002). The soil was fine sandy
    loam, and the rooting depth was around 1 m. Irrigation was applied by furrow and
    drip systems, and the schedule was based on ETc measured hourly on two well-watered
    peach trees growing in the same weighing lysimeter. The lysimeter contained trees
    of the same variety, age, and planting density as trees in the orchard. Furrow
    irrigation was applied to the orchard weekly while drip irrigation was applied
    every day. Irrigation application occurred from the beginning of April through
    mid-October. The research project was conducted during 2002 through 2004 and the
    results were used to assess the accuracy of the SIMETAW# model in estimating monthly
    ETc and ETaw. Weather data necessary to estimate ETo (Allen et al. 2005b) were
    obtained from the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS)
    station (Snyder and Pruitt 1992) nearby the experimental site (Parlier, 36°35′52″N;
    119°30′11″W; 103 m a.s.l.). The development dates were B (1 Mar), C (23 Jun),
    D (22 Set), and E (15 Oct), and the percentages for each growth stage from data
    B were 50 % (A-C), 90 % (A-D), and 100 % (A-E) and the Kc values were Kc1 = 0.55
    on date B, Kc2 = 1.05 on dates C and D, and Kc3 = 0.65 on date E. Using crop,
    soil, and management data reported in the experimental study, ETaw and the monthly
    ΣNAc for furrow and drip irrigation were estimated. 3.1.2 Site 2 The second experiment
    was carried out by Snyder and O’Connel (2007) on navel orange orchard [Citrus
    sinensis (L.) Osbeck] near Lindsay, California. The soil was a fine sandy loam,
    and the rooting depth was around 1.2 m. Irrigation was applied with micro-sprinklers
    every 4–6 days during summer. There was no irrigation from October/November through
    mid-March. Evapotranspiration was measured using the residual of the energy balance
    where the sensible heat flux was determined using the calibrated surface renewal
    method (Snyder and O’Connel 2007). A surface renewal (SR) station was set up inside
    the orchard to measure daily ETc, while weather data used to calculate ETo (Allen
    et al. 2006) came from the CIMIS station at the University of California Lindcove
    Field Station (36o21’26″N; 119o03’31″W; 146 m a.s.l.). The percentages for each
    growth stage from data B were 33 % (A-C), 67 % (A-D), and 100 % (A-E) and the
    Kc values were Kc1 = 1.00 on date B, Kc2 = 1.00 on dates C and D, and Kc3 = 1.00
    on date E. Results of daily ETc, monthly ΣNAc, and monthly number of irrigation
    events for the 2003 and 2004 seasons were used to assess the performance of the
    SIMETAW# model. 3.1.3 Site 3 The third experimental study was carried out by Snyder
    et al. (2012b) at the Campbell Tract at the University of California, Davis. Wheat
    (Triticum aestivum L.) was cultivated in rain-fed conditions from November 2011
    until June 2012. The soil was a Yolo silty clay loam with infiltration rate of
    about 28.6 mm h−1 and θA = 0.20 mm mm−1. Rooting depth was about 1.7 m. The development
    dates were A (26 Nov), B (10 Jan), C (20 Mar), D (15 May), and E (10 Jun), and
    the percentages for each growth stage from data A were 23 % (A-B), 58 % (A-C),
    87 % (A-D), and 100 % (A-E) and the Kc values were Kc1 = 0.33 on date B, Kc2 =
    1.05 on dates C and D, and Kc3 = 0.15 on date E. The ETa was computed by using
    data from a weighing lysimeter and a combination of the SR and eddy covariance
    (EC) methods. During initial-growth, because of the low ETa values, precipitation,
    and fog, data were only collected by the lysimeter. From mid-February on, the
    EC and SR methods were also used to estimate ETa. In early May, ETa from the lysimeter
    dropped dramatically. The EC and SR methods did not measure a drop in ETa until
    about two weeks later. The crop was not irrigated, and the early decrease in ETa
    observed in the lysimeter running out of water earlier than in the deeper soil
    surrounding the lysimeters. The wheat inside the lysimeter clearly senesced approximately
    two weeks prior to the wheat outside of the lysimeter. Thus, considering that
    the EC and SR observations clearly showed that the season was longer than indicated
    by the lysimeter data, an accurate computation of the ETa was possible by using
    the EC and SR data at the end of the season. Weather data and ETo estimates came
    from the CIMIS station (Davis, 38o32’09″N; 121o46’32″W; 18 m a.s.l.). Observed
    daily ETa data from the lysimeters (early growth), SR and EC (end of the season)
    where compared with those estimated by the SIMETAW# model. 3.2 Statistics The
    performance of the model in estimating the ETc, ETa, and ETaw was determined by
    statistical analyses. Several indexes, including the calculation of correlation
    and differences between estimated and measured series, were used. The simulated
    data were analyzed calculating the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), root
    mean squared error (RMSE), and mean relative error (MRE). The Pearson’s correlation
    coefficient provides a measure of how strong is the correlation between simulated
    and observed series, and its range is between −1 and 1. The RMSE, which is a measure
    of how closely two variable match (Loague and Green 1991; Xevi et al. 1996) was
    used to test the accuracy of the model: $$ \mathrm{RMSE}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{\mathrm{n}}{\sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^{\mathrm{n}}\left({\widehat{\mathrm{Z}}}_{\mathrm{i}}-{\mathrm{Z}}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)}^2}
    $$ (21) where n is the number of samples and Zi and Ẑi are the observed and estimated
    values for n observations. The MRE was used to measure the absolute error between
    simulated and observed data: $$ \mathrm{M}\mathrm{R}\mathrm{E}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{n}}\sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^{\mathrm{n}}\frac{\left|{\mathrm{Z}}_{\mathrm{i}}-{\widehat{\mathrm{Z}}}_{\mathrm{i}}\right|}{{\mathrm{Z}}_{\mathrm{i}}}
    $$ (22) The MRE statistic indicates the match of estimated to observed values,
    but the value is relative to the observed data. 4 Results 4.1 Site 1 It was assumed
    that the peach orchard was irrigated with sufficient frequency and depth of water
    applied to avoid water stress, so the symbol ETc rather than ETa is used here.
    The SIMETAW# model estimated the CETc for peach equal to 1026, 1020, and 1058
    mm, while the observed values were equal to 1100, 1081, and 1041 mm, in 2002,
    2003, and 2004, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1, the estimated and observed monthly
    ETc values followed a similar trend. For all three seasons, the model tended to
    overestimate ETc values during April through June and to the under predict ETc
    during July through September. The early difference is likely due to a later leaf
    out and, therefore, lower ETc than the default input value in the model (March
    1). The midseason ETc difference is clearly related to the choice of midseason
    Kc. If the model midseason Kc were increased, to what was observed, the model
    prediction would be nearly perfect. In general, the match between predicted and
    observed ETc values during the irrigation season was good. Nearly perfect ETc
    estimates were observed during May and June 2002 (Fig. 1a) and July and August
    2004 (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1 Monthly observed (obs) and estimated (est) crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) and applied water (ΣNAc) data for peach orchard in 2002 (a), 2003 (b), and
    2004 (c) Full size image Results of the statistical analysis of peach ETc estimates
    are shown in Table 1. The Pearson’s coefficient values were significant to less
    than 0.025. Taking into account the indices based on differences between expected
    and measured data, a relatively low RMSE was observed for ETc. The highest RMSE
    value was observed in 2003 (32.69 mm month−1), while the lowest value was 16.51
    mm month−1 in 2004. These results confirm a good predictive efficiency of the
    model. The model showed a tendency to underestimate ETc in 2002 and 2003. On the
    contrary, a slight overestimation of ETc was observed in 2004. These relationships
    would change if the model crop coefficients and growth dates were modified to
    better match the observed values. Table 1 Summary of predicted and observed monthly
    peach crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and sum of the net applications (ΣNAc) data
    during three growing seasons, and daily citrus ETc and monthly ΣNAc data by year
    Full size table The estimated ETaw in 2002 was 990 and 1005 mm for drip and furrow
    irrigation, respectively, compared with an observed ETaw = 1029 mm. For this example,
    the observed ETaw was set equal to the depth of water applied to the lysimeter,
    so distribution uniformity was not considered as it would be in a commercial field.
    The highest mismatch between observed and estimated data was noticed in June and
    September for both drip and furrow irrigation (Fig. 1a). The difference between
    observed and estimated monthly ΣNAc during the following years was less marked
    (Fig. 1b, c) with a nearly perfect match in 2004 (Fig. 1c). The summary statistics
    (Table 1) shows that the ETaw estimate in 2002 gave the highest RMSE values for
    both irrigation methods compared with the following irrigation seasons. The ETaw
    was underestimated in 2002, whereas it was overestimated in 2003 and 2004. In
    fact, the ETaw in 2004 was 1007 and 1013 mm for drip and furrow irrigation, respectively,
    compared with 992 mm for the observed data. In 2003, ETaw was 959 and 954 mm for
    drip and furrow irrigation, respectively, compared with 935 mm of the observed
    data. In general, the observed and predicted monthly ΣNAc values followed similar
    trends. 4.2 Site 2 The model estimated CETc values for citrus were 936 and 972
    mm for 2003 and 2004 respectively, whereas the observed CETc values were 975 and
    945 mm, respectively. The model showed some under-prediction of citrus ETc, especially
    during October and November in 2003 (Fig. 2a) and during March in 2004 (Fig. 2b).
    Since a fixed Kc = 1.00 was used all year in the SIMETAW# model, the canopy resistance
    in the ETo equation is fixed, and the canopy resistance of the crop was reduced
    when the foliage was wetted by fog or light rainfall, which is common in spring
    and fall, it likely explains the higher observed than modelled ETc values from
    late fall through early spring. In addition, the differences between modelled
    and observed ETc might result from measurement errors due to frequent light rainfall
    and fog interception during these months. In general, observed and predicted values
    followed the same trend, with a particular good fit when spikes in the ETc values
    were observed. Fig. 2 Estimated (est) and observed (obs) daily crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) and monthly applied water (ΣNAc) data of citrus in 2003 (a) and 2004 (b)
    Full size image The observed ETaw was estimated as the ΣNAc during the season
    assuming no runoff or deep percolation, and the estimated citrus ETaw was determined
    using SIMETAW#. The model estimated citrus ETaw values were 1060 mm (2003) and
    1124 mm (2004) without considering the contribution of November through April
    fog, dew, and light rainfall; this compares with the observed ETaw values 1153
    mm (2003) and 903 mm (2004). The model is predicting an optimal ETaw for the orchard,
    and the observed ETaw was 93 mm higher than ETaw (2003) and 121 mm lower than
    ETaw (2004). The yield of top quality fruit from the research orchard was 58 %
    higher in 2003 than in 2004, and the 2004 yield was considerably higher than the
    regional average (Snyder and O’Connel 2007). The statistics (Table 1) confirmed
    the good predictive capability of the model in estimating ETc and the amount of
    water necessary during the irrigation season. The RMSE and MRE values for estimated
    ETc, calculated during the main irrigation season, i.e., when ETo was substantial,
    were good for both seasons. The model simulation indicated the need for one irrigation
    event in January and February 2003, however, the contribution of fog, dew, and
    light rainfall was not included in the calculations. It is likely that the soil
    water extraction was overestimated during winter because the estimates did not
    include the contributions of fog, dew, and light rainfall. Because of the inaccuracy
    in trying to determine ETo during the winter, when ETo < 2.0 mm d−1 was common,
    we did not attempt to account for the contribution of fog interception, which
    is appreciable in the San Joaquin Valley from November through March. The irrigation
    season ended in mid-October 2004 compared with mid-November 2003, however, the
    model predicted two irrigation events in November 2014 and one irrigation event
    in November 2003. The actual irrigation events were independently controlled by
    the grower, but the predicted and actual number of irrigation events over the
    seasonal were comparable. During the irrigation season of 2003, the model estimated
    39 irrigation events and 38 were actually applied. In 2004, the model estimated
    38 irrigation events, and there were 36 actual applications. 4.3 Site 3 SIMETAW#
    estimated the seasonal CETa for wheat equal to 475 mm, while the observed value
    was 465 mm. As shown in Fig. 3, the mismatch between observed and simulated values
    was noted during the end of the growing season. In fact, a relatively small difference
    of about 20 mm month−1 of ETa was estimated in May. Taking into consideration
    the simulated daily soil water balance data, the wheat started to exhibit water
    stress after May 9 and the stress factor decreased from 1.00 to 0.42 at the end
    of the season. Around May 14, the stress factor was Ks = 0.76 and the drop of
    ETa values became apparent. Overall, the model simulation followed the observed
    trend well. The statistical analysis showed correlation r = 0.94, which was significant
    at P ≤ 0.001. The RMSE = 0.70 mm d−1 was relatively low and demonstrated a good
    predictive difference between expected and observed data. As further demonstrated
    by the MRE (0.51 mm d−1) value, the model showed a good performance for estimating
    daily ETa. Fig. 3 Daily estimated and observed ETa data of wheat Full size image
    5 Discussion Unlike other soil water balance models, SIMETAW# allows climate corrections
    for ETo and crop coefficient data in order to get more reliable water balance
    calculations. Moreover, SIMETAW# accounts for non-uniformity of the irrigation
    application, and it can be applied to rain-fed, deficit irrigated, and fully irrigated
    crops. SIMETAW# is a model to estimate irrigation water demand, and it provides
    some potential yield information for a wide number of crops rather than giving
    detailed crop production information as provided by more specific crop production
    and growth models. SIMETAW# does not require experimental data for the calibration
    and evaluation processes that are essential for using crop models. 6 Conclusions
    SIMETAW# is a soil water balance model that is able to simulate the evapotranspiration
    of the applied water. The daily water balance is an essential part of the program
    because it helps to determine the timing of the first and last irrigation events
    to insure that the soil water content starts and ends at levels that are reasonable.
    The model determines when the crop should be irrigated and how much water should
    be applied in terms of net and gross application depending on the irrigation system.
    Then, the sum of the computed net applications during a season provides information
    on how much water is needed to match the seasonal evapotranspiration to produce
    the crop. The possibility to choose the percentage of the full irrigation requirement
    to apply to a crop permits the simulation of adaptation strategies aimed to increase
    the use of irrigation water in an efficient way. Moreover, the application helps
    to assess irrigation demand in relation to future CO2 concentration. Results of
    the ETaw simulation indicate that the SIMETAW# model could be used efficiently
    to evaluate different irrigation strategies that enhance irrigation planning.

    Collection for Precision Agriculture

    Christine Dewi and Rung-Ching Chen

    Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) is a shared network of things which can associate

    with each other through the internet connection. IoT plays a vital role in the
    agri-

    culture industry which can feed 9.0 billion people by 2050. Precision Agriculture

    provides a novel solution using a systems approach for today’s agricultural issues

    such as the need to balance productivity with environmental concerns. This paper

    proposes IoT for local information data collection on Precision Agriculture and
    uses

    some case study for examples. In this paper, we aim that the internet of things
    can

    be used to collect local information data on precision agriculture. The farmer
    could

    get the real time data for monitoring his ﬁeld. Moreover, by using this technology,

    farmers can effectively use the information to achieve higher yields and therefore

    earn higher proﬁts.

    Introduction

    As of now the total population of the world is presumed to be approximately 7
    billion

    and is projected to increase by 2.0 billion in just 40 years, reaching 9.0 billion
    by

    2050 [1]. This global resident growth affects the problem of food shortfall, and
    it

    becomes a world-scale problem. As the world’s population grows, farmers will need

    to supply more food. Moreover, there are some innovations in the agricultural
    ﬁeld,

    for example, the concept of Precision Agriculture. Precision Agriculture provides

    a novel fulﬁllment using a systems approach for today’s agricultural issues such

    the need to balance productivity with environmental concerns. It is based on the

    implementation of foremost information technologies. It includes describing and

    modeling variation in soils and plant species and integrating agricultural practices
    to

    meet site-speciﬁc requirements.

    Furthermore, Precision Agriculture is the concept of using new technologies and

    collected ﬁeld information. The main activities of Precision Agriculture are data

    collection, processing and variable rate applications of inputs. In addition,
    Internet

    of Things (IoT) technology is currently shaping different aspects of human life.

    Precision agriculture is one of the paradigms which can use the IoT advantages
    to

    optimize the production efﬁciency across the agriculture ﬁelds, optimize the quality

    of the crops, and minimize the negative environmental impact [2]. The use of Wireless

    Sensor Networks (WSNs) in precision agriculture upgrades the overall efﬁciency,

    productivity, and proﬁtability of the agricultural system. WSNs are key components

    the IoT in which different pieces of information gathered from almost anywhere
    and

    anything in the world is accessible through the Internet [2]. Of the various advantages

    that IoT brings to the table, its ability to innovate the current scenario of
    farming

    methods is absolutely ground-breaking. Mostly, we come across ideas that suggest

    a wireless sensor network that collects data from the various sensors present
    in the

    ﬁeld and sends the data to the main central server. This method focuses on studying

    the environmental factors to improve crop yield [3].

    This paper proposes IoT for local information data collection on Precision Agri-

    culture. This paper aims to implement IoT technology to get the data for monitoring

    systems such as crop and soil monitoring, weather and air monitoring and working

    machine monitoring. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect.
    2,

    we review the related work and the proposed local information collection. The
    case

    study of IoT architecture is presented in Sect. 3. The paper is concluded in Sect.
    4.

    Related Work

    There are many types of research about the use of Internet of Things on Precision

    Agriculture. Prasad et al. [4] propose an approach combining the advantages of
    the

    signiﬁcant characteristics of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things

    (IoT) and Web Service to construct an efﬁcient approach to handle the enormous
    data

    involved in agrarian output. The method uses the combination of IoT and cloud
    com-

    puting that promotes the fast development of agricultural modernization and helps

    to realize the smart solution for agriculture and efﬁciently solve the issues
    related

    to farmers. This research use connectivity using existing 3G, 4G networks using

    the available hardware is one signiﬁcant advantage for Smart agriculture. Internet

    of things paradigms are used as resources to facilitate decision making. IoT archi-

    tecture, operating rules, and smart processes are implemented using a distributed

    model based on edge and fog computing paradigms. A communication architecture

    is proposed using these technologies. The aim is to help farmers to develop smart

    systems both, in current and new facilities [5]. The important things to do in
    this

    paper describe how to collect the local information data use the IoT before analyzing

    the other step.

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is one network which contains physical objects

    that are embedded with the electronic devices, software, connectivity and sensors
    to

    achieve a higher value and provide some services regarding the exchange of details

    with the product manufacturer, operator [4]. IoT is developed using architectures

    based on layers capable of connecting a huge number of devices with each other

    and with the established services. The basic model of IoT has a three layer archi-

    tecture which is of Perception, Network and Application Layers [5]. Protocols
    are

    important depends on several facts such as environmental conditions, network char-

    acteristics, the total of data to be transferred, quality of service requests
    and security

    levels [6]. Furthermore, in this work different protocols such as Hypertext Transfer

    Protocol (HTTP), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Bluetooth, and

    Wiﬁ can be used to develop proposed architecture. IoT technologies are proposed

    in PA scenarios. Moreover, in [7] this model is described as a solution in precision

    farming. IoT Smart farming application include farm parameters tracking, monitor-

    ing, ﬁeld observation, and storage monitoring. The work Internet of Things Platform

    for Smart Farming presents a platform based on IoT technologies that can automate

    the collection of environmental, soil, fertilization, and irrigation data; automatically

    correlate such data and ﬁlter-out invalid data from the perspective of assessing
    crop

    performance; and compute crop forecasts and personalized crop recommendations

    for any particular farm [6].

    Local Information Data Collection

    Local information system describes in this paper can see in Fig. 1. The data from

    the local system divided by three part, ﬁrst crop and soil monitoring, weather
    and air

    monitoring, and last working machine monitoring.

    Data are facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. Data
    col-

    lection is the most important in precision agriculture because the farmer can
    manage

    their crop real time and improve their crop productivity. There many research
    about

    precision agriculture in a different crop. In [8] explain and give an example
    about

    yield monitoring over time creates a unique GIS database that assists farmers
    to

    easily identify yield variability within a ﬁeld, to make better variable-rate
    decisions,

    and create a history of spatial ﬁeld data. Yield monitoring has become a common

    practice in traditional grain crops and corn-soybean rotation systems. This technol-

    ogy is being researched and commercialized for other crops such as potato, onion,

    sugar beet, tomato, hay, citrus, grape, and sugarcane. There are various elements
    of

    precision farming that play their necessary role in cropping systems. Yield monitor-

    ing is being used to measure the yield variability of corn, soybean, potato, tomato,

    onion, sugar beet, hay, orange, grape, sugarcane and has become the most widely

    used component of precision farming. Besides yield variability, crop variety com-

    parisons, yield damage reports, and ﬁeld efﬁciency are being assessed with the
    use

    of yield monitoring systems.

    Soil preparation is the ﬁrst step before growing a crop. The ultimate objective
    is to

    produce a ﬁrm and weed-free seedbed for rapid germination and emergence of the

    crop. One of the most important tasks in soil preparation is tilling (or ploughing):

    turning the soil and loosening it. Besides, soil preparation is one of the most
    energy-

    consuming parts of agriculture, requiring signiﬁcant inputs of fuel and time.
    Depend-

    ing on the ﬁeld’s location, it may also increase the risk of soil erosion. Nowadays,

    precision farming equipment exists that helps farmers to use considerably less
    fuel

    and time in soil preparation by improving the accuracy, efﬁciency, and sustainability

    of the process.

    According to Pavithra [9] the distinctive sensors which are utilized in the research

    are the Temperature sensor, Humidity sensor, Soil sensor, Water-level sensor,
    and

    Light Dependent Resistor can be seen on the Fig. 2.

    Sensed data inputs produce several data. First, Temperature control is considering

    high radiation, while the temperature is evolving, and a few yields may get harmed,
    so

    it needs some ventilation strategy to control the temperature. Depending on the
    agri-

    cultural product being grown temperature can affect growth, germination, sprouting,

    ﬂowering, and fruit development. Next, Water vapor is the fundamental issue that
    is

    inﬂuencing the development of products. Due to high humidity, odds of the ailment

    are expanding. Mugginess may affect hydria push, shutting the stomata and hence

    it might let down the procedure of photosynthesis which relies upon the osmosis.

    Moreover, soil water likewise inﬂuences the yield development. The best possible

    water systems and preparations of the product are differed according to the sort,
    age,

    stage, and atmosphere. Some key parameters for water level are pH esteem, dampness

    contains, electric conductivity and the temp of dirt. Furthermore, the Light dependent

    resistor is a photograph conductive sensor [9]. Based on Gaikwad and Galande [10],

    a wireless sensor network (WSN) is an infrastructure comprised of sensing, comput-

    ing and communication elements that allow the administrator to monitor and control

    of the speciﬁed parameters in the network. A typical application of WSN includes

    data collection, monitoring, surveillance and medical telemedicine. It is also
    used in

    the irrigation system, Greenhouses for monitoring and controlling parameters like

    water ﬂow, temp, humidity, moisture, etc. Based on the previous research, the
    type

    of sensor for local information data collection could be seen in Table 1.

    There were many type of sensors that can be used to get local information data

    like temperature sensor (LM35, DHT11, SHT75, SHT-3x DIS), humidity sensor

    (P-Hs-220, DHT11, HH10D, CMOS chip, SHT-3x DIS), Soil sensor (SN-M114,

    10HS, DHT11), Water-level sensor (pH measurement sensor), and Light Dependent

    Resistor. This research proposed a system model that could be seen in Fig. 3.

    Figure 3 shows the system model on local data information to collect data from
    the

    various crop (Potato, Onion, Sugar Beet, Tomato, Hay, Citrus, Grape, and Sugarcane,

    etc.). First, the process starts with sensors detection such as water level, temperature,

    humidity, soil moisture, andlight. Thedatawill collect, process, andsaveondatabase.

    The next step, the data will be processed and create a decision model (for example

    Decision tree and Markov). Furthermore, Decision tree is an efﬁcient tool in machine

    learning for classiﬁcation problems. The decision tree is based on a hierarchical

    decision scheme or a tree like structure. Each node of the decision tree structure

    makes a binary decision that separates either one class or some of the classes
    from

    the remaining classes. The processing is generally carried out by moving down
    the

    tree until the leaf node is reached. This is known as a top–down approach. Moreover,

    this analysis will help the farmer to monitor his crop real time. The system could
    give

    warning and alarm if something happened in the ﬁeld as the change of temperature

    and humidity, so the farmer could make an action to solve this problem quickly,
    for

    instance, automation irrigation. The decision model analysis can help the farmers

    maximize their proﬁt margin by providing predictions on crops that will give the

    maximum output in a particular area and in the future.

    Case Study

    Chavan and Karande [12] focuses on ﬁeld monitoring using IoT devices which would

    provide real-time soil moisture, humidity, and temperature of the ﬁeld to the
    farmers.

    An Arduino Microcontroller board with soil, temperature and humidity sensors is

    used to collect the data from the ﬁled on the ﬂy from a remote ﬁeld. The sensors

    are deployed in the wheat crop for data capturing. The results are carried out
    and

    analyzed in the form of temperature, moisture and humidity from the wheat crop

    ﬁeld for the invocating alarm to the farmer when required.

    Figure 4 shows that as the temperature raises the humidity decreases alarmingly.

    Near 110 days the humidity falls to around 35. This again can be a trigger an
    alarm

    to the farmer to water the ﬁelds. Since the system can be on auto mode, the pump

    could start on its own. Moreover, the other case study describes wireless monitoring

    of soil moisture, temperature and humidity using Zigbee in Agriculture [13]. This

    38

    C. Dewi and R.-C. Chen

    Fig. 4 Temperature, humidity and moisture plot analysis [12]

    research concludes Zigbee-based agriculture monitoring system serves as a reliable

    and efﬁcient system for monitoring agricultural parameters. The corrective action

    can be taken. Wireless monitoring of ﬁeld not only allows the user to reduce the

    human power, but it also allows the user to see accurate changes in it. It is
    cheaper

    and consumes less power. Nirmal Kumar et al. [17], presented a real-time paddy

    crop ﬁeld monitoring using Zigbee Network. This paper proposed an idea about

    monitoring the crop ﬁeld area without human interaction. Besides, this research
    use

    four Zigbee nodes to form a Zigbee network. Temperature sensor and pressure sensor

    were connected to two Zigbee devices via microcontroller and humidity sensor was

    connected to another Zigbee via a microcontroller. The result of the experiment
    can

    be seen in Table 2 and Fig. 3.

    The graph on Fig. 5 describes the temperature and humidity readings when imple-

    mented in real-time environment. The result shows that the temperature and humidity

    is a varying quantity in the paddy crop ﬁeld area. A farmer can use this data
    to make

    decision support in the future to improve their productivity. For examples, Veenad-

    hari et al. [18] focused on decision tree to evaluate the effect of climatic factors
    on

    the soybean crop yield. The study implement the potential use of this process
    for

    extracting useful information from existing secondary data of climatic factors.
    The

    decision trees suggested there exists a correlation between climatic factors and

    the

    productivity of soybean crop was mostly inﬂuenced by Relative humidity followed

    by temperature and rainfall. Figure 6 shows decision tree for inﬂuence of climatic

    factors on soybean yield.

    Based on Shakoor et al. [19], in most of the cases, Decision Tree Learning-ID3

    algorithm gives a less value for percentage error than the KKNR algorithm without

    omitting the outliers of the dataset. The research suggests area based beneﬁcial
    crop

    rank before the cultivation process. The prediction is based on analyzing a static
    set

    of data using Supervised Machine Learning techniques (Decision Tree Learning-ID3

    and K Nearest Neighbors Regression algorithms). ID3 uses the decision tree table

    which consists of the ranges of the rainfall, temperature and yield data. The
    goal

    of this research is to help the farmers maximize their proﬁt margin by providing

    predictions on crops that will give the maximum output in a particular area. The

    dataset contains of details on crops’ yield per hectare, average of minimum and

    maximum temperature, rainfall, year range, and region. Analyzing these data, the

    algorithms give the result which predicts the preferred proﬁtable output. For
    the

    accuracyoftheprediction,dataofpasttwelveyearsisbeingusedbythealgorithmsfor

    the purpose of learning and result analysis. Example of decision tree implementation

    could be seen on Fig. 7.

    In [20], a WSN-based outlier detection and irrigation management system is

    developed to assist farmers in handling crop irrigation schedules. The proposed

    system collects environmental and soil-related data through sensor nodes that
    are

    examined by the outlier detection module. The proposed noise detection algorithm

    is implementedtoimprovethesystem‘s accuracy. Afterward, DSSfurther examines it

    to identify water deﬁcient sites in agricultural ﬁelds. After identiﬁcation, the
    alarming

    unit is activated, and text messages are sent over a local area network (LAN)
    to inform

    farmers. The other research use a wireless decision support system for the optimized

    management of the irrigation in agriculture has been presented. The properties
    of

    the WSAN technology have been exploited to acquire heterogeneous environmental

    parameters and to control the functioning of the irrigation system. The FL-based

    methodology has been designed and calibrated according to the indications of the

    farmers in order to mimic the human experience and to properly understand the

    status of the crop [21]. Monitoring based on IoT is a reliable and fast system
    which

    Decision Making Based on IoT Data Collection …

    41

    helps farmers in monitoring the ﬁelds effectively. This helps them to take corrective

    measure for the protection and better yield of the crop.

    In this paper, we aim that the internet of things can be used to collect local
    information

    data on precision agriculture. The farmer could get the real-time data for monitoring

    his ﬁeld. The important local information data are water level, temperature, humidity,

    soil moisture, and light from the various crop (Potato, Onion, Sugar Beet, Tomato,

    Hay, Citrus, Grape, and Sugarcane, etc.). There are many types of sensors could

    be used to get the important data in the agriculture ﬁeld in Table 1. The decision

    model analysis, decision tree can help the farmers maximize their proﬁt margin
    by

    providing predictions on crops that will give the maximum output in a particular
    area

    and the algorithms give the result which predicts the preferred proﬁtable output.
    In

    the future, the monitoring system could be connected and information exchanged

    via sensors is available to the farmer on the website and desktop application
    and

    mobile phones. Furthermore, a farmer can use this data to make intelligent decisions

    for planting, fertilizing, and harvesting crops. Finally, using this technology,
    farmers

    can effectively use the information to achieve higher yields and therefore earn
    higher

    proﬁts.

  analysis: 'The paper conducts a systematic review of digital technologies in the
    field of agriculture, focusing particularly on real-time irrigation management
    systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. The review provides
    a comprehensive overview of the current state of research and identifies gaps
    and challenges in addressing the goal of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation
    management.


    The review is relevant to the outline point because it examines the different
    data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather), their collection
    and use, and the emerging trends in different technologies (e.g., IoT, machine
    learning, edge computing, fog computing, big data analytics) for real-time irrigation
    management.


    Here is one example of a verbatim quote from the paper that supports the relevance:


    > In addition to these technologies, advancements in data analytics techniques
    such as machine learning, cloud computing (CC), and the internet of things (IoT),
    have led to the development of smart irrigation systems that can monitor and analyze
    a wide range of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop
    production status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields,
    reduce costs, improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the
    use of modern systems.


    The review also contributes to the literature by providing a detailed classification
    of use cases for different technologies in real-time irrigation management, identifying
    their maturity level, and analyzing the technical and socioeconomic roadblocks
    to the full adoption of these technologies in agriculture.


    Regarding the limitations of the paper, the authors acknowledge that their study
    has two main limitations:


    1. **Limited scope of search engines:** The review process was limited to only
    three online repositories (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct), which may have resulted
    in missing some relevant studies.

    2. **Potential for more results:** Additional search databases and areas can be
    considered for future study in order to provide a complete overview of the agriculture
    industry in terms of digitization.


    Overall, the review provides a valuable contribution to the field of real-time
    irrigation management and serves as a useful reference for researchers, practitioners,
    and policymakers working in this area.'

    \ \n1.1. A worldwide dilemma of food security\nFood security is a multifaceted\
    \ notion that aims to eliminate hunger by \nassuring a steady supply of nutritious\
    \ food. It is defined by a four-pillar para-\ndigm, each of which is necessary\
    \ to provide food security [1]. Food security \nis becoming a severe global concern\
    \ as a result of anthropogenic factors such \nas rapid population expansion, urbanization,\
    \ industrialization, farmland loss, \nfreshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation.\
    \ This is due to the fact that \n424\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthese factors have a direct impact on the agricultural industry,\
    \ which is the \nworld’s principal source of agri-food production. By 2050, it\
    \ is expected that \nthe global population will rise from 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion,\
    \ urban population \nwill rise by 66 percent, arable land will decline by approximately\
    \ 50 million \nhectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO 2 – promote crop disease\
    \ and \npest growth) will rise by 50 percent, agri-food production will decline\
    \ by 20%, \nand food demand will rise by 59 to 98 percent, posing an imminent\
    \ threat. To \nmeet rising food demands, agricultural practitioners around the\
    \ world will need \nto increase crop and livestock production to maximize agricultural\
    \ output. The \nemphasis of this review paper is crop farming, which includes\
    \ the production \nof both food and cash crops. \nA typical agri-food value chain\
    \ displaying three key stages in the production \nof agricultural products: pre-field\
    \ (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and \nharvesting stage), and post-field\
    \ (post-harvesting stage). All of the stages are \nimportant in the value chain,\
    \ but in this examination, we will focus on the sec-\nond stage, in-field, which\
    \ includes numerous crop-growing operations such as \nploughing, sowing, spraying,\
    \ and harvesting, among others. Traditional agricul-\ntural approaches are now\
    \ used in these procedures, which are labor-intensive, \nrequire arable land,\
    \ time, and a significant quantity of water (for irrigation), and \nmake it difficult\
    \ to produce enough food [5]. A part of the problem is also due \nto the improper\
    \ application of pesticides and herbicides, as well as the misuse \nof available\
    \ technologies, both of which hurt crops and ultimately result in \nagricultural\
    \ waste [6]. These problems can be solved by combining advanced \ntechnologies\
    \ and computer-based applications that ensure higher crop yields, \nless water\
    \ use, better pesticide/herbicide use, and improved crop quality. This \nis where\
    \ the concept of smart agriculture comes into play.\n1.2. Smart Agriculture\n\
    Every industry is being revolutionized and reshaped by Industry 4.0. It’s a \n\
    strategic initiative that combines emerging disruptive digital technologies like\
    \ \nthe Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration\
    \ \n(SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS),\
    \ \naugmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks\
    \ \n(WSN), cyber-physical systems (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manu-\n\
    facturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. \nAgriculture 4.0,\
    \ also known as smart agriculture, smart farming or digital \nfarming [7], is\
    \ the next phase of industrial agriculture, fueled by the integra-\ntion of these\
    \ technologies in agriculture. Farmers can use smart agriculture to \naddress\
    \ a variety of agricultural food production concerns such as farm pro-\n425\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nductivity,\
    \ environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. \nFarmers,\
    \ for example, can connect to farms remotely, regardless of location \nor time,\
    \ using IoT-enabled equipment based on WSNs to monitor and control \nfarm operations.\
    \ Drones outfitted with hyper spectral cameras can collect data \nfrom a variety\
    \ of sources on farmlands, while autonomous robots can assist \nor complete repetitive\
    \ chores on farms. Data analytics techniques can be used \nto examine the obtained\
    \ data, and computer programs can be utilized to help \nfarmers make decisions.\n\
    Similarly, smart agriculture can monitor and analyze a wide range of pa-\nrameters\
    \ related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, \nwater\
    \ management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides and pes-\nticides,\
    \ and controlled environment agriculture to increase crop yields, reduce \ncosts,\
    \ improve product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of \nmodern\
    \ systems [8].\n1.3. Research Motivation and Contribution \nThe reason for writing\
    \ this assessment is that digital technologies in agri-\ncultural systems provide\
    \ new strategic solutions for increasing farm output ef-\nficiency and effectiveness.\
    \ Furthermore, digital transformation paves the door \nfor modern farming technologies\
    \ like vertical farming (hydroponics, aquapon-\nics, and aeroponics) to be used,\
    \ which has the potential to solve food security \nissues. However, there are\
    \ a number of issues and restrictions connected with \nthis change from a technological,\
    \ socioeconomic, and management perspective \nthat must be overcome in order to\
    \ fully realise the potential of agricultural 4.0 \n[9].A number of publications\
    \ [9–18] have examined developing trends in the \ndevelopment of agriculture 4.0\
    \ by offering concise information on essential \nuses, benefits, and research\
    \ problems of smart farming. These studies’ research \nfocuses on either explaining\
    \ more general technical aspects while focusing on \nonly one or a few digital\
    \ technologies, or improving agricultural supply chain \nperformance, or developing\
    \ an agriculture 4.0 definition, or achieving sustain-\nable agronomy through\
    \ precision agriculture, or proposing a smart farming \nframework. Nonetheless,\
    \ these studies do not include an explicit discussion of \nthe tools and techniques\
    \ utilized to construct various systems, as well as their \nmaturity level. There\
    \ are also few studies that look at the consequences of dig-\nital technology\
    \ in modern soilless farms including hydroponics, aquaponics, \nand aeroponics\
    \ (indoor/outdoor). As a result, in order to promote conversation \nin this field,\
    \ it is necessary to examine the emergence of agriculture 4.0 from \nmany angles.\
    \ This research seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of dig-\nital technologies\
    \ used in the second stage of the agricultural production value \n426\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nchain (in-field)\
    \ for various farm types as described in section 1.1. The study’s \nkey theoretical\
    \ contribution is the analysis and dissemination of the tools and \ntechniques\
    \ used, as well as the farm type, maturity level of produced systems, \nand potential\
    \ obstacles or inhibiting factors in agriculture 4.0 development. Re-\nsearchers\
    \ and agricultural practitioners will benefit from the review’s insights \nin\
    \ future study on agriculture 4.0. \n1.4. Paper organization \nThe following is\
    \ the structure of the paper after the introduction: \nSection 2 discusses the\
    \ methodology used to collect relevant literature; Sec-\ntion 3 then presents\
    \ the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the \nselected\
    \ research studies; Section 4 then provides a detailed overview of the \ncore\
    \ technologies used in agricultural digitization; Section 5 then highlights the\
    \ \ntechnical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture;\
    \ \nand finally, Section 6 outlines a discussion of the research questions.\n\
    2. Research Methodology \nA systematic literature review (SLR) is a technique\
    \ for organizing and iden-\ntifying research related to a specific topic [19].\
    \ SLR is used in this study to look \ninto the state of Industry 4.0 technologies\
    \ in the agricultural industry. Cases \nwhere the phrase ‘agricultural’ occurred\
    \ in the title, abstract, or keywords of \nan article with any of the ‘Industry\
    \ 4.0 technologies’ described in section 1.2 \nare specifically sought. A review\
    \ procedure is established prior to conducting \nthe SLR to ensure a transparent\
    \ and high-quality research process, which are \nthe features that distinguish\
    \ a systematic literature review [20]. By conducting \nthorough literature searches,\
    \ the review methodology also helps to reduce bias. \nThe creation of the research\
    \ questions, the defining of the search method, and \nthe specification of inclusion\
    \ and exclusion criteria are all part of this process. \nTo conduct SLR, this\
    \ paper uses a recommended reporting item for system-\natic reviews and meta-analysis\
    \ (PRISMA) approach. PRISMA is a minimum \ncollection of items based on evidence\
    \ that is used to guide the construction of \nsystematic literature reviews and\
    \ other meta-analyses [19].\n2.1. Review Protocol \nBefore doing the bibliographic\
    \ analysis, a review methodology is estab-\nlished to identify, analyze, and interpret\
    \ data that are relevant to the research \nfocus. To begin, research questions\
    \ are developed in order to provide insight \ninto the study of published studies\
    \ in the research area of interest from many \nperspectives. These are the questions\
    \ that must be addressed in the research. The \nsearch strategy is then created,\
    \ which aids in the identification of appropriate \n427\nSiberian Journal of Life\
    \ Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nkeywords later in the search equation,\
    \ as well as the identification of relevant \ninformation sources, such as academic\
    \ databases and search engines that allow \naccess to vast amounts of digital\
    \ documentation. Science Direct, Scopus, and \nIEEE Xplore are three online research\
    \ archives that are utilized to find relevant \nstudies. Finally, boundaries are\
    \ created by predefining inclusion and exclusion \ncriteria for further inquiry\
    \ and content assessments of selected articles in order \nto narrow the search\
    \ results of each database.\n2.2. Evaluation Process \nIdentification, screening,\
    \ eligibility, and inclusion are the four stages of the \nliterature search process\
    \ that are evaluated. Consolidation is done for the re-\nmoval of duplicate items\
    \ in the identification step after initial metadata filtering \nby the use of\
    \ search expressions. After this phase, the number of publications is \nreduced.\
    \ The titles and abstracts of the papers are reviewed during the screening \n\
    stage, and the most relevant publications are chosen for integral reading. In\
    \ the \nthird stage, full-text screening of these papers is done to ensure that\
    \ they are \neligible for this paper’s goal.\n2.3. Threats to Validity \n(i) SLR\
    \ replication: Because the current search is confined to only three on-\nline\
    \ repositories, the provided SLR is vulnerable to risks to validity. \nAdditional\
    \ sources could potentially lead to the discovery of more pub-\nlications. Validity\
    \ can be regarded satisfactorily addressed because the SLR \nprocess is clearly\
    \ defined in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, it is possible \nthat slightly\
    \ different publications will be found if this SLR is replicated. This \nvariation\
    \ could be due to various personal choices made throughout the PRIS-\nMA screening\
    \ and eligibility phases, but it’s highly improbable that the overall \nresults\
    \ would alter.\n(ii)The search string used to discover the relevant papers covers\
    \ the entire \nspectrum of SLR; however it’s possible that some important studies\
    \ were over-\nlooked. More research may be found if more keywords and synonyms\
    \ in the \nsearch are included.\n3. Digitization Trends in Agriculture \nAlthough\
    \ the agriculture business is making significant progress in terms \nof digital\
    \ technology adoption, it is still lagging behind other industries such \nas healthcare,\
    \ manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, and others [15]. The \ncrop farming\
    \ method considered while designing an application or framework \nis referred\
    \ to as the farm type. The farming method, for example, can be soil-\nbased or\
    \ soilless. Open-air fields (conventional outdoor agricultural farms) and \n428\n\
    Siberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ngreenhouse\
    \ farms are included in the soil-based farming category (indoor). The \nsoilless\
    \ farming category, on the other hand, includes modern farming tech-\nniques such\
    \ as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). In \nthe recent\
    \ decade, autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided \nvehicles and\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), the internet of things, and \nmachine learning\
    \ appear to be the most commonly used technology in agricul-\nture. Agriculture’s\
    \ growing sectors include big data, wireless sensor networks, \ncyber-physical\
    \ systems, and digital twins. Furthermore, in contrast to indoor \nfarms, open\
    \ air farms are the most usually examined in research investigations. \nFew publications\
    \ exist for soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, \nand hydroponics),\
    \ implying that these modern farming practices are still in \ntheir infancy. Similarly,\
    \ each use case’s services are identified and classified \ninto nine service categories:\
    \ I crop management, CM (estimation/harvesting \nperiod and seed plantation/prediction\
    \ of crop yield/ growth rate/harvesting/ \npollination/ spraying (fertilizer/\
    \ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM \n(fresh weight, green biomass,\
    \ height, length, width, leaf density, piment content \n(chlorophyll), and phytochemical\
    \ composition); iii) water and environmental \nmanagement, WEM (monitoring and\
    \ control of flow rate, water level, water \nquality (nutrients), temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2, and weather forecasts, among \nother things); iv) irrigation\
    \ management, IM (water stress detection and sched-\nuling); v) farm management,\
    \ FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and \ncounting products, determining\
    \ production efficiency, financial analysis, energy \nconsumption analysis, technology\
    \ integration, and decision-making);\nPDM (pest and disease management) is a term\
    \ used to describe the man-\nagement of pests and diseases (pest identification\
    \ and disease detection) SM \n(Soil Management) vii) (moisture content, soil nutrients,\
    \ fertilizer needs and \napplication) WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification,\
    \ and \npesticide application) viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management FDC\
    \ \n(fruit detection and counting), and ix) \nThe role of various digital technologies\
    \ in smart farming is depicted in \nthese categories. Crop management characteristics\
    \ such as crop yield prediction, \ngrowth rate estimation, and harvesting period\
    \ evaluation are the most 4.0 in the \nprevious decade, whereas soil management,\
    \ fruit identification and counting, \nand crop quality management receive very\
    \ less attention. The European Union’s \nTRL scale, which divides system maturity\
    \ into three generic categories [21], is \nused to assess the technology readiness\
    \ level (TRL) of all use cases. The first \nlevel is conceptual, which corresponds\
    \ to European TRL 1–2 (use case is in \nconcept phase), the second level is prototype,\
    \ which corresponds to Europe-\n429\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nan TRL 3–6 (use case is functional even without all planned\
    \ features), and the \nthird level is deployed, which corresponds to European\
    \ TRL 7–9. (Use case \nis mature with all the possible functions). Each use case’s\
    \ TRL was produced \nin a few experiments. It has been noticed that smart agricultural\
    \ systems have \nmade little progress from the concept and prototype stages to\
    \ the commercial \nstage. The majority of use cases, for example, are still in\
    \ the prototype stage.\n4. Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies \n4.1. Internet\
    \ of Things driven agricultural systems \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is a network\
    \ of interconnected computing de-\nvices, sensors, appliances, and machines that\
    \ are all connected to the internet \nand have their own unique identities and\
    \ capacities for remote sensing and \nmonitoring [21]. Network layer (communication),\
    \ perception layer (hardware \ndevices), , middleware layer (device management\
    \ and interoperability), service \nlayer (cloud computing), application layer\
    \ (data integration and analytics), and \nend-user layer are the six layers of\
    \ the IoT reference architecture (user-inter-\nface). IoT devices on the physical\
    \ layer in the agricultural domain collect data \non environmental and crop characteristics\
    \ such as temperature, humidity, pH \nvalue, water level, leaf colour, fresh leaf\
    \ weight, and so on. The network layer is \nresponsible for transmitting this\
    \ information, and its architecture is determined \nby the field size, farm location,\
    \ and type of farming method. ZigBee, LoRa, and \nSigfox, for example, are widely\
    \ utilized and employed in outdoor fields because \nthey are less expensive, have\
    \ low energy consumption, and have a long trans-\nmission range [22, 23]. Bluetooth,\
    \ despite being a secure technology, is only \nemployed in indoor farms due to\
    \ its limited transmission range [22]. Due to its \nhigh costs and high energy\
    \ consumption, Wi-Fi is not a promising technology \nfor agricultural applications\
    \ [22]. On the other hand, RFID (radio frequency \nidentification) and NFC (near\
    \ field communication) technologies are increas-\ningly being used in agricultural\
    \ systems for product tracking [24]. For periodic \nmonitoring of environmental\
    \ and soil characteristics, GPRS or mobile commu-\nnication technology (2G, 3G,\
    \ and 4G) is utilized. Furthermore, HTTP, WWW, \nand SMTP are the most commonly\
    \ utilized communication protocols in agri-\ncultural contexts. Similarly, middleware\
    \ HYDRA and SMEPP are commonly \nused in agricultural systems to enable interoperability\
    \ and system security for \ntheir context-aware functionalities [25]. \nCloud\
    \ computing approaches are used in the service layer to store data. \nThis information\
    \ is then used on the application layer to create smart apps that \nfarmers, agriculture\
    \ experts, and supply chain professionals can use to improve \n430\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nfarm monitoring and productivity.\
    \ The use of IoT in agriculture is intended to \nprovide farmers with decision-making\
    \ tools and automation technologies that \nallow them to seamlessly integrate\
    \ knowledge, products, and services in order to \nincrease production, quality,\
    \ and profit. A slew of research have been conduct-\ned and presented on the incubation\
    \ of IoT concepts in the agricultural industry. \nThe development of IoT-based\
    \ agricultural systems has addressed a variety of \ntechnological and architectural\
    \ concerns. However, most of these technologies \nare now in the conceptual stage\
    \ or in prototype form (not commercial). Farm \nmanagement, irrigation control,\
    \ crop development, health monitoring, and dis-\nease detection are all priorities.\
    \ \nSome of these studies also explained how IoT is being used in current ag-\n\
    ricultural systems like vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydro-\n\
    ponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Furthermore, the\
    \ \nmajority of studies have been focused on a single issue.\n4.2. Wireless sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture \nA wireless sensor network (WSN) is a technology that\
    \ is utilized in an Inter-\nnet of Things (IoT) system. It is defined as a collection\
    \ of spatially distributed \nsensors for monitoring environmental physical conditions,\
    \ temporarily storing \nobtained data, and transferring the information to a central\
    \ point [22]. A wire-\nless sensor network (WSN) for smart farming is made up\
    \ of multiple sensor \nnodes connected by a wireless connection module. These\
    \ nodes have a variety \nof skills that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,\
    \ and self-diagnose (for \nexample, processing, trans- mission, and feeling).\
    \ There are various varieties of \nWSNs, which are classified based on the environment\
    \ in which they are used. \nTWSNs (terrestrial wireless sensor networks), WUSNs\
    \ (wireless underground \nsensor networks), UWSNs (underwater wireless sensor\
    \ networks), WMSNs \n(wireless multimedia sensor networks), and MWSNs (mobile\
    \ wireless sensor \nnetworks) are a few examples [26]. TWSN and UWSN are commonly\
    \ utilized \nin agricultural applications. TWSN nodes are sensors that collect\
    \ data from \nthe environment and are located above ground. The second type of\
    \ WSN is \nWUSNs, which are WSNs with sensor nodes embedded in the soil. Lower\
    \ fre-\nquencies easily enter the soil in this environment, whereas higher frequencies\
    \ \nare severely attenuated [27]. Because of the limited communication radius,\
    \ the \nnetwork requires a larger number of nodes to cover a big area. Many research\
    \ \npublications on the use of WSN for various outdoor and indoor farm applica-\n\
    tions, such as irrigation management, water quality testing, and environmental\
    \ \nmonitoring, are accessible in the literature. The goal of these experiments\
    \ was \nto create WSN architectures that were simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,\
    \ and \n431\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    scalable. However, several aspects of WSNs, such as minimum maintenance, \nrobust\
    \ and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability, require more study. \n\
    4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture \nCloud computing (CC) is defined as a model\
    \ for enabling convenient, ubiq-\nuitous, on-demand network access to a shared\
    \ pool of configurable computing \nresources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,\
    \ applications, and services) that can \nbe rapidly provisioned and released with\
    \ minimal management effort or ser-\nvice provider interaction, according to the\
    \ National Institute of Standards and \nTechnologies (NIST) [28]. The datacenter\
    \ (hardware), infrastructure, platform, \nand application layers make up the primary\
    \ architecture of CC [29]. Each of \nthese layers corresponds to one of three\
    \ cloud service models: SaaS (software \nas a service), PaaS (platform as a service),\
    \ and IaaS (infrastructure as a service) \n(IaaS). In the agriculture sector,\
    \ cloud computing has gotten a lot of attention in \nthe last decade because it\
    \ provides: 1) low-cost storage for data collected from \nvarious domains via\
    \ WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale \ncomputer systems\
    \ to make intelligent decisions by converting raw data into \nusable knowledge,\
    \ and 3) a secure platform for developing agricultural based \nIoT applications\
    \ [30]. \nCC is used to develop various agricultural applications in conjunction\
    \ with \nIoT and WSN. CC technology is also utilized to develop operational farm\
    \ man-\nagement systems (FMSs) that help farmers and farm managers monitor farm\
    \ \nactivities more efficiently. The traceability of agri-product quality is another\
    \ \narea of interest that is being investigated in global research [31]. However,\
    \ only \npreliminary research has been done to see if traceability complies with\
    \ food \nsafety and quality criteria. The usage of cloud-based agricultural systems\
    \ has \nthe potential to address issues such as rising food demand, pollution\
    \ from pes-\nticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products.\
    \ These FMSs, on \nthe other hand, lack the flexibility to offer run-time customization\
    \ in response \nto specific farmer needs. Furthermore, because most farm data\
    \ is fragmented \nand distributed, recording farm operations accurately in existing\
    \ FMSs systems \nis problematic [32].\n4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture\
    \ \nThe rapid expansion of IoT has resulted in an explosion of sensors and smart\
    \ \ndevices, creating massive amounts of data. The processing and analysis of\
    \ such a \nlarge volume of data in real time is difficult since it puts a strain\
    \ on the cloud serv-\ner and slows response times. When dealing with such a massive\
    \ data set, a cloud \nserver alone will not be able to offer real-time responses.\
    \ Furthermore, because \nIoT applications require a constant exchange of information\
    \ between devices and \n432\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nthe cloud, they are susceptible to network latency, making\
    \ CC unsuitable for these \napplications [23]. The introduction of the edge computing\
    \ idea has the potential \nto overcome the CC issues. This novel computing architecture\
    \ places computa-\ntional and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes)\
    \ closer to data sources \nlike mobile devices and sensors at the network’s edge.\
    \ This allows for real-time \nanalytics while maintaining data security on the\
    \ device [23]. Although edge com-\nputing has exciting potential for smart agriculture,\
    \ its applications in agricultural \nsystems are still in their infancy. As a\
    \ result, there are limited research studies in \nthis field. The majority of\
    \ the edge computing-based agricultural systems covered \nin these papers are\
    \ prototypes that solve a small number of challenges across a \nvariety of agricultural\
    \ disciplines. Interoperability and scalability issues haven’t \ngotten enough\
    \ attention so yet. Agricultural robots combine emerging technolo-\ngies such\
    \ as computer vision; wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite navi-\ngation\
    \ systems (GPS), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing (CC), and the \n\
    Internet of Things (IoT) to help farmers improve productivity and quality of ag-\n\
    ricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile or fixed [33]. Mobile\
    \ \nAARS can move around the working field. Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) \n\
    and unidentified aerial vehicles (UAVs) are the two types of mobile AARSs, as\
    \ \ndiscussed in the following sections. \n4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in\
    \ agriculture\nUnmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that work\
    \ with-\nout the use of a human operator on the ground. A platform for locomotive\
    \ ap-\nparatus and manipulator, navigation sensors, a supervisory control system,\
    \ an \ninterface for the control system, communication links for information exchange\
    \ \nbetween devices, and system architecture for integration between hardware\
    \ and \nsoftware agents are the main components of UGVs [34]. The control architec-\n\
    ture of a UGV can be remote-operated (controlled via an interface by a human \n\
    operator) or totally autonomous (operated without the use of a human control-\n\
    ler using artificial intelligence technology) [34]. Locomotive systems, likewise,\
    \ \ncan be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [34]. Legged robots are uncommon in\
    \ \nagriculture, despite their great terrain flexibility, inherent Omni directionality,\
    \ \nand soil protection. These robots, however, offer a disruptive locomotion\
    \ mech-\nanism for smart farms when paired with wheels (wheel-legged robots).\
    \ UGVs \nshould meet specific requirements, such as small size, maneuverability,\
    \ resil-\nience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety, in addition\
    \ to the nec-\nessary features for infield operations, in order to improve crop\
    \ yields and farm \nproductivity. A 4WD locomotive system is used in the majority\
    \ of agricultural \nrobotic systems due to its ease of manufacture and control.\
    \ \n433\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n\
    The disadvantage of 4WD is that terrains with stone elements and/or voids \nhave\
    \ a significant impact on the wheels [34]. As a result, other mechanisms, \nsuch\
    \ as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems, should be investigated. \nAlthough\
    \ some robots include computer vision systems, most of these robots \nare designed\
    \ with a low-cost computer vision system, such as traditional RGB \ncameras, due\
    \ to the difficulties of establishing an accurate and dependable sys-\ntem that\
    \ can replace manual labour. Furthermore, the majority of the systems \nmentioned\
    \ above are still in the research phase, with no large-scale commer-\ncial application.\n\
    4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture \nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\
    \ sometimes known as aerial robots, are \nplanes that do not have a human pilot\
    \ on board. There are many different types \nof UAVs [35] depending on the technology\
    \ used to fly (wing structure) and the \nlevel of autonomy. Fixed-wing (planes),\
    \ single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system \n(vertical takeoff and landing), and\
    \ multi-rotor UAVs are examples of wing types \n(drone). Drones (multi-rotor technology),\
    \ which are raised and driven by four \n(quad-rotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors,\
    \ have grown in popularity in the agricul-\nture sector because to their mechanical\
    \ simplicity in comparison to helicopters, \nwhich rely on a much more complex\
    \ plate control mechanism [36]. Similarly, \nUAVs can be tele-operated or tele-commanded,\
    \ depending on their autonomy \nlevel, with the pilot providing references to\
    \ each actuator of the aircraft to con-\ntrol it in the same way that an onboard\
    \ pilot would, or tele-commanded with the \naircraft relying on an automatic controller\
    \ on board to maintain a stable flight \n[35]. Agricultural UAVs with the right\
    \ sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, \nand hyper spectral cameras, for\
    \ example) can collect data (vegetation, leaf area, \nand reflectance indexes)\
    \ from their fields to monitor dynamic changes in crops \nthat aren’t visible\
    \ from the ground [37]. Farmers can deduce information about \ncrop illnesses,\
    \ nutrient deficits, water level, and other agricultural growth char-\nacteristics\
    \ using this data. Farmers might plan possible cures using this knowl-\nedge (irrigation,\
    \ fertilization, weed control, etc.). \nThe majority of the systems mentioned\
    \ above are still in the research stage, \nwith no large-scale commercial use.\
    \ Other issues with these UAVs include bat-\ntery life and flight time [35]. Lithium-ion\
    \ batteries are currently in use because \ntheir capacity exceeds that of conventional\
    \ batteries. \nHowever, increasing the battery capacity increases the weight of\
    \ the drone, \nand research is currently underway to overcome this issue. \nFurthermore,\
    \ existing UAVs have complicated user interfaces that can only \nbe used by experts\
    \ to accomplish agricultural chores. People who are elderly \n434\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nor unfamiliar with UAV\
    \ technology will be able to control it more readily if \nthe user interface is\
    \ improved and made more human-centered with multimod-\nal feedback. \n4.6. Big\
    \ data and analytics in agriculture \nRapid advancements in IoT and CC technologies\
    \ have massively expanded \nthe amount of data available. Textual content (structured,\
    \ semi-structured, and un-\nstructured) and multimedia content (e.g., videos,\
    \ photos, and audio) are included \nin this data, also known as Big Data (BD)\
    \ [38]. Big data analytics is the practice \nof analyzing large amounts of data\
    \ to find hidden patterns, unknown relationships, \nmarket trends, client preferences,\
    \ and other important information (BDA). Big \ndata is usually classified into\
    \ five dimensions, each of which is represented by a V. \nThe concept of BD-driven\
    \ smart agriculture is very new, but its trend is \ngood because it has the potential\
    \ to make a dramatic change in the food supply \nchain and boost food security\
    \ through higher productivity. Agricultural big data \nis typically generated\
    \ from a variety of sources in agriculture, including ground \nsensors, aerial\
    \ vehicles, and ground vehicles equipped with special cameras and \nsensors; governmental\
    \ bodies in the form of reports and regulations; private \norganizations through\
    \ online web services; farmers in the form of knowledge \ngained through surveys;\
    \ and social media [39]. Depending on the agricultural \ndomain, the data can\
    \ be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), \nbiological (plant\
    \ disease), or geospatial, and it comes in a variety of volumes, \nspeeds, and\
    \ formats [40]. The information is acquired and stored in a computer \ndatabase,\
    \ where it is analyzed using computer algorithms for seed characteris-\ntics,\
    \ weather patterns, soil attributes (such as pH or nutrient content), marketing\
    \ \nand trade management, consumer behaviour, and inventory management. In \n\
    agriculture, a range of strategies and tools are used to examine large data. The\
    \ \nmost often employed techniques include machine learning, cloud-based plat-\n\
    forms, and modelling and simulation. Machine learning technologies are used \n\
    to solve problems like prediction, clustering, and classification, while cloud\
    \ \nplatforms are utilized for large-scale data storage, preprocessing, and visual-\n\
    ization. There are still numerous potential areas where BDA can be used to \n\
    address various agricultural concerns that are not well covered in existing lit-\n\
    erature. For example, data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming \n\
    systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor\
    \ \nfarms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to help farmers design\
    \ \nindoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to help them\
    \ make \ndecisions about the physical ecosystem’s sustainability. Finally, the\
    \ majority of \nsystems are still in the prototype stage.\n435\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n4.7. Artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture \nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the study of theories and computer\
    \ systems that \ncan perform activities that need human intelligence, such as\
    \ sensory percep-\ntion and decision-making [41]. AI, particularly in the areas\
    \ of machine learning \n(ML) and deep learning (DL), is seen as one of the primary\
    \ forces driving the \ndigitization of agriculture when combined with CC, IoT,\
    \ and big data. These \ntechnologies have the potential to increase crop production,\
    \ harvesting, pro-\ncessing, and marketing in real time [42]. ML and DL algorithms\
    \ are being used \nto determine various parameters such as weed detection, yield\
    \ prediction, and \ndisease identification in a number of intelligent agricultural\
    \ systems. The fol-\nlowing two sub-sections go through these systems.\n4.7.1.\
    \ Machine learning in agriculture \nsupervised learning (linear regression, regression\
    \ trees, non-linear regres-\nsion, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression,\
    \ and support vector \nregression), and unsupervised learning (hierarchal clustering,\
    \ k-means cluster-\ning, neural networks (NN) anomaly detection, principal component\
    \ analysis, \nindependent component analysis, a-priori algorithm, and singular\
    \ value decom-\nposition (SVD)). Weed detection, Crop yield prediction, disease\
    \ and weather \nprediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation ( moisture content,\
    \ type, pH, \ntemperature, etc.), water management, fertilizer amount determination,\
    \ and \nlivestock production and management all use machine learning techniques\
    \ and \nalgorithms [2, 43]. According to the study of these publications, “crop\
    \ yield \nprediction” is an extensively researched area, with the most widely\
    \ utilized ML \napproaches to allow smart farming being linear regression [4],\
    \ neural network \n(NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ [2]. \nThe presented use cases are still in the research phase, and no commercial\
    \ \nuse has been recorded as of yet. Furthermore, AI and machine learning ap-\n\
    proaches are found to be underutilized in greenhouse and indoor vertical farm-\n\
    ing systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are \n\
    only a handful publications that use machine learning techniques. To enable \n\
    digital farming, new methodologies such as federated learning and privacy \npreserving\
    \ methods are being developed in light of the digital transformation’s \ncyber-security\
    \ and data privacy problems [44]. These methods create machine \nlearning models\
    \ from local parameters rather than sharing private data samples, \nreducing security\
    \ concerns.\n4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture \nDeep learning (DL) is an extension\
    \ of classical machine learning (ML) \nbecause extra “depth” (complexity) is added\
    \ to the model, it can accomplish \n436\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ndifficult tasks (predictions and classification)\
    \ extraordinarily well and quick-\nly. DL’s main benefit is feature learning,\
    \ which includes extracting features \n(high-level information) from big datasets\
    \ automatically [45]. Long short term \nmemory (LSTM) networks, convolutional\
    \ neural networks (CNNs), recurrent \nneural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial\
    \ networks (GANs), radial basis \nfunction networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron\
    \ (MLPs), feed-forward ar-\ntificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps\
    \ (SOMs), deep belief net-\nworks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),\
    \ and autoencoders are \nexamples of deep learning algorithms Various sites [46]\
    \ provide a full overview \nof these methods, popular architectures, and training\
    \ systems. DL algorithms \nare commonly used in agriculture to solve problems\
    \ related to computer vision \napplications that aim to predict key parameters\
    \ such as crop yields, soil mois-\nture content, weather conditions, and crop\
    \ growth conditions; detect diseases, \npests, and weeds; and identify leaf or\
    \ plant species [47]. Computer vision is an \ninterdisciplinary field that has\
    \ exploded in popularity in recent years thanks to \nthe rise of CNNs. It provides\
    \ methods and techniques for accurately process-\ning digital images and allowing\
    \ computers to analyze and comprehend the vi-\nsual world [48]. CNNs, generally\
    \ is known as Convet and its derivatives, are \nthe most widely used deep learning\
    \ algorithms in agricultural applications. \nRegion-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN,\
    \ Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-\nRCNN are some of the CNN variants, with the first\
    \ four being the most typi-\ncally used to address object detection issues. On\
    \ the other side, Mask-RCNN \nis utilized to overcome instance segmentation issues.\
    \ The reader can find a \nthorough explanation of these algorithms and their applications\
    \ in the exist-\ning bibliography [47]. Other DL approaches have been employed\
    \ in a few re-\nsearch. When it comes to datasets, the majority of deep learning\
    \ models are \ntrained on photographs, with only a few trained on sensor data\
    \ collected in the \nfield. This demonstrates that DL can be used on a wide range\
    \ of datasets. It’s \nalso worth noting that the majority of the research is focused\
    \ on outdoor farms, \nwith next-generation farms (environment-controlled) receiving\
    \ less attention. \nThough digital farming has the potential to be enabled by\
    \ DL, most systems \nare still in the prototype stage. Furthermore, the additional\
    \ obstacles created \nby cyber-security and privacy concerns necessitate the improvement\
    \ of current \ndeep learning and computer vision technologies.\n4.8. Agricultural\
    \ decision support systems \nA decision support system (DSS) is a smart system\
    \ that assists stakehold-\ners and potential users in making decisions in response\
    \ to specific needs and \nchallenges by offering operational responses based on\
    \ meaningful informa-\n437\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\ntion retrieved from raw data, documents, personal knowledge,\
    \ and/or models \n[49]. Data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven,\
    \ and \nknowledge-driven DSS are all possibilities. The following source [50]\
    \ lists the \nkey features of these DSSs. The volume of farming data has exploded\
    \ as a re-\nsult of the advent of agriculture 4.0. Platforms like agricultural\
    \ decision support \nsystems (ADSS) are necessary to convert this heterogeneous\
    \ data into practical \nknowledge in order to make evidence-based and precise\
    \ judgments about farm \nmanagement and facility layout [51]. ADSSs have gotten\
    \ a lot of interest in the \nagriculture industry over the last few years. A variety\
    \ of agricultural concerns, \nsuch as farm management, water management, and environmental\
    \ management, \nhave been addressed by a number of ADSSs. Most ADSSs have been\
    \ found \nto ignore expert knowledge, which is extremely useful since it enables\
    \ for the \nconstruction of systems that are tailored to the demands of the users.\
    \ Complex \nGUIs, insufficient re-planning components, a lack of prediction and\
    \ forecasting \nabilities, and a lack of ability to adjust to unpredictable and\
    \ dynamic elements \nare some of the other identified faults with some of these\
    \ ADDSs. It’s also worth \nnoting that all of the ADSSs are for outside agriculture\
    \ systems and are still in \ndevelopment. In comparison, the use of ADSS in indoor\
    \ soilless agriculture is \ncurrently underutilized.\n4.9. Agricultural cyber-physical\
    \ systems \nA cyber-physical system (CPS) is an automated distributed system that\
    \ inte-\ngrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infra-\n\
    structures [52], and it is one of the key technologies of Industry 4.0. There\
    \ are \nthree standard CPS reference architecture models: 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA,\
    \ \nwhich may be found in full at the following source [53]. Among these, the\
    \ 5C \nis a well-known and widely used reference model. CPS takes advantage of\
    \ a \nnumber of existing technologies, including agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented\
    \ \nreality, big data, and machine learning (ML) [54]. Scalability, flexibility,\
    \ au-\ntonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security are all improved\
    \ as a result \nof its adoption.\nOne of the most difficult domains that can benefit\
    \ from CPS technology is \nagriculture. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs)\
    \ combine advanced \nelectronic technology with agricultural infrastructure to\
    \ create integrated farm \nmanagement systems that interact with the physical\
    \ environment to keep crops \ngrowing at their best [55]. ACPSs collect high-accuracy\
    \ data regarding climate, \nsoil, and crops and utilize it to manage watering,\
    \ humidity, and plant health, \namong other things. For the management of various\
    \ services, a range of ACPSs \nhave been created; however, most of these systems\
    \ are still in the prototype and \n438\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nconceptual stages. Furthermore, the majority\
    \ of studies are for outdoor farms, \nwith only a few publications published on\
    \ soil-based greenhouse systems. There \nhas been no research on indoor soilless\
    \ agricultural methods. Since of its pro-\nspective applications in a variety\
    \ of fields, ACPSs have sparked a lot of academ-\nic interest; nevertheless, deploying\
    \ CPS models in real-world applications is \nstill a difficulty because it requires\
    \ the right hardware and software [56]. When \ndesigning ACPSs, special emphasis\
    \ should be paid to autonomy, robustness, and \nresilience in order to deal with\
    \ the unpredictable nature of the environment and \nthe unknown characteristics\
    \ of agricultural facilities. ACPSs are influenced by \na variety of factors,\
    \ including humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data.. ACPSs \nmust be properly\
    \ and extensively developed to provide a seamless operation \nwhile avoiding conflicts,\
    \ errors, and disturbances.\n4.10. Digital twins in agriculture \nA digital twin\
    \ (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) \nobject that mimics\
    \ its behaviours and states across multiple stages of the ob-\nject’s lifecycle\
    \ by combining real-world data, simulation, and machine learning \nmodels with\
    \ data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning \n[57]. The\
    \ physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, \nthe\
    \ metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and\
    \ \nvirtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate,\
    \ and \nthe physical and virtual processes are all required for a complete description\
    \ of \nthe DT concept for any physical system [58]. Because of advancements in\
    \ tech-\nnology such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ and \ncloud computing, the DT concept has gained traction. This is due to the\
    \ fact that \nthese technologies enable real-time monitoring of physical twins\
    \ at high spatial \nresolutions using both small devices and distant sensing,\
    \ which generate ev-\ner-increasing data streams [21]. In comparison to other\
    \ fields, the notion of DT \nin agricultural applications is relatively new, with\
    \ the first references appearing \nin 2017; as a result, its added value has not\
    \ yet been thoroughly studied [21]. \nBecause of its reliance on natural circumstances\
    \ (temperature, soil, humidity), \nas well as the presence of living and non-living\
    \ physical twins (plants and an-\nimals), framing is a very complex and dynamic\
    \ realm (indoor farm buildings, \ngrow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural\
    \ machinery). \nNon-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with\
    \ plants and \nanimals (living physical twins), posing more obstacles for DT in\
    \ agriculture, \nwhereas non-living physical twins are the focus of DT in other\
    \ domains such \nas manufacturing. The majority of research has been on open-air\
    \ agricultur-\nal systems. There is just one study that proposes DT for a soil-based\
    \ vertical \n439\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6,\
    \ 2022\nfarming system and one study that implements DT for a soilless vertical\
    \ farm-\ning system (aquaponics). This could be due to the difficulty of designing\
    \ and \nmanaging modern farming systems. Furthermore, the majority of DTs are\
    \ still \nin the research phase, with no commercial deployment planned. Cost savings,\
    \ \ndisaster prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management oper-\n\
    ations are all reported benefits of DT applications in agriculture, which can\
    \ be \napplied to a variety of agricultural subfields such as plant and animal\
    \ breeding, \naquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming.\
    \ While \nDT technology offers a lot of promise, achieving synchronization between\
    \ the \nreal and digital worlds is difficult. Due to the quirks of living physical\
    \ twins, \nthe intricacy of this procedure is magnified in agricultural settings.\
    \ As a result, \nagricultural DT should begin with micro-farms, which can then\
    \ be gradually up-\ngraded to a more intelligent and autonomous form by adding\
    \ more components.\n4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry \n\
    This section outlines a series of interconnected hurdles to a wider adoption of\
    \ \ndigital technologies in agriculture. Following a review of the literature,\
    \ 21 barri-\ners were found, which were divided into technical and socioeconomic\
    \ categories.\n4.12. Technical roadblocks \n•Interoperability: Data is regarded\
    \ as a critical component in the success of \nsmart systems. Agricultural data\
    \ is typically gathered from a variety of sources, \nincluding thousands of individual\
    \ farmlands, animal industries, and business ap-\nplications. Data can be in a\
    \ variety of formats, making data integration difficult. \nAs a result, after\
    \ systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge \nmining, data\
    \ interoperability is critical to increasing the value of this widely \ndistributed\
    \ data [59]. Interconnected and interoperable devices are also required \nfor\
    \ successful communication between heterogeneous devices. The system’s in-\nteroperability\
    \ can be improved through cross-technology communication [60].\n•Standardization:\
    \ Standardization of devices is required to fully use digital \ntechnologies for\
    \ smart farming applications. Differences in output can occur \nas a result of\
    \ misinterpretation and changes over time. Device, application, and \nsystem interoperability\
    \ concerns can also be overcome by standardization [25].\n•Data quality: Data\
    \ quality, as well as data security, storage, and openness, \nare essential for\
    \ producing meaningful outcomes. Another impediment to the \nadoption of smart\
    \ farming technologies is the lack of decentralized data man-\nagement systems\
    \ [9]. Multiple actors’ willingness to exchange farm data is be-\ning harmed as\
    \ a result of this problem.\n•Hardware implementation: It is incredibly difficult\
    \ to establish a smart agri-\ncultural setup in large-scale open areas. This is\
    \ due to the fact that all hardware, \n440\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\nincluding IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,\
    \ sensor nodes, machinery, and \nequipment, is directly exposed to harsh environmental\
    \ conditions such as heavy \nrainfall, extreme temperatures, extreme humidity,\
    \ high wind speeds, and a vari-\nety of other dangers that can destroy electronic\
    \ circuits or disrupt their normal \nfunctionality [61]. A possible answer is\
    \ to construct a sturdy and lasting casing \nfor all of the expensive devices\
    \ that can withstand real-world conditions [62].\n•Adequate power sources: Typically,\
    \ wireless gadgets used on farms func-\ntion for an extended period of time and\
    \ have a limited battery life. \nBecause replacing a battery in the event of a\
    \ failure is difficult, especially in \nopen-air farms where devices are strategically\
    \ located with limited access [61], a \nproper energy-saving system is required.\
    \ Low-power sensors and proper commu-\nnication management are two viable strategies\
    \ for reducing energy consumption \n[24, 63]. Other intriguing technologies to\
    \ eliminate the need for battery renewal by \nrecharging batteries using electromagnetic\
    \ waves include wireless power transfer \nand self-supporting wireless systems.\
    \ In most agricultural applications, however, \nlong-distance wireless charging\
    \ is required [9]. Another potential alternative is to \ncapture ambient energy\
    \ from rivers, fluid flow, vehicle movement, and the ground \nsurface using sensor\
    \ nodes; however the converted electrical energy is current-\nly restricted, necessitating\
    \ the need to enhance power conversion efficiency [64].\n•Reliability: The dependability\
    \ of devices, as well as the software applica-\ntions that run on them, is critical.\
    \ This is due to the fact that IoT devices must \ncollect and transmit data from\
    \ which judgments are made utilizing a variety of \nsoftware packages. Unreliable\
    \ sensing, processing, and transmission can result \nin erroneous monitoring data\
    \ reports, significant delays, and even data loss, all \nof which can have a negative\
    \ impact on agricultural system performance [25].\n •Adaptability: Agriculture\
    \ is a complicated, dynamic, and continuously \nchanging environment. As a result,\
    \ when building a system, it is critical for de-\nvices and applications to react\
    \ proactively with other entities in the face of un-\nknown and dynamic elements\
    \ in order to provide the required performance [65].\n•Robust wireless architectures:\
    \ Low-cost, wide-area coverage, enough net-\nworking flexibility, and high scalability\
    \ are all advantages of wireless networks \nand communication technologies. However,\
    \ in a dynamic agriculture environ-\nment, such as temperature swings, the movement\
    \ of live objects, and the ex-\nistence of impediments, dependable wireless connection\
    \ is a major difficulty. \nFor example, multipath propagation effects cause signal\
    \ strength oscillations, \nresulting in unstable connectivity and insufficient\
    \ data transmission [66]. These \nelements have an impact on the agricultural\
    \ system’s performance. As a result, \nrobust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures\
    \ with proper sensor node place-\n441\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture,\
    \ Том 14, №6, 2022\nment, antenna height, network topology, and communication\
    \ protocols are re-\nquired, as well as low-maintenance wireless systems [11].\n\
    •Interference: Because of the extensive deployment of IoT devices and wire-\n\
    less sensor networks, another difficulty is wireless interference and quality\
    \ of \nservice degradation. Effective channel scheduling between heterogeneous\
    \ sens-\ning devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and upcoming networking prim-\n\
    itives like concurrent transmission [67] can all help to solve these problems.\
    \ \nBecause agriculture equipment are dispersed in indoor greenhouses, outdoor\
    \ \nfarmlands, underground locations, and even aquatic areas, cross-media com-\n\
    munication between underground, underwater, and air is also necessary for full\
    \ \nintegration of smart technologies [68].\n•Security and privacy: Because smart\
    \ agricultural systems are dispersed, \nthey are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such\
    \ as eavesdropping, data integrity, de-\nnial-of-service assaults, and other sorts\
    \ of disruptions that could jeopardize the \nsystem’s privacy, integrity, and\
    \ availability [69]. With various privacy-preserv-\ning techniques and federated\
    \ learning approaches, cyber-security is a funda-\nmental concern that needs to\
    \ be addressed in the context of smart farming [44].\n•Compatibility: in order\
    \ to meet the fragmentation and scalability standards, \nthe models or software\
    \ applications developed must be adaptable and able to \nrun on any equipment\
    \ in the agricultural system [13]. \n•Resource optimization: To boost farm profitability,\
    \ farmers need a resource op-\ntimization procedure to determine the ideal number\
    \ of IoT devices and gateways, \ncloud storage size, and volume of transmitted\
    \ data. Resource optimization is diffi-\ncult since farms vary in size and require\
    \ different types of sensors to assess different \nvariables [70]. Second, most\
    \ farm management systems do not support run-time \nchanges to match the demands\
    \ of individual farmers. To estimate adequate resource \nallocation, complicated\
    \ mathematical models and algorithms are necessary [32].\n•Scalability: Due to\
    \ technological improvements, the number of gadgets, \ngear, and sensors put on\
    \ farms is continually expanding. \nGateways, network applications, and back-end\
    \ databases should all be de-\npendable and scalable in order to serve these entities\
    \ [71].\n•Human-centered user interfaces: Existing agricultural software and gadgets\
    \ \nhave complicated user interfaces, which are limiting smart farming methods.\
    \ \nThe majority of graphical user interfaces are constructed in such a way that\
    \ \nonly specialists can use them to accomplish agricultural activities. By making\
    \ \nthe user interface more human-centered and providing multimodal feedback,\
    \ a \nbigger group of individuals will be able to use it to complete various agricul-\n\
    tural tasks [35].\n442\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks \n•Gap between farmers and researchers:\
    \ Farmers’ engagement is critical to \nthe success of the agriculture industry’s\
    \ digitization. Agricultural specialists are \nfrequently unaware of the concerns\
    \ that farmers encounter during the agri-food \nproduction process, which smart\
    \ technologies could solve [16]. Furthermore, it \nis critical to completely comprehend\
    \ the nature of problems in order to create \nan appropriate smart solution. \n\
    As a result, bridging the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, \n\
    and AI researchers is critical.\n•Expenses connected with smart systems: the costs\
    \ associated with adopt-\ning smart technology and systems are a major impediment\
    \ to the agriculture \nsector’s digitization. These expenses typically include\
    \ deployment, operation, \nand maintenance. Smart system deployment costs are\
    \ typically significant since \nthey include: I hardware installation, such as\
    \ autonomous robots and drones, \nWSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure,\
    \ and ii) paying trained labour \nto do particular agricultural tasks [72]. Similarly,\
    \ subscriptions to centralized \nnetworks and software packages are necessary\
    \ to support data processing, con-\ntrol of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge\
    \ exchange, which eventually \nraises operating expenses [73]. Even if service\
    \ providers occasionally provide \nfree subscription packages with limited capabilities,\
    \ storage capacity is limited. \nPeriodic maintenance is essential to ensure the\
    \ proper operation of the smart \nsystem, which adds to the total costs.\nEnvironmental,\
    \ ethical, and societal costs may also be connected with the \nadoption of smart\
    \ devices. Initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are need-\ned to overcome\
    \ cost-related roadblocks by providing: I support services for \nbetter cost management\
    \ and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to \ntransform conventional\
    \ equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce \nhigh initial costs [73].\n\
    •Digital division: a lack of awareness of digital technology and their appli-\n\
    cations is another problem limiting the digitalization of the agriculture sector.\
    \ \nThe majority of farmers have no understanding what digital technologies are,\
    \ \nhow to install and utilize them, or which technology is appropriate for their\
    \ farm \nand matches their needs [14]. As a result, farmers must be educated on\
    \ current \nfarming technologies and processes. \nFurthermore, various tactics\
    \ are required to develop tools that use natural \nlanguage and are easily understood\
    \ by farmers with low levels of education [74]. \n•Return on investment: In agriculture,\
    \ like in other industries, the profit \nmargin is critical. When it comes to\
    \ implementing modern technologies, farm-\n443\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences\
    \ and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\ners are concerned about the time it will\
    \ take to recoup their investment and the \ndifficulty in assessing the benefits\
    \ [12].\n•Building faith in the effectiveness of smart technology in agriculture\
    \ is \ndifficult, unlike in other disciplines, because many decisions influence\
    \ systems \nthat involve both living and non-living elements, and the results\
    \ can be difficult \nto reverse [16]. In addition, the lack of verification of\
    \ the influence of digital \ntools on farm productivity exacerbates the current\
    \ difficulties.\n•Legal frameworks: different regions and nations have distinct\
    \ legal frame-\nworks that influence the deployment of digital technologies in\
    \ agriculture, par-\nticularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [31]. Similarly,\
    \ laws governing \nresource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy,\
    \ and security \ndiffer from country to country [31].\n•Connectivity infrastructure:\
    \ In most developing nations, connectivity in-\nfrastructure is poor, limiting\
    \ access to advanced digital technologies that could \nhelp turn data from disparate\
    \ sources into useful and actionable insights [10].\n4.14. Discussion \nThe goal\
    \ of this study was to describe the new digital technologies that are \nbeing\
    \ used in the agricultural industry in order to predict the future trajectories\
    \ \nof agriculture 4.0. Big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-phys-\n\
    ical systems, and digital twins are among the technologies that have yet to be\
    \ \nfully explored in agriculture. This disparity could be due to the fact that\
    \ install-\ning advanced technologies with more complex processes can be costly,\
    \ at least \nin the early stages of their acceptance. The agricultural industry’s\
    \ development \nof these technologies is expected to speed up in the next years.\
    \ The findings of \nSLR also reveal that IoT is widely used in farms. This is\
    \ owing to the IoT’s di-\nverse capabilities, which include monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and tracing, agricultural \nmachinery, and precision agriculture [21]. One of\
    \ the key research aims within \nthe farm 4.0 techniques can be regarded to be\
    \ IoT. Nonetheless, when building \nan intelligent agricultural system, only a\
    \ few researches have examined data \nsecurity and dependability, scalability,\
    \ and interoperability. The outcomes of \nthe study also revealed that the majority\
    \ of use cases are still in the prototype \nstage. The reason for this could be\
    \ that most agricultural activities involve live \nsubjects, such as animals and\
    \ plants, or perishable products, and establish-\ning systems for living subjects\
    \ is more difficult than developing systems for \nnon-living human-made systems.\
    \ Another explanation could be that, due to the \ntrans-disciplinary character\
    \ of agriculture, it is a late adopter of technology. As a \nresult, in order\
    \ to construct intelligent systems, the agricultural community must \nbecome conversant\
    \ with all digital technologies. Finally, differences in plant/\n444\nSiberian\
    \ Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol. 14, №6, 2022\ncrop species and\
    \ growth conditions complicate agricultural system digitaliza-\ntion [55]. In\
    \ contrast to indoor farms, the majority of the technologies created \nby SLR\
    \ are for open-air soil-based farms (soilless and soil-based). This is owing \n\
    to the complicated design and maintenance of indoor farms, particularly soilless\
    \ \nfarms, where the parameters and elements to be maintained are numerous (pH,\
    \ \nair temperature, humidity, etc.) [5]. However, by incorporating digital technol-\n\
    ogy and data-driven computer applications into indoor farms, a more reliable \n\
    control of the process can be attained. Furthermore, SLR reveals that insufficient\
    \ \nresearch is undertaken in three of the nine service areas described in section\
    \ 3 \n(soil management, fruit detection and counting, and crop quality management).\
    \ \nThis supports the notion that significant research and development is required\
    \ \nin some areas to ensure the successful digitization of the agriculture business\
    \ \nin both developed and developing countries. The agriculture ecosystem’s com-\n\
    plexity creates a set of interrelated hurdles that prevent full integration of\
    \ digital \ntechnology for agriculture 4.0 implementation. As a result, identifying\
    \ possible \nbottlenecks is critical in order to devise strategic strategies to\
    \ overcome them. \nThis research aims to figure out what these stumbling barriers\
    \ are. Following \nthe investigation, 21 barriers were found and characterized\
    \ on both a technical \nand socioeconomic level. These impediments are addressed\
    \ in section 5, which \noutlines what needs to be done on a bigger scale to digitize\
    \ the agricultural \neconomy. However, it is still unknown how much removing or\
    \ mitigating these \nhurdles aids in the successful integration of digital technologies.\
    \ \n4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization \nSeveral benefits that can\
    \ inspire framers and other actors to assist agriculture \nindustry digitization\
    \ have been discovered and outlined based on analysis. The \nbenefits described\
    \ here have the potential to increase farm productivity and im-\nprove product\
    \ quality, but they should not be viewed as a cure for the problems \nthat come\
    \ with smart agriculture [73]. \n•Improved agility: Farm operations can now be\
    \ more agile thanks to digital \ntechnologies. Farmers and agricultural professionals\
    \ can quickly respond to \nany anticipated changes in environmental and water\
    \ conditions using real-time \nsurveillance and forecasting technologies to save\
    \ crops [72].\n•Green process: By lowering the use of in-field fuel, nitrogen\
    \ fertilizers, \npesticides, and herbicides, digital technologies make farming\
    \ more ecologically \nfriendly and climate-resilient [75].\n•Resource efficiency:\
    \ By increasing the quantity and quality of agricultural \noutput while reducing\
    \ the use of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides, digital \nplatforms can\
    \ improve resource efficiency [3]. \n445\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and\
    \ Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\n•Time and cost savings: By automating various\
    \ tasks such as harvesting, sow-\ning, or irrigation, managing the application\
    \ of fertilizers or pesticides, and sched-\nuling irrigation, digital technologies\
    \ provide significant time and cost savings [76].\n•Asset management: digital\
    \ technologies enable real-time observation of \nfarm holdings and equipment,\
    \ allowing for theft prevention, component re-\nplacement, and routine maintenance\
    \ [10].\n•Product safety: By eliminating fraud [17, 18] linked to adulteration,\
    \ coun-\nterfeiting, and artificial enhancement, digital technologies maintain\
    \ appropriate \nfarm output and ensure a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food\
    \ products [69].\n4.17. Considerations and future prospects \nThe agricultural\
    \ industry would see major benefits as a result of the planned \nmeasures. However,\
    \ the impediments identified in section 5 must be solved first \nin order to make\
    \ things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers. Some \nof the above hurdles\
    \ can be mitigated by awareness campaigns emphasizing the \nimportance of smart\
    \ agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and \nencouraging\
    \ novel techniques (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders \nto take\
    \ an active role in the digital transformation [9]. Initiatives at the federal\
    \ \nlevel, grants and endowments, public-private collaborations, data transparency,\
    \ \nand regional research efforts can all help overcome potential hurdles. Finally,\
    \ \nwhen constructing a smart agriculture system, a roadmap can be used, starting\
    \ \nwith a basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality and\
    \ \ngradually adding components and functionality to develop a sophisticated sys-\n\
    tem with full digitization potential [21]. These issues can pave the road for\
    \ ag-\nriculture 4.0’s successful adoption. The use of explainable artificial\
    \ intelligence \nto monitor crop development, estimate crop biomass, evaluate\
    \ crop health, and \ncontrol pests and diseases is one of the future prospects\
    \ of digital technologies \nin smart agriculture. Explainable AI eliminates the\
    \ old black-box approach of \nmachine learning and allows for a better understanding\
    \ of the reasoning behind \nany given decision [15]. The use of common semantics\
    \ and ontologies to de-\nscribe big data, as well as the adoption of open standards,\
    \ has the potential to \naccelerate research and development in the field of smart\
    \ farming. Similarly, \n5G technology must be thoroughly investigated in order\
    \ to enable improved \nconnectivity and live streaming of crop data [6]. By executing\
    \ precise crop in-\nspections remotely, 5G technology will reduce internet costs\
    \ and enhance the \nentire user experience of farm management and food safety\
    \ [77]. It would also \nhelp to close the gap between stakeholders by keeping\
    \ them informed about \ncrop availability. Finally, blockchain can be used in\
    \ conjunction with IoT and \nother technologies to address data privacy and security\
    \ concerns [78]. \n446\nSiberian Journal of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Vol.\
    \ 14, №6, 2022\n4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 \nThe agriculture sector has\
    \ traditionally had a breakthrough during industri-\nal revolutions. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 offers significant potential to offset rising food \ndemands and prepare\
    \ for the future by reinforcing agricultural systems with \nWSN, IoT, AI, and\
    \ other technologies, as formally mentioned in preceding \nsections. While agricultural\
    \ 4.0 is still being implemented, agriculture 5.0 is \nalready being discussed.\
    \ \nAgriculture 5.0 builds on agriculture 4.0 by incorporating industry 5.0 prin-\n\
    ciples to provide healthy, affordable food while also ensuring that the environ-\n\
    ments on which life depends are not degraded [79]. Industry 4.0 focuses less \n\
    on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability and more on dig-\n\
    italization and AI-driven technologies for increasing efficiency and flexibility,\
    \ \nthe European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution\
    \ \n(industry 5.0) in 2021 [80]. Industry 5.0 adds to and expands on the industry\
    \ 4.0 \nconcepts by emphasizing human-centricity, sustainability, and resiliency\
    \ [81]. \nIt entails improving human-machine collaboration, decreasing environmental\
    \ \neffect through the circular economy, and designing systems with a high degree\
    \ \nof robustness to reach an ideal balance of efficiency and productivity. Among\
    \ \nthe enabling technologies of industry are cobots (collaborative robots), smart\
    \ \nmaterials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient\
    \ \nand secure data management, renewable energy sources, and others 5.0[80].\n\
    Farm production efficiency and crop quality can be improved in agriculture \n\
    5.0 settings by delegating repetitive and boring activities to machines and those\
    \ \nthat need critical thinking to humans. For this reason, agricultural cyber\
    \ physical \ncognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and conduct\
    \ ap-\npropriate actions, comparable to those established for the manufacturing\
    \ sector, \nshould be developed. This might include collaborative farm robots\
    \ that work in \nthe fields to aid crop growers with time-consuming operations\
    \ like seed sowing \nand harvesting. Similarly, digital twins in agriculture 5.0\
    \ can add substantial value \nby recognizing technical difficulties in agricultural\
    \ systems and resolving them \nmore quickly, detecting crop illnesses, and producing\
    \ more accurate crop output \nestimates. This demonstrates that agriculture 5.0\
    \ has the potential to pave the way \nfor climate-smart, sustainable, and resilient\
    \ agriculture, but it is still in its infancy. \n5. Conclusions \nConcerns about\
    \ global food security have heightened the demand for \nnext-generation industrial\
    \ farms and agricultural intensive production systems. \nDigital technologies,\
    \ such as those given by the Industry 4.0 programme, are at \n447\nSiberian Journal\
    \ of Life Sciences and Agriculture, Том 14, №6, 2022\nthe vanguard of this modern\
    \ agricultural period, providing a wide range of in-\nnovative solutions. Disruptive\
    \ technologies are being integrated into traditional \nagriculture systems by\
    \ scientists and researchers in order to boost crop yields, \ncut costs, reduce\
    \ waste, and sustain process inputs. This report includes an SLR \nthat discusses\
    \ the current state of various technologies in the agriculture sector. \nSeveral\
    \ findings are drawn, including the fact that big data and analytics inte-\ngration,\
    \ wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in \nagriculture\
    \ are still in their infancy, with the majority of use cases still in the \nprototype\
    \ stage. Similarly, 21 technological and socioeconomic impediments \nare found\
    \ and categorized. These impediments must be identified and addressed \nif the\
    \ agriculture industry is to be digitalized. The report also identifies and \n\
    presents the additional value of digital technology in the agriculture industry.\
    \ \nOverall, this research contributes to the ongoing research on agricultural\
    \ 4.0. \nThe review’s principal restriction is twofold: first, only three online\
    \ reposito-\nries (Scopus, IEEE, and Science Direct) are considered for literature\
    \ searches, \nand second, new keywords and synonyms may return more papers. The\
    \ main \nconclusions are highly unlikely to alter in either scenario. Additional\
    \ research \ndatabases and areas can be considered for future study in order to\
    \ provide a \ncomplete overview of the agriculture industry in terms of digitization.\
    \ In addi-\ntion, papers focusing on agriculture 5.0 in general will be featured.\n\

    Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In the near future, the agricultural sector is
    called to face a significant challenge due to increasingly scarce resources, extreme
    weather conditions, a growing population, and a reduction in arable land [1].
    Indeed, according to the FAO, by 2050, the world’s population will reach about
    10 billion and, to be able to feed everyone, we will have to produce 70% more
    food [2], [3]. A practical and feasible solution is to move from the old farming
    concept to smart agriculture, with the adoption of information and communications
    technologies (ICTs) that help farmers to monitor, manage, and optimize their operations
    more effectively [4]. In particular, the introduction of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) applications, every single step of agricultural production can be improved:
    from soil management to minimizing water consumption, from plant protection to
    animal health and farm automation [5], [6]. Smart devices located infields are
    able to collect information and control the evolution of the different processes
    at various production stages. Besides, the miniaturization of electronic components
    allows to implement IoT sensors with reduced form factor and energy consumption,
    monitoring many variables of interest, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed
    and direction, soil conditions, chemical concentrations, crop growth, and solar
    exposure, as well as possible damages caused by drought, hail, or flooding. IoT
    systems integrate all this and other data and turn it into useful statistics:
    for example, predictive analysis allows farmers to use the strictly necessary
    resources (water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc.) and only where there is a real
    need, e.g., for poorly irrigated areas of the field, weak or sick plants, etc.
    [7], [8]. Despite such potential benefits, the deployment of smart agriculture
    systems is still in its infancy. Indeed, an obstacle to the digitization of agriculture
    is the lack or limitations of Internet connectivity in many areas. In the literature,
    several communication protocols have been proposed, with different characteristics
    related to cost, coverage, power consumption, and reliability [9]. Among the available
    technologies (summarized in Fig. 1 in terms of power consumption and coverage
    range), low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), enlightened in a dashed box in
    Fig. 1 represent the best solution for supporting smart agriculture requirements.
    One of the most adopted LPWAN technology is LoRaWAN, which offers wide network
    coverage, built-in security, low cost, and limited power consumption during operation
    [10]. Fig. 1. Classification of wireless technologies: power consumption versus
    communication range [11]. Show All Indeed, LoRaWAN is an open system based on
    a very robust modulation (called LoRa), which provides several interesting features
    for covering rural areas with simple devices [9]. For such reasons, LoRa has been
    widely employed and tested in the agricultural field, connecting environmental
    sensors measuring temperature, air/soil moisture, etc., or to control different
    kinds of actuators (e.g., irrigation valves), and in applications, such as tractor
    communications, livestock monitoring, and location tracing [12], [13], [14]. Differently
    from existing surveys, which either treat LoRa together with all other IoT solutions
    or consider very specific technological aspects, we consider the adoption of these
    systems from an holistic perspective. For example, LoRa is cited in [5] in the
    general framework of IoT; [7] cites LoRa among the most promising technologies
    for agricultural IoT, and the same plan is followed by [8] which dedicated a Section
    to LoRa in Enabling Communication Technologies; similarly [15] includes LoRa in
    IoT communication protocols suitable for smart agriculture. On the other hand,
    [16] is specific to LoRa but is focused only on the protocol performance, [13]
    takes into consideration only the energy consumption of LoRa, [17] discusses the
    application of the technologies of industry 4.0 in the context of smart agriculture.
    Papers [18] and [19] deal with specific issues meaning the decision support system
    (DSS) and robotics in agriculture, respectively. Instead, in this article, we
    strive to provide a thorough and focused analysis on LoRa/LoRaWAN application
    in smart agriculture, offering a comprehensive view of the advancements and in-field
    applications of this IoT technology. LoRaWAN relies on LoRa modulation, a robust
    chirp-based modulation scheme, patented by Semtech [20]. It supports wireless
    connectivity with limited data rates over large areas and without the need of
    an operator. LoRaWAN is widely used in smart industry, smart home, smart city
    and, increasingly, in the smart agriculture environment. In the view of the authors
    of this article, LoRaWAN possesses five main strengths (low-cost, long-range,
    low-power, no-operator, and unlicensed spectrum) that can bridge the gap between
    smart agriculture and smart cities or industries. Moreover, several recent improvements
    on the resource allocation, channel access protocol, and network planning can
    enhance the efficiency of LoRaWAN networks, reducing capital and operational costs
    [21]. In rural areas, several experiments have demonstrated good coverage of LoRa
    [22], [23], [12]. Coverage ranges of up to 5 and 47 km have been obtained in the
    non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and line-of-sight (LOS) propagation conditions, respectively.
    In addition, in the case of NLOS propagation, the coverage range can be increased
    by using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [24], [25]. In terms of power consumption,
    LoRa offers up to 15 years of battery life to its devices. The low power consumption
    is a key feature of LoRa that makes it an ideal choice for smart agriculture applications.
    It was demonstrated experimentally that the estimated battery lifetime of a LoRa
    device may be six times that of a Wi-Fi device and two times that of a ZigBee
    device [26]. In this article, we provide a broad survey of LoRa-based smart agriculture
    systems, analyzing the state-of-the-art and highlighting for each solution the
    possible adoption of Machine Learning, control automation techniques, and energy
    autonomy features. We classify these works in four main categories: 1) irrigation
    systems; 2) plantation and crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock
    monitoring. These LoRa systems are analyzed in terms of scalability, interoperability,
    network architecture, energy efficiency, and point out some open issues which
    traverse most of the current smart agriculture systems. References have been selected
    based on recent papers dealing with smart agriculture; however, some contributions
    in different fields useful as a benchmark are cited as well. Finally, we present
    the lessons learned and draw future research directions which we think crucial
    for the success and widespread of such technologies. The remainder of this article
    is structured as follows. Section II provides an overview of LoRa technology and
    its perspectives in agriculture, while Section III offers a brief summary on smart
    agriculture applications and their main challenges. Section IV reports on general
    purpose LoRa-based IoT platforms applied to smart agriculture. Section V, instead,
    discusses specific vertical solutions for smart agriculture, according to the
    four above-mentioned categories. Lessons learned and future research directions
    are proposed in Section VI. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section VII. SECTION
    II. LoRa and Its Perspectives in Agriculture LoRa technology is a proprietary
    physical layer technology patented by Semtech, which is revealing as a promising
    solution for large-scale low-power IoT deployments, including smart agriculture
    applications. Indeed, by operating in the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and
    medical (ISM) radio bands and with a robust chirp-based modulation scheme, LoRa
    provides a cheap solution for supporting wireless connectivity with limited data
    rates (from 0.3 to 27 kb/s) in large areas and without the need of an operator.
    Moreover, LoRa transmissions are regulated by having a maximum transmission power
    of 25 mW (14 dBm) in the uplink, a configurable bandwidth of 125, 250, or 500
    kHz, and a duty cycle of 0.1%, 1.0%, and 10%, which permit low energy consumption.
    In some scenarios, the battery of LoRa devices can last up to 15 years. Although
    LoRa technology is limited to the physical layer, different network solutions
    can be built on top of it, by exploiting its transmission interfaces. Among these,
    the most consolidated one is the open-source solution promoted by the LoRa Alliance,
    which is called LoRaWAN [27]. LoRaWAN networks are based on a simple star of star
    topology (Fig. 2): end-devices (EDs), such as sensors or actuators deployed infield,
    transmit packets on the wireless medium to fixed nodes called gateways (GWs),
    which, in turn, forward the collected packets to a central network server (NS)
    interacting with several application servers (ASs) [28]. The network infrastructure
    between GWs, NS, and ASs is typically based on a wired Internet technology, while
    EDs are not associated to a specific GW, which greatly simplifies implementation
    (e.g., in case of mobility [29]): in case a duplicate packet is simultaneously
    received by multiple GWs, the NS is responsible of filtering these packets and
    performs other simple decisions on network configuration. Fig. 2. LoRaWAN typical
    architecture. Show All To minimize the protocol complexity and the energy consumption,
    LoRaWAN employs a simple Aloha MAC protocol and defines three classes of devices
    (Fig. 3). Device classes represent different ways of managing the reception operations
    performed by the EDs. Class A devices, corresponding to the lowest energy profile,
    can receive downlink packets only in two time windows following the transmission
    of their own packet to the GW. In other words, devices can sleep all the time
    and downlink transmissions are triggered only after an uplink one. Class B devices
    add to this possibility a periodic scheduling of reception windows, by keeping
    a time synchronization with the GW. Finally, class C devices are constantly listening
    to the channel for downlink packets. Any time that a new packet is ready for transmission,
    devices attempt to transmit by randomly selecting one of the available channels
    in the ISM bands (e.g., in the 868 MHz there are 16 channels in Europe), together
    with a modulation parameter called spreading factor (SF). More into details, six
    different SFs are used in LoRa (from SF7 to SF12), which result in different symbol
    times and in almost orthogonal transmissions: when two signals modulated at different
    SFs overlap, the GW is able to decode both transmissions in a wide range of power
    ratios among the signals [30]. Unlike many other IoT technologies, the LoRaWAN
    specification offers dedicated end-to-end encryption to application providers,
    together with network-level security primitives, which allow sharing the same
    network among multitenant applications [31]. Fig. 3. LoRaWAN technology stack.
    Show All Summarizing, the ease of deployment with excellent coverage, the availability
    of devices with very low energy demand, and intrinsic security mechanisms make
    these systems very suitable for innovative agriculture applications. Indeed, several
    state-of-the-art IoT applications in smart agriculture are based on LoRa/LoRaWAN
    networks. For example, LoRa is used to connect sensor nodes measuring environmental
    parameters or to control different kinds of actuators (e.g., solenoid valve for
    irrigation purposes), and in applications such as livestock monitoring and location
    tracing [13], [10], [14]. These applications are not critical for data rates and
    latency, but often require to work in large rural areas, with limited access to
    energy grids and the Internet, and with decision mechanisms which benefit from
    data-driven learning. SECTION III. Smart Agriculture Applications and Challenges
    While industrial production processes have already become smarter and autonomous
    thanks to the implementation of the so called Industry 4.0 concept, the integration
    of technologies such as IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and big data
    is more recent in agriculture. The availability of IoT technologies for supporting
    wireless connectivity in rural areas and controlling infields smart objects shows
    a great potential for improving the agricultural sector, toward the so called
    smart agriculture [17], [18], [19]. Indeed, farm monitoring and automation can
    make production more efficient and sustainable [7], by promptly detecting and
    reacting to water or moisture stress, wastes of raw materials, crops’ diseases,
    pests, and nutrient deficiencies, as well as problems related to the wellbeing
    of farm animals. The interest on the development of smart agriculture applications
    has been demonstrated by the recent commercialization of agricultural sensors
    and robots (called Agribots), specifically designed for reducing the intense physical
    labor traditionally required in agriculture [15]. Apart from the availability
    of smart devices for interacting with the farm in the physical world, smart agriculture
    applications require to build a digital representation of the farm status and
    a decision logic based on the collected data. Different protocols can be envisioned
    both for providing the wireless connectivity to heterogeneous devices (from simple
    low-cost temperature sensors, to complex remote-controlled robots) and exporting
    data for analysis and decisions [32], [33]. Since a large amount of data can be
    produced by agricultural sensors, big data analysis can provide efficient monitoring
    and processing methods [34]. Data processing may involve various features such
    as data loading, validation, aggregation, prediction, classification, image or
    video processing, and data mining. Thus, based on the acquired data, DSSs can
    optimize the productivity and reduce the ecological footprint of the farm. Researchers
    recognize that digitization of farming processes and activities is an important
    challenge for the adoption of smart agriculture technologies [32], [35]. In particular,
    the major challenges to digitization in agriculture can be categorized as follows.
    Communication Issues: As we will detail later, large-scale implementations of
    IoT solutions require robust and secure network architectures. The reliability
    of communicating information still represents a challenge to be addressed in the
    agricultural context and justifies the adoption of LoRa/LoRaWAN technologies.
    Energy Management: The power supply in devices for smart agriculture is a significant
    challenge and energy harvesting systems are a relevant area of research. The main
    issue concerns the sensor’s power supply and how to optimize efficiently the power
    consumption. Moreover, distributed nodes can execute some computations (Edge computing)
    which consumes more energy, while sensor batteries have a limited capacity. Consequently,
    smart devices require efficient energy storage and supply. Data/Device Heterogeneity:
    In general, the agricultural data is produced by heterogeneous sensors (soil sensors,
    weather sensors, trunk sensors, leaf sensors, etc.). In addition, IoT devices
    generally use different network protocols and platforms. Thus, in addition to
    sensors heterogeneity, network and protocol heterogeneity should be considered
    as well. Getting these technologies to work together is often an issue, especially
    for unskilled farmers. Physical Deployments: Spatial deployment of devices on
    farms proves to be a significant challenge, especially when the entire farm needs
    to be monitored across a large area and with different application scenarios (soil,
    plants, trees, animals, etc.). Data Management: The difficulty of interpreting
    the data can be a huge barrier: indeed, numerous sensors are necessary and big
    data analysis could be required to better understand and forecast the unpredictability
    of agricultural ecosystems. Generic Platform: To promote the adoption of smart
    agriculture technologies is often required to develop user friendly software platforms.
    The challenge here is to build a universal platform that can be easily modified
    to support different types of monitoring ranging from specific crop to livestock.
    These challenges, together with the cost of infrastructure investment, the complexity
    of technologies, lack of farmers’ education and training, data ownership, and
    privacy and security concerns, has motivated the research and development of innovative
    platforms, specific network technologies, and new architectures for smart agriculture
    [32], [35]. SECTION IV. Generic LoRa-Based Platforms Since agricultural applications
    are widely different, varying from soil and air monitoring, to irrigation automation
    and livestock breeding, several general purpose IoT platforms have been adapted
    for farmers to accommodate all these applications together under a unified, easy
    to understand and simple to use interface. Therefore, in this section, we will
    discuss some of these LoRa-based platforms horizontally designed for smart agriculture,
    while in the next one, we will dig into more vertical and application-specific
    systems, focusing on the four reference scenarios depicted in Fig. 4. Fig. 4.
    Four reference applications in smart agriculture. Show All Generic and open IoT
    platforms can indeed help to digitize farms by integrating numerous agriculture
    applications, harmonizing specific sensing devices, actuators, and decision logics,
    which exhibit heterogeneous requirements in terms of network bandwidth, latency,
    sensors’ complexity, and energy requirements. A clear example is constituted by
    FIWARE [36], a powerful open-source platform, sponsored by the European Commission,
    that provides standardized interfaces for many different IoT sectors including
    agriculture. The FIWARE platform includes several parts called generic enablers
    (GEs), which provide components and reference implementations that support specific
    APIs, and can integrate data collected from heterogeneous sensors using different
    communication technologies, to create custom applications [37], [38]. Several
    GEs are available making it easier to interface with IoT systems, and the IoT
    Agent for LoRaWAN offers a bridge between LoRaWAN and the FIWARE Context Broker
    (the core component of the “Powered by FIWARE” platforms). Moreover, FIWARE can
    be combined with other third-party platforms to provide accessible tools to worldwide
    farmers and consumers too [39]. Another example is the work in [40] where low-cost,
    LoRa-based devices are used for soil temperature and humidity monitoring, and
    the data is processed and sent to the Cayenne IoT Platform for storage and visualization
    [41]. This platform is a drag and drop project builder for developers and engineers
    that can be used in different IoT applications. It encompasses cloud-based web
    applications as well as mobile apps for Android and IOS devices. Cayenne can integrate
    any tool into the library with a wide variety of IoT ready-to-use devices and
    connectivity options. Other LoRaWAN-based IoT platforms are more specific to the
    agricultural world, aiming at improving the management of generic farms in a highly
    customizable way. For example, the LoRaFarM platform [42] has a generally applicable
    “core” infrastructure, which can be completed with specialized ad-hoc modules
    depending on the farm’s characteristics and requirements. The LoRaFarM platform
    derives its topological structure from the LoRaWAN architecture, since low-level
    communication patterns are built around the LoRaWAN technology (see Fig. 5). Hence,
    expansion modules can be added at farm level (or low level), if they include physical
    hardware to be installed in the deployment (sensors or actuators), as well as
    a high level, in case data processing is needed. The middleware, in the LoRaFarM
    domain, refers to the set of entities and technologies by which data coming from
    farm-level modules are collected, stored, and exposed to high-level modules. This
    middleware can be defined as a sort of “connecting layer” between the farm and
    the back-end domain. Fig. 5. LoRaFarM platform: levels and parallelism with LoRaWAN
    [42]. Show All One of the main advantages of the LoRaFarM platform is that heterogeneous
    subnetworks, in terms of capabilities (transmission range, data throughput, and
    energy consumption), can be incorporated without altering the platform structure
    and, thus, making it highly scalable, flexible, and suitable for a wide range
    of scenarios. Indeed, this gives the freedom to choose the most suitable communication
    protocols and traffic policy to monitor and control the farm different areas,
    such as greenhouses and fields. Messages between nodes employing different protocols
    are translated by a multiprotocol GateWay (mpGW), enabling communications between
    non-LoRaWAN-enabled nodes and the LoRaFarM middleware, in a seamless way. Its
    protocol translation functionality, the mpGW can be enriched with edge computing
    features, to process and aggregate sensor data. Moreover, LoRaFarM can be extended
    with new functionalities like data analysis and prediction of the evolution of
    environmental parameters to prevent plant diseases, relying on AI and Machine
    Learning techniques. Finally, the mySense environment proposed by Silva et al.
    [58] is a sensor data integration framework aimed to systematize data acquisition
    procedures to address common smart agriculture issues. It facilitates the use
    of low cost platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi, making available a set
    of free tools based on the do it yourself (DIY) concept. The mySense platform
    builds over a 4-layer technological structure (sensor nodes, crop field and sensor
    networks, cloud services and front-end applications) and is accordingly divided
    into four levels of operation: Level 1, for data collection using common data
    transfer technologies (ZigBee, GSM/GPRS, LoRa, etc.); Level 2, for GWs (possibly)
    running local tasks according to the fog or edge computing paradigms; Level 3
    for storing data in the cloud; and Level 4 for high-level applications. Data can
    arrive from any device provided that complies with the data formats allowed by
    the platform. Summary and Insights: This Section discussed LoRa-based platforms
    which can be exploited to unify different applications into one simple and easy-to-use
    platform. Platforms such as Fiware, Cayenne, LoRaFarM, and mySense provide standardized
    interfaces to integrate different agricultural applications with each other. These
    platforms provide ready-to-use solutions and connectivity between heterogeneous
    networks. With these platforms, LoRa can integrate and complement existing systems
    based on other network technologies (ZigBee, Bluetooth, etc.), making them highly
    scalable. SECTION V. Application-Specific LoRa Platforms In this section, we provide
    an in-depth review focusing four reference scenarios: 1) irrigation systems; 2)
    plantation and crop monitoring; 3) tree monitoring; and 4) livestock monitoring,
    which broadly cover most of smart agriculture applications. A. Irrigation Systems
    Accurate monitoring of the soil water status allows to achieve seasonal water
    savings of up to 90% compared to traditional management, increasing productivity
    and introducing significant savings in energy costs for the water pumps management
    [59]. To improve water management in agriculture, it is necessary to analyze and
    monitor the complex water interactions that occur in field, following the concept
    of soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) continuum systems [60]. Indeed, the knowledge of
    the water status of the SPA system plays a significant role for understanding
    the crop water stress and implement water saving mechanisms with a minimal effect
    on the production [59]. Measuring the evapotranspiration (ET), which refers to
    the amount of water that passes from the soil into the air due to the combined
    effect of plant transpiration and evaporation, is another complex task. Examples
    of these sensors are the lysimeters or sophisticated micro-meteorological sensors
    (e.g., Eddy covariance), whose cost and complexity limit their application to
    research studies [61]. Cheaper systems are the time domain reflectometry (TDR)
    technique or gravimetric methods [62], whose main limit is the difficulty in calibration
    and automation. Some LoRa-based irrigation systems are implemented using development
    boards such as Arduino, ESP32, Pycom, or STM32, e.g., [43], [44], [47], [48],
    [46], and [51]. Few of them also include energy harvesting modules, such as an
    hydroelectric generator, allowing them to operate for decades. For example, the
    LoRaWAN-based irrigation system in [51] comprises an energy-neutral irrigation
    node (Fig. 6) with the following modules: controller module, power module, irrigation
    module, and transmitter module. Fig. 6. Energy-neutral irrigation node described
    in [51]. Show All Exploiting AI and data coming from different sensor, such as
    air temperature and humidity, soil temperature and humidity, light intensity,
    etc. makes possible to develop and train specific irrigation models to calculate
    the exact amount of water to be distributed. For example, the works [54], [55],
    [56] provide machine-learning-based smart irrigation systems, all employing LoRa
    technology. In particular, in [55], a random forest classifier predicts the soil
    moisture and, thus, irrigation is planned accordingly. In [54], instead, multiple
    linear regression algorithm is employed to train the model using two highest correlation
    coefficient features: 1) light intensity and 2) soil humidity. Data is collected
    with a LoRa P2P network, which uses a master–slave and TDMA-based MAC protocol.
    Each slave node has a unique address and can transmit a packet in each of the
    reserved TDMA time slots. Alternatively, a Penman-Monteith-based irrigation model
    allows for an optimal irrigation strategy for different crop growth periods and
    uses the ET parameter to estimate the amount of water [63]. This solution requires
    an integration of actuators, sensors and a meteorological station in a LoRa network
    [49], [50]. In addition, third-party services such as weather information or fog
    computing may be needed to decide on irrigation schedules [57]. Since in LoRaWAN,
    the latency of downlink communication from GW to Class-A nodes (sensors or actuators)
    is relatively long (must first wait for an uplink transmission), few systems employ
    alternative Master/Slave protocols [52], [53], [54]. These protocols increase
    the stability of the LoRa irrigation system, avoiding packet collisions and, thus,
    can save water during the close command of the solenoid valve. Finally, AREThOU5A
    [43] is an example of a water management system that combines data collected from
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in the field and satellite data provided by international
    weather forecast services, to achieve efficient water usage strategies for farmers.
    It employs a WSN with two different sensors for measuring the temperature and
    the soil moisture in field. A routing subsystem controls and routes the data and
    information through LoRaWAN and TCP/IP with SSL network interfaces. The LoRa network
    is used to collect data from the EDs and perform administration processes, while
    the TCP/IP SSL works as a bridge to the rest of the network architecture. Summary
    and Insights: Comparing the characteristics of different irrigation systems, summarized
    in Table I, it is relevant to note that most of these LoRa-based irrigation systems
    adopt temperature, humidity, and soil moisture sensors. However, albeit all cited
    papers are recently published, ML is used only in 1/3 of the applications. TABLE
    I LoRa-Based Irrigation System Comparison Furthermore, only 13% of these irrigation
    systems used an evapotranspiration-based methodology. This strategy, which is
    often expensive, may be accomplished by combining inexpensive sensors and AI (with
    a more comprehensive approach integrating meteorological variables measured by
    a weather station with variables measured by soil sensors into the system), significantly
    lowering the cost of direct evapotraspiration measurements. Such improvements
    could lead to more effective water management, with the simultaneous impact of
    decreasing water usage and increase crop output. Finally, LoRaWAN communications
    can be tuned to adapt the duty cycle and manage the system optimally: for example,
    when the irrigation system is not in use, sensor data could be collected every
    hour or even less, while when irrigation is taking place the measurements could
    be increased to every 5–10 min. This way, the use of water and energy could be
    further reduced [71]. B. Plantation and Crop Monitoring Plantation and crop monitoring
    requires a large number of sensors to obtain an effective control and, thus, increase
    productivity, especially when agricultural fields are very heterogeneous. For
    example, in order to optimize the production while minimizing the ecological footprint,
    it is necessary to control the injection of pesticides and fertilizers [72], [73],
    increasing yields up to 10% and saving fertilizers up to 37% [74]. Such control
    can be performed by varying the pesticides and fertilizer application rate over
    time and space. Crops do not always need a uniform application, as some areas
    have different requirements due to their location (sunlight, soil features, etc).
    Over-fertilization can deteriorate water quality, favor weed growth, and reduce
    profit. Vice-versa under-fertilization restricts yield or reduces crop quality
    [75]. The application rate can be modified based on weather impacts, nutrient
    availability, and seasonal cycles [73], [75]. Some optical or ultrasonic sensors
    indirectly assess the nutrient request (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc.)
    of the crop at the time of application [72]. In addition, to reduce the loss of
    productivity in crops, surveillance systems can be adopted [76]. Providing visual
    monitoring to growers can prevent crops from getting damaged by intruders, ensure
    the field conditions or enable the detection of pests attacks remotely. Although
    there are plenty of devices which can be exploited for building a real-time visual
    monitoring system, deploying them in a wide area and over wireless channels can
    be challenging [77], [78], [79]. Table II summarizes the main characteristics
    of several plantation and crop monitoring systems, based on LoRa technology. The
    nodes used in these systems should be of small dimensions, self-sufficient in
    terms of energy, relatively cheap, and often able to acquire a large variety of
    parameters. For example, three different sensor nodes have been developed by Valente
    et al. [64] and tested in a vineyard field: node 1, with an ultrasonic anemometer
    (that measures the direction and speed of the wind) and a sensor that monitors
    bulk electrical conductivity, in addition to volumetric water content (by measuring
    soil permittivity) and soil and air temperature; node 2, an irrometer watermark
    soil water tension sensor; and node 3, an all-in-one weather station with 12 sensors
    to measure air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure, barometric pressure,
    wind speed, gust and direction, solar radiation, precipitation, lightning strike
    counter, and distance. It should be remarked that each node contains sensors which
    differ for the sampling rate, accuracy, and supplied energy. The nodes send data
    using LoRaWAN to a GW that is connected to a the things network (TTN) server.
    In the TTN server, data is decoded and sent to the ThingSpeak [80] platform for
    visualization and possible analysis and aggregation. Fig. 7 summarizes the different
    blocks composing the nodes: 1) a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) applied to
    a photovoltaic source and connected with a storage system; 2) a dc/dc switching
    converter to interface the source with the storage system and loads; 3) the LoRaWAN
    module for communication; and 4) the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) module
    to convert the signals available from sensors. TABLE II LoRa-Based Plantation
    and Crop Monitoring System Comparison Fig. 7. Block diagram of the sensor nodes
    taken from [64]. Show All In [66] a LoRa-based IoT monitoring system for starfruit
    plantation is presented. The LoRa network implemented includes three nodes and
    one master, and it can cover a range of 700 m. For optimal growth, starfruit plants
    need soil pH conditions between 5.5–7.5. Thus, thanks to the proposed LoRa system,
    the farmers can make important and precise decisions about how to grow the crop.
    Similarly, works [65], [67], [68], [69], [58] present solutions to increase production
    and fruit quality, with optimal use of resources through LoRa-based networks.
    The Smart Mushroom Cultivation is a system used to automatize the production of
    expensive mushrooms [67]. The smart system includes devices to monitor and control
    humidity and C O 2 levels through sensors and actuators all connected using LoRaWAN.
    The sensor nodes measure the ambient condition inside Mushroom House (humidity,
    temperature, and C O 2 ), and data is sent to the remote server for monitoring
    and analysis. An automatic control maintains the ambient conditions between the
    required levels. Finally, there are cases where anomaly detection near the sensor
    is required to allow decisions and actions as soon as possible. In this direction,
    Brunelli et al. [70] proposed a new paradigm of monitoring and pest detection
    to improve the performance of an apple orchard. They add intelligence to the LoRa
    nodes, shifting the detection of anomalies near the sensor. The application is
    developed on a low-energy platform powered by a solar panel, realizing an energy-autonomous
    system capable of operating unattended continuously over LoRa networks. Summary
    and Insights: Plantation and crop monitoring requires the control of numerous
    parameters, captured by different heterogeneous sensors deployed in the agricultural
    fields. Some of the sensors used in the cited papers are specific to the type
    of crop, while others (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.) are deployed in almost
    all of the literature works. In addition, the use of AI is not yet widely adopted,
    and only three out of nine papers adopt automatic control for the implementation
    of DSSs. An innovative approach in this context would be to add intelligence to
    the LoRa nodes, while moving the DSS closer to the sensor. Finally, note that
    the maximum size of the LoRa payload is 250 bytes; this allows a wide variety
    of parameters to be monitored and transferred in a single packet. For example,
    Sacaleanu and Kiss [69] send eight agri-meteorological measurements in a single
    LoRa packet of only 16 bytes. C. Tree Monitoring Trees are essential in modern
    society and are widely applied in a great number of scenarios including soil erosion
    prevention, air purification, wood or fruit production. For supporting the managers
    of urban/rural green infrastructures and forests, it is important to constantly
    monitor the tree conditions, in terms of growth rate and failure risk, as well
    as micro-climate parameters in the tree surrounding areas. The analysis of this
    data allows the characterization of the trees functional responses to their environment
    and a prompt action in case of problems. Tree monitoring also requires reliable
    long-range communications in the presence of foliage, large sensor densification
    (i.e., one sensor per tree), and measurements of various physiological/biological
    parameters from specific locations (at the root, the trunk, or the branch) as
    a function of vegetation type to obtain accurate readings [83]. In these systems,
    it is also important to measure changes in position over time or instantaneous
    trunk accelerations. Table III summarizes the main characteristics of relevant
    Monitoring systems. TABLE III LoRa-Based Sensors Applications in Tree Farms One
    of the main properties to be measured is the water transport in the xylem of the
    trunk (called the sap flow). A possible measurement method is the Heat Balance
    Method, developed by Granier [91], [92], which is based on analyzing the temperature
    difference among two probes inserted into the stem wood at a 10 cm distance along
    the vertical trunk axis. The probe in the higher position is heated, while the
    lower one provides the stem wood reference temperature. The temperature difference
    generated between the probes represents an index of the transpiration activity
    of the plant, expressed as a variation of the flux density. This method can be
    used for accurate measurements of sap flow in plants, providing a reliable calibration
    procedure to relate the temperature difference to the actual sap flow [93]. For
    example, the TreeTalker (TT) [81] is a device that measures sapflow (water transport
    in the trunk), wood temperature and humidity, multispectral signature of light
    transmitted through the canopy, tree trunk radial growth, accelerations along
    a 3-D coordinate system used to detect tree movements, air temperature, and relative
    humidity, which can be additionally complemented by soil temperature and volumetric
    water content. A TT node is connected via LoRa wireless connection to a GW, that
    manages up to 48 devices in one cluster. The GW is, in turn, connected to the
    Internet via GPRS and sends data to a computer server. This technology can be
    applied to monitor the root plate tilt, as well as the flexion and the accelerations
    that tree trunks receive under the force of the wind for the evaluation of tree
    failure risk. Another solution to analyze the health condition of a tree consists
    on the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), it is a well-known technique with
    a wide range of applications. EIS has been applied to characterize solids, liquids,
    both in the laboratory and industrial environments. Moreover, assessment of physiological
    states of some trees (pinus, chestnut, etc.) has also been studied. The method
    based on bioimpedance indexes allows determining three distinct physiological
    states: healthy and watered plants, plants with a high level of hydric stress,
    and plants with disease [94], [95], [96]. For example, Amaro et al. [82] integrated
    an EIS system in a sensor node to analyze the health condition of the tree and
    transfer the results through the LoRaWAN protocol. Finally, tree monitoring systems
    are often influenced by the presence of foliage which can severely impact wireless
    communication systems performance. This generally leads to node densification
    to increase coverage levels, especially in large areas, resulting in additional
    costs and constraining the design of LoRa systems in nonhomogeneous vegetation
    environments [84], [85], [97]. For such reasons, a small drone with a GW is sometimes
    required for collecting data from nodes and solving the Fresnel zone radio propagation
    issues encountered in tree farms [98], [86]. Summary and Insights: In this section,
    some methodologies for monitoring tree health have been discussed. It is important
    to highlight how LoRa can be easily integrated into these systems, e.g., to measure
    the lymph flow or bio-impedance of trees. In case the parameter to be monitored
    involves roots, it has been shown that LoRa can be used for under-ground or near-ground
    communications too [12], [99]. Finally, the use of drones for data collection
    has been exploited to solve the problem of foliage scattering. D. Livestock Monitoring
    System Smart livestock practices aim at improving the productive and reproductive
    parameters, feeding and handling of feces, producing a direct effect on the increment
    of the farmers’ income, and also better milk and meat production [100]. The implementation
    of these practices requires to monitor the general health conditions of the animals,
    by tracking some biological signals to be associated to symptoms of disease, estrus
    and calving [101]. Wearable sensor technologies provide the possibility of remotely
    managing individual animals facilitating urgent interventions, responding to time
    and labor-intensive concerns in a more efficient way [87]. In extensive livestock
    production systems, the absence of access to networking and animal contact presents
    a barrier to the effective use of these technologies. Wearable sensors, to be
    more practical for extensive management settings, must: 1) network over longer
    distances; 2) have reliable power supplies (preferably renewable); 3) be low-cost
    so that damaged and lost sensors are less economically impactful; and 4) transmit
    data in real time. For these reasons, LoRaWAN technology is indicated for above
    described applications, some of which are summarized in Table IV. Primarily, these
    systems are used to monitor the animal health, but by integrating LoRa technology
    with a GPS, remote grazing systems can be implemented [87], [88]. TABLE IV LoRa-Based
    Sensor Applications in Livestock Monitoring Animal monitoring can involve completely
    different scenarios; as a consequence, the LoRa network architecture could require
    a more specific design effort to work either in indoor or outdoor settings. For
    example, the work in [89] proposes two different versions of GWs: an indoor GW,
    designed for installation in sheltered areas such as barns and cowsheds and oriented
    toward dairy cattle livestock scenarios, and an outdoor version, more specific
    for open areas such as paddocks and pasture lands, and designed for beef cattle
    livestock scenarios. The indoor GW is conceived for monitoring several important
    physical parameters typical of the shed environment, such as temperature, relative
    humidity, illuminance, carbon dioxide (C O 2 ) , and ammonia (N H 3 ) concentration,
    while the main purpose of the outdoor GW is to manage nodes in remote areas, far
    from the shed, directly on the pasture land. In the open field scenario, weather
    parameters (temperature and humidity) are collected, for purposes of correlation
    with the animal health status. Moreover, in the presence of large herds, the high
    node density could cause an increase in collisions between sent packets. In such
    scenarios, a MAC layer that includes a listen-before-talk (LBT) mechanism could
    prevent as much as possible packet collisions among nodes. Indeed, LBT-based carrier-sense
    multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) can be incorporated with the
    physical layer of LoRa [89]. The CA mechanism is based on a random retransmission
    time that randomizes the access of the nodes to the wireless medium. The size
    of the pasture area is another factor to consider in deploying the LoRaWAN network.
    In particular, it has been shown that in large areas of pasture, the use of a
    mobile GW that moves along the track is a better solution than the use of one
    or more static GWs [90]. Contrarily, when the livestock area is not too large,
    using only one static GW is preferable because the data extraction rate value
    is high enough and the energy consumption is lower compared to multiple static
    GWs or one mobile GW. The instance of cattle monitoring in New Mexico, as described
    by Actility [102], is one of the successful illustrations of a large-scale LoRaWAN-enabled
    deployment. Due to the large size of these desert ranches (10000–20000 hectares)
    and the large number of cows to track (up to 7000), monitoring and obtaining information
    regarding cattle wellbeing can be time consuming and expensive. Indeed, while
    the cattle were previously followed using traditional GPS devices, the absence
    of reliable cellular connection throughout the whole grazing region made this
    method ineffective. These issues were solved with an off-the-shelf LoRaWAN solution
    because of its extensive range and good coverage. Finally, LoRa technology can
    be used for sharing the short text messages and voice messages in the absence
    of cellular coverage. For example, COWShED [103] is used for supporting livestock
    transhumance in Senegal. Summary and Insights: In this section, we showed how
    LoRa is used to collect information about the movements and health of livestock,
    as well as on the conditions of grassland. LoRa can also aid herders in achieving
    remote grazing by combining data with electronic fences, to identify whether animals
    have crossed it. In addition, LoRa has been used to monitor environmental parameters
    of barns, demonstrating how this technology can be adopted in both outdoor and
    indoor scenarios. Additionally, innovative MAC schemes, such as LBT method could
    be implemented to minimize packet collisions when big herds present, and to mitigate
    the limits on the effective duty cycle of channel occupation. Finally, in the
    absence of cellular coverage, LoRa/LoRaWAN solutions have been used for large-scale
    cattle monitoring or even supporting livestock transhumance for text/voice messages.
    SECTION VI. Lessons Learned and Open Issues This Section discusses the lessons
    learned and the open research challenges for using LoRa technology in smart agriculture.
    According to the aim of this article, it was learned that, given the wide variety
    of sensors used in smart farming systems, different communication protocols need
    to be integrated, particularly when different platforms/vendors coexist and data
    must be collected from the various subsystems. In addition, since power supplies
    are frequently unavailable in a large agricultural area, nodes should be as energy
    self-sufficient as possible. Using local or edge data processing could mitigate
    this problem, optimizing the energy consumption. Moreover, keeping the logic on
    the Edge of the network could alleviate the hurdle on LoRa’s centralized communications
    (especially on the downlink). The development of interoperability in smart agriculture
    systems can also be accelerated by platforms such as FIWARE and Cayenne, while
    machine learning can be used to model and analyze technical problems, improving
    scalability of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion. The experience
    gained in Industry 4.0 can be transferred to agriculture, considering some peculiarities,
    including the need to cover large spaces that cannot be manned. In addition, there
    is the need to provide device power supply and data security (partially solved
    by leveraging on LoRaWAN built-in security schemes). Another significant factor
    is the initial cost of the system, which must be as low as possible since the
    pay-back time also depends on elements that cannot be predicted during the year,
    such as weather. Finally, it has been recognized that although ICT has long-term
    sustainability issues to be solved, they show great potential for improving the
    usage of natural resources, especially when cyber–physical systems (CPSs) are
    combined with IoT, AI, machine learning, and neuromorphic computing techniques
    [104]. Through the study carried out in this article, it is also possible to understand
    in which area LoRa has been applied and is emerging in recent years. In particular,
    among the application areas discussed in Section V, Fig. 8 shows in a pie chart
    that more than 40% of the analyzed studies focus on water management, while almost
    25% are dedicated on crop monitoring, followed by tree monitoring. This result
    is in line with recent market surveys on LPWANs (e.g., [105]), and other general
    studies on communications protocols for smart agriculture [9]. Fig. 8. Distribution
    of the LoRa papers according to smart agriculture application areas. Show All
    All this confirms the great potential of implementing smart agriculture solutions
    using IoT, and LoRa technology in particular. However, there are still some open
    issues that need to be faced: for example, LoRaWAN works quite well in uplink
    when it needs to collect data from sensors, while downlink connections might suffer
    high latency. In what follows, we briefly discuss future research directions related
    to downlink latency, energy management, device heterogeneity and interoperability,
    data management, and scalability. These open issues must be solved for LoRa systems
    to be widely adopted in smart agriculture. We conclude the Section with an eye
    on other wireless technologies, different from LoRa/LoRaWAN. A. LoRa Downlink
    Performance The downlink performance of LPWAN systems still represents a challenge
    since it is related to the energy consumption. In particular, LoRaWAN allows different
    tradeoffs between communication latency on the downlink channel and energy consumption.
    Nodes are classified by classes: they can receive only after an uplink transmission
    (Class A), or at regular time intervals (Class B), or at any time (Class C). The
    modern trend is to optimize energy efficiency, hence, data are transmitted only
    when necessary or periodically. According to the authors’ opinion, a further optimization
    could be retrieved by local data processing. As a matter of fact, even if nodes
    remain asleep most of the time, as in [57], or with scheduling intervals of reception
    windows of 10–20 min as in [48] and [50] or a few hours [58], local processing
    always lowers the data to be transmitted decreasing the transmission time; it
    has been successfully tested in [42] where edge processing on the GW allows a
    more effective control of the actuator nodes. This last approach improves also
    reliability since it allows farms to work even if the Internet connection of the
    LoRa GW is absent for a few hours. Reliability can also be improved by a Master/Slave
    access control method for the LoRa network [52], [53], [54]. Alternatively, for
    short-range communication, a Wake-up Radio (WuR) can be adopted. WuR technology
    is an ultralow-power receiver that is continuously listening to the channel while
    spending a few nanowatts or microwatts depending on the circuit’s design. WuRs
    work in parallel to the main LoRa transceiver and allow asynchronous wake-up of
    the nodes with low latency. With the LoRa-WuR scheme, the downlink latency can
    be reduced by almost 90% compared to the traditional LoRa protocol for a ten nodes
    cluster [106], [107]. B. Energy Efficiency Considerations In addition to downlink
    communication performance just explained, the energy consumption in an agricultural
    ED can include turning on booster pumps or solenoid valves, activating sensors
    over a long period, use of GPS and data transmission, etc. Nodes should be autonomous
    as much as possible since usually power supplies are not available in a wide agricultural
    area. Besides, the use of batteries needs to minimize disposal costs and pollution.
    Providing solutions to avoid the use of batteries by harvesting energy from the
    environment would encourage the deployment of wireless devices in smart agriculture.
    The use of different energy sources, such as solar energy, piezoelectricity, thermal,
    wind, water, and radiofrequency is consolidated [108]. However, making a device
    completely energy-neutral requires a thorough analysis of power consumption in
    different working states [109]. One facilitation is the availability of a renewable
    energy source as in [51]; on the other hand, a high energy consumption due to
    the heating of one probe as in [91] requires a different design or the remote
    monitoring of the energy available or harvested as in [110]. It is evident that
    there are many factors that influence the analysis of offering-demanding energy,
    it varies on a case-by-case basis and does not lend itself to systematic analysis;
    on the other hand, in this context, machine learning algorithms can give a significant
    contribution. Infact, the ML approach has been already successfully applied in
    different contexts allowing to implement an efficient renewable energy selection
    based on the geographic location [111], or to retrieve a good energy prediction
    [112]. An application example is given by the energy-neutral system for pest detection
    [70] which takes advantage of ML algorithms. C. Heterogeneity and Interoperability
    Smart agriculture systems are quite heterogeneous in terms of sensors and, in
    some cases, it is also required to integrate different communication technologies,
    e.g., when multiple platforms coexist and data arrives from different subsystems.
    LoRa platforms are used with ZigBee to implement hybrid communications managing
    different sensors clusters or with the IEEE 802.11s-based system to build a mesh
    networking architecture. The path for the integration of different technologies,
    such as cloud, IoT, and software-defined networking, with AI is proposed in [113]
    with the related challenges and opportunities. Assuring communications in heterogeneous
    smart agriculture systems is a critical issue that has been studied for example
    in [114], where LoRa and ZigBee hybrid communications are implemented. Precisely,
    two LoRa sensor clusters and two ZigBee sensor clusters are used and combined
    with two ZigBee-to-LoRa converters to communicate in a network managed by a LoRa
    GW. The token ring protocol in the ZigBee network and polling mechanism in the
    LoRa network is used. The system can work with a packet loss rate of less than
    0.5% when the communication distance is 630 m for the ZigBee network and 3.7 km
    for the LoRa network. An hybrid LoRa/IEEE 802.11s-based mesh networking architecture
    is proposed in [115], where an effective network protocol selection mechanism
    is developed to choose the right interface. Protocol selection is based on multiple
    parameters, including network communication interface type, GNSS position of the
    APs, RSSI of nearby nodes, type and amount of data to be transmitted. Large data
    to be transferred in a short time can rely on the IEEE 802.11s-based network while
    small data can be transmitted through a LoRa-based mesh network. Platforms such
    as FIWARE [116], Cayenne [41] and mySense [58], discussed in Section IV, can also
    give a push to achieve interoperability in the smart agriculture systems. The
    above described solutions can benefit of an “industry 4.0”-based approach where
    the integration of different protocols cooperate to address the needs of automating
    computing and technology processes [113], [18]. D. Machine Learning and Big Data
    Management The integration of big data analysis with machine learning can provide
    predictions about future outcomes, such as fruit quality or detect crops’ diseases
    using historical data, analytical techniques, and statistical modeling [117].
    The benefits of ML in the agriculture are relevant [118]. However, the deployment
    of models is the most challenging step to bring the ML algorithms in the production
    fields, and thanks to its advantages, LoRa technology could make a big contribution
    to taking this step. Collected data can be used to implement an intelligent system
    capable of supporting the identification of varieties and predicting the quality
    of the final product [64]. In fact, exploiting ML, the data can be used by the
    biologists to develop crop models and perform disease prediction [68]. The agricultural
    industry produces a large amount of data collected by heterogeneous sensors, so
    best practices should include the mechanisms to reduce the memory and time for
    data analysis. Thus, to pursue such objectives, edge computing models are also
    applied [119]. Distributed data process, such as MapReduce [120], may avoid bottlenecks
    when transferring all data to a single server, as in [121] where the proposed
    method adopts smart sensors to measure the soil quality indicators, while the
    preelaborated data is transmitted using the LoRaWAN protocol. The Apache Spark
    environment is then used to implement a parallel algorithm for statistical models
    based on the soil indicator data obtained from the experimental field. E. LoRa
    Scalability and Network Improvement As concerns scalability, some open points,
    shared with general applications, are recognized. For this reason, most of the
    reference literature does not directly address issues related to agriculture.
    Indeed, scalability is a key feature in LoRa networks due to its long-range and
    large number of devices can concurrently reach a given GW. The network scales
    quite well if dynamic transmission parameters are used, in combination with multiple
    sinks. However, the correct behavior of the NS is not easy to be evaluated [122].
    In fact, the NS presents some challenges from the point of view of its optimization,
    such as processing duplicate packets or packets from other networks, or bringing
    down the entire network in case of Internet connection loss. LoRa networks are
    bound by strict legal requirements, particularly where no LBT schemes are utilized.
    The transmission duty cycle (TDC) regulates the ISM bands to determine the maximum
    time that the band can be occupied, typically bounded to 1%. This implies that
    devices may not occupy the ISM band for more than 36 s per hour, forbidding the
    transmission of new packets when this limit is attained [123]. Machine learning
    can be applied to model and analyze technical problems, improving the scalability
    of LoRa networks and predicting network congestion [124]. Further developments
    could include enhanced ADR mechanisms, optimization of GW locations, and interference
    cancelation techniques [125]. Finally, some challenges remain such as the widespread
    adoption of multihop communications in LoRaWAN. Literature has shown that multihop
    or mesh topologies can extend the coverage of LoRaWAN networks and improve energy
    efficiency in certain scenarios [126]. These solutions propose intermediate nodes
    to forward messages to other EDs to extend the coverage. Other open points include
    the use of GWs as intermediate nodes, GW-to-GW communications, and practical large-scale
    deployment of LoRaWAN mesh networks. F. Other Communication Technologies The choice
    of a specific communication technology is central to the performance of IoT-based
    agricultural applications. Other than LoRa, many standards for wireless communications
    can be employed, including Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, RFID, Sigfox, and NB-IoT.
    Some of them work well in the short-range (within 100 m), while others are more
    useful to cover long distances (up to tens of kilometers). Examples of the former
    are Bluetooth, ZigBee, Z-Wave, and passive and active RFID systems, while in the
    latter, standards are Sigfox and NB-IoT (and LoRa of course). As discussed previously,
    the deployment of a massive number of IoT devices might cause interference problems
    especially for technologies using the unlicensed spectrum, such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    Sigfox, and LoRa. On the other hand, IoT devices operating with a licensed spectrum
    eliminate interference problems but might increase costs significantly. Several
    papers have analyzed different aspects of wireless communication protocols for
    smart agriculture, studying possible applications and comparing their performance.
    For example, ZigBee-based smart agriculture systems are described in [127], [128],
    [129], [130], and [131]. The biggest challenges for ZigBee networks are the limited
    range and increased power consumption (compared to LPWANs) and relatively low
    data rate (e.g., compared to BLE or WiFi). Therefore, ZigBee is better suited
    for small-scale scenarios [130], while the use of this protocol is not suitable
    when the agricultural area is vast and the distance between sensor nodes is large.
    On the other hand, the works [132], [133], [134], [135] represent successful examples
    of NB-IoT applications in smart agriculture. Indeed, extensive coverage, adaptable
    power consumption (depending on the mode of operation), and low interference among
    nodes, are features that make NB-IoT an interesting protocol for various agricultural
    systems [136]. However, NB-IoT employs licensed frequency channels, which results
    in higher subscription prices for the associated system even if it offers a higher
    data throughput than LoRa. Moreover, when there is an existing LTE infrastructure
    already in place, the need for hardware update may be another source of expense
    for such a system. This might be a drawback in the context of smart agriculture
    if the projected return on investment is not high enough to cover these costs
    [137]. Overall, the choice of the communication technology in smart agriculture
    needs to consider many factors and requirements, such as support for roaming,
    suitability of technology to small-scale, medium-scale, and large-scale deployments,
    geographical location, costs, etc. For example, it has been shown that Sigfox
    and LoRaWAN excel on network capacity, battery lifetime, and cost, whereas NB-IoT
    achieves higher quality of service and lower latency [27]. Finally, while LoRaWAN
    has been considered the most suitable communication network for IoT in smart agriculture
    [16], it is still difficult to tell which technology will dominate the market,
    or if several technologies will coexist, perhaps specializing on different application
    domains. SECTION VII. Conclusion Although the expected transition to smart agriculture
    has already begun, researchers around the world are still looking for new solutions
    to improve agricultural productivity through IoT architectures. Indeed, albeit
    applications in agriculture can benefit from the experience gained in Industry
    4.0, they require specific knowledge regarding sensor management, energy optimization,
    and data processing. LoRa technology is widely adopted, as it allows building
    an autonomous network that meets some of the requirements of the smart agriculture,
    such as low-power and long-range communication. The adoption of LoRa-based systems
    in agriculture results in an effective way to improve the connectivity of farms,
    encourage the deployment of DSSs and consequently improve their management, leading
    the agricultural sector toward smart agriculture. In order to provide a more focused
    and comprehensive view of the applications in the field, in this article, we restricted
    our focus to LoRa/LoRaWAN technology and its uses in the context of smart agriculture.
    We presented many LoRa applications in the field, and we discussed some open issues
    and research areas for future improvements. The main challenges analyzed using
    LoRa Technology in smart agriculture, are: latency on the downlink channel, energy
    management, heterogeneity and interoperability of the devices, data management,
    and scalability. All of these can benefit from the use of machine learning algorithms.
    Indeed, AI and edge computing are still scarcely used but related algorithms and
    technologies are now mature and may be successfully applied in this field. Finally,
    the optimization of multiple GW locations and multihop topologies to extend the
    coverage of LoRa networks have been recently tested to further improve the performance
    and coverage. NOTE Open Access funding provided by ‘Università degli Studi di

    \ 51 \n \n 1 \n1. Introduction \nAs is advocated by the United Nations, efficiency\
    \ of the life cycle of production process \nis an important consideration for\
    \ sustainable development. This study aims to quantitatively \nassess the degree\
    \ to which Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sensor \nnetworks\
    \ can help increase crop yield in farmland and cut down on the consumption of\
    \ \nresources. Additionally, in agriculture, excessive application of nutrients\
    \ can be regarded as \npollution. Therefore, pollution prevention is an additional\
    \ consideration in sustainable \nagricultural development. An ICT sensor network\
    \ is an effective tool to monitor external \nconditions and collect data for making\
    \ decision for agricultural inputs allocation (i.e., watering, \nfertilizer application,\
    \ and pesticide application) for optimal outcome (i.e., crop yield).  \nIn this\
    \ study, a model to simulate the performance of farms that are equipped with ICT\
    \ \nsensor networks for controlling usage of agricultural inputs, with the data\
    \ collected from \npublications and from the service providers that focus on utilizing\
    \ ICT sensor networks in \nagriculture. With the model, an estimated value of\
    \ possible outcomes (crop yield, resource \ninputs) was calculated. \nThis study\
    \ answered a question that how to use existing technologies to increase crop \n\
    yields, while reducing agricultural inputs and the associated negative ecological\
    \ impacts. The \nresults of this study have important implications for improving\
    \ the yield and productivity of \nfarming, and for the sustainable development\
    \ of agriculture. The effects of the climatic zones in \nwhich the farms are located\
    \ on performance of ICT sensor networks are also analyzed, and the \ninfluence\
    \ of location variation proved to be insignificant.  \n \n \n \n2 \n2. Background\
    \ \n2.1 Problem statement \nA growing population and the corresponding needs for\
    \ food throughout the world have \nprompted farm owners to expand the scale of\
    \ planting. As farm size expands, it is no longer \nfeasible to rely on collecting\
    \ data manually for making decisions on agricultural activities \n(Brase, 2006).\
    \ Breakthroughs in areas of information technology, lower manufacturing and \n\
    usage cost, smaller size, and longer life span have made sensors ubiquitous items\
    \ for the public \n(Nack, 2019), and there has been a trend that ICT sensors technologies\
    \ are being widely applied \nin agriculture, controlling the usage of water, fertilizer,\
    \ and pesticide. Meanwhile, in many \nstudies that discussed wireless sensor networks\
    \ in farms, the effects of using this service were \nnot clearly mentioned. To\
    \ describe the performance of ICT usage on farms, two types of \ninformation (indicators)\
    \ should be provided: the percentage of agricultural resources that can be \n\
    saved, and the increase in crop yield that are realized by using wireless sensor\
    \ networks. Some \nof the articles listed both indicators, while some of them\
    \ only provided one or neither of these \nindicators. \nMany previous studies\
    \ on sensor networks in agriculture have focused mainly on the \ndeployment and\
    \ configuration of wireless sensor networks, and the collection of environmental\
    \ \ndata. Work by Sakthipriya(2014) is a typical example. In the study by Sakthipriya(2014),a\
    \ crop \nmanagement system has two types of functions, sensing and decision making.\
    \ The sensor \nnetwork can collect environmental parameters including temperature,\
    \ soil moisture and soil pH \nvalue. Based on these environmental parameters sent\
    \ to the backbone, decisions on whether the \nwater sprinkler should be turned\
    \ on to provide sufficient water to the field can be made. \nHowever, there has\
    \ been little quantitative analysis on the potential of wireless sensor \nnetworks\
    \ to enhance crop yield or improve efficiency of resource use. Most of the studies\
    \ claim \nthat the wireless sensor networks solution they discussed will improve\
    \ or boost the crop \nproduction. iFarm designed by Jiber et al. (2011) is a typical\
    \ example. This system provided \nirrigation management (monitoring and controlling\
    \ water usage), pest and disease detection, \ncrop yield prediction, and resource\
    \ optimization. Few studies provided the percentage or \nincremental gain in crop\
    \ production and saving on agricultural inputs. For example, Xiong et \nal.(2008)collected\
    \ a variety of environmental and animal-related data (e.g. breed, days in milk,\
    \ \n \n3 \nmilk time, milk quality, reproduction status, location), but further\
    \ utilization of the data in \npredicting animal activities or future production\
    \ was not carried out. \n2.2 Research objectives \nThe overall purpose of my study\
    \ is to evaluate how the farmland and crop would \nrespond, when wireless sensor\
    \ networks are deployed to monitor and control how much water, \nfertilizer, and\
    \ pesticide are used. I decided to carry out research based on the performance\
    \ data \ncollected from existing farms using this type of service. The goal of\
    \ my research is to determine \nthe quantitative relationships between use of\
    \ wireless sensor networks and performance \nindicators (change in crop yield\
    \ and agricultural resource usage on farms). The analysis is based \non existing\
    \ farms that have already been equipped with wireless sensor networks and that\
    \ have \ncollected performance indicator data.  \nTherefore, my major research\
    \ questions are: \n(1) To what degree can ICT sensor networks boost crop yield\
    \ by monitoring and \ncontrolling the usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide?\
    \ \n(2) If ICT sensor networks could be deployed throughout a selected country\
    \ or area, \nhow could the annual yield of crops change?  \n \n \n \n4 \n3. Literature\
    \ review \nIn this literature review, concepts of sustainable development, an\
    \ introduction to ICT \nsensor network, and applications of ICT sensor networks\
    \ are discussed.  \n3.1 Sustainable Development and ICT sensor networks \n3.1.1\
    \ Overview of sustainable development \nThe United Nations in 1987 articulated\
    \ a need “to make development sustainable to \nensure that it meets the needs\
    \ of the present without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet\
    \ their own needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development, \n1987).\
    \ This concept drew the attention of the public toward finding ways to avoid sacrificing\
    \ \nthe natural environment for economic growth. Over time, given the changing\
    \ needs of people \nwith respect to the environment, society and economy, the\
    \ practices and definition of \nsustainable development need to be up-to-date.\
    \  \nThe US Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency\
    \ defined \nsustainable agricultural development as “Agricultural sustainable\
    \ development refers to the \napplication of local intrinsic technology to achieve\
    \ the following objectives for a long time and \nstrive to form a comprehensive\
    \ production system for plant and livestock production.” (Hebei \nAcademy of Social\
    \ Sciences, 2017). These objectives include (1) to meet the needs of people's\
    \ \nfood and clothing; (2) to improve the quality of the environment and natural\
    \ resources on which \nagricultural production depends; and (3) to make the most\
    \ efficient use of non-renewable \nresources and materials available on farms,\
    \ and at the same time, comprehensive regulation of \nnatural resources management\
    \ methods is carried out if necessary; (4) maintaining the \neconomic vitality\
    \ of agricultural production entities; and (5) improving the overall quality of\
    \ \nlife of farmers and the whole society (Hebei Academy of Social Sciences, 2017).\
    \ \nA report from the United Nations claims that if the global population increases\
    \ to 9.6 \nbillion in the next 30 years, the equivalent of three planets would\
    \ be required to meet the \ndemands of humans given current lifestyles (United\
    \ Nations, 2016). Facing the challenge of \nfulfilling growing demands with limited\
    \ resource, it is essential to increase the efficiency of \nusing resources, so\
    \ the United Nations proposed a concept of Sustainable Consumption and \nProduction.\
    \ Based on the principle of higher efficiency with smaller input and more output,\
    \ this \n \n5 \nconcept improves the quality of life while reducing resource consumption\
    \ and environmental \ndegradation and pollution levels throughout the consumption\
    \ and production cycle, thereby \nenhancing the welfare benefits of economic activities\
    \ (United Nations Environment Programme, \n2010).  \nIn 2015, the General Assembly\
    \ adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals for the \nfollowing 15-year lifespan,\
    \ aiming to achieve sustainable development inclusively for everyone. \nAmong\
    \ the 17 goals, Sustainable Development Goal 12 (also known as SDG 12) is most\
    \ related \nto this study. SDG 12 was to build a more sustainable and production-efficient\
    \ world. Its major \ntargets include (1) promoting resource and energy efficiency,\
    \ and (2) promoting sustainable \ninfrastructures (United Nations, 2015). The\
    \ SDGs were intended to promote a new worldview \nand provide the beginnings of\
    \ a plan to end poverty without imposing significant costs on \nEarth’s life-support\
    \ systems. The goals may help create a fresh global narrative around a \ncommon\
    \ future to mobilise collective action and help develop a shared understanding\
    \ of \ninterconnected risks and solutions(Gaffney, 2014).  \n3.1.2 Agricultural\
    \ waste issues \nHigher production and smaller input are required for sustainable\
    \ development. To meet \nthe demand for food by a growing global population, an\
    \ expansion in agricultural production is \nneeded. As farm sizes expand, it is\
    \ no longer viable to rely on collecting data manually for \nmaking decisions\
    \ on agricultural activities (Brase, 2006). At the same time, various sensors\
    \ \nwhich have lower manufacturing and utilization costs, smaller size, and longer\
    \ life spans, have \nbecome ubiquitous items for the public (Nack, 2019).  \n\
    Another aspect of accomplishing United Nation’s SDG 12 is to reduce the solid\
    \ waste \nthat is generated from production processes, which could cut down on\
    \ the amount of raw \nmaterials that manufacturers have to obtain from nature\
    \ or artificially create (Bishop, \n2004).Relevant to this research is agriculture\
    \ waste, produced by agricultural activities. \nAgricultural waste is comprised\
    \ of animal waste (manure, animal carcasses), food processing \nwaste (only 20%\
    \ of maize is canned and 80% is waste), crop waste (corn stalks, sugarcane \n\
    bagasse, drops and culls from fruits and vegetables, pruning) and hazardous and\
    \ toxic \nagricultural waste (pesticides, insecticides and herbicides, etc.) (Ramírez-García\
    \ et al., 2019; \nObi et al., 2016). \n \n6 \nMost chemicals of agricultural waste\
    \ are water-soluble and can leach and enter water \nbodies and food, leading to\
    \ severe ecologic and human health impacts.  This can cause serious \nhealth disorders\
    \ in humans, including cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, birth\
    \ \ndefects, and reproductive disorders. Pesticides can also kill non-target plants,\
    \ birds, and other \nwildlife, and have a significant negative impact on soil\
    \ quality and fertility (Ramírez-García, \nGohil, & Singh, 2019). \nFertilizer\
    \ contains massive amount of nutritive minerals including nitrogen, phosphorus,\
    \ \nand potassium which provides support for plants to grow faster and increase\
    \ yields. However, if \nthe application of fertilizer surpasses the crop/soil\
    \ system’s capacity to absorb the nutrients, the \nexcessive minerals will leak\
    \ into surface runoff, and eventually enter waterbodies such as lakes, \nrivers,\
    \ creeks, etc. (Karunanithi et al., 2016). When the excessive NPK minerals enter\
    \ the \nwaterbody, eutrophication occurs, with mass production of photosynthetic\
    \ microorganisms. \nWhen these photosynthetic microorganisms die, bacteria activity\
    \ decomposing this biomass can \ndeplete dissolved oxygen, causing other organisms\
    \ such as fish to die of hypoxia (Wetzel, \n2001). \nUnited States Environmental\
    \ Protection Agency recommended the following ways to \nmitigate the pollution\
    \ by excessive agricultural inputs: (1) applying nutrients in the right \namount,\
    \ at the right time of year, with the right method and with the right placement;\
    \ (2) \nEnsuring year-round ground cover to avoid soil erosion and nutrients loss\
    \ to the waterway; (3) \nPlanting field buffers. Planted buffers can help prevent\
    \ nutrient loss from fields by absorbing or \nfiltering out nutrients before they\
    \ reach a water body; (4) Installing fence along waterways to \nkeep animals off\
    \ the stream, river, etc. (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2019)\
    \ \n \nIn the context of this study, ICT sensor networks are deployed on farms\
    \ to collect \ninformation about the factors that would affect crop yield, such\
    \ as soil water content, fertilizer \nusage, and soil/atmospheric temperature\
    \ (Meeradevi & Mundada, 2015). Once information has \nbeen collected, it can be\
    \ processed in two different directions. The first is that information can \n\
    be sent directly to terminal clients and then converted into graphic deliverables\
    \ by visualization \nsoftware. With visualized content about the farm environment,\
    \ farm managers would know \nbetter about how the farm works, and what kind of\
    \ strategies they should take for better or more \n \n7 \nefficient crop production.\
    \ The second direction focuses on the idea of agricultural resource and \nwaste\
    \ control. The sensor network keeps contributing to making decision on the ground\
    \ \nregarding the proper amount of water, fertilizer and pesticide to be applied\
    \ on site. \n3.2 What is ICT sensor network? \nInformation and Communication Technology\
    \ is a varied cluster of digital tools and \nresources used to communicate, generate,\
    \ disseminate, store and perform information \nmanagement (Rahman et al., 2016).\
    \  \n3.2.1 Internet of Things \nIn this study, the main infrastructure used for\
    \ improving production is the sensor \nnetwork. The ICT sensor network is a subset\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT), referring to the \ninterconnection of smart\
    \ devices, ranging from appliances to tiny sensors (Stallings & Brown, \n2018).\
    \ An advantageous feature of the Internet of Things is that short-range mobile\
    \ transceivers \nare embedded in various gadgets and daily necessities, thereby\
    \ enabling new forms of \ncommunication between people and things, and between\
    \ things. The cloud systems today \nsupport the interconnection of billions of\
    \ industrial and personal objects. These objects can pass \ninformation collected\
    \ from distributed sensor nodes. Utilizing this low-latency information can \n\
    be used to effectively monitor the environment and make decisions for overall\
    \ management of \nlarge systems such as factories or cities. The farms involved\
    \ in this study are benefiting from \nthis technology. From the initial PC and\
    \ server to later professional operational technology and \npersonal electronic\
    \ communication equipment, sensor-based internet of things represents the \nlatest\
    \ products and trends of the Internet (Stallings & Brown, 2018). \nThe sensor\
    \ nodes are the most basic and underlying devices of an Internet of Things, \n\
    and at the same time they represent one of the core technologies of the wireless\
    \ sensor networks \nfor this study. A single sensor unit consists of five key\
    \ components, sensor, actuator, micro-\ncontroller, transceiver and radio-frequency\
    \ identification (Stallings & Brown, 2018), which will \nbe discussed in a following\
    \ subsection regarding sensor node structure. \nIn the context of a complete enterprise\
    \ network, an Internet of Things may have four \ndifferent layers. The bottom-up\
    \ order of these layers is the edge layer, the fog layer, the core \nlayer and\
    \ the cloud layer. The edge layer is mainly composed of sensors and switches,\
    \ which \n \n8 \ncan communicate information to each other when needed. At this\
    \ layer, there are a few \ngateways that connect sensors to communicate with higher-level\
    \ networks. After the data is \ncollected by the gateway, it is transmitted to\
    \ the fog layer. The amount of data this layer \nreceives from distributed sensor\
    \ networks on the ground is usually very large, so a significant \nfeature of\
    \ the fog layer is that it can be evaluated close to the edge layer. This can\
    \ effectively \nreduce the pressure on the entire network from transmitting a\
    \ large amount of data, whether it \nconsumes bandwidth or consumes other resources.\
    \ The main functions of the core layer above \nthe fog layer are to connect the\
    \ broadly distributed fog layer, and to open the interface to \nexternal servers.\
    \ The cloud layer on the top of the network, provides storage and processing \n\
    capabilities for large amounts of aggregated data sensor nodes from the edge (Stallings\
    \ & \nBrown, 2018). \n3.2.2 Network structure and architecture \nThe realm of\
    \ wireless networks can be divided into infrastructured and infrastructureless\
    \ \nnetworks. A typical infrastructured wireless network consists of a central\
    \ base station where all \nthe information transmitted from the ground is processed,\
    \ and nodes collect information at \nground level. A cellular wireless network\
    \ is the most common type of infrastructured network. \nDifferent from the infrastructured\
    \ network, an infrastructureless wireless network has \ndistributed, independent,\
    \ dynamic topology, low-power, task-oriented wireless nodes. With \nthese features,\
    \ a lot of decisions can be made at ground level, and as a result, some unnecessary\
    \ \ninformation for high-level decision-making will be removed from the information\
    \ package \nwhich will be sent to a central base station (Jangra, 2010). The wireless\
    \ sensor networks to be \ndiscussed in this study is a typical instance of an\
    \ infrastructureless network.  \n \nStallings and Brown (2018) summarized a sensor\
    \ network as a cluster of sensors \ntransmitting their data to one intermediate\
    \ entity that aggregates the data to be collected by a \nhigher-level entity.\
    \ There are five steps that a sensor network should take when a sensor node \n\
    has fetched data from an external environment: \n(1) Evaluation: evaluating data\
    \ for criteria as to whether it should be processed at a \nhigher level. \n(2)\
    \ Formatting: reformatting data for consistent higher-level processing. \n \n\
    9 \n(3) Expanding/decoding: handling cryptic data with additional context (such\
    \ as the \norigin). \n(4) Distillation/reduction: reducing and/or summarizing\
    \ data to minimize the impact \nof data and traffic on the network and higher-level\
    \ processing systems. \n(5) Assessment: determining whether data represent a threshold\
    \ or alert; this could \ninclude redirecting data to additional destinations.\
    \ \nAn advantage of the four-layered architecture of the Internet of Things networks,\
    \ is that \nthe size of data packets to be transmitted gradually shrinks as data\
    \ moves from ground level to \nthe higher levels (Stallings & Brown, 2018). \n\
    Another distinguishing characteristic of a sensor network is fog computing, which\
    \ is an \nopposite technical trend to cloud computing. Cloud computing refers\
    \ to the network that makes \nmassive and centralized storage, and processing\
    \ resources available to distributed users or \nclients. In fog computing, many\
    \ smart devices (e.g. sensors) are interconnected by fog network \nfacilities\
    \ that provide data processing function which is close to the sensors rather than\
    \ the \nhigher-level devices (Stallings et al., 2012). In terms of the efficiency,\
    \ the fog network between \nthe smart devices layer and the core network layer\
    \ enables lots of vital decisions to be made by \nthe smart devices on the edge.\
    \ That is to say, the time it takes for sensed data at ground/edge to \ntravel\
    \ to the higher-level cloud server can be saved by processing in the fog network.\
    \ The \narchitecture of the IoT equipped with a fog network relieves the burden\
    \ of computing in the \ncentral part of the IoT system, which in turn allows more\
    \ smart devices to be engaged in the \nnetwork. Owing to the rapid detection or\
    \ rapid measurements of sensors on edge, the risk of \ndisaster from a cascading\
    \ system failure would be decreased, and therefore the potential costs to \nmaintain\
    \ and repair the system would be saved (Cisco, 2015). Sliva’s research on WSNs\
    \ \nincludes a five-layered protocol, including a physical layer, a data link\
    \ layer, a network layer, a \ntransport layer and an application layer (Sliva,\
    \ 2008).Appendix Figure A1 is a common \narchitecture of ICT sensor network (Telecommunication\
    \ Standardization Sector of International \nTelecommunication Union, 2014). The\
    \ multi-layer feature of a sensor network is clearly \nillustrated in Appendix\
    \ Figure A1.  \n \n10 \n3.2.3 Sensor node structure \nNodes are a fundamental\
    \ part of a viable wireless sensor network. There are four major \ncomponents\
    \ in a node which are a power unit (e.g. battery sets), sensing unit, processing\
    \ and \nstorage unit and transceiver unit (for communication), with the major\
    \ structure of a node \ndepicted according to Sliva (2008)(Appendix Figure A2),\
    \ and a more detailed explanation (El-\nKader & El-Basion, 2013) (Appendix Figure\
    \ A3). In a fog network, these nodes have an \nadditional component, the microcontroller,\
    \ which is the intelligence for making basic decisions \nat ground level of a\
    \ whole network. \nTo ensure a sufficiently long network life, energy efficiency\
    \ in all parts of the network \nis critical. Therefore, data processing tasks\
    \ are often spread across the network: that is, nodes \nneed to cooperate to transmit\
    \ data to receivers (Galar & Kumar, 2017). \nIn real-world application of wireless\
    \ sensor networks in agriculture, one of the main \nconcerns and barriers is that\
    \ the farm owners or operators would worry about the costs of \nrunning the network\
    \ in fields, which includes the initial expense of setting up and configuring\
    \ \nhardware, the costs of maintenance and replacement, and of electricity for\
    \ devices in the long \nrun (Sliva, 2008; El-Kader & El-Basion, 2013). In order\
    \ to minimize the costs of nodes, more \ncircuits should be integrated into each\
    \ chip. Regarding the energy, less memory and less \npowerful processing units\
    \ in ground devices can be used to reduce cost (Sliva, 2008). This \nstrategy\
    \ makes sense, but at the same time it would increase the burden of computing\
    \ in a \ncentral base station, and in turn slow down the speed of processing data\
    \ and making decisions. \n3.2.4 Wireless standard used in ICT sensor networks\
    \ \nAt present, there are many standards and protocols for the wireless transmission\
    \ of \nsignals in wireless sensor networks. Among them, the following protocols\
    \ are the most \nfrequently used(Sohraby , Minoli, & Znati, 2007):  \n• IEEE 802.15.1\
    \ (also known as Bluetooth);  \nBluetooth is a standard for short range, low power,\
    \ and low-cost wireless \ncommunication that uses radio technology. Its short-range\
    \ wireless capability allows \nperipheral devices to communicate over a single\
    \ air-interface, replacing the cables that \n \n11 \nuse connectors with a multitude\
    \ of shapes, sizes and numbers of pins (McDermott-Wells, \n2004). \n• IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n\
    \ series of wireless LANs;  \nIEEE 802.11 and 802.11x refers to a family of specifications\
    \ developed by the IEEE for \nwireless local area network (WLAN) technology. 802.11\
    \ specifies an over-the-air \ninterface between a wireless client and a base station\
    \ or between two wireless clients \n(IEEE Standard Association, 2020). \n• IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 (ZigBee);  \nZigBee is a specification for a suite of high-level communication\
    \ protocols using low-\npower digital radios based on IEEE 802.15.4. The technology\
    \ defined by the ZigBee \nspecification is intended to be simpler and less expensive\
    \ than the other consumer \nwireless personal area networks, such as Bluetooth.\
    \ A distinguishing feature of ZigBee \nis low cost, which allows this technology\
    \ to be widely used in the area of wireless \ncontrolling (Radmand, Talevski,\
    \ Petersen, & Carlsen, 2010). \n• MAN-scope IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX);  \nWiMAX standard\
    \ is a family of 802.16, that provides, multiple physical layer (PHY) \nand Media\
    \ Access Control (MAC) options (Nuaymi, 2007). \n• Radio-frequency identification\
    \ (RFID) tagging. \nThere are two general categories of RFID tagging, active and\
    \ passive, depending on \ntheir source of electrical power. Active RFID tags contain\
    \ their own power source, \nusually an on-board battery. Passive tags obtain power\
    \ from the signal of an external \nreader. This technique has been used widely\
    \ in the areas of supply chain management, \nsecurity, and movement tracking (Weinstein,\
    \ 2005). \nThese transmission protocols and their corresponding properties, including\
    \ transmission \nrange and speed, have been summarized in previous literature\
    \ (Sohraby et al., 2007; Ojha et al., \n \n12 \n2015). When configuring transmission\
    \ protocols for WSNs, the person who makes the decision \nshould select the appropriate\
    \ one based on energy availability, nodes characteristics, and \nperformance requirement\
    \ of this network. Appendix Figure A4 and Appendix Table A1 show \nthe differences\
    \ in data transmission rate, transmission range, and energy consumption of these\
    \ \navailable transmission protocols.  \nThe technologies described above enable\
    \ many sensors to be deployed in crop fields in \na non-destructive way, which\
    \ in turn helps increase the resolution when mapping soil, plant, \nand livestock\
    \ properties.  \n3.2.5 Energy efficiency matters \nThe energy consumed by an ICT\
    \ sensor network mainly has two aspects, the direct \ncurrent brought by the battery\
    \ used by the node, and the alternating current consumed by the \ndata center\
    \ or core layer of the network when processing data. A technology used to facilitate\
    \ \nsustainable development should be in line with its own idea of sustainable\
    \ development. \nTherefore, energy efficiency in ICT sensor networks should be\
    \ considered. Improving energy \nefficiency in the ICT solutions requires both\
    \ policy and technology guidelines (Cremer et al., \n2010). In terms of technologic\
    \ guidelines, these solutions start with where the ICT industry \nconsumes energy.\
    \ For example, server clusters, data centers, and base stations that are now \n\
    commonly used consume electric power for daily operations on the one hand, and\
    \ cooling \nhardware on the other(Fagas, Gammaitoni, Gallagher, & Paul, 2017).\
    \ For energy consumed to \nmaintain daily operations, the base station should\
    \ first ensure that there are no in-situ servers \nthat are powered on but not\
    \ working at all. The second step is to transform the traditional data \ncenters\
    \ into next generation hyperscale data centers. This upgraded data center has\
    \ 25% higher \nenergy efficiency than the traditional one. From 2016 to 2020,\
    \ a hyperscale data center is \npredicted to shrink the overall energy consumption\
    \ by 50%, with these small and less-efficient \ndata centers shut down (Jones,\
    \ 2018). \nTackling cooling down or maintaining system temperature is another\
    \ technical \nimprovement direction. Monitoring real-time operation conditions\
    \ including temperature and \nhumidity makes it possible to make dynamic actions\
    \ on the right timing to run a cooling system. \n \n13 \nThis practice can avoid\
    \ excessive cooling when the workload in the data center is not heavy \n(Shuja\
    \ et al., 2012). \nOptimizing computing procedure and network architecture is\
    \ another guideline for \nhigher efficiency. For example, streamlining the computing\
    \ process, scaling dynamic voltage \nand frequency for high-performance tasks,\
    \ and balancing the data pipeline are all feasible \noptions for architecture\
    \ (Fagas et al., 2017; Satran, 2018). However, implementing these \nmeasures to\
    \ improve the energy efficiency of ICT sensor networks will inevitably encounter\
    \ \nobstacles. As is mentioned above, guidelines for improving energy efficiency\
    \ in ICT industry \nimpact initially the businesses from an economic perspective,\
    \ and it will inevitably add \nfinancial burden to both business owners and their\
    \ clients/consumers. For instance, adding \ntaxes or extra fees to the price of\
    \ a product is never an easy task, because the stakeholders \nmight be reluctant\
    \ to accept this increase in cost. \nIn terms of deploying advanced cooling systems\
    \ for higher energy, this practice has two \nmajor obstacles for implementation.\
    \ The first one is the price that data centers have to pay for \nthis upgrade,\
    \ because cost-controlling is the very basis of running business in a robust manner.\
    \ \nAnother barrier is that some smart temperature controlling systems that are\
    \ integrated into data \ncenters involve deep customization for better compatibility.\
    \ Therefore, it will take time and \nefforts to set up such a system for a data\
    \ center. \nThe third guideline mentioned above may have technical difficulty\
    \ in implementing, \nthat is the transformation and upgrading of legacy architecture\
    \ and computing algorithms is a \nmentally work-intensive job, and it requires\
    \ massive assistance from external sources. If so, \nfurther collaboration between\
    \ internal and outsourced workers will cost time and effort for this \nintegration.\
    \ \n \n3.3 Applications of the Internet of Things \n \nInternet of Things has\
    \ been applied in various industries, including but not limited to \ngrid, transportation,\
    \ logistic and healthcare (Wu, 2010). This study mainly discusses the \napplication\
    \ of IoT in healthcare and finance. \n \n14 \n3.3.1 The Internet of Things in\
    \ Healthcare \nThe Internet of Things solutions for healthcare includes the following\
    \ aspects, \nequipment for patients, equipment designed for doctors' work, and\
    \ networks for hospital \nmanagement. \nInternet of Things for patients. IoT solutions\
    \ for monitoring the health or medical \nconditions of individuals are able to\
    \ collect parameters from patients, using the body-sensor \nnodes that are equipped\
    \ in wearable devices. These solutions play an important role in \nimproving the\
    \ quality of life and survival opportunities of critically ill patients and chronically\
    \ \nill patients. Fortino et al. (2014)designed a body sensor networks called\
    \ BodyCloud, which can \ngather real-time data regarding body temperature, blood\
    \ pressure, and electrocardiography, and \nconduct further processing on raw data,\
    \ data storage and analysis. Fanucci et al (2012)created a \nsystem to monitor\
    \ the vital signs of chronic heart failure patients. In this system, signs including\
    \ \nelectrocardiogram, SpO2, blood pressure, and weight are collected by non-invasive\
    \ sensor \nnodes. These data will be transmitted from sensor nodes to a home sensor\
    \ gateway for checking \nwhether the status of a patient who is prone to suffering\
    \ from heart failure is abnormal, \ncompared with the pre-set safety value range.\
    \ Once the detected values are beyond the \nthreshold, alerts will be sent from\
    \ home gateway and calls for instant supports, which allows \nearlier home interventions\
    \ thus reducing the number of hospitalizations. \nThe Internet of Things also\
    \ has significant impacts on the elderly who are living alone \nand their families\
    \ by continuously tracking their health. When someone's daily activities are \n\
    disturbed or changed, the alert mechanism will send signals to family members\
    \ and medical \npersonnel. For example, falls are a serious problem for the elderly,\
    \ so it is imperative to apply \nfalls detection in the daily life of the elderly.\
    \ There have been plenty of IoT-based fall detection \nand alerting solutions.\
    \ In Gutiérrez-Madroñal et al.’s (2019)solution of fall detection, once their\
    \ \nmotion sensors observe that the change in the acceleration of human motion\
    \ conforms to the \nfall pattern, these sensor nodes will determine a fall event,\
    \ and then an alert will be sent for help. \nThe combination of home monitoring\
    \ devices, such as wearables and fog computing, \ncan allow doctors to more effectively\
    \ track the patient's health. After the sensors installed on \nthe patient are\
    \ processed locally, the data necessary for the doctor's diagnosis will be uploaded\
    \ \nto the cloud. Doctors can track the patient's compliance with the treatment\
    \ plan or any need for \n \n15 \nimmediate medical attention. The Internet of\
    \ Things has made healthcare professionals more \nalert and able to proactively\
    \ contact patients. The data collected from IoT devices can help \ndoctors determine\
    \ the best treatment process for patients and achieve the expected results \n\
    (Alam et al., 2018). \nInternet of Things for hospitals. The National Health Service\
    \ in England declared the \npractices of using IoT in healthcare is effective\
    \ in tracking medical supplies and automating \nbasic data collection and patient\
    \ monitoring, so that the experienced healthcare workers can be \nset free from\
    \ repetitive tasks to focus on patients’ safety and services(Best, 2018). Hospitals\
    \ can \nuse IoT technology to track the use of medical equipment and consumables.\
    \ In most hospitals, \nequipment such as electrocardiographs and analgesic pumps\
    \ needs to be shared by patients. IoT \ncan not only provide insights for hospital\
    \ staff to plan resource allocation by sending the real-\ntime location of the\
    \ device, but also can be used to monitor the maintenance status of the device\
    \ \nand issue alerts when appropriate. For some medical consumables that are being\
    \ consumed at \nfast speed, low-cost RFID tags allow them to be marked, so it\
    \ is easy to count usage and then \ncharge the patient's account. At the same\
    \ time, tracking the usage of these medical consumables \ncan also help hospitals\
    \ manage inventory. For example, when the consumption of certain items \nis too\
    \ high or the rate of use is too fast, an alarm will be issued to remind the hospital\
    \ to \nreplenish inventory or reduce excessive consumption (Laplante & Laplante,\
    \ 2016). \nFor hospitals and some other healthcare providers, the significance\
    \ of using IoT is that \nafter collecting a massive amount of data from ground\
    \ devices, meaningful trends and \nconclusions can be drawn through centralized\
    \ sorting and analysis. These analytics deliverables \ncan be suggestions of medical\
    \ assistance or overall visualization of the condition of a patient \ngroup. Figure\
    \ 1is an illustration of the workflow of IoT solutions in healthcare (Mora et\
    \ al., \n2017; Mora, Gil, Terol, Azorín, & Szymanski, 2017) \n \n16 \n \nFigure\
    \ 1. Schema of IoT workflow (Mora et al., 2017) \n3.3.2 The Internet of Things\
    \ in Finance \n \nThe applications of IoT have transformed the way that the financial\
    \ sector works. \nKhanboubi et al. (2019)summarized the following trend in which\
    \ IoT solutions are changing \nfinancial services, mobile banking, crowd-based\
    \ financing, virtual money, high frequency \ntrading firms, cyber criminality,\
    \ big data and IT analytics. The applications of IoT in finance \ncan be classified\
    \ into two categories, one is financial services for individual users and corporate\
    \ \nusers, and the other is the measures used by banks and other financial institutions\
    \ to optimize \nand upgrade their own workflow. The most common of the first type\
    \ of application is the \nbanking service provided to users that can be accessed\
    \ at any time through a personal terminal. \nThese services include using the\
    \ user’s biological information to perform security \nauthentication of the banking\
    \ business or to replace the physical signature during the business \nprocess;\
    \ using the built-in near-field communication technologies (NFC) module of mobile\
    \ \nphone or wearable device to complete contactless payment; collecting funding\
    \ from a large \nnumber of individual to support a project financially via an\
    \ online platform (Khanboubi et al., \n2019). \nThere are some other IoT applications\
    \ in finance designed for business security and risk \nmanagement. For example,\
    \ Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is using IoT solutions for \nits financing\
    \ business risk management practices. RFID tags are deployed on collateral to\
    \ detect \nthe movement of objects. Any abnormal movement can trigger the alarm\
    \ system, a realization \n \n17 \nof the automatic collection of alarm information\
    \ and early warning of risk monitoring (InfoQ, \n2019). \n3.4 Concerns regarding\
    \ sensor nodes and the network \nAs discussed above, ICT sensor networks can indeed\
    \ play an effective role in detecting \nfarmland environment and controlling the\
    \ application of yield technology, but use of this \ntechnology in agriculture\
    \ is confronted with the limitations and challenges including, but not \nlimited\
    \ to, lifetime, energy and reliability. \n3.4.1 Energy consumption and Battery\
    \ life \nThe power unit is an essential part of an ICT sensor node (Sliva, 2008).\
    \ Rechargeable \nbatteries are usually used for power supply in a sensor node,\
    \ which have limited capacity and \npose a challenge to long-term deployment.\
    \ These batteries provide stable electricity to the other \nmodule in a sensor\
    \ node, so that each part of the node can work properly. To enhance energy \n\
    efficiency within a sensor node, the circuits and algorithm of the processing\
    \ and calculating \nmodule of a node have to be further optimized (Jawad, Nordin,\
    \ Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, \n2017). In wireless sensor networks, the lifetime\
    \ of a node is generally determined by its power \nunit, usually the life of batteries\
    \ used in the sensor nodes. To utilize the maximum of the battery \nlife, power\
    \ consumption of the nodes should be strictly controlled, which means that the\
    \ \nprogram and algorithms inside the nodes should be optimized and improved (Sliva,\
    \ 2008). The \ngood news is that the problem of limited node lifespan can be addressed,\
    \ with the use of \nenergy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been\
    \ developed to allow sensor nodes \nto harvest different types of energy, such\
    \ as solar, wireless power transfer, mechanical vibration, \nkinetic, and wind\
    \ energy, from different environments. Ambient energy can be converted into \n\
    electrical energy, and the electric energy can be used to charge the battery of\
    \ a sensor node, or \nit can be stored for later use. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to \nextend the life of sensor nodes (Jawad, Nordin,\
    \ Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017). \n3.4.2 Equilibrium among energy consumption,\
    \ transmission range and node performance \nIn the realm of wireless communication\
    \ protocols, ZigBee consumes much less power \nthan these traditional transmission\
    \ methods, including Wi-Fi and GPRS, but the latter has a \nwider transmission\
    \ range. Similar trade-offs occur from time to time. Zigbee and low-energy \n\
    \ \n18 \nBluetooth are designed for battery-powered devices. Low-energy Bluetooth\
    \ is superior to \nZigBee in terms of power consumption, but due to its short\
    \ communication distance of 10 \nmeters, the protocol is limited in agricultural\
    \ applications. The Long-Range Radio (LoRa) \nProtocol covers large communication\
    \ areas with low power consumption. Therefore, it can be \nappropriately deployed\
    \ in a wide agricultural field. However, for this protocol, limited \ncommunication\
    \ time per hour for each device and message capacity for communication, and its\
    \ \ndependency on gateway make this protocol no longer the best option for configuring\
    \ \nagricultural ICT sensor networks (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail,\
    \ 2017). \n3.4.3 Transmission loss \nWhen deployed for agricultural purposes,\
    \ WSN faces a more difficult environment than \nother uses, such as outdoor, orchards,\
    \ farms and other complex terrain. Signal transmission will \nbe disturbed by\
    \ obstacles. In agricultural applications, signals transmitted from sensor nodes\
    \ \nneed to reach the receiving node through a thick canopy. If a sufficient gap\
    \ cannot be ensured, \nthe signal will be absorbed, reflected, attenuated and\
    \ scattered during the propagation process \n(Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad,\
    \ & Ismail, 2017). \n3.4.4 Immediate and reliable \nThe starting point for the\
    \ establishment of WSN determines that one of its first tasks is \nto provide\
    \ farmers with low-latency environmental information. Most crops are easily affected\
    \ \nby the weather. If WSN fails to detect environmental changes in a timely manner,\
    \ or detects \ninformation but does not transmit it to relevant clients in a timely\
    \ manner, it may lead to serious \nagricultural disasters, such as large-scale\
    \ diseases and insect pests, floods, fires, etc. Regarding \nsome existing ICT\
    \ sensor networks deployed in farms, the way they work is still to wait until\
    \ \nsymptoms appear so that the disease can be detected. Such systems do not qualify\
    \ as early \nwarning systems in detecting disease and pests (Datir & Wagh, 2014).\
    \ \n3.4.5 Fault tolerance \nIn ICT sensor networks, it is normal for one of the\
    \ hundreds of thousands of nodes to \nfail. Common causes include power exhaustion,\
    \ communication failure, and sensor module \nfailure. At this time, the most important\
    \ thing is to design a set of topological structures with \nstrong fault tolerance,\
    \ to prevent the entire network from collapsing due to a failed node(Jawad, \n\
    \ \n19 \nNordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017). Apart from solving this problem\
    \ from the \nperspective of network topology, some further improvement on the\
    \ combination of nodes \narchitecture and the network can be done as well. Geeta\
    \ et al.(2013) suggested a possible way \nof improvement. A single sensor node\
    \ should have the capability to send early alert to its \nneighbour node when\
    \ its battery is low or when it gets external interference, offering the \nnetwork\
    \ with enough time to adjust a transmission route to avoid network collapse. Hang\
    \ et \nal.(2015)designed a three-tiered unmanned aerial vehicle sensor network\
    \ for capturing \ninformation from farmland. This architecture realizes the extension\
    \ of the life of sensor nodes \nby reducing the transmission tasks of sensor nodes\
    \ in WSN. It enhances the data collection \nefficiency and life of the entire\
    \ system by enhancing the function of relay nodes and power \nsupply, reducing\
    \ resource consumption caused by transmission node failures, and improving \n\
    the network communication quality provided by mobile nodes. \n3.4.6 Data management\
    \ \nAgricultural monitoring practices generate large amounts of data because multiple\
    \ \nWSNs in agricultural applications include multiple crop sensor growth analysis\
    \ and harvest \nestimates. This situation requires the base station to monitor\
    \ and change farmland through \nanalysis mode. Therefore, base stations must support\
    \ high levels of storage capacity (Jawad et \nal., 2017). \n3.5 Review of ICT\
    \ sensor networks in agriculture \nDigital farming is the practice of modern technologies\
    \ such as sensors, robotics, and \ndata analysis for shifting from tedious operations\
    \ to continuously automated processes \n(Shamshiri et al., 2018). The terms digital\
    \ farming and precision agriculture are often used to \ndescribe the same concept\
    \ in many current contexts, but they are not the same thing. The \nconcept of\
    \ precision agriculture (PA) has been proposed for ages. At the very beginning,\
    \ PA \nwas mainly focused on the matching of environmental factors such as insitu\
    \ climate, soil \nproperty, and crop species (Krishna, 2016). \nInnovation in\
    \ digital farming occurs where the crops interact with their external \nenvironment,\
    \ for example, the physical, biological, and chemical components (Es van & \n\
    Woodard, 2017). Therefore, inspiration for innovations could be derived from the\
    \ factors that \naffect crop productivity. Lazarcik (1963) developed a term output-input\
    \ ratio for measuring \n \n20 \nproductivity. This ratio is about the relationship\
    \ of agricultural output to all production inputs \nused to produce that output.\
    \ It measures average aggregate productivity of all inputs together \n(operating\
    \ expenses, depreciation, interest on capital and cost of labor). It indicates\
    \ that in order \nto increase the productivity in agriculture, measures aiming\
    \ for both higher output and smaller \ninput should be taken. \nThere have been\
    \ many achievements in using wireless sensor networks in farms to \nmonitor the\
    \ environmental factors that affect crop yield, including but not limited to soil\
    \ \nmoisture, temperature, pH value, soil microbes load. Kalaivani et al. (2011)surveyed\
    \ ZigBee-\nbased wireless sensor networks in agriculture, which covers the features\
    \ and some drawbacks \nof the application of ZigBee in agribusiness. This transmission\
    \ protocol has good capability of \ntransmitting data with few losses within its\
    \ complimentary range, with low power consumption, \nprice and deployment difficulty.\
    \ However, the transmission quality can be significantly \nimpaired as the distance\
    \ changes and vegetable canopy keeps growing. The reason is that there \nis a\
    \ significant gray zone which is a range of distance between transmitter and receiver\
    \ where \nthe transmission doesn't work, and if the route between transmitter\
    \ and receiver is physically \nblocked by plant canopy, the connection would be\
    \ disturbed and closed (Kalaivani , Allirani, & \nPriya, 2011). \nYadav et al.\
    \ (2012)described a method to use wireless sensor networks to ensure that \neveryone\
    \ has enough food in some developing areas. In this study, wireless sensor networks\
    \ \nwere used to monitor the life cycle of food from producing stage to sales\
    \ stage. This monitoring \nprocess includes establishing a database by mapping\
    \ agricultural production and food shortages, \nconstructing efficient ways of\
    \ communication during emergency, monitoring real-time \nagricultural conditions\
    \ and sending an alert if an indicator meets its threshold. \nOjha et al.(2015)reviewed\
    \ various applications of WSNs in an agricultural context. \nThey divided wireless\
    \ sensor networks into two types according to different scenarios, which \nare\
    \ Terrestrial WSNs and Underground WSNs. They also listed some potential applications\
    \ \nsuch as automated irrigation scheduling for saving water, maintaining an optimized\
    \ \nenvironment for higher plant growth, monitoring cattle activities and ground\
    \ water quality to \nensure the cattle are staying in an appropriate environment\
    \ and location, simulating greenhouse \ngas distribution, and agricultural production\
    \ processing monitoring. These applications indicate \n \n21 \nthe feasibility\
    \ of utilizing ICT sensor network technologies in farms to improve production\
    \ by \ncreating optimal environment for crops. \nZhao et al. (2010) designed a\
    \ greenhouse environment monitoring system using IoT \ntechnology. This system\
    \ can control the on-site environment in real time according to the needs \nof\
    \ plants for temperature and humidity. Also, it’s able to collect a large amount\
    \ of \nenvironmental data and send it to research institutions for further processing\
    \ and analysis. \nDholu and Ghodinde (2018)created a similar IoT-based system\
    \ which can sense necessary \nparameters from the environment and make the necessary\
    \ decisions to control an actuator for \nirrigation. \nThe application of the\
    \ Internet of Things in agriculture is not limited to reading \nenvironmental\
    \ parameters and then taking corresponding irrigation or fertilization measures.\
    \ \nThe information collected by smart devices in the Internet of Things can be\
    \ accurately analyzed \nto improve agricultural productivity. Elijah et al.(2018)classified\
    \ the analysis into the following \ncategories. \nPrediction. The huge quantity\
    \ of environmental data such as moisture and temperature \ncollected by sensor\
    \ nodes and other smart devices in an IoT network can be used to develop \npredictive\
    \ algorithms to notify when diseases, drought, flood or fire is about to happen.\
    \ \nInventory management. In terms of storing agriproducts, external moisture\
    \ and \ntemperature can influence the quality of products significantly. In this\
    \ scenario, sensor nodes \nare deployed in inventory to collect this information.\
    \ After the data analysis has been sent to the \ncloud and analysis has been conducted,\
    \ automatic command will be sent for adjusting the \ncondition of inventory. This\
    \ practice can reduce the negative influence of spoilage and pests on \nfood quality.\
    \ \nDecision making. Big data obtained from sensors provides learning opportunities\
    \ to \nimprove decision-making for changing environmental conditions. An ideal\
    \ outcome of this \nanalysis is automatic decision-making by IoT systems involving\
    \ few human interventions, \nwhich could set the workers free from repetitive\
    \ work. \nInsurance. Agricultural activities are vulnerable to natural disasters.\
    \ IoT devices \ndeployed in remote areas can notify farmers or insurance companies\
    \ when a hazard or disaster \n \n22 \nis detected, reminding them to settle claims.\
    \ When extreme weather or another condition is \ndetected, access to information\
    \ by an insurance company can allow the company to make \nautomatic direct payment\
    \ to policyholders, initiated by the IoT system (Elijah, Rahman, \nOrikumhi, Leow,\
    \ & Hindia, 2018). \nUtilizing ICT sensor networks for collecting data from farmland\
    \ assists the farmers to \nmatch cropping practices to climatic trends, to use\
    \ inputs and resources more sustainably and \nreduce environmental impact, and\
    \ to cope with productivity threats. Moreover, it can enable \npublic officials\
    \ to integrate the data across the country and to adjust policies to reflect the\
    \ data \ncollected, to predict food supplies, and to target social programs or\
    \ promote yield technologies \n(World Bank, 2017). \n3.6 How do crops interact\
    \ with the external environment? \n3.6.1 Environmental factors \nWater and temperature\
    \ \nUnfavorable water and thermal conditions could sharply reduce crop yields.\
    \ For \nexample, excessively high temperature proved to have negative effect on\
    \ the yield of maize \n(Carter et al., 2016) and at the same time low-temperature\
    \ stress may damage photosynthesis \n(Oquist, 1983).Excessive high or low temperature\
    \ would impede the activity of enzymes, and \naffect the efficiency of metabolism\
    \ of plants.  \nAgriculture is one of the major consumer industries in the world\
    \ (Cazadilla et al., 2010). \nTwo aspects related to water consumption should\
    \ be considered, the direct effects of water \ncontent on crop growth, and the\
    \ economic cost of using water. In agribusiness, the term water \nproductivity\
    \ (WP), defined as the amount of yield produced per unit volume of water (\U0001D458\
    \U0001D454/\U0001D45A3), \nis often used to assess the efficiency of water usage\
    \ (Patil et al., 2015). Therefore, higher yield \nwith smaller water input can\
    \ be regarded as success in improving the productivity of crops. \nRespiration\
    \ by soil microorganisms can increase with increasing irrigation under water stress,\
    \ \nbut excessive irrigation can suppress soil respiration under the condition\
    \ of flooding (Wang, \nZhao, & Ouyang, 2010). For the crops, changes in atmospheric\
    \ moisture can alter the way their \nstomata work, and in turn the process of\
    \ plant transpiration, energy balance and tissue \ntemperatures (Grantz, 1990).\
    \ In some cases, the combination of high temperature and high \n \n23 \nvapor\
    \ pressure deficits could result in crops wilting when the water that crops take\
    \ up from soil \ncannot make up for the evaporation loss into the air (Carter,\
    \ Melkonian, Riha, & Shaw, 2016).  \nSoil nutrients \nSoil nutrients can be divided\
    \ into three types according to the amount that plants need \nduring for growth:\
    \ primary nutrients, secondary nutrients and micro-nutrients (Moore & \nBradley,\
    \ 2018). Fertilizer can be considered as a supplement to the original deficiencies\
    \ in the \nsoil, and the amount of fertilizers added to the soil should be precisely\
    \ calculated and controlled. \nN, P, and K are the most limiting factors in crop\
    \ production (primary nutrients) (Warpe & \nPippal, 2016).However, excessive application\
    \ of N-P-K fertilizers would lead to degradation of \nboth soil and water quality,\
    \ and production of crops. For example, nitrate leaching from the \nirrigated\
    \ farmland may move to lakes and groundwater, and then result in eutrophication\
    \ in \nlakes and nitrogen pollution in groundwater (Ju et al., 2007; Savci, 2012).\
    \ This practice in \ncontrolling the volume and usage of fertilizer is coined\
    \ as fertilizer management, which takes \nenvironmental, agronomic and economic\
    \ effects into consideration (Matson, Naylor, & Ortiz-\nMonasterio, 1998). \n\
    Soil pH \nA major issue regarding soil pH in agribusiness is soil acidity, resulting\
    \ from diverse \ncauses. For example, the parent rock material may enter soil\
    \ or groundwater due to weathering \n(Xu, 2015). Another cause of acidification\
    \ emerging in recent decades is the excessive use of \nchemical fertilizers. Common\
    \ chemicals found in artificial fertilizers, including ammonium \nsulfate, ammonium\
    \ phosphate, potassium nitrate, and ammonium nitrate have proven to be able \n\
    to lead to increase in H+ concentration in farmland soil (Pierre, 1928). A direct\
    \ effect of higher \nconcentration of H+ on soil is that activities and metabolism\
    \ of the microbes in soil could be \naffected. Altered soil pH may create conditions\
    \ that are less optimal for microbes or plants. \nExtreme pH could even inactivate\
    \ them. Some researchers have demonstrated the correlation \nbetween the soil\
    \ enzyme activity and crop yield (Tautges, Sullivan, Reardon, & Burke, 2016).\
    \ \nThere is another indirect effect that H+ could have on the soil. Higher concentration\
    \ of H+ \ncould change the form in which aluminum (and other metals) exist in\
    \ soil, and can increase the \n \n24 \nsolubility of Al+3in soil pore water (Gazey\
    \ & Azam, 2018). Excessive aluminum can lead to \nthe death of aquatic organisms,\
    \ the wilting of terrestrial plants, the reduction of crop yields, and \nthe decline\
    \ of forests (Weng, Huang, Liu, & Sato, 2000). Research conducted by Abruña-\n\
    Rodríguezet al. (1982) showed that higher concentrations of H+ and Al+3, decreased\
    \ the yield \nof crops like yam and cassava relative to their maximum yield. \
    \ \nSoil microbes \n \nSoil microbes consist of the fungi and bacteria in soil.\
    \ Soil microbes maintain or alter \nthe microscopic soil physical and chemical\
    \ properties by their metabolic activities, including \nthe soil properties in\
    \ the plant rhizosphere, influencing the efficiency with which plants are able\
    \ \nto utilize the soil nutrients (Sessitsch & Mitter, 2015). There is increasing\
    \ evidence that \nbiotechnology using microbes or their metabolites can enhance\
    \ nutrient uptake and yield of \ncrops, control pests and reduce plant stress\
    \ responses (Trivedi, Schenk, Wallenstein, & Singh, \n2017). At the same time,\
    \ research conducted by Gu et al. (2009)showed that a combination N-\nP-K fertilizer\
    \ could increase soil microbial biomass, diversify bacterial communities, and\
    \ \nmaintain crop production.  \nSoil depth \nResearch conducted by Khakural et\
    \ al.(1996)shows that the fertility of deeper soil can \ncontribute much to crop\
    \ yield than the fertility of topsoil. Williams et al. (1999) found that \nunder\
    \ sub-optimal living conditions, the properties of topsoil are definitely important\
    \ for \npredicting crop yield, while the properties of subsoil are relatively\
    \ more important in limiting \ncrop yields under normal conditions (Williams,\
    \ Ahuja, Naney, Ross, & Barnes, 1987). \nFarmland slope \n \nFarmland in sloping\
    \ area tends to have a thinner layer of soil (Atherton, Morgan, \nShearer, Stombaugh,\
    \ & Ward, 1999). Steep slopes are more vulnerable to soil erosion, therefore \n\
    soil layer on the slope is usually thinner, and the soil water content and soil\
    \ fertility are also \nrelatively poor (Mohammadi, Jalali, Kooch, & Said-Pullicino,\
    \ 2016), although Yang et \nal.(1998)found that the slope of farmland can have\
    \ a positively significant relationship with \nyield of wheat. \n \n25 \n3.7 Cultural\
    \ factors \n \nCommon cultural practices in agriculture include irrigation patterns,\
    \ fertilizer \napplication, planting spacing and density, intensity of various\
    \ routine agricultural practices, and \nharvesting time. The mechanism by which\
    \ some of these practices is able to influence crop \nyield is by modifying the\
    \ availability of sunlight (Atherton, Morgan, Shearer, Stombaugh, & \nWard, 1999).\
    \ Pathiratna et al.(2004)conducted several experiments to study the effects of\
    \ \nfertilizer, spacing and shade on the growth and yield of Aerva lanata. Results\
    \ from these \nexperiments showed that crops treated with organic and inorganic\
    \ fertilizers could produce \nhigher dry matter yields. Crops established with\
    \ a closer spacing have lower yield and growth \nthan those with wider planting\
    \ spacing, if yield per area is not considered. Ashraf and Saeed \n(2006) compared\
    \ two different irrigation methods in an area with saline groundwater. The \n\
    result shows that root zone of the crops which are treated with alternative, reduced-frequency\
    \ \nfurrow irrigation has smaller accumulation of salt than that with regular\
    \ furrow irrigation \n(Ashraf & Saeed, 2006). The planting date of a crop is fundamental\
    \ information for the \nmodeling of planting activities. It can be calculated\
    \ based on historical weather information \n(Dobor et al., 2016). Research conducted\
    \ by Kucharik (2008) in the United States shows that \nthe planting date, especially\
    \ the timing of planting the seeds has a significant impact on yield of \nmaize.\
    \ \nApart from the factors above, Krebs (1984)mentioned that there are some major\
    \ ways \nthat crops yield can be improved, including (1) improved quality of crop\
    \ varieties, (2) improved \nresistance to diseases, (3) improved resistance to\
    \ insects, and (4) adaptation to climatic \ncondition. \nThese known factors provide\
    \ direction for researchers and farm operators to improve \ncrops yield and labor\
    \ productivity. Among these factors, soil properties that can be measured by \n\
    sensors include soil moisture, concentration of specific ions required for plant\
    \ growth, and soil \nelectrical conductivity. Lab test and insitu measurements\
    \ on these soil properties of their \ncorresponding sensors are well matched.\
    \ However, for a lot of soil nutrients and soil organic \nmatter, there are not\
    \ reliable sensors for measurement.  \n \n26 \n3.8 Integration of sensor networks\
    \ with other ICT products for boosting production in \nagriculture \nAgriculture\
    \ is an important sector for the continuous growth of developing countries, \n\
    especially large agricultural countries. More than 80% of those who live in remote\
    \ areas are \nengaged in agriculture. The World Bank provided a guideline to guarantee\
    \ the security of \nreliable and stable access to nutritious, affordable food,\
    \ with access resilient to climate change. \nAs the World Bank pointed out in\
    \ a report, increasing the output of the agriculture, forestry, \nanimal husbandry\
    \ and fishery industries requires: 1) utilizing insitu technologies to characterize\
    \ \nfield conditions, in order to provide the optimal resources for plant growth.\
    \ These farming \npractices, after optimization, would result in more sustainable\
    \ and profitable farming; 2) \neliminating yield losses through early warning\
    \ systems. This revolves around identifying the \ninfection, disease, and upcoming\
    \ bad weather. \nMost farmers have access to the means of production and yield\
    \ enhancing technologies \nthat can help them increase their crop yields, such\
    \ as fertilizers and pesticides. Meanwhile, \nsometimes they do not know how to\
    \ use these products in a proper way. Although these \nproducts are usually equipped\
    \ with instructions, different application scenarios always have \ndifferent applicable\
    \ standards, with no universal standard practice. In this case, ICT technology\
    \ \ncan fill the gap of farmers' knowledge. With the help of ICT farmers can use\
    \ the optimal \nsolution for consuming resources in agriculture(World Bank, 2017).\
    \ \nIn agricultural production, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are often used\
    \ in \nconjunction with ICT sensor networks. UAV is very suitable for spraying\
    \ pesticides and \nfertilizers due to its high speed and spraying efficiency (Costa\
    \ et al., 2012). However, as is \nmentioned in Faiçal et al.’s work(2014), the\
    \ working route of a UAV spraying pesticides or \nfertilizer is prone to being\
    \ disturbed by wind.The architecture and workflow of Costa’s \nUAV+sensor networks\
    \ monitoring system was similar to that of Faiçal et al.The UAV has to \ncommunicate\
    \ with sensor nodes on the ground periodically to make sure that it’s in the proper\
    \ \nlocation (Costa et al., 2012). \nZhang et al. (2015) designed a three-tiered\
    \ UAV farmland sensor network (TUFSN) for \ncapturing information. Figure 2is\
    \ an illustration of their network architecture. The data \ncollection layer on\
    \ the ground is where the distributed sensor network can monitor the external\
    \ \n \n27 \nenvironment and grab information. In this layer, a large number of\
    \ sensor nodes are deployed to \nstrengthen the monitoring of a target data collecting\
    \ area. Another feature of this layer is self-\norganization. Layered protocols\
    \ and distributed algorithms allow wireless sensor nodes to \nautonomously schedule\
    \ their work processes. When deployed to a specific area and activated, \nthe\
    \ corresponding network can be organized automatically. The relay transmission\
    \ layer \nconsists of a network established between the relay node and the UAV\
    \ mobile node. This layer \nhas the following characteristics: 1) simple structure:\
    \ direct communication between UAV and \nthe data collection layer; 2) more energy\
    \ available: the data collection layer is generally \npowered by solar energy\
    \ so that UAV can be powered by rechargeable batteries; 3) stable and \nreliable:\
    \ UAV communicates with the ground data collection layer in the air. The possibility\
    \ of \nbeing blocked by plants or houses in the middle is low, and the packet\
    \ loss rate will be reduced; \n4) Long communication distance: the communication\
    \ quality is good, and it can provide larger \npower antenna coverage. The mobile\
    \ convergence layer consists of a single or multiple UAVs \nand a network established\
    \ between data centres. UAV and data centres are directly connected \nby a cellular\
    \ data network. The mobile convergence layer network has a very long \ncommunication\
    \ distance, has error detection and packet loss retransmission functions, and\
    \ \nsupports real-time or delayed data transmission. Compared with the traditional\
    \ static WSN, in \nterms of economic efficiency, this architecture is more suitable\
    \ for scattered land, hills and \nmountains, and the ground wireless sensor network\
    \ has difficulty or is unable to form a \ncomplete network due to natural environment\
    \ constraints. They are divided into multiple \nindependent networks. The limitation\
    \ of this system is that flight missions are performed only \nwhen data are needed,\
    \ so the frequency of UAV flights determines the frequency of data \nupdates (Zhang\
    \ et al., 2015). \n \n28 \n \nFigure 2. Three-tiered UAV farmland sensor network\
    \ by Zhang et al. (2015) \nApart from the sensor networks studied in this article,\
    \ image-based techniques are \nanother major part of the ICT solutions applied\
    \ in agriculture. Remote sensing is a hit. In \ngeneral, remote sensing technology\
    \ refers to acquiring image information about an object in a \nnon-invasive way,\
    \ without actually coming into contact with it, from a physically high altitude\
    \ \nand a macro perspective (Horning, 2008). \nWhen applied to agriculture, the\
    \ major role of remote sensing technology is to collect \nraw data from farmland.\
    \ The methods of obtaining data and the form of data from mobile \nphones include\
    \ aerial images taken by airplane, helicopter, radio-controlled aircraft, and\
    \ \nunmanned aerial vehicles; satellite images captured by satellites in orbit;\
    \ surface GPS receivers \nand satellite linkage to obtain positioning information;\
    \ laser scanning, using a set of laser beams \nto measure accurate elevation,\
    \ i.e. the distance from an aircraft to features on the ground, \npruning the\
    \ disturbance of trees and buildings on the ground. This means that when measuring\
    \ \nthe elevation of sensing aircraft, ground elevation under tree canopy can\
    \ be measured (World \nBank, 2017).After data are collected by remote sensing\
    \ technology, the following analytic tools \nare used to provide a deeper understanding\
    \ of the farmland system being studied. With spatial \nmodeling, existing data\
    \ can be used to simulate the real-world farmland. Using data mining \ntechniques,\
    \ patterns of crops, such as their growth rate characteristics can be extracted\
    \ from the \ndata set. \n \n29 \nThe workflow of collecting and analysing image-based\
    \ data has been widely used in \nagriculture. Reinecke and Prinsloo(2017)designed\
    \ a system, using drones to capture aerial \nphotos of plant leaf. These data\
    \ were used to determine whether the crops were healthy. \nHonkavaara et al.(2013)used\
    \ drones to take aerial images at pre-set time intervals at the \nbeginning of\
    \ the crop growing season, during the season, and before harvest to check the\
    \ \ngrowth of the entire field and highlight growth stagnation caused by insufficient\
    \ irrigation or \nlow initial nitrogen content. Biossard et al. (2008)provided\
    \ a technique based on automatic \ninterpretation applied to images of rose leaves\
    \ scanned in situ. They propose a cognitive vision \nsystem that combines image\
    \ processing, learning, and knowledge-based technologies. The \nsystem is able\
    \ to detect and count white flies (Trialeurode Vaporariorum Westwood) at \nmaturity.\
    \ This technology provides early warning for pest management so that measures\
    \ can be \ntaken to reduce losses before the pests become severe.  \nApplication\
    \ of remote sensing technology is not limited to identifying bad weather, \nplant\
    \ disease and pests. On a smaller scale, this technology is widely used on individual\
    \ crops, \nsuch as for classification of vegetables, fruits, and livestock. Traditionally,\
    \ the classification \nwork is often finished by the human workers who are well\
    \ trained and experienced. However, \nthere are some disadvantages to relying\
    \ on the human workforce for classification. For example, \nthe classifying worker\
    \ may feel tired or lose concentration and then lower the accuracy of \nclassification.\
    \ Ideally, there should be a standard diagram for the workers to refer to when\
    \ \nclassifying, which will increase difficulty of work. Also, raters are prone\
    \ to various illusions \n(Barbedo, 2013). Therefore, image processing techniques\
    \ are needed for these tasks to relieve \nworkload.  \nGastelum-Barrios et al.(2011)reviewed\
    \ newly emergent non-invasive image processing \nmethods in determining the quality\
    \ of fruits during and after the harvesting period, and \nconcluded that it is\
    \ a high-efficiency and harmless solution to grade the fruits. Singh et al. \n\
    (2011)customized an automated classifier of four different bamboo species based\
    \ on shape \nfeatures of bamboo Culm sheath, using the central moment classifier.\
    \ Their classifier for \nbamboo shows considerable recognition accuracy, which\
    \ has great potential on saving labour of \nmanually recognizing bamboo species.\
    \ This outcome proved the possibility of putting this \ntechnology into commercial\
    \ use. Latha et al.(2014) implemented an image processing function \n \n30 \n\
    to detect weed areas. Once the function was equipped onto pesticide sprayers,\
    \ the automatic \nsprayers can target these blocks covered by weed. This not only\
    \ saves pesticides, but also \navoids generating agricultural waste, and additional\
    \ effects on the environment and other plants \ncaused by excessive use. \nPatil\
    \ (2011) designed a measuring method for leaf area based on image processing \n\
    techniques. A traditional graphic measuring method was used to verify the accuracy\
    \ of \nmeasuring leaf area using image processing. The new method proved to have\
    \ high precision \nand accuracy and take less processing time. This result provided\
    \ a theoretical basis for the \ndevelopment of an imagery leaf area meter that\
    \ meets the requirements of precision farming. \nXu et al. (2011)developed an\
    \ algorithm that can tell whether the plants are suffering \nfrom nutrient deficiency,\
    \ by recognizing the color and texture of the leaf. The accuracy of this \ndiagnostic\
    \ algorithm was above 82.5% and it was able to diagnose disease 6–10 days before\
    \ \nexperts could determine it. Arakeri et al. (2015)implemented a system which\
    \ provided early \nwarning to detect diseases on tomatoes. Tomatoes are very prone\
    \ to a disease called late blight, \nwhich happens when leaves get infected with\
    \ Phytophthora infestans fungus. Typical \nsymptoms of fungus infection include\
    \ irregularly shaped leaves and water-soaked lesions. This \nalert system was\
    \ able to recognize whether a leaf was ill or healthy, and whether the leaf had\
    \ \ncontracted the Phytophthora infestans fungus. The accuracy of analyzing the\
    \ late blight disease \nwas 84%. Chen et al. (2014)proposed an effective method\
    \ for judging the nutrient content of \ncrops. They extracted characteristic parameters\
    \ from years of images of healthy leaves and \nnutritionally deficient leaves.\
    \ They were able to determine from an image of a rice leaf whether \nthe plant\
    \ was deficient in N, P, and K based on the attributes of leaf sheath length,\
    \ leaf area / \nleaf length, leaf tip, leaf lightness, etc. The average identification\
    \ accuracy of this method for \nassessing N/P/K deficiencies was around 88%.In\
    \ 2019, Chen et al. optimized the algorithm of \nthis detection method, and the\
    \ average accuracy of recognition increased to 93.4%. \nApplication of image-based\
    \ technologies is not limited to crop assessment; it is \napplicable in animal\
    \ husbandry as well. Image processing systems have been widely used in \nmonitoring\
    \ livestock for many applications, including identification, tracking, behavior\
    \ analysis, \noccupancy rates, and activity calculations. Kashiha et al. (2014)designed\
    \ an image processing \nsystem for checking whether hens were staying inside the\
    \ chambers. This system could save \n \n31 \nmuch time on manually analysing videos\
    \ for monitoring hen chambers. Pradana et al. \n(2016)designed a method to accurately\
    \ estimate the weight of cattle, by visually measuring the \nbody length, chest\
    \ circumstance, height and width. Wongsriworaphon et al. (2012)conducted \nsimilar\
    \ research, but their focus was to recognize individual pigs based on their size\
    \ and weight. \nAppendix Table A2 from Gong (2010) compares the differences of\
    \ the node sensors \nfrom the perspective of price, reliability, performance and\
    \ power consumption. This table also \nlists some environmental parameters that\
    \ can be measured by available sensors, such as \ntemperature, carbon dioxide\
    \ concentration, and relative humidity. \n3.9 A case study illustrating use of\
    \ UAV and ICT sensor networks in sustainable agriculture \nThe system Faiçal et\
    \ al. (2014)designed for the linkage of unmanned aerial vehicles \n(UAV) and ICT\
    \ sensor networks for spraying pesticides is a typical application in agriculture,\
    \ \nand is described in detail in subsections below to illustrate the use. \n\
    3.9.1 Research background \n \nSpraying pesticides and fertilizers in farmland\
    \ is vital for crop yields. Aircrafts are \nbecoming more common and popular for\
    \ this task, mainly because of the speed and efficiency \nof aircraft spray operations.\
    \ However, certain factors may reduce yield and even cause damage. \nFor example,\
    \ the spraying process might miss some crop areas, repeat spraying in the same\
    \ \ncrop area, and apply pesticides to the outer edges of the farmland. This study\
    \ proposed an \narchitecture based on unmanned aerial vehicles that could be employed\
    \ to implement a control \nloop for agricultural applications with UAVs responsible\
    \ for spraying chemicals on crops. An \nalgorithm to adjust the UAV’s motion routes\
    \ when confronted with constantly changing wind \nwas also assessed in this work.\
    \ \n3.9.2 Methods and procedure \n \nIn this solution, an unmanned aerial vehicle\
    \ and several sensor nodes are deployed in \nthe farmland. The function of the\
    \ sensor mainly includes obtaining the current concentration of \nthe pesticide\
    \ chemical from the soil. Sensor nodes also communicate with the drone in the\
    \ air at \nany time to help the UAV verify its real-time position to avoid crossing\
    \ a boundary and \nspraying where it should not, or spraying an area repeatedly,\
    \ resulting in excessively high \n \n32 \nconcentrations of pesticides in a small\
    \ area causing damage to the crop. If the sensor detects \nexcess chemicals, the\
    \ drone in the air will be directed away from this area of excessive \nconcentration.\
    \ The role of the drone is relatively simple, it receives the concentration \n\
    information on the ground and judges whether it is necessary to spray. \nThe researchers\
    \ used the following steps to ensure that UAV sprayed pesticides where \nappropriate.\
    \ (1) The algorithm sends a message periodically to query sensor nodes scattered\
    \ \nthroughout the farmland. A sensor node located at a previous location of the\
    \ drone responds to \nthis message with information about the amount of pesticide.\
    \ (2) With this information, the \ndrone can calculate the difference in pesticide\
    \ concentration between each sensor node. (3) If \nthe difference is larger than\
    \ the predetermined threshold, the algorithm will re-plan the route, \notherwise\
    \ it will continue to advance in the predefined path and wait for the next round\
    \ of query. \nRegarding the robustness of this proposed algorithm for spraying\
    \ pesticides, the following \naspects were assessed. \nCalibration of UAV routes.\
    \ An unmanned aerial vehicle is influenced by wind when it is \nworking. A dataset\
    \ containing information about wind direction and intensity was used to \nreproduce\
    \ the constantly changing weather conditions, and check if the UAV was able to\
    \ \nhandle the changes. Also, considering the nature of the linkage of ICT sensor\
    \ network and \nUAV in this project, whether the number of message exchanges between\
    \ the two terminals \nwould improve performance was evaluated. \nMapping the pesticide\
    \ concentration. ICT sensor networks provide location information \nand information\
    \ on chemical concentrations to the UAV. However, in practice, crops may not \n\
    get the appropriate amount of pesticide. Possible reasons are the UAV may be flying\
    \ too fast, or \nthe pesticide spraying process may be disturbed by wind. Therefore,\
    \ given the information \nabout nodes location and their corresponding chemical\
    \ concentration, a complete map of \npesticide concentration distribution can\
    \ be drawn. A heat map is an illustration of pesticide \ndistribution, where green\
    \ represents higher concentrations, and red low concentrations (Figure \n3). For\
    \ the spraying system in this study, an ideal outcome is that each node of it\
    \ has the same \nor similar color. \n \n33 \n \nFigure 3. Map after the application\
    \ of the interpolation technique (Faiçal et al., 2014) \nPotential correlation\
    \ between UAV height and spray coverage. Researchers speculate \nthat drones need\
    \ to fly to a certain altitude when spraying to get the best spray effect. There\
    \ \nmay be a relationship between the spray angle / coverage and the height of\
    \ the drone, meaning \nthat the higher the UAV’s altitude, the larger the area\
    \ covered by the spray may be. \n3.9.3 Case study results \n \nFigure 4is a map\
    \ of pesticide concentrations after actual testing. Higher uniform the \ncolors\
    \ of this map represents higher stability and robustness of the algorithm, and\
    \ this feature \nlets the vehicle to be more resistant to wind disturbance. Most\
    \ areas of the farmland were \nsprayed with similar concentrations of pesticides,\
    \ leaving only several small clusters with \ninsufficient pesticide concentrations.\
    \ Researchers assessed the relationship between time \nrequired for communicating\
    \ with sensor nodes on the ground and height of the UAV, and the \ncorrelation\
    \ turned out to be insignificant. \n \nFigure 4. Map after the application of\
    \ the threshold value (Faiçal et al., 2014) \n3.9.4 Case study summary \nThis\
    \ project provided a practical example of the combination of ICT sensor networks\
    \ \nand some other ICT solutions, aiming to make agricultural activities to be\
    \ more precise. \nAccording to the result of assessing with simulation tools,\
    \ the algorithm designed for the \ncollaboration between UAV and ICT sensor networks\
    \ proved to work well. After further insitu \ntesting procedures, it would be\
    \ possible to utilize the system to improve sustainability in crop \nproduction\
    \ (Faiçal et al., 2014). \n \n \n34 \n4. Methodology \nThis study consists of\
    \ two parts designed to answer the research questions. The first part \nis to\
    \ simulate the performance (which is indicated by annual yield in this study)\
    \ of a farm where \nICT sensor networks are deployed. The second part is to conduct\
    \ a meta-analysis on the \noutcomes of existing studies and publications. \n4.1\
    \ Data sources \nData and information for this study were collected by two major\
    \ means, (1) published \nacademic papers that discussed the change in crop yield\
    \ of specific ICT sensor networks-based \nfarms; and (2) contacting the companies\
    \ who provide ICT sensor networks solutions for details \nof how the solutions\
    \ they provide work and performance data of their service. \n4.1.1 Samples overview\
    \ \n \nThis study examines how the annual crop yield would change, when ICT sensor\
    \ \nnetworks are deployed to control usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide.\
    \ Therefore, the sample \nfarms in this study all use ICT sensor networks to control\
    \ one or more of these agricultural \nresource usages. Figure shows the distribution\
    \ of where the selected farms are located. The \ninvolved crop types in this study\
    \ include maize, grape, rice. \n \nFigure 5. Geographical distribution of the\
    \ farms involved \n \nYara Water Solution is a part of a Farm Management System\
    \ offered by Yara Inc.in \nNorway, which can enable the farmers to save irrigation\
    \ water. This solution provides a \ncontinuous and non-destructive way of measuring\
    \ plant status. It uses sensors to measure the \nNorth America, 36%\nEurope, 36%\n\
    Asia, 8%\nAustralia, 16%\nSouth America, 4%\n \n35 \nturgor pressure of the plants’\
    \ leaves to determine if plants are deficient in water, and then \nmakes a decision\
    \ on whether to irrigate. The service provider of Yara Water Solution claims \n\
    that with this solution, the irrigation water consumption would drop by 20% while\
    \ yield \nincreases by 15%. Also, this solution will help save maintenance work\
    \ and corresponding \nenergy consumed (Yara, 2018). \nAtfarm (2018) monitors the\
    \ growth of fields with images taken remotely from satellite. \nIt makes it possible\
    \ for users to compare with images from previous years and to benchmark the \n\
    development of crops. Its performance of saving resources and boosting crop yield\
    \ is similar to \nYara (Atfarm, 2018). \nAccenture has been providing digital-based\
    \ farm services to farm owners for years. \nThese services are helping to improve\
    \ financial performance and to boost yield. Accenture \nDigital Agriculture Services\
    \ can help both large and small farms use digital technology to \nimprove processes,\
    \ increase yields and increase profitability to meet growing global food \ndemand\
    \ and to reduce the overall environmental impact of agriculture. Digital Agriculture\
    \ \nService can help increase overall profitability by $55 to $110 per acre (Accenture,\
    \ 2017). \nThe Field Manager created by Xarvio digital farming solutions supports\
    \ the users to \nknow better about the farmland they are working. The Manager\
    \ can provide real-time \ninformation of water and nutrition and can generate\
    \ a map for better visualization. Spray Timer \nis a product of the Field Manager\
    \ scheme. As is stated on the official website, Spray Timer can \nsave the amount\
    \ of pesticide application by up to 30% (Xarvio Digital FArming Solutions, \n\
    2020). \nDSS4Ag is an expert system for precision farming research. This system\
    \ uses advanced \nartificial intelligence and computer science technology to make\
    \ spatially variable fertilizer use \nand economically optimal decisions for specific\
    \ locations. Field testing was conducted in a \nwheat farmland, and the result\
    \ showed a 39.7% cost saving using the DSS4Ag as compared to \nthose blocks managed\
    \ by the farm’s traditional uniform applications practices, with only a 3.3% \n\
    decrease in yield (Hoskinson, Hess, & Fink, 1999). \nWhiteley implemented a precision\
    \ farming technology to monitor and control pesticide \napplication. The research\
    \ found that the estimated saving on pesticide can be as much as 80% \nof the\
    \ original application (Whiteley, 2002). \n \n36 \nA closed-loop, distributed\
    \ control and data acquisition system for site-specific irrigation \nmanagement\
    \ was introduced and developed by Wang & Li (2013). The system is formed by a\
    \ \ngroup of stationary field sensing nodes deployed in a field and a group of\
    \ nodes, called P2K \nnodes. These nodes collected the data from the field and\
    \ the central pivot system and \ntransmitted them to a master controller through\
    \ a power-line carrier communication. The \nsystem performance was compared with\
    \ a conventional uniform irrigation treatment in a potato \nfield. Results showed\
    \ that, with essentially equal water consumption, the tuber yield under site-\n\
    specific irrigation management was significantly greater, by about 4%, than the\
    \ yield from \nuniform irrigation (Wang & Li, 2013). \nBongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer\
    \ (2004)summarized the research carried out by \nWeisz et al.(1996)regarding the\
    \ performance of ICT sensor networks in controlling the amount \nof pesticide\
    \ applied in a commercial potato farmland. With the site-specific pest management\
    \ \nprogram, the input amount of pesticide in this experimental area dropped by\
    \ up to 40%. \nBausch and Delgado (2003)built an application to figure out if\
    \ it is feasible to use \nground-based sensing and the N Reflectance Index to\
    \ improve in-season N management of corn \nin a commercial sprinkler-irrigated\
    \ field. The results indicated that the application could reduce \nthe consumption\
    \ of nitrogen fertilizer by 47%. \nIn much of the literature that discusses ICT\
    \ sensor networks in farms, the effects of \nusing this service have not been\
    \ clearly described. To describe the performance of this type of \nfarm and the\
    \ benefits of wireless sensor networks, two indicators should be provided - the\
    \ \npercentage of agricultural resources that can be saved (e.g. water, fertilizer,\
    \ or pesticide), and \nthe effect on crop yield. Some of the articles reviewed\
    \ reported both indicators, while some of \nthem only provided one or neither\
    \ of these indicators.  \n4.2 Simulation \n \nIn this study, one of the aims was\
    \ to investigate the possible response to the equipment \nof ICT sensor networks\
    \ in farms for controlling the consumption of means of production in \nagriculture.\
    \ Before this predictive what-if analysis begins, the raw data collected from\
    \ \npublications and service providers have to be cleaned and formatted well according\
    \ to the \nmethodologies in the following paragraph.  \n \n37 \nThe collected\
    \ data are about the amount and percentage that usage of agricultural \nresources\
    \ including irrigation water, fertilizer and pesticide can be saved and reduced\
    \ by the \nwireless sensor networks solution in farm, and the amount and percentage\
    \ that crop yield can be \nimproved with the solutions. Apart from the numeric\
    \ data, location and crop type are recorded \nas well. These two attributes are\
    \ regarded as independent factors on sensor network \nperformance. \nThe first\
    \ step of data cleaning is to normalize all the raw data into the same value range,\
    \ \nand at the same time keeping the original relative deviation. In this case,\
    \ all the extents of \nchange in crop yield and resource usage are converted to\
    \ a value of percentage, which is the \n“final state” after ICT sensor networks\
    \ interfering with the crop production activities. These \nnormalized variables\
    \ include incremental changes in crop yield with ICT sensor networks, \npercentage\
    \ of saved resources, location, crop type, and information source. Table 1 is\
    \ an \nillustration of the details that will be analysed. \nTable 1. Illustration\

    \ Table 2, for some samples, one or more columns are missing. For this \nissue,\
    \ a R package called missForest is used for filling the missing values. This package\
    \ can \nhandle multivariate data consisting of continuous and categorical variables\
    \ simultaneously. This \nfeature matches the variable type of the dataset in this\
    \ study. Also, when applying this \nalgorithm, there is no need in setting tuning\
    \ parameters or making assumptions in data \ndistribution. The full potential\
    \ of missForest is deployed when the data include complex \ninteractions or non-linear\
    \ relations between variables of unequal scales and different types \n(Stekhoven\
    \ & Bühlmann, 2012).In other words, in contrast to the traditional way of using\
    \ \naverage or median values of missing data missForest uses a predictive algorithm\
    \ based on a \nrandom forest trained on the observed values to predict the missing\
    \ values. This will increase \nthe accuracy of estimated missing values. So far,\
    \ all the data used from here has been filled \n \n39 \nwith missing values with\
    \ missForest, and all variables have been normalized to the same value \nrange.\
    \ \nFor the modeling process, as is proposed in the methodology chapter, the first\
    \ step of \nmodeling was to preclude the statistical influence of locations on\
    \ the performance of ICT \nsensor networks. For this analysis, the General Linear\
    \ Model (GLM) Univariate procedure, \nwhich is based on the General Linear Model\
    \ procedure, was used for testing the significance of \nthe correlation of crop\
    \ production increasing and where the farms equipped with ICT sensor \nnetworks\
    \ are located. To assess the impact of location, general linear regression was\
    \ run with \nthe fixed factors being set as location. If the test statistic is\
    \ outside of the confidence intervals, \nthen the factor has a significant effect\
    \ on the response variable. In this study, the statistical \nsignificance of the\
    \ correlation between location and ICT sensor networks performance can be \nassessed\
    \ by this test. The statistical software used for this step was SPSS. In the GLM\
    \ \nregression setting in SPSS, the increased percentage of yield was set as the\
    \ dependent variable, \nand the percentage of water/fertilizer/pesticide saved\
    \ by ICT sensor network-based farms were \nset as covariates. This means that\
    \ the change in crop yield is the result of combined changes in \nusage of agricultural\
    \ input, controlled by ICT sensor networks.  \n \nThe following central issue\
    \ is to fit a function based on collected data. In this step, \nrandom forest\
    \ was used as the basis model for simulating how the farmland would respond with\
    \ \nICT sensor networks equipped on site. Random forest is a classifier consisting\
    \ of a collection of \ntree-structured classifiers {ℎ(\U0001D465, Θ\U0001D458\
    ),\U0001D458 = 1,… } where the {Θ\U0001D458} are independent identically \ndistributed\
    \ random vectors and each tree casts a unit vote for the most popular class at\
    \ input \U0001D465. \nWhen it comes to continuous numeric values instead of classification\
    \ questions, the random \nforest model works as well. Random forests for regression\
    \ are formed by growing trees \ndepending on a random vector Θ such that the tree\
    \ predictor ℎ(\U0001D465, Θ) takes on numerical values \nas opposed to class labels\
    \ (Breiman, 2001). This regressor fits classifying decision trees on \nvarious\
    \ sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy\
    \ and \ncontrol over-fitting (Pedregosa et al., 2011).  \nIn terms of implementation\
    \ of this simulation, a Python package called Scikit-learn was \nused. Scikit-learn\
    \ provides a functional implementation of the random forest regressor model, \n\
    RandomForestRegressor, which is written in Python. To optimize the accuracy of\
    \ modeling, \n \n40 \nparameters including, but not limited to, the number of\
    \ decision trees, maximum depth, \nminimum number of samples required to be at\
    \ a leaf node can be set to the model instance \n(scikit-learn, 2019). This implementation\
    \ has a class method score, which calculates the \ncoefficient of value (1 −\n\
    \U0001D462\n\U0001D463), where \U0001D462 is the residual sum of squares of the\
    \ difference between \nreal value and predicted value, and \U0001D463 is the total\
    \ sum of squares of the difference (Pedregosa et \nal., 2011). \nThis model can\
    \ be simplified to the form of \U0001D466 = \U0001D453(\U0001D4651,\U0001D465\
    2,\U0001D4653), where \U0001D466 stands for the \nincreased percentage of crop\
    \ yield, compared with the years during which ICT sensor networks \nare not used;\
    \ and \U0001D4651,\U0001D4652,\U0001D4653 represent the percentage of saving on\
    \ water, fertilizer and pesticide \nrespectively. The selected random forest Python\
    \ package provides several optional parameters, \nsuch as the number of trees\
    \ in the forest, criteria to measure the quality of splitting a tree, and \nminimum\
    \ number of samples required to be at a leaf node. I selected several parameters\
    \ that \nhave a significant impact on the random forest to fit the equation mentioned\
    \ above, and then \nfind a group of parameters that scored the highest among all\
    \ the parameter sets in an iterative \nway. After 500 experiments, it was found\
    \ that for the dataset in this study, the following \nparameter combinations had\
    \ the highest scores, with a score of 0.9946 (out of 1). This score \nindicates\
    \ that the current model fits the nature and distribution feature of dataset well.\
    \ \n{'bootstrap': True, 'criterion': 'mse', 'max_depth': None, 'max_features':\
    \ 'auto', \n'max_leaf_nodes': None, 'min_impurity_decrease': 0.0, 'min_impurity_split':\

    \ 0.0, 'n_estimators': 1, 'n_jobs': 1, 'oob_score': \nFalse, 'random_state': 50,'verbose':\
    \ 0, 'warm_start': False} \n \nGiven a model that has been fitted, predictive\
    \ analysis on the potential increase in crop \nyield with ICT sensor network deployed\
    \ for controlling external environment can be conducted. \nWith this predictive\
    \ model, as long as the percentages of the three resources saved are input, we\
    \ \ncan get a percentage of how the crop output will change in a farm using ICT\
    \ sensor networks. \n4.3 Meta-analysis \n \nMeta-analysis is a research method\
    \ that summarizes, integrates, and interprets selected \nsets of scholarly works\
    \ in the various disciplines (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).Glass (1976)defined \n \n\
    41 \nthis research method as statistical analysis on a collection of research\
    \ results from individual \nstudies. It is the application of specific design\
    \ and statistical methods to the overall and \nsystematic qualitative and quantitative\
    \ analysis of previous research results. It is retrospective \nand observational,\
    \ it is improvement on the traditional review (Xia, 2005). \n \nResearch findings\
    \ which are applicable for this method must meet the following criteria: \n(1)\
    \ they must deal with the same constructs and relationships, (2) they must be\
    \ configured in \nsimilar statistical forms. To be specific, the involved studies\
    \ must focus on the same correlation \nor causality relationship in the research\
    \ scope. In meta-analysis, effect sizes are used to \nrepresent the outcome of\
    \ each study. The effect size indicates the critical quantitative \ninformation\
    \ from each study. It should represent either the direction or the magnitude of\
    \ \nquantitative research findings, or both(Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). \n4.3.1 Analysis\
    \ steps \n \nThe statistic tool used for the meta-analysis is an R package called\
    \ metafor. The \nfunction rma() in this package allows for fitting fixed- and\
    \ random/mixed-effects models with \nor without moderators via the usual mechanics\
    \ of the general linear (mixed-effects) model \n(Viechtbauer, 2010). \nThere are\
    \ two major models to use for meta-analysis, the fixed-effects model and the \n\
    random-effects model. The difference between these two models is that a random-effects\
    \ model \nallows the true effect to vary among studies. For further scalability\
    \ (Brockwell & Gordon, \n2001), the random-effects model is chosen for this study.Then,\
    \ the individual effect size \nforeach sample (i.e. finding) is calculated, using\
    \ the calculating tools provided by \nWilson(2001).The most common format of calculating\
    \ effect size is \U0001D451 = (\U0001D44B\U0001D452 − \U0001D44B\U0001D450)/\U0001D446\
    , where \n\U0001D44B\U0001D452 is the average value of an experimental group,\
    \ \U0001D44B\U0001D450 is average value of the control or reference \ngroup, and\
    \ \U0001D446 is the common standard deviation of both groups(Peng & Zheng, 1999).The\
    \ value \nof the overall effect size is positively related to the influence, which\
    \ means that higher effect \nsize indicates greater influences (Yuan, Sun, You,\
    \ Liu, & Li, 2018). \nIn this study, standard deviation from the involved studies\
    \ is collected for further \nanalysis. For these publications that did not provide\
    \ the statistical information, emails for \nenquiry were sent to the authors.\
    \  \n \n \n42 \n5. Results and Discussion \n5.1 Research question evaluation \n\
    Research question 1: To what degree can ICT sensor networks boost crop yield by\
    \ monitoring \nand controlling the usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide?\
    \ \nAccording to the result for the test of between-subjects effects proposed\
    \ in Section 3.2, \nthe significance value for location (continent) term is 0.181\
    \ (p = 0.181), which is higher than \n0.05. Table 3 is the result of statistical\
    \ analysis from SPSS. Therefore, the correlation between \nincreased crop yield\
    \ and continent was not statistically significant. From a statistical point of\
    \ \nview, the influence of area on performance can be temporarily excluded in\
    \ this study. \nTable 3. Result of Test of between-subjects effects from SPSS\

    \ of irrigation water, fertilizer and pesticide are 80%, 86%, \nand 75% respectively,\
    \ compared with the conditions that these ICT solutions were not utilized \non\
    \ site. \nGiven the random forest model built above, a percentage to which the\
    \ ICT sensor \nnetworks can assist farms increase yield can be estimated. In this\
    \ case, with the \U0001D45D\U0001D45F\U0001D452\U0001D451\U0001D456\U0001D450\U0001D461\
    () \nfunction provided by RandomForestRegressor class in Scikit-learn, prediction\
    \ based on the \nmodel that was fitted, with parameters as the above three percentage\
    \ value set (80, 86, 75) can \nbe conducted. Output value of this prediction turned\
    \ out to be 116.26746667. This result \n \n43 \nindicates that, if the ICT sensor\
    \ network can be deployed and used in a crop farmland, with an \naverage percentage\
    \ of saving water, fertilizer and pesticide resources, the corresponding \nestimated\
    \ increase in crop yield is approximately 16%. \nAccording to the results of simulation,\
    \ the deployment of such ICT sensor networks on \nfarms can indeed reduce the\
    \ amount of agricultural resources (such as water and fertilizers) \nwhile increasing\
    \ crop yields. Such a decrease in input and an increase or change in output just\
    \ \nimprove the productivity of the farm, which is in line with the idea of sustainable\
    \ development \nin agriculture. In addition to increasing production, the more\
    \ important significance of this \napplication is to reduce the impact of human\
    \ agricultural production on the natural environment \nby controlling the amount\
    \ of chemical substances used. This protects animals and plants from \ntoxic chemicals\
    \ on the one hand, and protects human safety on the other. \nResearch question\
    \ 2: If ICT sensor networks could be deployed throughout a selected \ncountry/area,\
    \ how could the annual yield of crops change? \n \nFor this research question,\
    \ Canada is taken as an example for estimating the potential in \nincreasing crop\
    \ yield with ICT sensor networks. Except for 2015, in the past five years, \n\
    Canada's annual principal crop yield has remained at around 88.6 million metric\
    \ tonnes \n(Statistics Canada, 2020).At the same time, according to previous research\
    \ results, the \nconsumption of irrigation, fertilization and spraying of pesticides\
    \ on those farms using ICT can \nbe reduced to 80%, 86% and 75% respectively,\
    \ with boost of annual crop yield by 16%.  \nIf the result of this estimation\
    \ is extended to the entire scope of Canada, taking into \naccount the average\
    \ crop yield of Canada over the past five years, it can be concluded that if \n\
    this ICT sensor network that detects and controls water, fertilizer, and pesticides\
    \ can spread \nacross the farms in Canada, the annual crop yield in Canada (shown\
    \ in Figure 6)(Statistics \nCanada, 2019)may rise from 88 million tonnes to 98\
    \ million tonnes. Considering that Canada \nhas been exporting more than half\
    \ of the crops to the overseas demand side (Agriculture and \nAgri-Food Canada,\
    \ 2019), this potential growth in crop production will help alleviate the \ndemand\
    \ around the world. \n \n44 \n \nFigure 6. Estimated production of principal field\
    \ crops of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2019) \nAccordingly, with ICT sensor network,\
    \ the amount of resources saved for agricultural \nproduction cannot be overlooked.\
    \ In Canada, the annual total irrigation volume for crops was \n2.05 million cubic\
    \ metres in 2016, rising to 2.95 million cubic metres in 2018, a 43% increase\
    \ \n(Statistics Canada, 2019).Fertilizer consumption per hectare of arable land\
    \ in Canada was \nreported at 87.63 kg in 2016. With 41,224,000 hectares of arable\
    \ land in Canada, the annual \nfertilizer consumption is estimated as 36 million\
    \ tonnes in 2016, which has increased from 29 \nmillion tonnes in 2010, a 25%\
    \ increase (Index Mundi, 2020; World Bank, 2020). Only \nconsidering irrigation\
    \ and fertilizer use, ICT sensor networks are expected to help Canada save \n\
    irrigation water by 0.59 million tonnes, and fertilizer by 5.76 million tonnes,\
    \ with increases in \ncrop yield of 14 million tonnes. \nAs can be seen from the\
    \ results above, since the consumption of water, fertilizer and \npesticide can\
    \ be controlled by ICT sensor networks, deploying this solution across the country\
    \ \nin Canada is likely to have a huge positive influence on the crop yield and\
    \ the environment. \n5.2 Conclusion and Limitation \nAccording to Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations, the growth in \nyield of rice in developing\
    \ countries has been declining or stagnating for years since 2009. In \n0\n10,000,000\n\
    20,000,000\n30,000,000\n40,000,000\n50,000,000\n60,000,000\n70,000,000\n80,000,000\n\
    90,000,000\n100,000,000\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nEstimated production of\
    \ principal field crops of Canada \n(metric tonnes)\nBarley\nCanary seed\nCanola\n\
    Chick peas\nCorn for grain\nFlaxseed\nLentils\nMustard seed\nOats\nSoybeans\n\
    Sunflower seeds\nWheat\n \n45 \nsouth Asia, the annual yield of rice has dropped\
    \ by 10% due to the primary and secondary \ndamage to farmland due to effects\
    \ of climate change. There are many reasons for the low yield, \nsuch as diseases\
    \ and insect pests, soil erosion, and improper farming. In addition, limited \n\
    research investment and transfer of scientific and technological practices have\
    \ also put \nunderdeveloped regions into inefficient agricultural production,\
    \ and the lack of technology \nleaves their agricultural industry vulnerable (World\
    \ Bank, 2017). \nThis study aimed to address the gap in knowledge from the few\
    \ quantitative analyses of \nthe performance of ICT sensor networks that reported\
    \ simultaneous monitoring of water, \nfertilizer and pesticide (or some subset\
    \ of these). In this study, the necessity and feasibility of \nutilizing ICT sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture have been clarified. \nThe analysis shows that as a\
    \ whole, ICT sensor networks can indeed effectively \nimprove the use of agricultural\
    \ resources, such as water, fertilizers and pesticides, and can also \nincrease\
    \ crop output by 16%. If this technology can be widely used in developing countries\
    \ or \nregions that rely heavily on agriculture as a source of income and livelihood,\
    \ then farmers and \nthe agricultural sector there can satisfy more of them with\
    \ limited resources in a sustainable \nway.  \nMeanwhile, the cost of deploying,\
    \ setting up and maintaining a network is often a \nstumbling block to prevent\
    \ farmers from adopting ICT sensor networks. In fact, there are \nalready some\
    \ low-cost solutions, such as a basic version of the network designed by Polo\
    \ et al. \n(2015).  The total cost can be controlled within $1,000, operating\
    \ in a farm of around 100 ha. \nRegarding the limitation of this study, the first\
    \ is that the small amount of data has \nlimited the development of this study.\
    \ Although the research on the combination of ICT and \nagriculture is not a new\
    \ topic, most of the literature that can be found now does not include \nquantitative\
    \ statements regarding the performance of their equipment. Therefore, it is not\
    \ easy \nto find a lot of information about the performance of ICT sensor networks\
    \ in agriculture. \nAttempts have been made to reach out to the authors and researchers\
    \ for more detailed \ninformation regarding the research questions, but very few\
    \ replies were received. \nAnother limitation of this study is that the original\
    \ meta-analysis was not completed. \nJudging from the publications I've been exposed\
    \ to regarding the application of the ICT sensor \nnetwork in agriculture, no\
    \ researcher provided information about the experimental group and \n \n46 \n\
    the control group in their articles, and the standard deviation used to calculate\
    \ meta-analysis is \neven more rare. Similarly, I wrote some emails to these researchers,\
    \ but unfortunately there are \nfew responders and insufficient data to support\
    \ this analysis. In the end, the focus of this \nresearch was on the simulation\
    \ of farmland equipped with ICT sensor network equipment. \n \n47 \n5.3 Future\
    \ recommendations \nThis study can be a very small part of future studies looking\
    \ to provide optimal \nallocation of agricultural resources in crop production.\
    \ The perspective of this research is \nrelatively macro. It is based on the existing\
    \ research conclusions of previous people. In the \nfuture, more micro experiments\
    \ can be conducted. For example, ICT sensor networks can be set \nup in situ to\
    \ control irrigation and fertilizer application on farmland, and eventually figure\
    \ out \nthe best external conditions for planting. To be specific, a piece of\
    \ farmland can be divided into \na grid, and ICT sensor networks will be deployed\
    \ for monitoring and controlling the amount of \nagricultural input. By comparing\
    \ crop yields under different conditions, find out the most \nsuitable external\
    \ environmental parameters for certain farmland and crops. \nIn the long run,\
    \ after collecting and analyzing many years of data, ICT can be used to \nmatch\
    \ the right environment with cultivars, to increase understanding of the interactions\
    \ \nbetween genotypes and the environment, and to adapt planting strategies to\
    \ constantly changing \nclimate. \n \n \n48 \nAppendices \nAppendix A: Tables\

  - This study answered a question that how to use existing technologies to increase
    crop yields, while reducing agricultural inputs and the associated negative ecological
    impacts. The results of this study have important implications for improving the
    yield and productivity of farming, and for the sustainable development of agriculture.
  - The effects of the climatic zones in which the farms are located on performance
    of ICT sensor networks proved to be statistically insignificant.
  journal: ''
  limitations: 'The first is that the small amount of data has limited the development
    of this study. Although the research on the combination of ICT and agriculture
    is not a new topic, most of the literature that can be found now does not include
    quantitative statements regarding the performance of their equipment. Therefore,
    it is not easy to find a lot of information about the performance of ICT sensor
    networks in agriculture. Attempts have been made to reach out to the authors and
    researchers for more detailed information regarding the research questions, but
    very few replies were received.


    Another limitation of this study is that the original meta-analysis was not completed.
    Judging from the publications I''ve been exposed to regarding the application
    of the ICT sensor network in agriculture, no researcher provided information about
    the experimental group and the control group in their articles, and the standard
    deviation used to calculate meta-analysis is even more rare. Similarly, I wrote
    some emails to these researchers, but unfortunately there are few responders and
    insufficient data to support this analysis. In the end, the focus of this research
    was on the simulation of farmland equipped with ICT sensor network equipment.'

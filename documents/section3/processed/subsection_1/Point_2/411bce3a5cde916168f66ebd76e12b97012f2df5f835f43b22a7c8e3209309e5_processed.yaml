  analysis: 'Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)
    and their collection and use

    In this context, DRL has been recently used as an emerging tool to effectively
    address various problems and challenges. In particular, modern networks such as
    Internet of Things (IoT), Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets), and Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle (UAV) network become more decentralized, ad-hoc, and autonomous in nature.
    Network entities such as IoT devices, mobile users, and UAVs need to make local
    and autonomous decisions, e.g., spectrum access, data rate selection, transmit
    power control, and base station association, to achieve the goals of different
    networks including, e.g., throughput maximization and energy consumption minimization.
    Under uncertain and stochastic environments, most of the decision-making problems
    can be modeled by a so-called Markov Decision Process (MDP). Dynamic programming
    [1, 6] and other algorithms such as value iteration, as well as reinforcement
    learning techniques can be adopted to solve the MDP. However, the modern networks
    are large-scale and complicated, and thus the computational complexity of the
    techniques rapidly becomes unmanageable. As a result, DRL has been developing
    to be an alternative solution to overcome the challenge.In general, the DRL approaches
    provide the following advantages:DRL can obtain the solution of sophisticated
    network optimizations. Thus, it enables network controllers, e.g., base stations,
    in modern networks to solve non-convex and complex problems, e.g., joint user
    association, computation, and transmission schedule, to achieve the optimal solutions
    without complete and accurate network information.DRL allows network entities
    to learn and build knowledge about the communication and networking environment.
    Thus, by using DRL, the network entities, e.g., a mobile user, can learn optimal
    policies, e.g., base station selection, channel selection, handover decision,
    caching and offloading decisions, without knowing channel model and mobility pattern.DRL
    provides autonomous decision-making. With the DRL approaches, network entities
    can make observation and obtain the best policy locally with minimum or without
    information exchange among each other. This not only reduces communication overheads
    but also improves security and robustness of the networks.

    **Specific Example 1**

    The authors in [101] propose a DQN-based scheme to minimize the mobile user’s
    cost and energy consumption by offloading cellular traffic to WLAN as shown in
    Fig. 16(a). The mobile user’s problem can be modeled as an MDP. The DQL is adopted
    to solve the problem. The state of the mobile user includes its location and the
    remaining file size of all data flows. The mobile user takes action to choose
    to transmit data through either WLAN or cellular network, and to allocate channel
    capacities to concurrent flows. CNNs are employed in the DQL to predict a continuous
    value of the mobile user’s remaining data. Simulation results show that the DQN-based
    scheme outperforms the dynamic programming algorithm for the benchmark scenario
    over 90% of the time.'

    review on applications of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in communications
    and networking. Modern networks, e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial
    vehicle (UAV) networks, become more decentralized and autonomous. In such networks,
    network entities need to make decisions locally to maximize the network performance
    under uncertainty of network environment. Reinforcement learning has been efficiently
    used to enable the network entities to obtain the optimal policy including, e.g.,
    decisions or actions, given their states when the state and action spaces are
    small. However, in complex and large-scale networks, the state and action spaces
    are usually large, and the reinforcement learning may not be able to find the
    optimal policy in reasonable time. Therefore, DRL, a combination of reinforcement
    learning with deep learning, has been developed to overcome the shortcomings.
    In this survey, we first give a tutorial of DRL from fundamental concepts to advanced
    models. Then, we review DRL approaches proposed to address emerging issues in
    communications and networking. The issues include dynamic network access, data
    rate control, wireless caching, data offloading, network security, and connectivity
    preservation which are all important to next generation networks, such as 5G and
    beyond. Furthermore, we present applications of DRL for traffic routing, resource
    sharing, and data collection. Finally, we highlight important challenges, open
    issues, and future research directions of applying DRL. Published in: IEEE Communications

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Reinforcement learning
    [1] is one of the most important research directions of machine learning which
    has significant impacts to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) over
    the last 20 years. Reinforcement learning is a learning process in which an agent
    can periodically make decisions, observe the results, and then automatically adjust
    its strategy to achieve the optimal policy. However, this learning process, even
    though proved to converge, takes a lot of time to reach the best policy as it
    has to explore and gain knowledge of an entire system, making it unsuitable and
    inapplicable to large-scale networks. Consequently, applications of reinforcement
    learning are very limited in practice. Recently, deep learning [2] has been introduced
    as a new breakthrough technique. It can overcome the limitations of reinforcement
    learning, and thus open a new era for the development of reinforcement learning,
    namely Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). DRL embraces the advantage of Deep Neural
    Networks (DNNs) to train the learning process, thereby improving the learning
    speed and the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. As a result, DRL
    has been adopted in numerous applications of reinforcement learning in practice
    such as robotics, computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing
    [2]. One of the most famous applications of DRL is AlphaGo [3], the first computer
    program which can beat a human professional without handicaps on a full-sized
    19×19 board. In the areas of communications and networking, DRL has been recently
    used as an emerging tool to effectively address various problems and challenges.
    In particular, modern networks such as Internet of Things (IoT), Heterogeneous
    Networks (HetNets), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) network become more decentralized,
    ad-hoc, and autonomous in nature. Network entities such as IoT devices, mobile
    users, and UAVs need to make local and autonomous decisions, e.g., spectrum access,
    data rate selection, transmit power control, and base station association, to
    achieve the goals of different networks including, e.g., throughput maximization
    and energy consumption minimization. Under uncertain and stochastic environments,
    most of the decision-making problems can be modeled by a so-called Markov Decision
    Process (MDP) [4]. Dynamic programming [5], [6] and other algorithms such as value
    iteration, as well as reinforcement learning techniques can be adopted to solve
    the MDP. However, the modern networks are large-scale and complicated, and thus
    the computational complexity of the techniques rapidly becomes unmanageable. As
    a result, DRL has been developing to be an alternative solution to overcome the
    challenge. In general, the DRL approaches provide the following advantages: DRL
    can obtain the solution of sophisticated network optimizations. Thus, it enables
    network controllers, e.g., base stations, in modern networks to solve non-convex
    and complex problems, e.g., joint user association, computation, and transmission
    schedule, to achieve the optimal solutions without complete and accurate network
    information. DRL allows network entities to learn and build knowledge about the
    communication and networking environment. Thus, by using DRL, the network entities,
    e.g., a mobile user, can learn optimal policies, e.g., base station selection,
    channel selection, handover decision, caching and offloading decisions, without
    knowing channel model and mobility pattern. DRL provides autonomous decision-making.
    With the DRL approaches, network entities can make observation and obtain the
    best policy locally with minimum or without information exchange among each other.
    This not only reduces communication overheads but also improves security and robustness
    of the networks. DRL improves significantly the learning speed, especially in
    the problems with large state and action spaces. Thus, in large-scale networks,
    e.g., IoT systems with thousands of devices, DRL allows network controller or
    IoT gateways to control dynamically user association, spectrum access, and transmit
    power for a massive number of IoT devices and mobile users. Several other problems
    in communications and networking such as cyber-physical attacks, interference
    management, and data offloading can be modeled as games, e.g., the non-cooperative
    game. DRL has been recently used as an efficient tool to solve the games, e.g.,
    finding the Nash equilibrium, without the complete information. Although there
    are some surveys related to machine learning, they do not discuss the applications
    of DRL in communications and networking. Specifically, there are surveys that
    discuss the applications of DRL such as [7] and [8], but they are specifically
    for computer vision and natural language processing. Also, there are surveys discussing
    the applications of machine learning for networking such as [9], [10], [11], [12],
    and [13]. However, they mostly focus on deep learning approaches. In particular,
    the survey in [9] discusses deep learning approaches for network cybersecurity,
    the survey in [10] reviews deep learning approaches for network traffic control,
    the survey in [11] presents deep learning approaches for physical layer modulation,
    network access/resource allocation, and network routing, and the survey in [12]
    presents deep learning approaches for emerging issues including edge caching and
    computing, multiple radio access and interference management. In summary, the
    existing surveys either consider applications of DRL for computer vision and natural
    language processing or discuss applications of deep learning for networking. There
    is no survey specifically discussing the applications of DRL for communications
    and networking. This motivates us to deliver the survey with the tutorial of DRL
    and the comprehensive literature review on the applications of DRL to address
    issues in communications and networking. For convenience, the related works in
    this survey are classified based on issues in communications and networking as
    shown in Fig. 2. The major issues include network access, data rate control, wireless
    caching, data offloading, network security, connectivity preservation, traffic
    routing, and data collection. Also, the percentages of DRL related works for different
    networks and different issues in the networks are shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b),
    respectively. From the figures, we observe that the majority of the related works
    are for the cellular networks. Also, the related works to the wireless caching
    and offloading have received more attention than the other issues. Fig. 1. Percentages

    commonly appeared in this paper is given in Table I. Note that DRL consists of
    two different algorithms which are Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and policy gradients
    [14]. In particular, DQL is mostly used for the DRL related works. Therefore,
    in the rest of the paper, we use “DRL” and “DQL” interchangeably to refer to the
    DRL algorithms. TABLE I List of Abbreviations SECTION II. Deep Reinforcement Learning:
    An Overview In this section, we first present fundamental knowledge of Markov
    decision processes, reinforcement learning, and deep learning techniques which
    are important branches of machine learning theory. We then discuss DRL technique
    that can capitalize on the capability of the deep learning to improve efficiency
    and performance in terms of the learning rate for reinforcement learning algorithms.
    Afterward, advanced DRL models and their extensions are reviewed. A. Markov Decision
    Processes MDP [4] is a discrete time stochastic control process. MDP provides
    a mathematical framework for modeling decision-making problems in which outcomes
    are partly random and under control of a decision maker or an agent. MDPs are
    useful for studying optimization problems which can be solved by dynamic programming
    and reinforcement learning techniques. Typically, an MDP is defined by a tuple
    ( S , A , p , r ) where S is a finite set of states, A is a finite set of actions,
    p is a transition probability from state s to state s ′ after action a is executed,
    and r is the immediate reward obtained after action a is performed. We denote
    π as a “policy” which is a mapping from a state to an action. The goal of an MDP
    is to find an optimal policy to maximize the reward function. An MDP can be finite
    or infinite time horizon. For the finite time horizon MDP, an optimal policy π
    ∗ to maximize the expected total reward is defined by max π E[ ∑ T t=0 r t ( s
    t ,π( s t ))] , where a t =π( s t ) . For the infinite time horizon MDP, the objective
    can be to maximize the expected discounted total reward or to maximize the average
    reward. The former is defined by max π E[ ∑ T t=0 γ r t ( s t ,π( s t ))] , while
    the latter is expressed by lim inf T→∞ max π E[ ∑ T t=0 r t ( s t ,π( s t ))]
    , where γ∈[0,1] is the discount factor. The discount factor γ determines the importance
    of future rewards compared with the current reward. If γ=0 , the agent is “myopic”,
    i.e., it only considers to maximize its current reward, i.e., immediate reward.
    In contrast, if γ approaches one, the agent will strive for a long-term higher
    reward. 1) Partially Observable Markov Decision Process: In MDPs, we assume that
    the system state is fully observable by the agent. However, in many cases, the
    agent only can observe a part of the system state, and thus Partially Observable
    Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) [15] can be used to model the decision-making
    problems. A typical POMDP model is defined by a 6-tuple (S,A,p,r,Ω,O) , where
    S , A , p , r are defined the same as in the MDP model, Ω and O are defined as
    the set of observations and observation probabilities, respectively. At each time
    epoch, the agent is at state s , selects an action a based on its belief about
    the current state s , i.e., b ( s ), and observes the immediate reward r and current
    observation o . Based on the observation o and its belief about the current state
    b ( s ), the agent then updates its belief about the new state s ′ , i.e., b(
    s ′ ) , as follows [15]: b( s ′ )= O(o|s,a, s ′ ) ∑ s∈S p( s ′ |s,a)b(s) ∑ s ′
    ∈S O(o|s,a, s ′ ) ∑ s∈S p( s ′ |s,a)b(s) , (1) View Source where O(o|s,a, s ′
    ) is the probability that the agent obtains observation o after action a is taken
    at state s and the agent moves to state s ′ . p( s ′ |s,a) is defined the same
    as that of the MDP model, i.e., the transition probability from state s to state
    s ′ after action a is performed at state s . Finally, the agent receives an immediate
    reward r that is equal to r ( s , a ) in the MDP. Similar to the MDP model, the
    agent in POMDP also aims to find the optimal policy π ∗ in order to maximize its
    expected long-term discounted reward ∑ ∞ t=0 γ r t ( s t , π ∗ ( s t )) . Fig.
    3 illustrates and compares an MDP and a POMDP. Fig. 3. An illustration of MDP
    and POMDP. Show All 2) Markov Games: In game theory, a Markov game, or a stochastic
    game [16], is a dynamic game with probabilistic transitions played by multiple
    players, i.e., agents. A typical Markov game model is defined by a tuple (I,S,{
    A i } i∈I ,p,{ r i } i∈I ) , where I≜{1,…,i,…,I} is a set of agents, S≜{ S 1 ,…,
    S i ,…, S I } is the global state space of all agents with S i being the state
    space of agent i , { A i } i∈I are sets of action spaces of the agents with A
    i being the action space of agent i , p≜S× A 1 ×⋯× A I →[0,1] is the transition
    probability function of the system. { r i } i∈I are payoff functions of the agents
    with r i ≜S× A 1 ×⋯× A I →R , i.e., the payoff of agent i obtained after all actions
    of the agents are executed. In a Markov game, the agents start at some initial
    state s 0 ∈S . After observing the current state, all the agents simultaneously
    select their actions a={ a 1 ,…, a I } and they will receive their corresponding
    rewards together with their own new observations. At the same time, the system
    will transit to a new state s ′ ∈S with probability p( s ′ |s,a) . The procedure
    is repeated at the new state and continues for a finite or infinite number of
    stages. In this game, all the agents try to find their optimal policies to maximize
    their own expected long-term average rewards, i.e., ∑ ∞ t=0 γ i r i t ( s t ,
    π ∗ i ( s t )) , ∀i . The set of all optimal policies of this game, i.e., { π
    ∗ 1 ,…, π ∗ I } is known to be the equilibrium of this game. If there is a finite
    number of players and the sets of states and actions are finite, then the Markov
    game always has a Nash equilibrium [17] under a finite number of stages. The same
    is true for Markov games with infinite stages, but the total payoff of agents
    is the discounted sum [17]. B. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning,
    an important branch of machine learning, is an effective tool and widely used
    in the literature to address MDPs [1]. In a reinforcement learning process, an
    agent can learn its optimal policy through interaction with its environment. In
    particular, the agent first observes its current state, and then takes an action,
    and receives its immediate reward together with its new state as illustrated in
    Fig. 4(a). The observed information, i.e., the immediate reward and new state,
    is used to adjust the agent’s policy, and this process will be repeated until
    the agent’s policy approaches to the optimal policy. In reinforcement learning,
    Q -learning is the most effective method and widely used in the literature. In
    the following, we will discuss the Q -learning algorithm and its extensions for
    advanced MDP models. Fig. 4. (a) Reinforcement learning, (b) Artificial neural
    network, and (c) Deep Q-learning. Show All 1) Q -Learning Algorithm: In an MDP,
    we aim to find an optimal policy π ∗  : S→A for the agent to maximize the expected
    long-term reward function for the system. Accordingly, we first define value function
    V π  : S→R that represents the expected value obtained by following policy π from
    each state s∈S . The value function V for policy π quantifies the goodness of
    the policy through an infinite horizon and discounted MDP that can be expressed
    as follows: V π (s)= = E π [ ∑ t=0 ∞ γ r t ( s t , a t )| s 0 =s] E π [ r t (
    s t , a t )+γ V π ( s t+1 )| s 0 =s]. (2) View Source Since we aim to find the
    optimal policy π ∗ , an optimal action at each state can be found through the
    optimal value function expressed by V ∗ (s)= max a t { E π [ r t ( s t , a t )+γ
    V π ( s t+1 )]} . If we denote Q ∗ (s,a)≜ r t ( s t , a t )+γ E π [ V π ( s t+1
    )] as the optimal Q -function for all state-action pairs, then the optimal value
    function can be written by V ∗ (s)= max a { Q ∗ (s,a)} . Now, the problem is reduced
    to find optimal values of Q -function, i.e., Q ∗ (s,a) , for all state-action
    pairs, and this can be done through iterative processes. In particular, the Q
    -function is updated according to the following rule: Q t+1 (s,a)= Q t (s,a) +
    α t [ r t (s,a)+γ max a ′ Q t (s, a ′ )− Q t (s,a)]. (3) View Source The core
    idea behind this update is to find the Temporal Difference (TD) between the predicted
    Q -value, i.e., r t (s,a)+γ max a ′ Q t (s, a ′ ) and its current value, i.e.,
    Q t (s,a) . In (3), the learning rate α t is used to determine the impact of new
    information to the existing Q -value. The learning rate can be chosen to be a
    constant, or it can be adjusted dynamically during the learning process. However,
    it must satisfy Assumption 1 to guarantee the convergence for the Q -learning
    algorithm. Assumption 1:The step size α t is deterministic, nonnegative and satisfies
    the following conditions: α t ∈[0,1] , ∑ ∞ t=0 α t =∞ , and ∑ ∞ t=0 ( α t ) 2
    <∞ . The step size adaptation α t = 1 t is one of the most common examples used
    in reinforcement learning. More discussions for selecting an appropriate step
    size can be found in [18]. The details of the Q -learning algorithm are then provided
    in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 The Q -Learning Algorithm Input: For each state-action
    pair ( s , a ), initialize the table entry Q(s,a) arbitrarily, e.g., to zero.
    Observe the current state s , initialize a value for the learning rate α and the
    discount factor γ . for t:=1 to T do From the current state-action pair ( s ,
    a ), execute action a and obtain the immediate reward r and a new state s ′ .
    Select an action a ′ based on the state s ′ and then update the table entry for
    Q(s,a) as follows: Q t+1 (s,a) ← Q t (s,a)+ α t [ r t (s,a)+ γ max a ′ Q t ( s
    ′ , a ′ )− Q t (s,a)] (4) View Source Replace s← s ′ . end for Output: π ∗ (s)=arg
    max a Q ∗ (s,a) . Once either all Q -values converge or a certain number of iterations
    is reached, the algorithm will terminate. The algorithm then yields the optimal
    policy indicating an action to be taken at each state such that Q ∗ (s,a) is maximized
    for all states in the state space, i.e., π ∗ (s)=arg max a Q ∗ (s,a) . Under the
    assumption of the step size (i.e., Assumption 1), it is proved in [19] that the
    Q -learning algorithm converges to the optimum action-values with probability
    one. It is worth noting that unlike value function V π , Q-function is an example
    of model-free learning algorithm that does not require the agent to know the system
    model parameters, e.g., the state-transition and reward models, in advance to
    estimate the pairs of state-action values. Specifically, the core idea of Q-function
    is to approximate the values of state-action pairs through samples obtained during
    the interactions with the environment. Furthermore, while the value function takes
    the expectation of all actions according to the policy π , the Q-function only
    focuses on a particular action at a particular state. As a result, learning algorithms
    using Q-function are less complex than those of using the value function. However,
    from the sampling perspective, the dimension of Q-function is higher than that
    of value function, and thus Q-function might be more difficult to get enough samples,
    i.e., state-action pairs, to learn. Therefore, if the system model is available
    in advance, the value function is usually preferable. 2) SARSA (An Online Q -Learning
    Algorithm): Although the Q -learning algorithm can find the optimal policy for
    the agent without requiring knowledge about the environment, this algorithm works
    in an offline fashion. In particular, Algorithm 1 can obtain the optimal policy
    only after all Q -values converge. Therefore, this section presents an alternative
    online learning algorithm, i.e., the SARSA algorithm, which allows the agent to
    approach the optimal policy in an online fashion. Different from the Q -learning
    algorithm, the SARSA algorithm is an online algorithm which allows the agent to
    choose optimal actions at each time step in a real-time fashion without waiting
    until the algorithm converges. In the Q -learning algorithm, the policy is updated
    according to the maximum reward of available actions regardless of which policy
    is applied, i.e., an off-policy method. In contrast, the SARSA algorithm interacts
    with the environment and updates the policy directly from the actions taken, i.e.,
    an on-policy method. Note that the SARSA algorithm updates Q -values from the
    quintuple Q(s,a,r, s ′ , a ′ ) . 3) Q -Learning for Markov Games: To apply Q-learning
    algorithm to the Markov game context, we first define the Q -function for agent
    i by Q i (s, a i , a −i ) , where a −i ≜{ a 1 ,…, a i−1 , a i+1 ,…, a I } denotes
    the set of actions of all agents except i . Then, the Nash Q -function of agent
    i is defined by: Q ∗ i (s, a i , a −i )= r i (s, a i , a −i )+β ∑ s ′ ∈S p( s
    ′ |s, a i , a −i ) × V i ( s ′ , π ∗ 1 ,…, π ∗ I ), (5) View Source where ( π
    ∗ 1 ,…, π ∗ I ) is the joint Nash equilibrium strategy, r i (s, a i , a −i ) is
    agent i ’s immediate reward in state s under the joint action ( a i , a −i ) ,
    and V i ( s ′ , π ∗ 1 ,…, π ∗ I ) is the total discounted reward over an infinite
    time horizon starting from state s ′ given that all the agents follow the equilibrium
    strategies. In [17], the authors propose a multi-agent Q-learning algorithm for
    general-sum Markov games which allows the agents to perform updates based on assuming
    Nash equilibrium behavior over the current Q-values. In particular, agent i will
    learn its Q -values by forming an arbitrary guess from starting time of the game.
    At each time step t , agent i observes the current state and takes an action a
    i . Then, it observes its immediate reward r i , actions taken by others a −i
    , others’ immediate rewards, and the new system state s ′ . After that, agent
    i calculates a Nash equilibrium ( π 1 ( s ′ ),…, π I ( s ′ )) for the state game
    ( Q t 1 ( s ′ ),…, Q t I ( s ′ )) , and updates its Q -values according to: Q
    t+1 i (s, a i , a −i )= (1− α t ) Q t i (s, a i , a −i ) + α t [ r i t +γ N i
    t ( s ′ )], (6) View Source where α t ∈(0,1) is the learning rate and N i t (
    s ′ )≜ Q t i ( s ′ )× π 1 ( s ′ )×⋯× π I ( s ′ ) . In order to calculate the Nash
    equilibrium, agent i needs to know ( Q t 1 ( s ′ ),…, Q t I ( s ′ )) . However,
    the information about other agents’ Q -values is not given, and thus agent i must
    learn this information too. To do so, agent i will set estimations about others’
    Q -values at the beginning of the game, e.g., Q j 0 (s, a i , a −i )=0,∀j,s .
    As the game proceeds, agent i observes other agents’ immediate rewards and previous
    actions. That information can then be used to update agent i ’s conjectures on
    other agents’ Q -functions. Agent i updates its beliefs about agent j ’s Q -function,
    according to the same updating rule in (6). Then, the authors prove that under
    some highly restrictive assumptions on the form of the state games during learning,
    the proposed multi-agent Q -learning algorithm is guaranteed to be converged.
    C. Deep Learning Deep learning [2] is composed of a set of algorithms and techniques
    that attempt to find important features of data and to model its high-level abstractions.
    The main goal of deep learning is to avoid manual description of a data structure
    (like hand-written features) by automatic learning from the data. Its name refers
    to the fact that typically any neural network with two or more hidden layers is
    called DNN. Most deep learning models are based on an Artificial Neural Network
    (ANN), even though they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables
    organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in Deep Belief
    Networks and Deep Boltzmann Machines. An ANN is a computational nonlinear model
    based on the neural structure of the brain that is able to learn to perform tasks
    such as classification, prediction, decision-making, and visualization. An ANN
    consists of artificial neurons and is organized into three interconnected layers:
    input, hidden, and output as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). The input layer contains
    input neurons that send information to the hidden layer. The hidden layer sends
    data to the output layer. Every neuron has weighted inputs (synapses), an activation
    function, and one output. Synapses are the adjustable parameters that convert
    a neural network to a parameterized system. The activation function of a node
    defines the outputs of that node given the inputs. In particular, the activation
    function will map the input values into target ranges depending on the selected
    activation function. For example, the logistic activation function will map all
    inputs in the real number domain into the range of 0 to 1. During the training
    phase, ANNs use backpropagation as an effective learning algorithm to compute
    quickly a gradient descent with respect to the weights. Backpropagation is a special
    case of automatic differentiation. In the context of learning, backpropagation
    is commonly used by the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the
    weights of neurons by calculating the gradient of the loss function. This technique
    is also sometimes called backward propagation of errors, because the error is
    calculated at the output and distributed back through the network layers. A DNN
    is defined as an ANN with multiple hidden layers. There are two typical DNN models,
    i.e., Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In
    the FNN, the information moves in only one direction, i.e., from the input nodes,
    through the hidden nodes and to the output nodes, and there are no cycles or loops
    in the network as shown in Fig. 5. In FNNs, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    is the most well known model with a wide range of applications especially in image
    and speech recognition. The CNN contains one or more convolutional layers, pooling
    or fully connected, and uses a variation of multilayer perceptrons discussed above.
    In general, CNNs have two main components, i.e., feature extraction and classification,
    as illustrated in Fig. 6. The feature extraction component is placed at the hidden
    layers with the aim of performing a series of convolutions and pooling operations
    during which the features are being detected. After that, the classification component,
    placed at the fully connected layers, will assign a probability for the object,
    e.g., on the image, to what we need to predict. Fig. 5. FNN and RNN. Show All
    Fig. 6. An illustration of CNN. Show All Unlike FNNs, the RNN is a variant of
    a recursive artificial neural network in which connections between neurons make
    directed cycles. It means that an output depends not only on its immediate inputs,
    but also on the previous further step’s neuron state. The RNNs are designed to
    utilize sequential data, when the current step has some relation with the previous
    steps. This makes the RNNs ideal for applications with a time component, e.g.,
    time-series data, and natural language processing. However, all RNNs have feedback
    loops in the recurrent layer. This lets RNNs maintain information in memory over
    time. Nevertheless, it can be difficult to train standard RNNs to solve problems
    that require learning long-term temporal dependencies. The reason is that the
    gradient of the loss function decays exponentially with time, which is called
    the vanishing gradient problem. Thus, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is often used
    in RNNs to address this issue. LSTMs are designed to model temporal sequences
    and their long-range dependencies are more accurate than conventional RNNs. In
    particular, LSTMs provide a solution by incorporating memory units that allow
    the network to learn when to forget previous hidden states and when to update
    hidden states given new information. Usually, LSTM units are implemented in “blocks”
    which have three or four “gates”, e.g., input gate, forget gate, output gate and
    input modulation gate, as illustrated in Fig. 7 [20] to control information flow
    drawing on the logistic function. Unlike the RNN, the LSTM memory cell is composed
    of three components, i.e., the previous memory cell c t , current input x t and
    previous hidden state h t−1 . Here, the input gate and forget gate will be used
    to selectively forget its previous memory or consider its current input. Likewise,
    the output gate learns how much of the memory cell to transfer to the hidden state.
    These additional blocks enable the LSTM to learn extremely complex and long-term
    temporal dynamics that the RNN is unable to do. Fig. 7. An illustration of a basic
    (a) LSTM and (b) RNN cell. Show All D. Deep Q -Learning The Q -learning algorithm
    can efficiently obtain an optimal policy when the state space and action space
    are small. However, in practice, with complicated system models, these spaces
    are usually large. As a result, the Q -learning algorithm may not be able to find
    the optimal policy. Thus, Deep Q -Learning (DQL) algorithm is introduced to overcome
    this shortcoming. Intuitively, the DQL algorithm implements a Deep Q -Network
    (DQN), i.e., a DNN, instead of the Q -table to derive an approximate value of
    Q ∗ (s,a) as shown in Fig. 4(c). As stated in [21], the average reward obtained
    by reinforcement learning algorithms may not be stable or even diverge when a
    nonlinear function approximator is used. This stems from the fact that a small
    change of Q -values may greatly affect the policy. Thus, the data distribution
    and the correlations between the Q -values and the target values R+γ max a ′ Q(
    s ′ , a ′ ) are varied. To address this issue, two mechanisms, i.e., experience
    replay and target Q -network, can be used. Experience replay mechanism: The algorithm
    first initializes a replay memory D, i.e., the memory pool, with transitions (
    s t , a t , r t , s t+1 ) , i.e., experiences, generated randomly, e.g., through
    using ϵ -greedy policy. Then, the algorithm randomly selects samples, i.e., minibatches,
    of transitions from D to train the DNN. The Q-values obtained by the trained DNN
    will be used to obtain new experiences, i.e., transitions, and these experiences
    will then be stored in the memory pool D. This mechanism allows the DNN trained
    more efficiently by using both old and new experiences. In addition, by using
    the experience replay, the transitions are more independent and identically distributed,
    and thus the correlations between observations can be removed. Fixed target Q
    -network: In the training process, the Q -value will be shifted. Thus, the value
    estimations can be out of control if a constantly shifting set of values is used
    to update the Q -network. This leads to the destabilization of the algorithm.
    To address this issue, the target Q -network is used to update frequently but
    slowly the primary Q -networks’ values. In this way, the correlations between
    the target and estimated Q -values are significantly reduced, thereby stabilizing
    the algorithm. The DQL algorithm with experience replay and fixed target Q -network
    is presented in Algorithm 2. DQL inherits and promotes advantages of both reinforcement
    and deep learning techniques, and thus it has a wide range of applications in
    practice such as game development [3], transportation [22], and robotics [23].
    Table II summarizes how different the DQL approach and other techniques, i.e.,
    reinforcement learning, deep learning, and traditional combinatorial optimization
    methods, solve optimization problems. TABLE II Comparisons Among Optimization

    for E. Advanced Deep Q -Learning Models 1) Double Deep Q -Learning: In some stochastic
    environments, the Q -learning algorithm performs poorly due to the large over-estimations
    of action values [24]. These over-estimations result from a positive bias that
    is introduced because Q -learning uses the maximum action value as an approximation
    for the maximum expected action value as shown in Eq. (4). The reason is that
    the same samples are used to decide which action is the best, i.e., with highest
    expected reward, and the same samples are also used to estimate that action-value.
    Thus, to overcome the over-estimation problem of the Q -learning algorithm, the
    authors in [25] introduce a solution using two Q -value functions, i.e., Q 1 and
    Q 2 , to simultaneously select and evaluate action values. In particular, the
    selection of an action is still due to the online weights θ 1 . This means that,
    as in Q -learning, we are still estimating the value of the greedy policy according
    to the current values, as defined by θ 1 . However, the second set of weights
    θ 2 is used to evaluate fairly the value of this policy. This second set of weights
    can be updated symmetrically by switching the roles of θ 1 and θ 2 . Inspired
    by this idea, the authors in [25] then develop Double Deep Q -Learning (DDQL)
    model [26] using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) with the loss function updated
    as follows: [ r j +γ Q ^ ( s j+1 ,arg max a j+1 Q( s j+1 , a j+1 ;θ); θ ′ )−Q(
    s j , a j ;θ)] 2 . (8) View Source Unlike double Q -learning, the weights of the
    second network θ 2 are replaced with the weights of the target networks θ ′ for
    the evaluation of the current greedy policy as shown in Eq. (8). The update to
    the target network stays unchanged from DQN, and remains a periodic copy of the
    online network. Due to the effectiveness of DDQL, there are some applications
    of DDQL introduced recently to address dynamic spectrum access problems in multichannel
    wireless networks [27] and resource allocation in heterogeneous networks [28].
    2) Deep Q -Learning With Prioritized Experience Replay: Experience replay mechanism
    allows the reinforcement learning agent to remember and reuse experiences, i.e.,
    transitions, from the past. In particular, transitions are uniformly sampled from
    the replay memory D. However, this approach simply replays transitions at the
    same frequency as that the agent was originally experienced, regardless of their
    significance. Therefore, the authors in [29] develop a framework for prioritizing
    experiences, so as to replay important transitions more frequently, and therefore
    learn more efficiently. Ideally, we want to sample more frequently those transitions
    from which there is much to learn. In general, the DQL with the Prioritized Experience
    Replay (PER) samples transitions with a probability related to the last encountered
    absolute error [29]. New transitions are inserted into the replay buffer with
    maximum priority, providing a bias towards recent transitions. Note that stochastic
    transitions may also be favoured, even when there is little left to learn about
    them. Through real experiments on many Atari games, the authors demonstrate that
    DQL with PER outperforms DQL with uniform replay on 41 out of 49 games. However,
    this solution is only appropriate to implement when we can find and define the
    important experiences in the replay memory D. 3) Dueling Deep Q -Learning: The
    Q -values, i.e., Q(s,a) , used in the Q -learning algorithm, i.e., Algorithm 1,
    are to express how good it is to take a certain action at a given state. The value
    of an action a at a given state s can actually be decomposed into two fundamental
    values. The first value is the state-value function, i.e., V(s) , to estimate
    the importance of being in a particular state s . The second value is the action-value
    function, i.e., A(a) , to estimate the importance of selecting an action a compared
    with other actions. As a result, the Q -value function can be expressed by two
    fundamental value functions as follows: Q(s,a)=V(s)+A(a) . Stemming from the fact
    that in many MDPs, it is unnecessary to estimate both values, i.e., action and
    state values of Q-function Q(s,a) , at the same time. For example, in many racing
    games, moving left or right matters if and only if the agent meets the obstacles
    or enemies. Inspired by this idea, the authors in [30] introduce an idea of using
    two streams, i.e., two sequences, of fully connected layers instead of using a
    single sequence with fully connected layers for the DQN. The two streams are constructed
    such that they are able to provide separate estimations on the action and state
    value functions, i.e., V(s) and A(a) . Finally, the two streams are combined to
    generate a single output Q(s,a) as follows: Q(s,a;α,β)=V(s;β)+(A(s,a;α)− ∑ a ′
    A(s, a ′ ;α) |A| ), (9) View Source where β and α are the parameters of the two
    streams V(s;β) and A(s, a ′ ;α) , respectively. Here, |A| is the total number
    of actions in the action space A . Then, the loss function is derived in the similar
    way to (7). Through the simulation, the authors show that the proposed dueling
    DQN can outperform DDQN [26] in 50 out of 57 learned Atari games. However, the
    proposed dueling architecture only clearly benefits for MDPs with large action
    spaces. For small state spaces, the performance of dueling DQL is even not as
    good as that of double DQL as shown in simulation results in [30]. 4) Asynchronous
    Multi-Step Deep Q -Learning: Most of the Q -learning methods such as DQL and dueling
    DQL rely on the experience replay method. However, such kind of method has several
    drawbacks. For example, it uses more memory and computation resources per real
    interaction, and it requires off-policy learning algorithms that can update from
    data generated by an older policy. This limits the applications of DQL. Therefore,
    the authors in [31] introduce a method using multiple agents to train the DNN
    in parallel. In particular, the authors propose a training procedure which utilizes
    asynchronous gradient decent updates from multiple agents at once. Instead of
    training one single agent that interacts with its environment, multiple agents
    are interacting with their own version of the environment simultaneously. After
    a certain amount of timesteps, accumulated gradient updates from an agent are
    applied to a global model, i.e., the DNN. These updates are asynchronous and lock
    free. In addition, to tradeoff between bias and variance in the policy gradient,
    the authors adopt n -step updates method [1] to update the reward function. In
    particular, the truncated n -step reward function can be defined by r (n) t =
    ∑ n−1 k=0 γ (k) r t+k+1 . Thus, the alternative loss for each agent will be derived
    by: [ r (n) j + γ (n) j max a ′ Q ^ ( s j+n , a ′ ; θ ′ )−Q( s j , a j ;θ)] 2
    . (10) View Source The effects of training speed and quality of the proposed asynchronous
    DQL with multi-step learning are analyzed for various reinforcement learning methods,
    e.g., 1-step Q -learning, 1-step SARSA, and n-step Q -learning. They show that
    asynchronous updates have a stabilizing effect on policy and value updates. Also,
    the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms on the
    Atari games while training for half of the time on a single multi-core CPU instead
    of a GPU. As a result, some recent applications of asynchronous DQL have been
    developed for handover control problems in wireless systems [32] 5) Distributional
    Deep Q -Learning: All aforementioned methods use the Bellman equation to approximate
    the expected value of future rewards. However, if the environment is stochastic
    in nature and the future rewards follow multimodal distribution, choosing actions
    based on expected value may not lead to the optimal outcome. For example, we know
    that the expected transmission time of a packet in a wireless network is 20 minutes.
    However, this information may not be so meaningful because it may overestimate
    the transmission time most of the time. For example, the expected transmission
    time is calculated based on the normal transmissions (without collisions) and
    the interference transmissions (with collisions). Although the interference transmissions
    are very rare to happen, but it takes a lot of time. Then, the estimation about
    the expected transmission is overestimated most of the time. This makes estimations
    not useful for the DQL algorithms. Thus, the authors in [33] introduce a solution
    using distributional reinforcement learning to update Q -value function based
    on its distribution rather than its expectation. In particular, let Z(s,a) be
    the return obtained by starting from state s , executing action a , and following
    the current policy, then Q(s,a)=E[Z(s,a)] . Here, Z represents the distribution
    of future rewards, which is no longer a scalar quantity like Q -values. Then we
    obtain the distributional version of Bellman equation as follows: Z(s,a)=r+γZ(
    s ′ , a ′ ) . Although the proposed distributional deep Q-learning is demonstrated
    to outperform the conventional DQL [21] on many Atari 2600 Games (45 out of 57
    games), its performance relies much on the distribution function Z . If Z is well
    defined, the performance of distributional deep Q -learning is much more significant
    than that of the DQL. Otherwise, its performance is even worse than that of the
    DQL. 6) Deep Q -Learning With Noisy Nets: In [34], the authors introduce Noisy
    Net, a type of neural network whose bias and weights are iteratively perturbed
    during training by a parametric function of the noise. This network basically
    adds the Gaussian noise to the last (fully-connected) layers of the network. The
    parameters of this noise can be adjusted by the model during training, which allows
    the agent to decide when and in what proportion it wants to introduce the uncertainty
    to its weights. In particular, to implement the noisy network, we first replace
    the ϵ -greedy policy by a randomized action-value function. Then, the fully connected
    layers of the value network are parameterized as a noisy network, where the parameters
    are drawn from the noisy network parameter distribution after every replay step.
    For replay, the current noisy network parameter sample is held fixed across the
    batch. Since the DQL takes one step of optimization for every action step, the
    noisy network parameters are re-sampled before every action. Through experimental
    results, the authors demonstrate that by adding the Gaussian noise layer to the
    DNN, the performance of conventional DQL [21], dueling DQL [30], and asynchronous
    DQL [31] can be significantly improved for a wide range of Atari games. However,
    the impact of noise to the performance of the deep DQL algorithms is still under
    debating in the literature, and thus analysis on the impact of noise layer requires
    further investigations. 7) Rainbow Deep Q -Learning: In [35], the authors propose
    a solution which integrates all advantages of seven aforementioned solutions (including
    DQL) into a single learning agent, called Rainbow DQL. In particular, this algorithm
    first defines the loss function based on the asynchronous multi-step and distributional
    DQL. Then, the authors combine the multi-step distributional loss with double
    Q -learning by using the greedy action in s t+n selected according to the Q -network
    as the bootstrap action a ∗ t+n , and evaluate the action by using the target
    network. In standard proportional prioritized replay [29] technique, the absolute
    TD-error is used to prioritize the transitions. Here, TD-error at a time slot
    is the error in the estimate made at the time slot. However, in the proposed Rainbow
    DQL algorithm, all distributional Rainbow variants prioritize transitions by the
    Kullbeck-Leibler (KL) loss because this loss may be more robust to noisy stochastic
    environment. Alternatively, the dueling architecture of DNNs is presented in [30].
    Finally, the Noisy Net layer [35] is used to replace all linear layers in order
    to reduce the number of independent noise variables. Through simulation, the authors
    show that this is the most advanced technique which outperforms almost all current
    DQL algorithms in the literature over 57 Atari 2600 games. In Table III, we summarize
    the DQL algorithms and their performance under the parameter settings used in
    [35]. As observed in Table III, all of the DQL algorithms have been developed
    by Google DeepMind based on the original work in [21]. So far, through experimental
    results on Atari 2600 games, the Rainbow DQL presents very impressive results
    over all other DQL algorithms. However, more experiments need to be further conducted
    in different domains to confirm the real efficiency of the Rainbow DQL algorithm.
    TABLE III Performance Comparison Among DQL Algorithms by Google DeepMind F. Deep
    Q -Learning for Extensions of MDPs 1) Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Q -Learning
    for Continuous Action: Although DQL algorithm can solve problems with high-dimensional
    state spaces, it can only handle discrete and low-dimensional action spaces. However,
    systems in many applications have continuous, i.e., real values, and high dimensional
    action spaces. The DQL algorithms cannot be straightforwardly applied to continuous
    actions since they rely on choosing the best action that maximizes the Q -value
    function. In particular, a full search in a continuous action space to find the
    optimal action is often infeasible. In [36], the authors introduce a model-free
    off-policy actor-critic algorithm using deep function approximators that can learn
    policies in high-dimensional, continuous action spaces. The key idea is based
    on the deterministic policy gradient (DPG) algorithm proposed in [37]. In particular,
    the DPG algorithm maintains a parameterized actor function μ(s; θ μ ) with parameter
    vector θ which specifies the current policy by deterministically mapping states
    to a specific action. The critic Q ( s , a ) is learned by using the Bellman equation
    as in Q -learning. The actor is updated by applying the chain rule to the expected
    return from the start distribution with respect to the actor parameters. Based
    on this update rule, the authors then introduce Deep DPG (DDPG) algorithm which
    can learn competitive policies by using low-dimensional observations, e.g., cartesian
    coordinates or joint angles, under the same hyper-parameters and network structure.
    The algorithm makes a copy of the actor and critic networks Q ′ (s,a; θ Q ′ )
    and μ ′ (s; θ μ ′ ) , respectively, to calculate the target values. The weights
    of these target networks are then updated with slowly tracking on the learned
    networks, i.e., θ ′ →τθ+(1−τ) θ ′ with τ≪1 . This means that the target values
    are constrained to change slowly, greatly improving the stability of learning.
    Note that the major challenge of learning in continuous action spaces is exploration.
    Therefore, in the proposed algorithm, the exploration policy μ ′ is constructed
    by adding noise sampled from a noise process N to the actor policy. 2) Deep Recurrent
    Q -Learning for POMDPs: To tackle problems with partially observable environments
    by deep reinforcement learning, the authors in [38] propose a framework called
    Deep Recurrent Q-Learning (DRQN) in which an LSTM layer was used to replace the
    first post-convolutional fully-connected layer of the conventional DQN. The recurrent
    structure is able to integrate an arbitrarily long history to better estimate
    the current state instead of utilizing a fixed-length history as in DQNs. Thus,
    DRQNs estimate the function Q( o t , h t−1 ;θ) instead of Q( s t , a t );θ) ,
    where θ denotes the parameters of entire network, h t−1 denotes the output of
    the LSTM layer at the previous step, i.e., h t =LSTM( h t−1 , o t ) . DRQN matches
    DQN’s performance on standard MDP problems and outperforms DQN in partially observable
    domains. Regarding the training process, DRQN only considers the convolutional
    features of the observation history instead of explicitly incorporating the actions.
    Through the experiments, the authors demonstrate that DRQN is capable of handling
    partial observability, and recurrency confers benefits when the quality of observations
    changes during evaluation time. 3) Deep SARSA Learning: In [39], the authors introduce
    a DQL technique based on SARSA learning to help the agent determine optimal policies
    in an online fashion. In this algorithm, given the current state s , the CNN is
    used to obtain the current state-action value Q(s,a) . Then, the current action
    a is selected by the ϵ -greedy algorithm. After that, the immediate reward r and
    the next state s ′ can be observed. To estimate the current Q(s,a) , the next
    state-action value Q( s ′ , a ′ ) is obtained. Here, when the next state s ′ is
    used as the input of the CNN, Q( s ′ , a ′ ) can be obtained as the output. Then,
    a label vector related to Q(s,a) is defined as Q( s ′ , a ′ ) which represents
    the target vector. The two vectors only have one different component, i.e., r+γQ(
    s ′ , a ′ )→Q(s,a) . It should be noted that during the training phase, the next
    action a ′ for estimating the current state-action value is never greedy. On the
    contrary, there is a small probability that a random action is chosen for exploration.
    4) Deep Q -Learning for Markov Games: In [40], the authors introduce the general
    notion of sequential prisoner’s dilemma (SPD) to model real world prisoner’s dilemma
    (PD) problems. Since SPD is more complicated than PD, existing approaches addressing
    learning in matrix PD games cannot be directly applied in SPD. Thus, the authors
    propose a multi-agent DRL approach for mutual cooperation in SDP games. The deep
    multi-agent reinforcement learning towards mutual cooperation consists of two
    phases, i.e., offline and online phases. The offline phase generates policies
    with varying cooperation degrees. Since the number of policies with different
    cooperation degrees is infinite, it is computationally infeasible to train all
    the policies from scratch. To address this issue, the algorithm first trains representative
    policies using actor-critic until it converges, i.e., cooperation and defection
    baseline policy. Second, the algorithm synthesizes the full range of policies
    from the above baseline policies. Another task is to detect effectively the cooperation
    degree of the opponent. The algorithm divides this task into two steps. First,
    the algorithm trains an LSTM-based cooperation degree detection network offline,
    which will be then used for real-time detection during the online phase. In the
    online phase, the agent plays against the opponents by reciprocating with a policy
    of a slightly higher cooperation degree than that of the opponent. On one hand,
    intuitively the algorithm is cooperation-oriented and seeks for mutual cooperation
    whenever possible. On the other hand, the algorithm is also robust against selfish
    exploitation and resorts to defection strategy to avoid being exploited whenever
    necessary. Unlike [40] which considers a repeated normal form game with complete
    information, in [41], the authors introduce an application of DRL for extensive
    form games with imperfect information. In particular, the authors in [41] introduce
    Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP), a DRL method for learning approximate Nash
    equilibria of imperfect-information games. NFSP combines FSP with neural network
    function approximation. An NFSP agent has two neural networks. The first network
    is trained by reinforcement learning from memorized experience of play against
    fellow agents. This network learns an approximate best response to the historical
    behaviour of other agents. The second network is trained by supervised learning
    from memorized experience of the agent’s own behaviour. This network learns a
    model that averages over the agent’s own historical strategies. The agent behaves
    according to a mixture of its average strategy and best response strategy. In
    the NSFP, all players of the game are controlled by separate NFSP agents that
    learn from simultaneous play against each other, i.e., self-play. An NFSP agent
    interacts with its fellow agents and memorizes its experience of game transitions
    and its own best response behaviour in two memories, M RL and M SL . NFSP treats
    these memories as two distinct datasets suitable for DRL and supervised classification,
    respectively. The agent trains a neural network, Q(s,a; θ Q ) , to predict action
    values from data in M RL using off-policy reinforcement learning. The resulting
    network defines the agent’s approximate best response strategy, β=ϵ -greedy( Q
    ), which selects a random action with probability ϵ and otherwise chooses the
    action that maximizes the predicted action values. The agent trains a separate
    neural network Π(s,a; θ Π ) to imitate its own past best response behavior by
    using supervised classification on the data in M SL . NFSP also makes use of two
    technical innovations in order to ensure the stability of the resulting algorithm
    as well as to enable simultaneous self-play learning. Through experimental results,
    the authors show that the NFSP can converge to approximate Nash equilibria in
    a small poker game. Summary: In this section, we have presented the basics of
    reinforcement learning, deep learning, and DQL. Furthermore, we have discussed
    various advanced DQL techniques and their extensions. Different DQL techniques
    can be used to solve different problems in different network scenarios. In the
    next sections, we review DQL related works for various problems in communications
    and networking. SECTION III. Network Access and Rate Control Modern networks such
    as IoT become more decentralized and ad-hoc in nature. In such networks, entities
    such as sensors and mobile users need to make independent decisions, e.g., channel
    and base station selections, to achieve their own goals, e.g., throughput maximization.
    However, this is challenging due to the dynamic and the uncertainty of network
    status. Learning algorithms such as DQL allow to learn and build knowledge about
    the networks that are used to enable the network entities to make their optimal
    decisions. In this section, we review the applications of DQL for the following
    issues. Dynamic spectrum access: Dynamic spectrum access allows users to locally
    select channels to maximize their throughput. However, the users may not have
    full observations of the system, e.g., channel states. Thus, DQL can be used as
    an effective tool for dynamic spectrum access. Joint user association and spectrum
    access: User association is implemented to determine which user to be assigned
    to which Base Station (BS). The joint user association and spectrum access problems
    are studied in [42] and [43]. However, the problems are typically combinatorial
    and non-convex which require nearly complete and accurate network information
    to obtain the optimal strategy. DQL is able to provide distributed solutions which
    can be effectively used for the problems. Adaptive rate control: This refers to
    bitrate/data rate control in dynamic and unpredictable environments such as Dynamic
    Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH). Such a system allows clients or users to
    independently choose video segments with different bitrates to download. The client’s
    objective is to maximize its Quality of Experience (QoE). DQL can be adopted to
    effectively solve the problem instead of dynamic programming which has high complexity
    and demands complete information. A. Network Access This section discusses how
    to use DQL to solve the spectrum access and user association in networks. 1) Dynamic
    Spectrum Access: The authors in [44] propose a dynamic channel access scheme of
    a sensor based on the DQL for IoT. The model is shown in Fig. 8. At each time
    slot, the sensor selects one of M channels for transmitting its packet. The channel
    state is either in low interference, i.e., successful transmission, or in high
    interference, i.e., transmission failure. Since the sensor only knows the channel
    state after selecting the channel, the sensor’s optimization decision problem
    can be formulated as a POMDP. In particular, the action of sensor is to select
    one of M channels. The sensor receives a positive reward “+1” if the selected
    channel is in low interference, and a negative reward “−1” otherwise. The objective
    is to find an optimal policy which maximizes the sensor’s expected accumulated
    discounted reward over time slots. In fact, the objective can be obtained by the
    myopic policy [45]. However, the myopic policy requires the prior knowledge of
    the system transition matrix which is hard to obtain. DQL allows the sensor to
    find the optimal policy from its experiences, and thus it can be adopted to solve
    the sensor’s problem. In particular, the DQL uses a DQN1 with experience replay
    [46]. The input of the DQN is a state of the sensor which is the combination of
    actions and observations, i.e., the rewards, in the past time slots. The output
    includes Q-values corresponding to the actions. To balance the exploration of
    the current best Q-value with the exploration of the better one, the ϵ -greedy
    policy is adopted for the action selection mechanism. The simulation results based
    on the real data from [47] show that the proposed scheme achieves an average reward
    of 4.4 that is close to the myopic policy [45] with an average reward of 4.5.
    Note that the myopic policy requires the knowledge of the system transition matrix.
    Fig. 8. Channel selection based on DQL in IoT. Show All Reference [44] can be
    considered to be a pioneer work using the DQL for the channel access. However,
    the DQL keeps following the learned policy over time slots and stops learning
    a suitable policy. Actual IoT environments are dynamic, and the DQN in the DQL
    needs to be re-trained. An adaptive DQL scheme is proposed in [48] which evaluates
    the accumulated reward of the current policy for every period. When the reward
    is reduced by a given threshold, the DQN is re-trained to find a new good policy.
    The simulation results [48] show that when the states of the channels change,
    the adaptive DQL scheme can detect the change and start re-learning to obtain
    the high reward. The models in [44] and [48] are constrained to only one sensor.
    Consider a multi-sensor scenario, the authors in [49] address the joint channel
    selection and packet forwarding using the DQL. The model is shown in Fig. 9 in
    which one sensor as a relay forwards packets received from its neighboring sensors
    to the sink. The sensor is equipped with a buffer to store the received packets.
    At each time slot, the sensor selects a set of channels for the packet forwarding
    so as to maximize its utility, i.e., the ratio of the number of transmitted packets
    to the transmit power. Similar to [44], the sensor’s problem can be formulated
    as an MDP. The action is to select a set of channels, the number of packets transmitted
    on the channels, and a modulation mode. To avoid packet loss, the state is defined
    as the combination of the buffer state and channel state. The MDP is then solved
    by the DQL in which the input is the state and the output is the action selection.
    The DQL uses the stacked autoencoder to reduce the massive calculation and storage
    in the Q-learning phase. The sensor’s utility function is proved to be bounded
    which can guarantee the convergence of the algorithm. The analysis shows that
    the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is O (KM ( J+1 ))that is
    lower than that of the strategy iteration algorithm [50] with the computational
    complexity of O(KM(J+1))(L+1 ) K C M ) , where K is the number of buffers, L is
    the buffer length, M and C respectively are the numbers of channels and channel
    states, and J is the number of possible transmission modes. The simulation results
    show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system utility compared
    with the random action selection scheme. In particular, the average system utility
    of the proposed scheme is 0.63, while that obtained by the random policy is 0.37.
    However, as the packet arrival rate increases, the system utility of the proposed
    scheme decreases since the sensor needs to consume more power to transmit all
    packets. Fig. 9. Joint channel selection and packet forwarding in IoT. Show All
    Consuming more power leads to poor sensor’s performance due to its energy constraint,
    i.e., a shorter IoT system lifetime. The channel access problem in the energy
    harvesting-enabled IoT system is investigated in [51]. The model consists of one
    BS and energy harvesting-based sensors (see Fig. 10). The BS as a controller allocates
    channels to the sensors. However, the uncertainty of ambient energy availability
    at the sensors may make the channel allocation inefficient. For example, the channel
    allocated to the sensor with low available energy may not be fully utilized since
    the sensor cannot communicate later. Fig. 10. Channel access in energy harvesting-enabled
    IoT systems. Show All Therefore, the BS’s problem is to predict the sensors’ battery
    states and select sensors for the channel access so as to maximize the total rate.
    To solve the BS’s problem, the optimal approaches such as the uplink resource
    allocation scheme [52] can be adopted. However, the scheme requires the BS to
    have perfect non-causal knowledge of all the random processes. The perfect knowledge
    may not be available since the sensors are distributed randomly over a geographical
    area. Thus, the DQL is used to solve the problem of the BS, i.e., the agent. The
    DQL uses a DQN consisting of two LSTM-based neural network layers. The first layer
    generates the predicted battery states of sensors, and the second layer uses the
    predicted states along with Channel State Information (CSI) to determine the channel
    access policy. The state space consists of (i) channel access scheduling history,
    (ii) the history of predicted battery information, (iii) the history of the true
    battery information, and (iv) the current CSI of the sensors. The action space
    contains all sets of sensors to be selected for the channel access, and the reward
    is the difference between the total rate and the prediction error. As shown in
    the simulation results, the proposed scheme is close to the optimal approach [52]
    and outperforms the myopic policy [45] in terms of total rate. In particular,
    the total rates obtained by the proposed scheme, the myopic policy, and the optimal
    scheme are 6.8, 6.5, and 7.0 kbps, respectively. Moreover, the battery prediction
    error obtained from the proposed scheme is close to zero. The above schemes, e.g.,
    [44] and [51], focus on the rate maximization. In IoT systems such as Vehicle-to-Vehicle
    (V2V) communications, latency also needs to be considered due to the mobility
    of V2V transmitters/receivers and vital applications in the traffic safety. One
    of the problems of each V2V transmitter is to select a channel and a transmit
    power level to maximize its capacity under a latency constraint. Given the decentralized
    network, a DQN is adopted to make optimal decisions as proposed in [53]. The model
    consists of V2V transmitters, i.e., agents, which share a set of channels. The
    actions of each V2V transmitter include choosing channels and transmit power levels.
    The reward is a function of the V2V transmitter’s capacity and latency. The state
    observed by the V2V transmitter consists of (i) the instantaneous CSI of the corresponding
    V2V link, (ii) the interference to the V2V link in the previous time slot, (iii)
    the channels selected by the V2V transmitter’ neighbors in the previous time slot,
    and (iv) the remaining time to meet the latency constraint. The state is also
    an input of the DQN. The output includes Q-values corresponding to the actions.
    As shown in the simulation results, by dynamically adjusting the power and channel
    selection when V2V links are likely to violate the latency constraint, the proposed
    scheme has more V2V transmitters meeting the latency constraint compared with
    the random channel allocation. To reduce spectrum cost, the above IoT systems
    often use unlicensed channels. However, this may cause the interference to existing
    networks, e.g., WLANs. The authors in [54] propose to use the DQN to jointly address
    the dynamic channel access and interference management. The model consists of
    Small Base Stations (SBSs) which share unlicensed channels in an LTE network (see
    Fig. 11). At each time slot, the SBS selects one of channels for transmitting
    its packet. However, there may be WLAN traffics on the selected channel, and thus
    the SBS accesses the selected channel with a probability. The actions of the SBS
    include pairs of channel selection and channel access probability. The problem
    of the SBS is to determine an action vector so as to maximize its total throughput,
    i.e., its utility, over all channels and time slots. The resource allocation problem
    can be formulated as a non-cooperative game, and the DQN using LSTM can be adopted
    to solve the game. The input of the DQN is the history traffic of the SBSs and
    the WLAN on the channels. The output includes predicted action vectors of the
    SBSs. The utility function of each SBS is proved to be convex, and thus the DQN-based
    algorithm converges to a Nash equilibrium of the game. The analysis shows that
    the computational complexity per time step of the proposed scheme is O( n 2 c
    + n c n i + n c n 0 + n c ) , where n c , n i , and n o are the numbers of memory
    cells, input units, and output units, respectively. The simulation results based
    on real traffic data from [55] show that the proposed scheme can improve the average
    throughput up to 28% compared with the standard Q-learning. Moreover, deploying
    more SBSs in the LTE network does not allow more airtime fraction for the network.
    This implies that the proposed scheme can avoid causing performance degradation
    to the WLAN. However, the proposed scheme requires synchronization between the
    SBSs and the WLAN which is challenging in real networks. Fig. 11. Unlicensed channel
    access in LTE networks. Show All In the same cellular network context, the authors
    in [27] address the dynamic spectrum access problem for multiple users sharing
    K channels. At a time slot, the user selects a channel with a certain attempt
    probability or chooses not to transmit at all. The state is the history of the
    user’s actions and its local observations, and the user’s strategy is mapping
    from the history to an attempt probability. The problem of the user is to find
    a vector of the strategies, i.e., the policy, over time slots to maximize its
    expected accumulated discounted data rate of the user. The above problem is solved
    by training a DQN. The input of the DQN includes past actions and the corresponding
    observations. The output includes estimated Q-values of the actions. To avoid
    the overestimation in the Q-learning, the DDQN [25] is used. Moreover, the dueling
    DQN [30] is employed to improve the estimated Q-value. The DQN is then offline
    trained at a base station. Similar to [54], the multichannel random access is
    modeled as a non-cooperative game. As proved in [27], the game has a subgame perfect
    equilibrium. Note that some users can keep increasing their attempt probability
    to increase their rates. This makes the equilibrium point inefficient, and thus
    the strategy space of the users is restricted to avoid the situation. The simulation
    results show that the proposed scheme can achieve twice the channel throughput
    compared with the slotted-Aloha [56]. The reason is that in the proposed scheme,
    each user only learns from its local observation without an online coordination
    or carrier sensing. However, the proposed scheme requires the central unit which
    may raise the message exchanges as the training is frequently updated. In the
    aforementioned models, the number of users is fixed in all time slots, and the
    arrival of new users is not considered. The authors in [57] address the channel
    allocation to new arrival users in a multibeam satellite system. The multibeam
    satellite system generates a geographical footprint subdivided into multiple beams
    which provide services to ground User Terminals (UTs). The system has a set of
    channels. If there exist available channels, the system allocates a channel to
    the new arrived UT, i.e., the new service is satisfied. Otherwise, the service
    is blocked. The system’s problem is to find a channel allocation decision to minimize
    the total service blocking probability of the new UT over time slots without causing
    the interference to the current UTs. The system’s problem can be viewed as a temporal
    correlated sequential decision-making optimization problem which is effectively
    solved by the DQN. Here, the satellite system is the agent. The action is an index
    indicating which channel is allocated to the new arrived UT. The reward is positive
    when the new service is satisfied and is negative when the service is blocked.
    The state includes the set of current UTs, the current channel allocation matrix,
    and the new arrived UT. Note that the state has the spatial correlation feature
    due to the co-channel interference, and thus it can be represented in an image-like
    fashion, i.e., an image tensor. Therefore, the DQN adopts the CNN to extract useful
    features of the state. The simulation results show that the proposed DQN algorithm
    converges after a certain number of training steps. Also, by allocating available
    channels to the new arrived UTs, the proposed scheme can improve the system traffic
    up to 24.4% compared with the fixed channel allocation scheme. However, as the
    number of current UTs increases, the number of available channels is low or even
    zero. Therefore, the dynamic channel allocation decisions of the proposed scheme
    become meaningless, and the performance difference between the two schemes becomes
    insignificant. For the future work, a joint channel and power allocation algorithm
    based on the DQL can be investigated. 2) Joint User Association and Spectrum Access:
    Joint user association and spectrum access problems are typically non-convex.
    To solve the problems, traditional approaches such as linear programming [58]
    are developed to obtain the optimal solution. However, the approaches require
    nearly complete and accurate network information that is usually not available.
    Learning techniques such as Q-learning can be used. However, it is challenging
    to obtain an optimal solution due to the large state and action spaces of the
    joint optimization problems. By combining DNN with Q-learning, DQL is effectively
    used to solve the joint optimization problems as proposed in [28] and [59]. The
    authors in [28] consider a HetNet which consists of multiple users and BSs including
    macro base stations and femto base stations (see Fig. 12). The BSs share a set
    of orthogonal channels, and the users are randomly located in the network. The
    problem of each user is to select one BS and a channel to maximize its data rate
    while guaranteeing that the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) of
    the user is higher than a minimum Qualtiy of Service (QoS) requirement. The DQL
    is adopted to solve the problem in which each user is an agent, and its state
    is a vector including QoS states of all users, i.e., the global state. Here, the
    QoS state of the user refers to whether its SINR exceeds the minimum QoS requirement
    or not. At each time slot, the user takes an action. If the QoS is satisfied,
    the user receives utility as its immediate reward. Otherwise, it receives a negative
    reward, i.e., an action selection cost. Note that the cumulative reward of one
    user depends on actions of other users, then the user’s problem can be defined
    as an MDP. Similar to [27], the DDQN and the dueling DQN are used to learn the
    optimal policy, i.e., the joint BS and channel selections, for the user to maximize
    its cumulative reward. The simulation results from [28] show that the proposed
    scheme outperforms the Q-learning implemented in [19] in terms of convergence
    speed and system capacity. The simulation comparisons imply that the DQN can be
    effectively used to solve the complex problems, e.g., joint optimization problems,
    in the large-scale systems such as HetNets and IoT. Fig. 12. Joint user association
    and channel selection based on DQL in HetNets. Show All The scheme proposed in
    [28] is considered to be the first work using the DQL for the joint user association
    and spectrum access problem. Inspired by this work, the authors in [59] propose
    to use the DQL for a joint user association, spectrum access, and content caching
    problem. The network model is an LTE network which consists of UAVs serving ground
    users. The UAVs are equipped with storage units and can act as cached-enabled
    LTE-BSs. The UAVs are able to access both licensed and unlicensed bands in the
    network. The UAVs are controlled by a cloud-based server, and the transmissions
    from the cloud to the UAVs are implemented by using the licensed cellular band.
    The problem of each UAV is to determine (i) its optimal user association, (ii)
    the bandwidth allocation indicators on the licensed band, (iii) the time slot
    indicators on the unlicensed band, and (iv) a set of popular contents that the
    users can request to maximize the number of users with stable queue, i.e., users
    satisfied with content transmission delay. The UAV’s problem is combinatorial
    and non-convex, and the DQL can be used to solve it. The UAVs do not know the
    users’ content requests, and thus the Liquid State Machine approach (LSM) [60]
    is adopted to predict the content request distribution of the users and to perform
    resource allocation. In particular, predicting the content request distribution
    is implemented at the cloud based on an LSM-based prediction algorithm. Then,
    given the request distributions, each UAV as an agent uses an LSM-based learning
    algorithm to find its optimal users association. Specifically, the input of the
    LSM-based learning algorithm consists of actions, i.e., UAV-user association schemes,
    that other UAVs take, and the output includes the expected numbers of users with
    stable queues corresponding to actions that the UAV can take. After the user association
    is done, the optimal content caching is determined based on the results of [61,
    Th.2], and the optimal spectrum allocation is done by using linear programming.
    Based on the Gordon’s Theorem [62], the proposed DQL is proved to converge with
    probability one. The simulation results using the content request data from [63]
    show that the proposed DQL can converge within 400 iterations. Compared with the
    Q-learning, the proposed DQN improves the convergence time up to 33%. Moreover,
    the proposed DQL significantly improves the number of users with stable queues
    up to 50% compared with the Q-learning without cache. In fact, energy efficiency
    is also important for the UAVs, and thus applying the DQL for a joint user association,
    spectrum access, and power allocation problem needs to be investigated. B. Adaptive
    Rate Control Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) becomes the dominant
    standard for video streaming [64]. DASH is able to leverage existing content delivery
    network infrastructure and is compatible with a multitude of client-side applications.
    A general DASH system is shown in Fig. 13 in which the videos are stored in servers
    as multiple segments, i.e., chunks. Each segment is encoded at different compression
    levels to generate representations with different bitrates, i.e., different video
    visual quality. At each time slot, the client chooses a representation, i.e.,
    a segment with a certain bitrate, to download. The client’s problem is to find
    an optimal policy which maximizes its QoE such as maximizing average bitrate and
    minimizing rebuffering, i.e., the time which the video playout freezes. Fig. 13.
    A dynamic adaptive streaming system based on HTTP standard. Show All As presented
    in [65], the above problem can be modeled as an MDP in which the agent is the
    client and the action is choosing a representation to download. To maximize the
    QoE, the reward is defined as a function of (i) visual quality of the video, (ii)
    video quality stability, (iii) rebuffering event, and (iv) buffer state. Given
    the reward formulation, the state of the client should include (i) the video quality
    of the last downloaded segment, (ii) the current buffer state, (iii) the rebuffering
    time, and (iv) the channel capacities experienced during downloading of segments
    in the past time slots. The MDP can be solved by using dynamic programming, but
    the computational complexity rapidly becomes unmanageable as the size of the problem
    increases. Thus, the authors in [65] adopt the DQL to solve the problem. Similar
    to [51], the LSTM networks are used in which the input is the state of the client,
    and the output includes Q-values corresponding to the client’s possible actions.
    To improve the performance of the standard LSTM, peephole connections are added
    into the LSTM networks. The simulation results based on the dataset from [66]
    show that the proposed DQL algorithm can converge much faster than Q-learning.
    In particular, the DQL algorithm converges in around 3 episodes, while the Q-learning
    converges in around 180 episodes. The fast convergence suggests that DQL can provide
    efficient solution to problems in real-time applications. Moreover, the proposed
    DQL improves the video quality and reduces the rebuffering since it is able to
    dynamically manage the buffer by considering the buffer state and channel capacity.
    The network model and the optimization problem in [65] are also found in [67].
    However, different from [65], the authors in [67] adopt the Asynchronous Advantage
    Actor- Critic (A3C) method [31] for the DQL to further enhance and speed up the
    training. As presented in Section II-F1, A3C includes two neural networks, namely,
    actor network and critic network. The actor network is to choose bitrates for
    the client, and the critic network helps train the actor network. For the actor
    network, the input is the client’s state, and the output is a policy, i.e., a
    probability distribution over possible actions given states that the client can
    take. Here, the action is choosing the next representation, i.e., the next segment
    with a certain bitrate, to download. For the critic network, the input is the
    client’s state, and the output is the expected total reward when following the
    policy obtained from the actor network. The simulation results based on the mobile
    dataset from [68] show that the proposed DQL can improve the average QoE up to
    25% compared with the bitrate control scheme [69]. Also, by having sufficient
    buffer to handle the network’s throughput fluctuations, the proposed DQL reduces
    the rebuffering around 32.8% compared with the baseline scheme. In practice, the
    DQL algorithm proposed in [67] can be easily deployed in a multi-client network
    since A3C is able to support parallel training for multiple agents. Accordingly,
    each client, i.e., an agent, is configured to observe its reward. Then, the client
    sends a tuple including its state, action, and reward to a server. The server
    uses the actor-critic algorithm to update its actor network model. The server
    then pushes the newest model to the agent. This update process can happen asynchronously
    among all agents which improves quality and speeds up the training. Although the
    parallel training scheme may incur a Round-Trip Time (RTT) between the clients
    and the server, the simulation results in [67] show that the RTT between the clients
    and the server reduces the average QoE by only 3.5%. The performance degradation
    is small, and thus the proposed DQL can be implemented in real network systems.
    In [65] and [67], the input of the DQL, i.e., the client’s state, includes the
    video quality of the last downloaded video segment. The video segment is raw which
    may cause “state explosion” to the state space [70]. To reduce the state space
    and to improve the QoE, the authors in [70] propose to use a video quality prediction
    network. The prediction network extracts useful features from the raw video segments
    using CNN and RNN. Then, the output of the prediction network, i.e., the predicted
    video quality, is used as one of the inputs of the DQL which is proposed in [67].
    Simulation results based on the broadband dataset from [71] show that the proposed
    DQL can improve the average QoE up to 25% compared with the Google Hangout, i.e.,
    a communication platform developed by Google. Moreover, the proposed DQL can reduce
    the average latency of video transmission around 45% due to the small state space.
    This means that in the scenarios that the state space is large, the CNN should
    be used to improve the user QoE and the convergence time. Apart from the DASH
    systems, the DQL can be effectively used for the rate control in High Volume Flexible
    Time (HVFT) applications. HVFT applications use cellular networks to deliver IoT
    traffic as shown in Fig. 14. The HVFT applications have a large volume of traffic,
    and the traffic scheduling, e.g., data rate control, in the HVFT applications
    is necessary. One common approach is to assign static priority classes per traffic
    type, and then traffic scheduling is based on its priority class. However, such
    an approach does not evolve to accommodate new traffic classes. Thus, learning
    methods such as DQL should be used to provide adaptive rate control mechanisms
    as proposed in [72]. The network model is a single cell including one BS as a
    central controller and multiple mobile users. The problem at the BS is to find
    a proper policy, i.e., data rate for the users, to maximize the amount of transmitted
    HVFT traffic while minimizing performance degradation to existing data traffics.
    It is shown in [72] that the problem can be formulated as an MDP. The agent is
    the BS, and the state includes the current network state and the useful features
    extracted from network states in the past time slots. The network state at a time
    slot includes (i) the congestion metric, i.e., the cell’s traffic load, at the
    time slot, (ii) the total number of network connections, and (iii) the cell efficiency,
    i.e., the cell quality. The action that the BS takes is a combination of the traffic
    rate for the users. To achieve the BS’ objective, the reward is defined as a function
    of (i) the sum of HVFT traffic, (ii) traffic loss to existing applications due
    to the presence of the HVFT traffic, and (iii) the amount of bytes served below
    desired minimum throughput. The DQL using the actor and critic networks with LSTM
    is then adopted. By using the real network data collected in Melbourne, the simulation
    results show that the proposed DQL scheme increases the HVFT traffic up to 2 times
    compared with the heuristic control scheme. The proposed DQL is thus expected
    to be applied in modern networks in large-scale cities with a large population
    growth. Fig. 14. Data rate control based on DQL in HVFT applications. Show All
    In the aforementioned approaches, the maximum number of objectives is constrained,
    e.g., to 3 in [73]. The authors in [74] show that the DQL can be used for the
    rate control to achieve multiple objectives in complex communication systems.
    The network model is a future space communication system which is expected to
    operate in unpredictable environments, e.g., orbital dynamics, atmospheric and
    space weather, and dynamic channels. In the system, the transmitter needs to be
    configured with several transmit parameters, e.g., symbol rate and encoding rate,
    to achieve multiple conflict objectives, e.g., low Bit Error Rate (BER), throughput
    improvement, power and spectral efficiency. The adaptive coding and modulation
    schemes, i.e., [75], can be used. However, the methods allow to achieve only limited
    number objectives. Learning algorithms such as the DQL can be thus used. The agent
    is the transmitter in the system. The action is a combination of (i) symbol rate,
    (ii) energy per symbol, (iii) modulation mode, (iv) number of bits per symbol,
    and (v) encoding rate. The objective is to maximize the system performance. Thus,
    the reward is defined as a fitness function of performance parameters including
    (i) BER estimated at the receiver, (ii) throughput, (iii) spectral efficiency,
    (iv) power consumption, and (v) transmit power efficiency. The state is the system
    performance measured by the transmitter, and thus the state is the reward. To
    achieve multiple objectives, the DQL is implemented by using a set of multiple
    neural networks in parallel. The input of the DQL is the current state and the
    channel conditions, and the output is the predicted action. The neural networks
    are trained by using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm [76]. The
    simulation results show that the proposed DQL can achieve the fitness score, i.e.,
    the weighted sum of different objectives, close to the ideal, i.e., the exhaustive
    search approach. This implies that the DQL is able to select near-optimal actions
    and learn the relationship between rewards and actions given dynamic channel conditions.
    Summary: This section reviews applications of DQL for the dynamic network access
    and adaptive rate control. The reviewed approaches are summarized along with the
    references in Table IV. We observe that the problems are mostly modeled as an
    MDP. Moreover, DQL approaches for the IoT and DASH systems receive more attentions
    than other networks. Future networks, e.g., 5G networks, involve multiple network
    entities with multiple conflicting objectives, e.g., provider’s revenue versus
    users’ utility maximization. This poses a number of challenges to the traditional
    resource management mechanisms that deserve in-depth investigation. In the next
    section, we review the adoption of DQL for the emerging services, i.e., offloading
    and caching. TABLE IV A Summary of Approaches Using DQL for Network Access and
    Adaptive Rate Control SECTION IV. Caching and Offloading As one of the key features
    of information-centric networking, in-network caching can efficiently reduce duplicated
    content transmissions. The studies on wireless caching has shown that access delays,
    energy consumption, and the total amount of traffic can be reduced significantly
    by caching contents in wireless devices. Big data analytics [77] also demonstrate
    that with limited cache size, proactive caching at network edge nodes can achieve
    100% user satisfaction while offloading 98% of the backhaul traffic. Joint content
    caching and offloading can address the gap between the mobile users’ large data
    demands and the limited capacities in data storage and processing. This motivates
    the study on Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). By deploying both computational resources
    and caching capabilities close to end users, MEC significantly improves energy
    efficiency and QoS for applications that require intensive computations and low
    latency. A unified study on caching, offloading, networking, and transmission
    control in MEC scenarios involves very complicated system analysis because of
    strong couplings among mobile users with heterogeneities in application demand,
    QoS provisioning, mobility pattern, radio access interface, and wireless resources.
    A learning-based and model-free approach becomes a promising candidate to manage
    huge state space and optimization variables, especially by using DNNs. In this
    section, we review the modeling and optimization of caching and offloading policies
    in wireless networks by leveraging the DRL framework. A. Wireless Proactive Caching
    Wireless proactive caching has attracted great attentions from both academia and
    industry. Statistically, a few popular contents are usually requested by many
    users during a short time span, which accounts for most of the traffic load. Therefore,
    proactively caching popular contents can avoid the heavy traffic burden of the
    backhaul links. In particular, this technique aims at pre-caching the contents
    from the remote content servers at the edge devices or BSs that are close to the
    end users. If the requested contents are already cached locally, the BS can directly
    serve the end users with small delay. Otherwise, the BS requests these contents
    from the original content server and updates the local cache based on the caching
    policy, which is one of the main design problem for wireless proactive caching.
    1) QoS-Aware Caching: Content popularity is the key factor used to solve the content
    caching problem. With a large number of contents and their time-varying popularities,
    DQL is an attractive strategy to tackle this problem with high-dimensional state
    and action spaces. The authors in [77] present a DQL scheme to improve the caching
    performance. The system model consists of a single BS with a fixed cache size.
    For each request, the BS as an agent makes a decision on whether or not to store
    the currently requested content in the cache. If the new content is kept, the
    BS determines which local content will be replaced. The state is the feature space
    of the cached contents and the currently requested content. The feature space
    consists of the total number of requests for each content in a specific short-,
    medium-, and long-term. There are two types of actions: (i) to find a pair of
    contents and exchange the cache states of the two contents and (ii) to keep the
    cache states of the contents unchanged. The aim of the BS is to maximize the long-term
    cache hit rate, i.e., reward. The DQL scheme in [77] trains the policy by using
    the DDPG method [78] and employs Wolpertinger architecture [79] to reduce the
    size of the action space and avoid missing an optimal policy. The Wolpertinger
    architecture consists of three main parts: an actor network, K-Nearest Neighbors
    (K-NN), and a critic network. The actor network is to avoid a large action space.
    The critic network is to correct the decision made by the actor network. The DDPG
    method is applied to update both critic and actor networks. K-NN can help to explore
    a set of actions to avoid poor decisions. The actor and critic networks are then
    implemented by using FNNs. The simulation results show that the proposed DQL scheme
    outperforms the first-in first-out scheme in terms of long-term cache hit rate.
    In particular, the cache hit rate obtained by the DQL scheme is 0.5, while that
    obtained by the first-in first-out scheme is 0.4. The performance comparisons
    demonstrate that the proposed DQL scheme can achieve competitive cache hit rates
    while effectively reducing the run-time. This makes the proposed framework efficient
    and suitable for handling large-scale data. Maximizing the long-term cache hit
    rate in [77] implies that the cache stores the most popular contents. In a dynamic
    environment, contents stored in a cache have to be replaced according to the users’
    dynamic requests. An optimization of the placement or replacement of cached contents
    is studied in [80] by a deep learning method. The optimization algorithm is trained
    by a DNN in advance and then used for real-time caching or scheduling with minimum
    delay. The authors in [81] propose an optimal caching policy to learn the cache
    expiration times, i.e., Time-To-Live (TTL), for dynamically changing requests
    in content delivery networks. The system includes a cloud database server and
    multiple mobile devices that can issue queries and update entries in a single
    database. The query results can be cached for a specified time interval at server-controlled
    caches. All cached queries will become invalid if one of the cached records has
    been updated. A large TTL will strain cache capacities while a small TTL increases
    latencies significantly if the database server is physically remote. Unlike the
    DDPG approach used in [77], the authors in [81] propose to utilize Normalized
    Advantage Functions (NAFs) for continuous DQL scheme to learn optimal cache expiration
    duration. The key problem in continuous DQL is to select an action maximizing
    the Q-function, while avoiding performing a costly numerical optimization at each
    step. The use of NAFs obviates a second actor network that needs to be trained
    separately. Instead, a single neural network is used to output both a value function
    and an advantage term. The DQL agent at the cloud database uses an encoding of
    a query itself and the query miss rates as the system states, which allows for
    an easier generalization. The system reward is linearly proportional to the current
    load, i.e., the number of cached queries divided by the total capacity. This reward
    function can encourage longer TTLs when fewer queries are cached, and shorter
    TTLs when the load is close to the system capacity. Considering incomplete measurements
    for rewards and next-states at run-time, the authors introduce the Delayed Experience
    Injection (DEI) approach that allows the DQL agent to keep track of incomplete
    transitions when measurements are not immediately available. The authors evaluate
    the learning algorithm by Yahoo! cloud serving benchmark with customized Web workloads
    [82]. The simulation results verify that the learning approach based on NAFs and
    DEI outperforms a statistical estimator. 2) Joint Caching and Transmission Control:
    The caching policies determine where to store and retrieve the requested content
    efficiently, e.g., by learning the contents’ popularities [77] and cache expiration
    time [81]. Another important aspect of caching design is the transmission control
    of the content delivery from caches to end users, especially for wireless systems
    with dynamic channel conditions. To avoid mutual interference in multi-user wireless
    networks, the transmission control decides which cached contents can be transmitted
    concurrently as well as the most appropriate control parameters, e.g., transmit
    power, precoding, data rate, and channel allocation. Hence, the joint design of
    caching and transmission control is required to enable efficient content delivery
    in multi-user wireless networks. Recently, some approaches, e.g., [83], are proposed
    for the joint caching and interference alignment in wireless systems. However,
    most of the approaches assume that the channel state information is invariant
    that may not be the case in dynamic wireless systems. The authors in [84]–[86]
    propose to use the DQL framework to address the joint caching and interference
    alignment to tackle mutual interference in multi-user wireless networks. The authors
    consider an MIMO system with limited backhaul capacity and the caches at the transmitter.
    The precoding design for interference alignment requires the global CSI at each
    transmitter. A central scheduler is responsible for collecting CSI and cache status
    from each user via the backhaul, scheduling the users’ transmission, and optimizing
    the resource allocation. By enabling content caching at individual transmitters,
    we can decrease the demand for data transfer and thus save more backhaul capacity
    for real-time CSI update and sharing. Using the DQL-based approach at the central
    scheduler can reduce the explicit demand for CSI and the computational complexity
    in matrix optimization, especially with time-varying channel conditions. The DQL
    agent implements the DNN to approximate the Q-function with experience replay
    in training. To make the learning process more stable, the target Q-network parameter
    is updated by the Q-network for every a few time instants. The collected information
    is assembled into a system state and sent to the DQL agent, which feeds back an
    optimal action for the current time instant. The action indicates which users
    to be active, and the resource allocation among active users. The system reward
    represents the total throughput of multiple users. An extended work of [84] and
    [85] with a similar DQL framework is presented in [86], in which a CNN-based DQN
    is adopted and evaluated in a more practical conditions with imperfect or delayed
    CSI. Simulation results show that the performance of the MIMO system is significantly
    improved compared with the baseline scheme [83] in terms of the total throughput
    and energy efficiency. In particular, at SNR = 15 dB, the total rate obtained
    by the proposed DQN scheme is 240 Mbps, while that obtained by the baseline scheme
    is 200 Mbps. Interference management is an important requirement of wireless systems.
    The application-related QoS or user experience is also an essential metric. Different
    from [84]–[86], the authors in [87] propose a DQL approach to maximize Quality
    of Experience (QoE) of IoT devices by jointly optimizing the cache allocation
    and transmission rate in content-centric wireless networks. The system state is
    specified by the nodes’ caching conditions, e.g., the service information and
    cached contents, as well as the transmission rates of the cached contents. The
    aim of the DQL agent is to minimize continuously the network cost or maximize
    the QoE. The proposed DQL framework is further enhanced with the use of PER and
    DDQN. PER replays important transitions more frequently so that DQN can learn
    from samples more efficiently. The use of DDQN can stabilize the learning by providing
    two value functions in separated neural networks. This avoids an overestimation
    of the DQN with the increasing number of actions. These two neural networks are
    not completely decoupled as the target network is a periodic copy of estimation
    network. A discrete simulator ccnSim [88] is used to model the caching behavior
    in various graph structures. The output data trace of the simulator is then imported
    to MATLAB and used to evaluate the learning algorithm. As shown in the simulation
    results, the proposed DQL framework can achieve a QoE value of 4 that is double
    to that of the standard penetration test scheme. Moreover, the computational complexity
    of the DDQN is O (lg n ) that is lower than that of the standard penetration test
    scheme with the computational complexity of O(ls n 3 ) , where n is the number
    of content-centric computing nodes, s is the number of service nodes, and l is
    the number of transmission rate values. The QoE can be used to characterize the
    users’ perception of Virtual Reality (VR) services. The authors in [89] address
    the joint content caching and transmission strategy in a wireless VR network,
    where UAVs capture videos on live games and transmit them to small-cell BSs servicing
    the VR users. Millimeter wave (mmWave) downlink backhaul links are used for VR
    content transmission from the UAVs to BSs. The BSs can also cache the popular
    contents that may be requested frequently by end users. The joint content caching
    and transmission problem is formulated as an optimization to maximize the users’
    reliability, i.e., the probability that the content transmission delay satisfies
    the instantaneous delay target. The maximization involves the control of transmission
    format, users’ association, the set and format of cached contents. A DQL framework
    combining the Liquid State Machine (LSM) and Echo State Network (ESN) is proposed
    for each BS to find the optimal transmission and caching strategies. As a randomly
    generated spiking neural network [90], LSM can store information about the network
    environment over time and adjust the users’ association policy, cached contents
    and formats according to the users’ content requests. It has been used in [59]
    to predict the users’ content request distribution while having only limited information
    regarding the network and different users. Conventional LSM uses FNNs as the output
    function, which demands high complexity in training due to the computation of
    gradients for all of the neurons. Conversely, the proposed DQL framework uses
    an ESN as the output function, which uses historical information to find the relationship
    between the users’ reliability, caching, and content transmission. It also has
    a lower complexity in training and a better memory for network information. Simulation
    results show that the proposed DQL framework can yield 25.4% gain in terms of
    users’ reliability compared to the baseline Q-learning. 3) Joint Caching, Networking,
    and Computation: Caching and transmission control will become more involved in
    a HetNet that integrates different communication technologies, e.g., cellular
    system, device-to-device network, vehicular network, and networked UAVs, to support
    various application demands. The network heterogeneity raises the problem of complicated
    system design that needs to address challenging issues such as mutual interference,
    differentiated QoS provisioning, and resource allocation, hopefully in a unified
    framework. Obviously this demands a joint optimization far beyond the extent of
    joint caching and transmission control. Accordingly, the authors in [91] propose
    a DQL framework for energy-efficient resource allocation in green wireless networks,
    jointly considering the couplings among networking, in-network caching and computation.
    The system consists of a Software-Defined Network (SDN) with multiple virtual
    networks and mobile users requesting for video on-demand files that require a
    certain amount of computational resource at either the content server or at local
    devices. In each virtual network, an authorized user issues a request to download
    files from a set of available SBSs in its neighborhood area. The wireless channels
    between each mobile user and the SBSs are characterized as Finite-State Markov
    Channels (FSMC). The states are the available cache capacity at the SBSs, the
    channel conditions between mobile users and SBSs, the computational capability
    of the content servers and mobile users. The DQL agent at each SBS decides an
    association between each mobile user and SBS, where to perform the computational
    task, and how to schedule the transmissions of SBSs to deliver the required data.
    The objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of the system from data
    caching, wireless transmission, and computation. Simulation results show that
    the total energy consumption in different testing scenarios is very high at the
    beginning of the learning process and gradually decreases a stable value when
    the learning converges. Moreover, the energy consumption of the unified DRL framework
    considering caching, networking, and computing is significantly lower than those
    of other DRL frameworks that only focus on part of the control variables. The
    DQL scheme proposed in [91] has been applied to improve the performance of Vehicular
    Ad doc NETworks (VANETs) in [92]–[94]. The network model includes multiple BSs,
    Road Side Units (RSUs), MEC servers, and content servers. All devices are controlled
    by a mobile virtual network operator. The vehicles request for video contents
    that can be cached at the BSs or retrieved from remote content servers. The authors
    in [92] formulate the resource allocation problem as a joint optimization of caching,
    networking, and computing, e.g., compressing and encoding operations of the video
    contents. The system states include the CSI from each BS, the computational capability,
    and cache size of each MEC/content server. The network operator feeds the system
    state to the FNN-based DQN and gets the optimal policy that determines the resource
    allocation for each vehicle. To exploit spatial correlations in learning, the
    authors in [93] enhance Q-learning by using CNNs in DQN. This makes it possible
    to extract high-level features from raw input data. Two schemes have been introduced
    in [94] to improve stability and performance of the ordinary DQN method. Firstly,
    DDQN is designed to avoid over-estimation of Q-value in ordinary DQN. Hence, the
    action can be decoupled from the target Q-value generation. This makes the training
    process faster and more reliable. Secondly, the dueling DQN approach is also integrated
    in the design with the intuition that it is not always necessary to estimate the
    reward by taking some action. The state-action Q-value in dueling DQN is decomposed
    into one value function representing the reward in the current state, and the
    advantage function that measures the relative importance of a certain action compared
    with other actions. Simulation results show that the proposed DQL scheme outperforms
    the existing static scheme in terms of total utility. In particular, the total
    utility obtained by the DQL scheme is 8000, while that obtained by the existing
    static scheme is 5000. Considering the huge action space and high complexity with
    the vehicle’s mobility and service delay deadline T d , a multi-time scale DQN
    framework is proposed in [95] to minimize the system cost by the joint design
    of communication, caching and computing in VANET. The policy design accounts for
    limited storage capacities and computational resources at the vehicles and the
    RSUs. The small timescale DQN is for every time slot and aims to maximize the
    exact immediate reward. Additionally, the large timescale DQN is designed for
    every T d time slots within the service delay deadline, and used to estimate the
    reward considering the vehicle’s mobility in a large timescale. Simulation results
    show that the proposed framework can reduce the cost up to 30% compared with the
    random resource allocation scheme. The aforementioned DQL framework for VANETs,
    e.g., [92]–[94], has also been generalized to smart city applications in [96],
    which necessitates dynamic orchestration of networking, caching, and computation
    to meet different servicing requirements. Through Network Function Virtualization
    (NFV) [97], the physical wireless network in smart cities can be divided logically
    into several virtual ones by the network operator, which is responsible for network
    slicing and resource scheduling, as well as allocation of caching and computing
    capacities. The use cases in smart cities are presented in [98], [99], which apply
    the generalized DQL framework to improve the security and efficiency for trust-based
    data exchange, sharing, and delivery in mobile social networks through the resource
    allocation and optimization of MEC allocation, caching, and D2D (Device-to-Device)
    networking. B. Data and Computation Offloading With limited computation, memory
    and power supplies, IoT devices such as sensors, wearable devices, and handheld
    devices become the bottleneck to support advanced applications such as interactive
    online gaming and face recognition. To address such a challenge, IoT devices can
    offload the computational tasks to nearby MEC servers, integrated with the BSs,
    Access Points (APs), and even neighboring Mobile Users (MUs). As a result, data
    and computation offloading can potentially reduce the processing delay, save the
    battery energy, and even enhance security for computation-intensive IoT applications.
    However, the critical problem in the computation offloading is to determine the
    offloading rate, i.e., the amount of computational workload, and choose the MEC
    server from all available servers. If the chosen MEC server experiences heavy
    workloads and degraded channel conditions, it may take even longer time for the
    IoT devices to offload data and receive the results from the MEC server. Hence,
    the design of an offloading policy has to take into account the time-varying channel
    conditions, user mobility, energy supply, computation workload and the computational
    capabilities of different MEC servers. Some optimal offloading approaches, e.g.,
    the dynamic programming based offloading algorithm and heuristic offloading algorithm
    [100], are proposed. However, the approaches assume that the mobility patterns
    of the mobile users are given in advance. Without knowing the mobility pattern
    in advance, the DQL can be used for each mobile user to learn the optimal offloading
    policy from past experiences such as the approaches proposed in [101] and [102].
    The authors in [101] focus on minimizing the mobile user’s cost and energy consumption
    by offloading cellular traffic to WLAN. Each mobile user can either access the
    cellular network, or the complimentary WLAN as illustrated in Fig. 16(a), but
    with different monetary costs. The mobile user also has to pay a penalty if the
    data transmission does not finish before the deadline. The mobile user’s data
    offloading decision can be modeled as an MDP. The system state includes the mobile
    user’s location and the remaining file size of all data flows. The mobile user
    will choose to transmit data through either WLAN or cellular network, and decide
    how to allocate channel capacities to concurrent flows. CNNs are employed in the
    DQL to predict a continuous value of the mobile user’s remaining data. Simulation
    results reveal that the DQN-based scheme generally outperforms the dynamic programming
    algorithm for the MDP in terms of cost and energy consumption. In particular,
    the DQL-based scheme can reduce the energy consumption up to 500 Joules compared
    with that of the dynamic programming algorithm. The reason is that the DQN can
    learn from experience while the dynamic programming algorithm cannot obtain the
    optimal policy with incorrect transition probability. Fig. 15. Joint caching,

    [108], (d) Offloading to multiple MEC-enabled BSs [112], [113] and mobile cloudlets
    [114], [115]. Show All The allocation of limited computational resources at the
    MEC server is critical for cost and energy minimization. The authors in [102]
    consider an MEC-enabled cellular system, in which multiple mobile users can offload
    their computational tasks via wireless channels to one MEC server, co-located
    with the cellular BS as shown in Fig. 16(b). Each mobile user has a computational-intensive
    task, characterized by the required computational resources, CPU cycles, and the
    maximum tolerable delay. The capacity of the MEC server is limited to accommodate
    all mobile users’ task loads. The bandwidth sharing between different mobile users’
    offloading also affects the overall delay performance and energy consumptions.
    The DQL is used to minimize the cost of delay and power consumptions for all mobile
    users, by jointly optimizing the offloading decision and computational resource
    allocation. The system states include the sum of cost of the entire system and
    the available computational capacity of the MEC server. The action of BS is to
    determine the resource allocation and offloading decision for each mobile user.
    To limit the size of action space, a pre-classification step is proposed to check
    the mobile users’ feasible set of actions. Simulation results show that the proposed
    scheme can reduce the sum cost up to 55% compared with the static allocation strategies.
    In contrast to [102], multiple BSs in an ultra-dense network is considered in
    [103] and [104], as shown in Fig. 16(c), with the objective of minimizing the
    long-term cost of delay in computation offloading. All computational tasks are
    offloaded to the shared MEC server via different BSs. Besides the allocation of
    computational resources and transmission control, the offloading policy also has
    to optimize the association between mobile users and the BSs. With dynamic network
    conditions, the mobile users’ decision-making can be formulated as an MDP. The
    system states are the channel conditions between the mobile user and the BSs,
    the states of energy and task queues. The cost function is defined as a weighted
    sum of the execution delay, the handover delay and the computational task dropping
    cost. The authors in [104] firstly propose a DDQN-based DQL algorithm to learn
    the optimal offloading policy without knowing the network dynamics. By leveraging
    the additive structure of the utility function, the Q-function decomposition combined
    with the DDQN further leads to a novel online SARSA-based DRL algorithm. Numerical
    experiments show that the new algorithm achieves a significant improvement in
    computation offloading performance compared with the baseline policies, e.g.,
    the DQN-based DQL algorithm and some heuristic offloading strategies without learning.
    The high density of SBSs can relieve the data offloading pressure in peak traffic
    hours but consume a large amount of energy in off-peak time. Therefore, the authors
    in [105], [106], and [107] propose a DQL-based strategy for controlling the (de)activation
    of different SBSs to minimize the energy consumption without compromising the
    quality of provisioning. In particular, in [105], the on/off decision framework
    uses a DQL scheme to approximate both the policy and value functions in an actor-critic
    method. The reward of the DQL agent is defined as a cost function relating to
    energy consumption, QoS degradation, and the switching cost of SBSs. The DDPG
    approach is also employed together with an action refinement scheme to expedite
    the training process. Through extensive numerical simulations, the proposed scheme
    is shown to greatly outperform other baseline methods in terms of both energy
    and computational efficiency. With a similar model to that in [104], computation
    offloading finds a proper application for cloud-based malware detection in [108].
    A review of the threat models and the RL-based solutions for security and privacy
    protection in mobile offloading and caching are discussed in [109]. With limited
    energy supply, computational resources, and channel capacity, mobile users cannot
    always update the local malware database and process all application data in time
    and thus are vulnerable to zero-day attacks [110]. By leveraging the remote MEC
    server, all mobile users can offload their application data and detection tasks
    via different BSs to the MEC/security server with larger and more sophisticated
    malware database, more computational capabilities, and powerful security services.
    This can be modeled by a dynamic malware detection game in which multiple mobile
    users interact with each other in resource competition, e.g., the allocation of
    wireless channel capacities and the computational capabilities of the MEC/security
    server. A DQL scheme is proposed for each mobile user to learn its offloading
    data rate to the MEC/security server. The system states include the channel state
    and the size of application traces. The objective is to optimize the detection
    accuracy of the security server, which is defined as a concave function in the
    total amount of malware samples. The Q-value is estimated by using a CNN in the
    DQL framework. The authors also propose the hotbooting Q-learning technique that
    provides a better initialization for Q-learning by exploiting the offloading experiences
    in similar scenarios. It can save exploration time at the initial stage and accelerate
    the learning speed compared with a standard Q-learning algorithm with all-zero
    initialization of the Q-value [111]. The proposed DQL scheme not only improves
    the detection speed and accuracy, but also increases the mobile users’ battery
    life. The simulation results reveal that compared with the hotbooting Q-learning
    and standard Q-learning schemes, the DQL-based malware detection has faster learning
    rate, higher accuracy, and lower detection delay. For example, the detection delay
    of the proposed DQL scheme reduces by 24.6% and 35.3% at time slot 2000, respectively,
    compared with those of the hotbooting Q-learning and the standard Q-learning schemes.
    Multiple MEC servers have been considered in [112], [113], as illustrated in Fig.
    16(d). The authors in [112] aim to design optimal offloading policy for IoT devices
    with energy harvesting capabilities. The system consists of multiple MEC servers,
    such as BSs and APs, with different capabilities in computation and communications.
    The IoT devices are equipped with energy storage and energy harvesters. They can
    execute computational tasks locally and offload the tasks to the MEC servers.
    The IoT device’s offloading decision can be formulated as an MDP. The system states
    include the battery status, the channel capacity, and the predicted amount of
    harvested energy in the future. The IoT device evaluates the reward based on the
    overall delay, energy consumption, the task drop loss and the data sharing gains
    in each time slot. Similar to [108], the authors in [112] enhance Q-learning by
    the hotbooting technique to save the random exploration time at the beginning
    of learning. The authors also propose a fast DQL offloading scheme that uses hotbooting
    to initialize the CNN and accelerates the learning speed. The authors in [113]
    view the MEC-enabled BSs as different physical machines constituting a part of
    the cloud resources. The cloud optimizes the MUs’ computation offloading to different
    virtual machines residing on the physical machines. A two-layered DQL algorithm
    is proposed for the offloading problem to maximize the utilization of cloud resources.
    The system state relates to the waiting time of each computational task and the
    number of virtual machines. The first layer is implemented by a CNN-based DQL
    framework to estimate an optimal cluster for each computational task. Different
    clusters of physical machines are generated based on the K-NN algorithm. The second
    layer determines the optimal serving physical machine within the cluster by Q-learning
    method. The aforementioned works all focus on data or computation offloading in
    cellular system via BSs to remote MEC servers, e.g., [101]–[104], [108], [112],
    [113]. In [115] and [114], the authors study QoS-aware computation offloading
    in an ad-hoc mobile network. By making a certain payment, the mobile user can
    offload its computational tasks to nearby mobile users constituting a mobile cloudlet,
    as shown in Fig. 16(d). Each mobile user has a first-in-first-out queue with limited
    buffer size to store the arriving tasks arriving as a Poisson process. The mobile
    user selects nearby cloudlets within D2D communication range for task offloading.
    The offloading decision depends on the states including the number of remaining
    tasks, the quality of the links between mobile users and the cloudlet, and the
    availability of the cloudlet’s resources. The objective is to maximize a composite
    utility function, subject to the mobile user’s QoS requirements, e.g., energy
    consumption and processing delay. The utility function is firstly an increasing
    function of the total number of tasks that have been processed either locally
    or remotely by the cloudlets. It is also related to the user’s benefit such as
    energy efficiency and payment for task offloading. This problem is formulated
    as an MDP and solved by linear programming and Q-learning approaches, depending
    on the availability of information about the state transition probabilities. This
    work is further enhanced by leveraging DNN or DQN to learn the decision strategy
    more efficiently. A similar model is studied in [116], where the computation offloading
    is formulated as an MDP to minimize the cost of computation offloading. The solution
    to the MDP can be used to train a DNN by supervised learning. The well-trained
    DNN is then applied to unseen network conditions for real-time decision-making.
    Simulation results show that the use of deep supervised learning achieves significant
    performance gain in offloading accuracy and cost saving. Data and computation
    offloading is also used in fog computing. The mobile application demanding a set
    of data and computational resources can be hosted in a container, e.g., virtual
    machine of a fog node. With user’s mobility, the container has to be migrated
    or offloaded to other nodes and dynamically consolidated. With the container migration,
    some nodes with low resource utilization can be switched off to reduce power consumption.
    The authors in [117] model the container migration as a multi-dimensional MDP,
    which is solved by the DQL. The system states consist of the delay, the power
    consumption and the migration cost. The action includes the selection policy that
    selects the containers to be emigrated from each source node, and the allocation
    policy that determines the destination node of each container. The action space
    can be optimized for more efficient exploration by dividing fog nodes into under-utilization,
    normal-utilization, and over-utilization groups. By powering off under-utilization
    nodes, all their containers will be migrated to other nodes to reduce power consumption.
    The training process is also optimized by using DDQN and PER which assigns different
    priorities to the transitions in experience memory. This helps the DQL agent at
    each fog node to perform better in terms of faster learning speed and more stability.
    The analysis presents that the proposed scheme can be executed in polynomial time.
    Simulation results reveal that the DQL scheme achieves fast decision-making and
    outperforms the existing baseline approaches significantly in terms of delay,
    power consumption, and migration cost. Summary: This section reviews the applications
    of the DQL for wireless caching and data/computation offloading, which are inherently
    coupled with networking and allocation of channel capacity, computational resources,
    and caching capabilities, etc. We observe that the DQL framework for caching is
    typically centralized and mostly implemented at the network controller, e.g.,
    the BS, service provider, and central scheduler, which is more powerful in information
    collection and cross-layer policy design. On the contrary, the end users have
    more control over their offloading decisions, and hence we observe more popular
    implementation of the DQL agent at local devices, e.g., mobile users, IoT devices,
    and fog nodes. Though an orchestration of networking, caching, data and computation
    offloading in one unified DQL framework is promising for network performance maximization,
    we face many challenges in designing highly-stable and fast-convergent learning
    algorithms, due to excessive delay and unsynchronized information collection from
    different network entities. SECTION V. Network Security and Connectivity Preservation
    Future networks become more decentralized and ad-hoc in nature which are vulnerable
    to various attacks such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) and cyber-physical attack.
    Recently, the DQL has been used as an effective solution to avoid and prevent
    the attacks. In this section, we review the applications of DQL in addressing
    the following security issues. Jamming attack: In the jamming attack, attackers
    as jammers transmit Radio Frequency (RF) jamming signals with high power to cause
    interference to the legitimate communication channels, thus reducing the SINR
    at legitimate receivers. Anti-jamming techniques such as the frequency hopping
    [118] and user mobility, i.e., moving out from the heavy jamming area, have been
    commonly used. However, without being aware of the radio channel model and the
    jamming methods, it is challenging for the users to choose an appropriate frequency
    channel as well as to determine how to leave and avoid the attack. DQL enables
    the users to learn an optimal policy based on their past observations, and thus
    DQL can be used to address the above challenge. Cyber-physical attack: The cyber-physical
    attack is an integrity attack in which an attacker manipulates data to alter control
    signals in the system. This attack often happens in autonomous systems such as
    Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) and increases the risk of accidents
    to Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). The DQL allows the AVs to learn optimal actions
    based on their time-varying observations of the attacker’ activities. Thus, the
    DQL can be used to achieve robust and dynamic control of the AV to the attacks.
    Connectivity preserving: This refers to maintaining the connectivity among the
    robots, e.g., UAVs, to support the communication and exchange of information among
    them. The system and network environment is generally dynamic and complex, and
    thus the DQL which allows each robot to make dynamic decisions based on its state
    can be effectively used to preserve the connectivity in the system. A. Network
    Security This section discusses the applications of DQL to address the jamming
    attack and the cyber-physical attack. 1) Jamming Attack: A pioneer work using
    the DQL for the anti-jamming is [119]. The network model is a Cognitive Radio
    Network (CRN) as shown in Fig. 17 which consists of one Secondary User (SU), multiple
    Primary Users (PUs), and multiple jammers. The network has a set of frequency
    channels for hopping. At each time slot, each jammer can arbitrarily select one
    of the channels to send its jamming signal, and the SU, i.e., the agent, needs
    to choose a proper action based on the SU’s current state. The action is (i) selecting
    one of the channels to send its signals or (ii) leaving the area to connect to
    another BS. The jammers are assumed to avoid causing interference to the PUs,
    and thus the SU’s current state consists of the number of PUs and the discretized
    SINR of the SU signal at the last time slot. The objective of the SU is to maximize
    its expected discounted utility over time slots. Note that when the SU chooses
    to leave the area to connect to another BS, it spends a mobility cost. Thus, the
    utility is defined as a function of the SINR of the SU signal and the mobility
    cost. Since the number of frequency channels may be large that results in a large
    action set, the CNN is used for the DQL to quickly learn the optimal policy. As
    shown in the simulation results, the proposed DQL has a faster convergence speed
    than that of the Q-learning algorithm. In particular, the utility of the SU increases
    from 2.73 at the beginning to 3.39 at time slot 1000 that is 8.3% higher than
    that of the Q-learning algorithm. Moreover, considering the scenario with two
    jammers, the proposed DQL outperforms the frequency-hopping method in terms of
    the SINR and the mobility cost. Fig. 17. Jamming attack in cognitive radio network
    [119]. Show All The model in [119] is constrained to two jammers. As the number
    of jammers in the network increases, the proposed scheme may not be effective.
    The reason is that it becomes hard for the SU to find good actions when the number
    of jammed channels increases. An appropriate solution, as proposed in [120], allows
    the receiver of the SU to leave its current location. Since the leaving incurs
    the mobility cost, the receiver, i.e., the agent, needs an optimal policy, i.e.,
    staying at or leaving the current location, to maximize its utility. In this scenario,
    the DQL based on CNN can be used for the receiver to find the optimal action to
    maximize its expected utility. Here, the utility and state of the receiver are
    essentially defined similarly to that of the agent in [119]. In particular, the
    state includes the discretized SINR of the signal measured by the receiver at
    the last time slot. Simulation results show that the proposed DQL converges to
    SINR and utility values that are higher than those obtained by the Q-learning
    and random schemes. In particular, the SINR value obtained by the proposed DQL
    is 3.4, while those obtained by the Q-learning and random schemes are 3.3 and
    2.8, respectively. The above approaches, i.e., in [119] and [120], define states
    of the agents based on raw SINR values of the signals. In practical wireless environments,
    the number of SINR values may be large and even infinite. Moreover, the raw SINR
    can be inaccurate and noisy. To cope with the challenge of the infinite number
    of states, the DQL can use a recursive Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) as
    proposed in [121]. By using the pre-processing layer and recursive convolution
    layers, the RCNN is able to remove noise from the network environment and extract
    useful features of the SINR, i.e., discrete spectrum sample values greater than
    a noise threshold, thus reducing the computational complexity. The network model
    and the problem formulation considered in [121] are similar to those in [119].
    However, instead of directly using the raw SINR, the state of the SU is the extracted
    features of the SINR. Also, the action of the SU includes only frequency-hopping
    decision. The simulation results show that the proposed DQL based on the RCNN
    can converge in both fixed and dynamic jamming scenarios while the Q-learning
    cannot converge in the dynamic jamming one. Furthermore, the proposed DQL can
    achieve the average throughput close to that of the optimal scheme, i.e., an anti-jamming
    scheme with completely known jamming actions. Instead of finding the frequency-hopping
    decisions, the authors in [122] propose the use of DQL to find an optimal power
    control policy for the anti-jamming. The model is an IoT network including IoT
    devices and one jammer. The jammer can observe the communications of the transmitter
    and chooses a jamming strategy to reduce the SINR at the receiver. Thus, the transmitter
    chooses an action, i.e., transmit power level, to maximize its utility. Here,
    the utility is the difference between the SINR and the energy consumption cost
    due to the transmission. Note that choosing the transmit power impacts the future
    jamming strategy, and thus the interaction between the transmitter and the jammer
    can be formulated as an MDP. The transmitter is the agent, and the state is SINR
    measured at its receiver at the last time slot. The DQN using the CNN is then
    adopted to find an optimal power control policy for the transmitter to maximize
    its expected accumulated discounted reward, i.e., the utility, over time slots.
    The simulation results show that the proposed DQL can improve the utility of the
    transmitter up to 17.7% compared with the Q-learning. Also, the proposed DQL reduces
    the utility of the jammer around 18.1% compared with the Q-learning. Moreover,
    the proposed DQL has faster convergence speed than that of the Q-learning. Specifically,
    the proposed DQL converges at time slot 210, while the Q-learning converges at
    time slot 240. To prevent the jammer’s observations of communications, the transmitter
    can change its communication strategy, e.g., by using relays that are far from
    the jamming area. The relays can be UAVs as proposed in [123]. The model consists
    of one UAV, i.e., a relay, one jammer, one mobile user and its serving BS (see
    Fig. 18). The mobile user transmits messages to its server via the serving BS.
    In the case that the serving BS is heavily jammed, the UAV helps the mobile user
    to relay the messages to the server through a backup BS. In particular, depending
    on the SINR and Bit Error Rate (BER) values sent from the serving BS, the UAV
    as an agent decides the relay power level to maximize its utility, i.e., the difference
    between the SINR and the relay cost. The relay power level can be considered to
    be the UAV’s actions, and the SINR and BER are its states. As such, the next state
    observed by the UAV is independent of all the past states and actions. The problem
    is formulated as an MDP. To quickly achieve the optimal relay policy for the UAV,
    the DQL based on CNN is then adopted. The simulation results in [123] show that
    the proposed DQL scheme takes only 200 time slots to converge to the optimal policy,
    which is 83.3% less than that of the relay scheme based on Q-learning [124]. Moreover,
    the proposed DQL scheme reduces the BER of the user by 46.6% compared with the
    hill climbing-based UAV relay scheme [125]. Fig. 18. Anti-jamming scheme based
    on UAV [123]. Show All The scheme proposed in [123] assumes that the relay UAV
    is sufficiently far from the jamming area. However, as illustrated in Fig. 18,
    the attacker can use a compromised UAV close to the relay UAV to launch the jamming
    attack to the relay UAV. In such a scenario, the authors in [126] show that the
    DQL can still be used to address the attack. The system model is based on physical
    layer security and consists of one UAV and one attacker. The attacker is assumed
    to be “smarter” than that in the model in [123]. This means that the attacker
    can observe channels that the UAV uses to communicate with the BS in the past
    time slots and then chooses jamming power levels on the target channels. Therefore,
    the UAV needs to find a power allocation policy, i.e., transmit power levels on
    the channels, to maximize the secrecy capacity of the UAV-BS communication. Similar
    to [123], the DQL based on CNN is used which enables the UAV to choose its actions,
    i.e., transmit power levels on the channels, based on its state, i.e., the attacker’s
    jamming power level in the last time slot. The reward is the difference between
    the secrecy capacity of the UAV and BS and the energy consumption cost. The simulation
    results in [126] show that the proposed DQL can improve the UAV’s utility up to
    13% compared with the baseline scheme [127] which uses the Win or Learn Faster-Policy
    Hill Climbing (WoLF-PHC) to prevent the attack. Also, the safe rate of the UAV,
    i.e., the probability that the UAV is attacked, obtained by the proposed DQL is
    7% higher than that of the baseline. However, the proposed DQL has higher computational
    complexity and takes longer time to make a decision in each time epoch compared
    with the WoLH-PHC. Thus, the proposed DQL is applied only to a single-UAV system.
    For the future work, scenarios with multiple UAVs need to be considered. In such
    a scenario, more computational overhead is expected and multi-agent DQL algorithms
    can be applied. 2) Cyber-Physical Attack: In autonomous systems such as ITSs,
    the attacker can seek to inject faulty data to information transmitted from the
    sensors to the AVs. The AVs which receive the injected information may inaccurately
    estimate the safe spacing among them. This increases the risk of AV accidents.
    Vehicular communication security algorithms, e.g., [128], can be used to minimize
    the spacing deviation. However, the attacker’s actions in these algorithms are
    assumed to be stable which may not be applicable in practical systems. The DQL
    that enables the AVs to learn optimal actions based on their time-varying observations
    of the attacker’ actions can be thus used. The first work using the DQL for the
    cyber-physical attack in an ITS can be found in [129]. The system is a car-following
    model [130] of the General Motors as shown in Fig. 19. In the model, each AV updates
    its speed based on measurement information received from the closest road smart
    sensors. The attacker attempts to inject faulty data to the measurement information.
    However, the attacker cannot inject the measurements of different sensors equally
    due to its resource constraint. Thus, the AV can choose less-faulty measurements
    by selecting a vector of measurement weights. The objective of the attacker is
    to maximize the deviation, i.e., the utility, from the safe spacing between the
    AV and its nearby AV while that of the AV is to minimize the deviation. The interaction
    between the attacker and the AV can be modeled as a zero-sum game. The authors
    in [129] show that the DQL can be used to find the equilibrium strategies. In
    particular, the action of the AV is to choose a weight vector. Its state includes
    the past actions, i.e., the weight vectors, and the past deviation values. Since
    the actions and deviations have continuous values, the state space is infinite.
    Thus, LSTM units that are able to extract useful features are adopted for the
    DQL to reduce the state space. The simulation results show that by using the past
    actions and deviations for learning the attacker’s action, the proposed DQL scheme
    can guarantee a lower steady-state deviation than the Kalmar filter-based scheme
    [128]. Moreover, by using the LSTM units, the results show that the proposed DQL
    scheme can converge much faster than the baseline scheme. Fig. 19. Car-following
    model with cyber-physical attack. Show All Another work that uses the LSTM to
    extract useful features from the measurement information to detect the cyber-physical
    attack is proposed in [131]. The model is an IoT system including a cloud and
    a set of IoT devices. The IoT devices generate signals and transmit the signals
    to the cloud (see Fig. 20). The cloud uses the received signals for estimation
    and control of the IoT devices’ operation. An attacker can launch the cyber-physical
    attack by manipulating the IoT devices’ output signals that causes control errors
    at the cloud and degrades the performance of the IoT system. To detect the attack,
    the cloud uses LSTM units to extract stochastic features or fingerprints such
    as flatness, skewness, and kurtosis, of the IoT devices’ signals. The cloud sends
    the fingerprints back to the IoT devices, and the IoT devices embed, i.e., watermark,
    the fingerprints inside the signals. The cloud uses the fingerprints to authenticate
    the IoT devices’ signals to detect the attack. The computational complexity of
    the proposed signal authentication method is O(d f i s ) , where d is the delay
    that the cloud authenticates any IoT signal, and f i s is the sampling rate of
    IoT device i . Fig. 20. Cyber-physical detection in IoT systems using DQL. Show
    All The algorithm proposed in [131] is also called dynamic watermarking [132]
    which is able to detect the cyber-physical attack and to prevent eavesdropping
    attacks. However, the algorithm requires large computational resources at the
    cloud for the IoT device signal authentication. Consequently, the cloud can only
    authenticate a limited number of vulnerable IoT devices. The cloud can choose
    the vulnerable IoT devices by observing their security status. However, this can
    be impractical since the IoT devices may not report their security status. Thus,
    the authors in [133] propose to use the DQL that enables the cloud to decide which
    IoT devices to authenticate with the incomplete information. Since IoT devices
    with more valuable data are likely to be attacked, the reward is defined as a
    function of data values of IoT devices. The cloud’s state includes attack actions
    of the attacker on the IoT devices in the past time slots. The actions of the
    attacker on the IoT devices can be obtained by using the dynamic watermarking
    algorithm in [131] (see Fig. 20). The DQL then uses an LSTM unit to find the optimal
    policy. The input of the LSTM unit is the state of the cloud, and the output includes
    probabilities of attacking the IoT devices. By using a real dataset from the accelerometers,
    the simulation results show that the proposed DQL can improve the cloud’s utility
    up to 30% compared with the case in which the cloud chooses the IoT devices with
    equal probability. B. Connectivity Preservation Multi-robot systems such as multi-UAV
    cooperative networks have been widely applied in many fields such as military,
    e.g., enemy detecting. In the cooperative multi-robot system, the connectivity
    among the robots, e.g., UAVs in Fig 21, is required to enable the communication
    and exchange of information. To tackle the connectivity preservation problem,
    the Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithm [134] is used. However, the algorithm
    cannot be directly adopted when the robots are undertaking missions in dynamic
    and complex environments. The DQL which allows each robot to make dynamic decisions
    based on its own state can be effectively applied to preserve the connectivity
    in the multirobot system. Such an approach is proposed in [135]. Fig. 21. Connectivity
    preservation of a multi-UAV network. Show All The model in [135] consists of two
    robots or UAVs, i.e., one leader robot and one follower robot. In the model, a
    central control, i.e., a ground BS, adjusts the velocity of the follower such
    that the follower stays in the communication range of the leader at all time (see
    Fig 21). The connectivity preservation problem can be thus formulated as an MDP.
    The agent is the BS, and the states are the relative position and the velocity
    of the leader with respect to the follower. The action space consists of possible
    velocity values of the follower. Taking an action returns a reward which is +1
    if the follower is in the range of the leader, and −1 otherwise. A DQN using FNN
    is used which enables the BS to learn an optimal policy to maximize the expected
    discounted cumulative reward. The input of the DQN includes the states of the
    two robots, and the output is the action space of the follower. The simulation
    results show that for different locations of the leader and the follower, the
    score obtained by the proposed scheme is always 100, while the score of the APF
    method can be occasionally less than 100. This means that the proposed scheme
    achieves better connectivity between the two robots than that of the APF method.
    However, a general scenario with more than one leader and one follower needs to
    be investigated. Considering the general scenario, the authors in [136] address
    the connectivity preservation between multiple leaders and multiple followers.
    The robot system is definitely connected if any two robots are connected via a
    direct link or multi-hop link. To express the connectivity in such a robot system,
    the authors introduce the concept of algebraic connectivity [137] which is the
    second smallest eigenvalue of a Laplacian matrix. The robot system is connected
    if the algebraic connectivity of the system is positive. Thus, the problem is
    to adjust the velocity of the followers such that the algebraic connectivity is
    positive over time slots. This problem can be formulated as an MDP in which the
    agent is the ground BS, the state is a combination of the states of all robots,
    the action is a set of possible velocity values for the followers. The reward
    is +1 if the algebraic connectivity of the system increases or holds, and becomes
    a penalty of −1 if the algebraic connectivity decreases. Similar to [135], a DQN
    is adopted. Due to the large action space of the followers, the actor-critic neural
    network [31] is used. The simulation results show that the followers always follow
    the motion of the leaders even if the leaders’ trajectory dynamically changes.
    This demonstrates the capability of DQN to tackle the connectivity preservation
    problem for multi-robot systems. However, the proposed DQN requires more time
    to converge than that in [135] because of the presence of more followers. The
    proposed schemes in [135] and [136] do not consider a minimum distance between
    the leaders and followers. The leaders and followers can collide with each other
    if the distance between them is too short. Thus, the BS needs to guarantee the
    minimum distance between them. One solution is to have the minimum distance in
    the reward as proposed in [138]. In particular, if the leader is too close to
    its follower, the reward of the system is penalized regarding the minimum distance.
    The DQL algorithm proposed in [136] is then used such that the BS learns proper
    actions, e.g., turning left and right, to maximize the cumulative reward. When
    BSs are densely deployed, the UAVs or mobile users need to trigger a frequent
    handover to preserve the connectivity. The frequent handover increases communication
    overhead and energy consumption of the mobile users, and interrupts data flows.
    Thus, it is essential to maintain an appropriate handover rate. The authors in
    [32] address the handover decision problem in an ultra-density network. The network
    model consists of multiple mobile users, SBSs, and one central controller. At
    each time slot, the user needs to decide its serving SBS. The handover decision
    process can be modeled as an MDP, and the DQL is adopted to find an optimal handover
    policy for each user to minimize the number of handover occurrences while ensuring
    certain throughput. The state of the user, i.e., the agent, includes reference
    signal quality received from candidate SBSs and the last action of the user. The
    reward is defined as the difference between the data rate of the user and its
    energy consumption for the handover process. Given a high density of users, the
    DQL using A3C and LSTM is adopted to find the optimal policy in short training
    time. The simulation results show that the proposed DQL can achieve higher throughput
    and lower handover rate than those of the upper confidence bandit algorithm [139]
    with similar training time. Specifically, the throughput and the handover rate
    of the DQL are 0.7 bit/s/Hz and 0.0003, respectively, while those of the upper
    confidence bandit algorithm are 0.67 bit/s/Hz and 0.00049, respectively. To enhance
    the reliability of the communication between the SBSs and the mobile users, the
    SBSs should be able to handle network faults and failure automatically as self-healing.
    The DQL can be applied as proposed in [140] to make optimal parameter adjustments
    based on the observation of the network performance. The model is the 5G network
    including one MBS. The MBS as an agent needs to handle network faults such as
    transmit diversity faults and antenna azimuth change, e.g., because of wind. These
    faults are represented as the MBS’s state that is the number of active alarms.
    Based on the alarms, the MBS can take actions including (i) enabling the transmit
    diversity and (ii) setting the antenna azimuth to default value. The reward that
    the MBS receives is the scores, e.g., −1, 0, and +1, depending on the number of
    faults happening. The DQL is used to learn the optimal policy. The simulation
    results show that the proposed DQL can achieve network throughput close to that
    of the oracle-based self-healing, i.e., the upper-performance bound, but incurs
    less fault message passing overhead. In particular, the message passing complexity
    of the proposed DQL is O ( N ), and that of the oracle-based self-healing is O(
    N 2 ) , where N is the number of SBSs in the network. Summary: This section reviews
    applications of DQL for the network security and connectivity preservation. The
    reviewed approaches are summarized along with the references in Table VI. We observe
    that the CNN is mostly used for the DQL to enhance the network security. Moreover,
    DQL approaches for the anonymous system such as robot systems and ITS receive
    more attentions than other networks. However, the applications of DQL for the
    cyber-physical security are relatively few and need to be investigated. TABLE

    VI. Miscellaneous Issues In previous sections, we have reviewed and analyzed the
    applications of DRL framework in different aspects (with different technological
    focuses) of communications and networking, i.e., network access and rate control,
    caching and offloading, security and connectivity preservation. However, the optimization
    of communications and networking actually involves cross-layer co-design and interactions
    among different network entities. For example, the traffic engineering problem
    may require joint optimization of routing, transmit power control, channel access
    control, resource allocation and so on. The problem can become more complicated
    for the emerging communications systems, e.g., UAV and vehicular networks. In
    this section, we review the other uses of DRL in communications and networking.
    These issues include (i) traffic engineering and routing, (ii) resource sharing
    and scheduling, and (iii) crowdsensing and social networking. Due to its model-free
    nature, DRL provides a flexible tool for dynamic and diversified applications,
    typically involving high-dimensional, cross-layer, and multi-agent interactions.
    All these imply a huge space of state transitions and actions. A. Traffic Engineering
    and Routing Traffic Engineering (TE) in communication networks refers to Network
    Utility Maximization (NUM) by optimizing a path to forward the data traffic, given
    a set of network flows from source to destination nodes. Traditional NUM problems
    are mostly model-based. However, with the advances of wireless communication technologies,
    the network environment becomes more complicated and dynamic, which makes it hard
    to model, predict, and control. The recent development of DQL methods provides
    a feasible and efficient way to design experience-driven and model-free schemes
    that can learn and adapt to the dynamic wireless network from past observations.
    Routing optimization is one of the major control problems in traffic engineering.
    The authors in [141] present the first attempt to use the DQL for the routing
    optimization. Through the interaction with the network environment, the DQL agent
    at the network controller determines the paths for all source-destination pairs.
    The system state is represented by the bandwidth request between each source-destination
    pair, and the reward is a function of the mean network delay. The DQL agent leverages
    the actor-critic method for solving the routing problem that minimizes the network
    delay, by adapting routing configurations automatically to current traffic conditions.
    The DQL agent is trained using the traffic information generated by a gravity
    model [142]. The routing solution is then evaluated by OMNet+ discrete event simulator
    [143]. Simulation results show that the well-trained DQL agent can produce a near-optimal
    routing configuration in a single step and thus the agent is agile for real-time
    network control. The proposed approach is attractive as the traditional optimization-based
    techniques require a large number of steps to produce a new configuration. The
    authors in [144] consider a similar network model with multiple end-to-end communication
    sessions. Each source-destination pair has a set of candidate paths that can transport
    the traffic load. Experimental results show that the conventional DDPG method
    does not work well for the continuous control problem in [144]. One possible explanation
    is that DDPG utilizes uniform sampling for experience replay, which ignores different
    significance of the transition samples. The authors in [144] also combine two
    new techniques to optimize DDPG particularly for traffic engineering problems,
    i.e., TE-aware exploration and actor-critic-based PER methods. The TE-aware exploration
    leverages the shortest path algorithm and NUM-based solution as the baseline during
    exploration. The PER method is conventionally used in DQL, e.g., [87] and [117],
    while the authors in [144] integrate the PER method with the actor-critic framework
    for the first time. The proposed scheme assigns different priorities to transitions
    in the experience replay. Based on the priority, the proposed scheme samples the
    transitions in each epoch. The system state consists of throughput and delay performance
    of each communication session. The action specifies the amount of traffic load
    going through each of the paths. By learning the dynamics of network environment,
    the DQL agent aims to maximize the total utility of all the communication sessions,
    which is defined based on end-to-end throughput and delay [145]. Packet-level
    simulations using NS-3 [146], tested on well-known network topologies as well
    as random topologies generated by BRITE [147], reveal that the proposed DQL scheme
    significantly reduces the end-to-end delay and improves the network utility, compared
    with the baseline schemes including DDPG and the NUM-based solutions. The networking
    and routing optimization become more complicated in the UAV-based wireless communications.
    The authors in [138] model autonomous navigation of one single UAV in a large-scale
    unknown complex environment as a POMDP, which can be solved by actor-critic-based
    DRL method. The system state includes its distances and orientation angles to
    nearby obstacles, the distance and angle between its present position and the
    destination. The UAV’s action is to turn left or right or keep ahead. The reward
    is composed of four parts: an exponential penalty term if it is too close to any
    obstacles, a linear penalty term to encourage minimum time delay, the transition
    and direction rewards if the UAV is getting close to the target position in a
    proper direction. Instead of using conventional DDPG for continuous control, the
    Recurrent Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG) is proposed for the POMDP by approximating
    the actor and critic using RNNs. Considering that RDPG is not suitable for learning
    using memory replay, the authors in [138] propose the fast-RDPG method by utilizing
    the actor-critic framework with function approximation [148]. The proposed method
    derives policy update for POMDP by directly maximizing the expected long-term
    accumulated discounted reward. Path planning for multiple UAVs connected via cellular
    systems is studied in [149] and [150]. Each UAV aims to achieve a tradeoff between
    maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing both latency and interference caused
    to the ground network along its path. The network state observable by each UAV
    includes its distances and orientation angles to cellular BSs, the orientation
    angle to its destination, and the horizontal coordinates of all UAVs. The action
    of each UAV includes an optimal path, transmit power, and cell association along
    its path. The interaction among UAVs is cast as a dynamic game and solved by a
    multi-agent DRL framework. The use of ESN in the DRL framework allows each UAV
    to retain previous memory states and make a decision for unseen network states,
    based on the reward obtained from previous states. ESN is a new type of RNNs with
    feedback connections, consisting of the input, recurrent, and output weight matrices.
    ESN training is typically quick and computationally efficient compared with other
    RNNs. Deep ESNs can exploit the advantages of a hierarchical temporal feature
    representation at different levels of abstraction, hence disentangling the difficulties
    in modeling complex tasks. The analysis shows that the computational complexity
    of the proposed DRL is O( A 3 ) , where A is the number of discretized areas.
    Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the tradeoff between
    energy efficiency, wireless latency, and the interference caused to the ground
    network. Results also show that each UAV’s altitude is a function of the ground
    network density and the UAV’s objective function is an important factor in achieving
    the UAV’s target. Besides networked UAVs, vehicle-to-infrastructure also constitutes
    an important part and provides rich application implications in 5G ecosystem.
    The authors in [151] adopt the DQL to achieve an optimal control policy in communication-based
    train control system, which is supported by bidirectional train-ground communications.
    The control problem aims to optimize the handoff decision and train control policy,
    i.e., accelerate or decelerate, based on the states of stochastic channel conditions
    and real-time information including train position, speed, measured SNR from APs,
    and handoff indicator. The objective of the DQL agent is to minimize a weighted
    combination of operation profile tracking error and energy consumption. B. Resource
    Sharing and Scheduling System capacity is one of the most important performance
    metrics in wireless communication networks. System capacity enhancements can be
    based on the optimization of resource sharing and scheduling among multiple wireless
    nodes. The integration of DRL into 5G systems would revolutionize the resource
    sharing and scheduling schemes from model-based to model-free approaches and meet
    various application demands by learning from the network environment. The authors
    in [152] study the user scheduling in a multi-user massive MIMO system. User scheduling
    is responsible for allocating resource blocks to BSs and mobile users, taking
    into account the channel conditions and QoS requirements. Based on this user scheduling
    strategy, a DRL-based coverage and capacity optimization is proposed to obtain
    dynamically the scheduling parameters and a unified threshold of QoS metric. The
    performance indicators are calculated as the average spectrum efficiency of all
    the users. The system state is an indicator of the average spectrum efficiency.
    The action of the scheduler is a set of scheduling parameters to maximize the
    reward as a function of the average spectrum efficiency. The DRL scheme uses policy
    gradient method to learn a policy function (instead of a Q-function) directly
    from trajectories generated by the current policy. The policy network is trained
    with a variant of the REINFORCE algorithm [148]. The simulation results in [152]
    show that compared with the optimization-based algorithms that suffer from incomplete
    network information, the policy gradient method achieves much better performance
    in terms of network coverage and capacity. In [153], the authors focus on dynamic
    resource allocation in a cloud radio access network and present a DQL-based framework
    to minimize the total power consumption while fulfilling mobile users’ QoS requirements.
    The system model contains multiple Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) connected to a cloud
    BaseBand Unit (BBU). The information of RRHs can be shared in a centralized manner.
    The system state contains information about the mobile users’ demands and the
    RRHs’ working states, e.g., active or sleep. According to the system state and
    the result of last execution, the DQL agent at the BBU decides whether to turn
    on or off certain RRH(s), and how to allocate beamforming weight for each active
    RRH. The objective is to minimize the total expected power consumption. The authors
    propose a two-step decision framework to reduce the size of action space. In the
    first step, the DQL agent determines the set of active RRHs by Q-learning and
    DNNs. In the second step, the BBU derives the optimal resource allocation for
    the active RRHs by solving a convex optimization problem. Through the combination
    of DQL and optimization techniques, the proposed framework results in a relatively
    small action space and low online computational complexity. Simulation results
    show that the framework achieves significant power savings while satisfying user
    demands and is robust in highly dynamic network environment. The aforementioned
    works mostly focus on simulations and numerical comparisons. With one step further,
    the authors in [154] implement a multi-objective DQL framework as the radio-resource-allocation
    controller for space communications. The implementation uses modular software
    architecture to encourage re-use and easy modification for different algorithms,
    which is integrated into the real space-ground system developed by NASA Glenn
    Research Center. In emerging and future wireless networks, BSs are deployed with
    a high density that introduces a number of challenges to resource management such
    as the power allocation and interference management. Traditional power allocation
    approaches, e.g., the iterative algorithm based on closed-form factional programming
    [155] can be used. However, the approaches always require full CSI that may be
    not available as the networks become larger and more complicated. Learning algorithms
    such as DRL can be used for the power allocation. The authors in [156] propose
    to use a DQL scheme which allows the BSs to learn their optimal power control
    policy. In the proposed scheme, each BS is an agent, the action is choosing power
    levels, and the state includes interference that the BS caused to its neighbors
    in the last time slot. The objective is to maximize the BS’s data rate. The DQN
    using FNN is then adopted to implement the DQL algorithm. The DQN using FNN is
    then adopted to implement the DQL algorithm. In the simulation, the authors model
    the channel variations in the Jake’s model. With random CSI and delay, the DQL
    algorithm is shown to achieve near-optimal power allocation in real time. In certain
    scenarios, it even outperforms the centralized algorithms. This verifies that
    the DQL algorithm can be fast and competitive, especially for the scenarios with
    inaccurate CSI and non-negligible delay. For the future work, a joint power control
    and channel selection can be considered. Network slicing [157] and NFV [97] are
    two emerging concepts for resource allocation in the 5G ecosystem to provide cost-effective
    services with better performance. The network infrastructure, e.g., cache, computation,
    and radio resources, is comparatively static while the upper-layer Virtualized
    Network Functions (VNFs) are dynamic to support time-varying application-specific
    service requests. The concept of network slicing is to divide the network resources
    into multi-layer slices, managed by different service renderers independently
    with minimal conflicts. The concept of Service Function Chaining (SFC) is to orchestrate
    different VNFs to provide required functionalities and QoS provisioning. The authors
    in [158] propose a DQL scheme for QoS/QoE-aware SFC in NFV-enabled 5G systems.
    Typical QoS metrics are bandwidth, delay, throughput, etc. The evaluation of QoE
    normally involves the end-user’s participation in rating the service based on
    direct user perception. The authors quantify QoE by measurable QoS metrics without
    end-user involvements, according to the Weber-Fechner Law (WFL) [159] and exponential
    interdependency of QoE and QoS hypothesis [160]. These two principles actually
    define nonlinear relationship between QoE and QoS. The system state represents
    the network environment including network topology, QoS/QoE status of the VNF
    instances, and the QoS requirements of the SFC request. The DQL agent selects
    a certain direct successive VNF instance as an action. The reward is a composite
    function of the QoE gain, the QoS constraint penalty, and the OPEX penalty. A
    DQL based on CNNs is implemented to approximate the action-value function. The
    authors in [161] review the application of a DQL framework in two typical resource
    management scenarios using network slicing. For radio resource slicing, the authors
    simulate a scenario containing one single BS with different types of services.
    Due to limited spectrum resource, the radio resource slicing aims to optimize
    the allocation of resource blocks to each slice. The reward can be defined as
    a weighted sum of spectrum efficiency and QoE. For priority-based core network
    slicing, the authors simulate a scenario with 3 SFCs demanding different computational
    resources and waiting time. The aim is to minimize the scheduling delay by optimizing
    the common or dedicated VNFs. The reward can be defined as a weighted sum of spectrum
    efficiency and QoE. For priority-based core network slicing, the authors simulate
    a scenario with 3 SFCs demanding different computational resources and waiting
    time. The reward is the sum of waiting time in different SFCs. Simulation results
    in both scenarios show that the DQL framework could exploit more implicit relationship
    between user activities and resource allocation in resource constrained scenarios,
    and enhance the effectiveness and agility for network slicing. Mobile data traffic
    is anticipated to significantly increase that may cause congestion at SBSs in
    5G wireless networks. The conventional technique adjusts the uplink-downlink ratio
    based on the current network traffic condition and lacks knowledge of future traffic
    patterns. The conventional technique is thus prone to repeated congestion. The
    deep learning technique based on LSTM can be used as proposed in [162] that allows
    the SBS to make local prediction of its traffic load based on the past and current
    traffic load. The input of the LSTM is the traffic information of the SBS in the
    past and current time slots, and the output is the traffic load predictions in
    the next time slots. Based on the prediction, the SBS proactively adjusts the
    uplink-downlink ratio to avoid the congestion. The simulation results show that
    the proposed scheme outperforms the conventional methods in terms of network throughput
    and packet loss rate. Resource allocation and scheduling problems are also important
    for computer clusters or database systems. This usually leads to an online decision-making
    problem depending on the information of workload and environment. The authors
    in [163] propose a DRL-based solution, DeepRM, by employing policy gradient methods
    [148] to manage resources in computer systems directly from experience. The same
    policy gradient method is also used in [152] for user scheduling and resource
    management in wireless systems. DeepRM is a multi-resource cluster scheduler that
    learns to optimize various objectives such as minimizing average job slowdown
    or completion time. The system state is the current allocation of cluster resources
    and the resource profiles of jobs in the queue. The action of the scheduler is
    to decide how to schedule the pending jobs. By simulations with synthetic dataset,
    DeepRM is shown to perform comparably or better than state-of-the-art heuristics,
    e.g., Shortest-Job-First (SJF). It adapts to different conditions and converges
    quickly, without any prior knowledge of system behavior. In [164], the authors
    use the actor-critic method to address the scheduling problem in a general-purpose
    distributed data stream processing systems, which deal with processing of continuous
    data flow in real time or near-real-time. The system model contains multiple threads,
    processes, and machines. The system state consists of the current scheduling decision
    and the workload of each data source. The scheduling problem is to assign each
    thread to a process of a machine. The agent at the scheduler determines the assignment
    of each thread, with the objective of minimizing the average processing time.
    The DRL framework includes three components, i.e., an actor network, an optimizer
    producing a K-NN set of the actor network’s output action, and the critic network
    predicting the Q-value for each action in the set. The action is selected from
    the K-NN set with the maximum Q-value. The use of optimizer may avoid unstable
    learning and divergence problems in conventional actor-critic methods [165]. Simulation
    results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the average processing time by
    25.1% compared to the default scheduler and 9% compared to the model-based method.
    C. Power Control and Data Collection With the prevalence of IoT and smart mobile
    devices, mobile crowdsensing becomes a cost-effective solution for network information
    collection to support more intelligent operations of wireless systems. The authors
    in [166] consider spectrum sensing and power control in non-cooperative cognitive
    radio networks. There is no information exchange between PUs and SUs. As such,
    the SU outsources the sensing task to a set of spatially distributed sensing devices
    to collect information about the PU’s power control strategy. The SU’s power control
    can be formulated as an MDP. The system state is determined by the Received Signal
    Strength (RSS) at individual sensing devices. The SU chooses its transmit power
    from the set of pre-specified power levels based on the current state. A reward
    is obtained if both primary and SUs can fulfill their SNR requirements. Considering
    the randomness in RSS measurements, the authors propose a DQL scheme for the SU
    to learn and adjust its transmit power. The DQL is then implemented by a DQN by
    using FNN. The simulation results show that the proposed DQL scheme is able to
    converge to a close-to-optimal solution. In massive MIMO networks, each base station
    is able to serve a number of users simultaneously. Thus, one critical problem
    is to allocate power to the users. To address the problem, the authors in [167]
    propose to use the deep learning. The model consists of multiple base stations
    that serve multiple users. The problem is to determine a power allocation vector
    for the users to maximize the global energy efficiency of the network. The global
    energy efficiency is generally proportional to the data rates of the users and
    inversely proportionally to their total power consumption. The FNN is trained
    in which the input includes the signals received at the users, and the output
    includes the predicted power allocation vector. The loss function is formulated
    from the predicted power allocation vector and the optimal power allocation vector.
    Here, the optimal power allocation vector is obtained off-line by using the Sequential
    Fractional Programming (SFP) algorithm [168]. The simulation results show that
    the proposed deep learning scheme can achieve the energy efficiency close to that
    of the SFP algorithm while using significantly less CPU time. Max-min fairness
    is also a performance metric in the massive MIMO network to enhance the channel
    capacity of the users. The authors in [169] adopt a deep learning model for the
    power allocation to achieve the objective. The model consists of multiple cells,
    and each cell consists of a base station that serves the base station’s users.
    The problem of the base station is to determine the power allocation vector for
    its serving users to achieve the max-min fairness. Here, the max-min fairness
    is a max-min optimization problem in which the objective function is the ergodic
    channel capacity of each user. The FNN is trained in which the input includes
    geographical positions of the users in the whole network and the output includes
    the predicted power allocation vector of the users served by the base station.
    The loss function is a function of the optimal power allocation vector and the
    predicted power allocation vector. In particular, the optimal power allocation
    vector is obtained by offline solving the base station’s optimization problem
    based on the traditional bisection approach [170]. The simulation results show
    that the proposed deep learning scheme matches well the Minimum Mean Square Error
    (MMSE) scheme [171] that is optimal but has high computational complexity. The
    authors in [172] leverage the DQL framework for sensing and control problems in
    a Wireless Sensor and Actor Network (WSAN), which is a group of wireless devices
    with the ability to sense events and to perform actions based on the sensed data
    shared by all sensors. The system state includes processing power, mobility abilities,
    and functionalities of the actors and sensors. The mobile actor can choose its
    moving direction, networking, sensing and actuation policies to maximize the number
    of connected actor nodes and the number of sensing events. The authors in [173]
    focus on mobile crowdsensing paradigm, where data inference is incorporated to
    reduce sensing costs while maintaining the quality of sensing. The target sensing
    area is split into a set of cells. The objective of a sensing task is to collect
    data, e.g., temperature and air quality, in all the cells. Here, the sensed data
    from different cells of the target sensing area may has different quality. The
    problem for each sensor in the mobile crowdsensing paradigm is how to choose cells
    to collect data to minimize the sensing cost while guaranteeing the sensing data
    quality. The optimal cell selection algorithms, e.g., [174], need to know the
    true data of each cell in advance that is usually impossible in practice. DQL
    is able to provide optimal decisions without a complete knowledge of the true
    data. Thus, it can be adopted for the cell selection of the mobile sensors to
    decide which cell is better to perform sensing tasks. The system state includes
    the selection matrices for a few past decision epochs. The reward function is
    determined by the sensing quality and cost in the chosen cells. To extract temporal
    correlations in learning, the authors propose the DRQN that uses LSTM layers in
    DQL to capture the hidden patterns in state transitions. Considering inter-data
    correlations, the authors use the transfer learning method to reduce the amount
    of data in training. That is, the cell selection strategy learned for one task
    can benefit another correlated task. Hence, the parameters of DRQN can be initialized
    by another DRQN with rich training data. Simulations are conducted based on two
    real-life datasets collected from sensor networks, i.e., the Sensor-Scope dataset
    [175] in the EPFL campus and the U-Air dataset of air quality readings in Beijing
    [176]. The experiments verify that DRQN reduces up to 15% of the sensed cells
    with the same inference quality guarantee. The authors in [177] combine UAV and
    unmanned vehicle in mobile crowdsensing for smart city applications. The UAV cruises
    in the above of the target region for city-level data collection. Meanwhile, the
    unmanned vehicle carrying mobile charging stations moves on the ground and can
    charge the UAV at a preset charging point. The target region is divided into multiple
    subregions and each subregion has a different sample priority. The authors in
    [177] propose a DQL-based control framework for the unmanned vehicle to schedule
    its data collection, constrained by limited energy supply. The system state includes
    information about the sample priority of each subregion, the location of charging
    point, and the moving trace of the UAV and unmanned vehicle. The UAV and unmanned
    vehicle can choose the moving direction. The DQL framework utilizes CNNs for extracting
    the correlation of adjacent subregions, which can increase the convergence speed
    in training. The DQL algorithm can be enhanced by using a feasible control solution
    as the baseline during exploration. The PER method is also used in DQL to assign
    higher priorities to important transitions so that the DQL agent can learn from
    samples more efficiently. The proposed scheme is evaluated by using real dataset
    of taxi traces in Rome [178]. Simulation results reveal that the proposed DQL
    algorithm can obtain the highest data collection rate compared with the MDP and
    other heuristic baselines. Mobile crowdsensing is vulnerable to faked sensing
    attacks, as selfish users may report faked sensing results to save their sensing
    costs and avoid compromising their privacy. The authors in [179] formulate the
    interactions between the server and a number of crowdsensing users as a Stackelberg
    game. The server is the leader that sets and broadcasts its payment policy for
    different sensing accuracy. In particular, the higher payment is set for more
    sensing accuracy. Based on the server’s sensing policy, each user as a follower
    then chooses its sensing effort and thus the sensing accuracy to receive the payment.
    The payment motivates the users to put in sensing efforts, and thus the payment
    decision process can be modeled as an MDP. The server can apply Q-learning to
    optimize payment policy without requiring the sensing model. However, in the presence
    of a large state space, Q-learning has a slow learning rate. Therefore, the server
    can use the DQL to obtain the optimal payment to maximize its utility, based on
    the system state consisting of the past sensing quality and the payment policy.
    The DQL uses a deep CNN to accelerate the learning process and improve the crowdsensing
    performance against selfish users. Simulation results show that the DQL-based
    scheme produces a higher sensing quality, lower attack rate, and higher utility
    of the server, exceeding those of both the Q-learning and the random payment strategies.
    Moreover, the DQL-based scheme can converge at 200 time slots that is 225% faster
    than that of the Q-learning. Social networking is an important component of smart
    city applications. The authors in [180] aim to extract useful information by observing
    and analyzing the users’ behaviors in social networking. One of the main difficulties
    is that the social behaviors are usually fuzzy and divergent. The authors model
    pervasive social networking as a monopolistically competitive market, which contains
    different users as data providers selling information at a certain price. Given
    the market model, the DQL can be used to estimate the users’ behavior patterns
    and find the market equilibrium. Considering the costly deep learning structure,
    the authors in [180] propose a Decentralized DRL (DDRL) framework that decomposes
    the costly deep component from the RL algorithms at individual users. The deep
    component can be a feature extractor integrated with the network infrastructure
    and provide mutual knowledge for all individuals. Multiple RL agents can purchase
    the most desirable data from the mutual knowledge. The authors combine well-known
    RL algorithms, i.e., Q-learning and learning automata, to estimate users’ patterns
    which are described by vectors of probabilities representing the users’ preferences
    or altitudes to different information. In social networking and smart city applications
    with human involvement, there can be both labeled and unlabeled data and hence
    a semi-supervised DRL framework can be designed, by combining the strengths of
    DNNs and statistical modeling to improve the performance and accuracy in learning.
    Then, the authors in [181] introduce the semi-supervised DRL framework that utilizes
    variational auto-encoders [182] as an inference engine to infer the classification
    of unlabeled data. As a case study, the proposed DRL framework is customized to
    provide indoor localization based on the RSS from Bluetooth devices. The positioning
    environment contains a set of positions. Each position is associated with the
    set of RSS values from the set of anchor devices with known positions. The system
    state includes a vector of RSS values, the current location, and the distance
    to the target. The DQL agent, i.e., the positioning algorithm itself, chooses
    a moving direction to minimize the error distance to the target point. Simulations
    tested on real-world dataset show an improvement of 23% in terms of the error
    distance to the target compared with the supervised DRL scheme. D. Direction-of-Arrival
    (DoA) Estimation Massive MIMO will be deployed for 5G to achieve high-speed communications
    at Gbps. For this, the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation is the prerequisite
    for realizing massive MIMO. However, the required DoA estimation is very challenging
    since it is difficult to exploit the characteristics of the channel and sparsity
    of the massive MIMO systems. Deep learning is able to learn useful features, and
    it can be used for the DoA estimation as proposed in [183]. In particular, the
    DNN is trained based on a training dataset including DoAs and received signals.
    The DoAs are randomly generated, and the received signals are obtained by using
    different wireless channel models. The input of the DNN includes the DoAs and
    the received signals, and the output includes the estimated DoAs. The simulation
    results show that the high accuracy of the DoA estimation can be achieved with
    a mean square error of 10−3. E. Signal Detection Apart from improving the accuracy
    of the DoA estimation, enhancing the accuracy of the symbol detection needs to
    be considered to reduce Bit Error Ratio (BER). The authors in [184] propose to
    use the deep learning for the symbol detection in OFDM systems. Specifically,
    the DNN is used in which the input includes each pair of pilot symbol and the
    corresponding received signal. The output of the DNN includes the predicted pilot
    symbol. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the least
    square technique in terms of BER. These results imply that the DNN can learn the
    characteristics of the wireless channel accurately. F. User Association and Load
    Balancing In the complicated future networks such as HetNets and massive MIMO,
    user association is one of critical problems to assign users to base stations
    to maximize the total data rate. The existing approaches generally incur a considerable
    complexity overhead that impairs the real-time user association. Thus, deep learning
    can be used to perform the user association in real-time in realistic massive
    MIMO networks as proposed in [185]. The model is similar to that in [169]. The
    problem is to determine the user-association vector to maximize the total data
    rate of all users in the network. The FNN is trained to output the user association
    vector given the user positions. The training set consists of multiple pairs of
    user positions and optimal user association vector. Here, the optimal association
    vector is obtained offline by using the branch-and-cut algorithm [186]. Simulation
    results show that the total data rate obtained by the deep learning scheme is
    close to that obtained by the optimal user association scheme from [171]. This
    implies that the structure of the optimal association can be learned by the deep
    learning. G. User Localization Channel State Information (CSI) has been recently
    used for the user localization since the CSI values contain information related
    to locations of the users. However, in the complicated wireless networks such
    as massive MIMO, measuring the wireless channel characteristics, i.e., the CSI
    values, is challenging. Deep learning that is able to learn useful features from
    complicated environments can be used for the user localization as proposed in
    [187]. The deep learning algorithm consists of two phases, i.e., the offline training
    phase and online localization phase. In the offline training phase, a mobile device
    transmits packets from known locations to a base station. At each location, the
    base station measures the corresponding CSI values. The measured CSI values as
    a fingerprint of the location are used to train the FNN. The input of the FNN
    includes the measured CSI values, and the output includes the reconstructed CSI
    values. The gready learning algorithm [188] is used to train the FNN that minimizes
    the error between the measured CSI values and the reconstructed CSI values. In
    the online localization phase, the reconstructed CSI values are used to estimate
    the location of the mobile device based on the probabilistic methods. Simulation
    results show that with the proposed deep learning algorithm, 60% of the positions
    in the test have errors under 1m, while the baseline algorithm [189] only ensures
    that 25% of the tested positions have errors under 1m. The FNN can work well as
    the number of CSI values is small. However, it may be computationally intractable
    with a large number of CSI values. To address the issue, CNNs can be used to learn
    the features of the wireless channels for the user localization as proposed in
    [190]. However, CNN is suitable to process inputs with grid-like structures, e.g.,
    an image. Therefore, the CSI values must be first transformed into so-called channel
    snapshots. Then, the CNN is trained to output the user locations given the channel
    snapshots. The analysis shows that the overall complexity of the proposed CNN
    algorithm is O( K 2 ML N F S 1 S 2 ) , where K is the number of convolution Kernels,
    L is the number of convolutional-activation-pooling layers, M is the number of
    the base station’s antennas, N F is the number of frequency points, and S 1 and
    S 2 are the sizes of the Kernels, respectively. As such, the complexity does not
    depend on the training set size that is one main advantage of using the CNN for
    the user localization. H. Access Device Detection Massive Machine-Type Communication
    (mMTC) is expected to be one of key technologies in 5G. mMTC enables tens of billions
    of machine-type devices to communicate with each other with high availability,
    low latency, and high reliability. However, the mMTC systems only allow the devices
    to transmit small packets with minimum signaling overhead. Thus, it is challenging
    for the base stations to detect and identify active devices, i.e., devices to
    access the base stations. The traditional detection algorithms such as iterative
    algorithm [191] can be used. However, they fail to consider the time constraints.
    Deep learning that is able to provide online decisions can be an alternative solution
    as proposed in [192]. The system model consists of a base station and multiple
    machine-type devices. Each device is assigned with a unique pilot sequence. The
    signal received at the base station is the sum of signals transmitted from active
    users. Given the received signal, the base station needs to determine which users
    are active. The base station uses the FNN in which the input is the received signal,
    and the output contains the user activity matrix. The FNN is trained in which
    the training data is randomly generated and the loss function is formulated from
    the received signal, the user activity matrix and the channel estimations of the
    users, and the pilot matrix of the users. Simulation results show that the proposed
    deep learning scheme outperforms the traditional iterative algorithm from [191]
    in terms of active user detection success rate. Summary: In this section, we review
    miscellaneous uses of DRL in wireless and networked systems. DRL provides a flexible
    tool in rich and diversified applications, conventionally involving dynamic system
    modeling and multi-agent interactions. All these imply a huge space of state transitions
    and actions. These approaches are summarized along with the references in Table
    VII. We observe that the NUM problems in 5G ecosystem for traffic engineering
    and resource allocation face very diversified control variables, including discrete
    indicators, e.g., for BS (de)activation, user/cell association, and path selection,
    as well as continuous variables such as bandwidth allocation, transmit power,
    and beamforming optimization. Hence, both DQL and policy gradient methods are
    used extensively for discrete and continuous control problems, respectively. TABLE
    VII A Summary of Applications of DQL for Traffic Engineering, Resource Scheduling,
    and Data Collection SECTION VII. Challenges, Open Issues, and Future Research
    Directions Different approaches reviewed in this survey evidently show that DRL
    can effectively address various emerging issues in communications and networking.
    There are existing challenges, open issues, and new research directions which
    are discussed as follows. A. Challenges 1) State Determination in Density Networks:
    The DRL approaches, e.g., [28], allow the users to find an optimal access policy
    without having complete and/or accurate network information. However, the DRL
    approaches often require the users to report their local states at every time
    slot. To observe the local state, the user needs to monitor Received Signal Strength
    Indicators (RSSIs) from its neighboring BSs, and then it temporarily connects
    to the BS with the maximum RSSI. However, the future networks will deploy a high
    density of the BSs, and the RSSIs from different BSs may not be different. Thus,
    it is challenging for the users to determine the temporary BS [193]. 2) Knowledge
    of Jammers’ Channel Information: The DRL approach for wireless security as proposed
    in [126] enables the UAV to find optimal transmit power levels to maximize the
    security capacity of the UAV and the BS. However, to formulate the reward of the
    UAV, a perfect knowledge of channel information of the jammers is required. This
    is challenging and even impossible in practice. 3) Multi-Agent DRL in Dynamic
    HetNets: Most of the existing works focus on the customizations of DRL framework
    for individual network entities, based on locally observed or exchanged network
    information. Hopefully, the network environment is relatively static to ensure
    convergent learning results and stable policies. This requirement may be challenged
    in a dynamic heterogenous 5G network, which consists of hierarchically nested
    IoT devices/networks with fast changing service requirements and networking conditions.
    In such a situation, the DQL agents for individual entities have to be light-weighted
    and agile to the change of network conditions. This implies a reduce to the state
    and action spaces in learning, which however may compromise the performance of
    the convergent policy. The interactions among multiple agents also complicate
    the network environment and cause a considerable increase to the state space,
    which inevitably slows down the learning algorithms. 4) Training and Performance
    Evaluation of DRL Framework: The DRL framework requires large amounts of data
    for both training and performance evaluation. In wireless systems, such data is
    not easily accessible as we rarely have referential data pools as other deep learning
    scenarios, e.g., computer vision. Most of the existing works rely on simulated
    dataset, which undermines the confidence of the DRL framework in practical system.
    The simulated data set is usually generated by a specific stochastic model, which
    is a simplification of the real system and may overlook the hidden patterns. Hence,
    a more effective way for generating simulation data is required to ensure that
    the training and performance evaluation of the DRL framework are more consistent
    with practical system. B. Open Issues 1) Distributed DRL Framework in Wireless
    Networks: The DRL framework requires large amounts of training for DNNs. This
    may be implemented at a centralized network controller, which has sufficient computational
    capacity and the capability for information collection. However, for massive end
    users with limited capabilities, it becomes a meaningful task to design distributed
    implementation for the DRL framework that decomposes resource-demanding basic
    functionalities, e.g., information collection, sharing, and DNN training, from
    reinforcement learning algorithms at individual devices. The basic functionalities
    can be integrated with the network controller. It remains an open issue for the
    design of network infrastructure that supports these common functionalities for
    distributed DRL. The overhead of information exchange between end users and network
    controller also has to be well controlled. 2) Balance Between Information Quality
    and Learning Performance: The majority of the existing works consider the orchestration
    of networking, transmission control, offloading, and caching decisions in one
    DRL framework to derive the optimal policy, e.g., [91]–[96], [98], [99]. However,
    from a practical viewpoint, the network system will have to pay substantially
    increasing cost for information gathering. The cost is incurred from large delay,
    pre-processing of asynchronous information, excessive energy consumption, reduced
    learning speed, etc. Hence, an open issue is to find the optimal balance between
    information quality and learning performance so that the DQL agent does not consume
    too much resources only to achieve insignificantly marginal increase in the learning
    performance. C. Future Research Directions 1) DRL for Channel Estimation in Wireless
    Systems: We expect that the combination of Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) and Mobile
    Crowd Sensing (MCS), namely Wireless-Powered Crowd Sensing (WPCS) will be a promising
    technique for the emerging IoT services. To this end, a higher power transfer
    efficiency of WPT is very critical to enable the deployment of WPCS in low-power
    wide area network. A “large-scale array antenna based WPT” will achieve this goal
    of higher WPT efficiency, but the channel estimation should be performed with
    minimal power consumption at a sensor node. This is because of that the sensor
    must operate with self-powering via WPT from the dedicated energy source, e.g.,
    power beacon, Wi-Fi or small-cell access point, and/or ambient RF sources, e.g.,
    TV tower, Wi-Fi AP and cellular BS. In this regard, the channel estimation based
    on the receive power measurements at the sensor node is one viable solution, because
    the receive power can be measured by the passive-circuit power meter with negligible
    power consumption. DRL can be used for the time-varying wireless channels with
    temporal correlations over time by taking the receive power measurements from
    the sensor node as the input for DRL, which will enable the channel estimation
    for WPT efficiently. 2) DRL for Crowdsensing Service Optimization: In MCS, mobile
    users contribute sensing data to a crowdsensing service provider and receive an
    incentive in return. However, due to limited resources, e.g., bandwidth and energy,
    the mobile user has to decide on whether and how much data to be uploaded to the
    provider. Likewise, the provider aiming to maximize its profit has to determine
    the amount of incentive to be given. The provider’s decision depends on the actions
    of the mobile users. For example, with many mobile users contributing data to
    the crowdsensing service provider, the provider can lower the incentive. Due to
    a large state space of a large number of users and dynamic environment, DRL can
    be applied to obtain an optimal crowdsensing policy similar to [194]. 3) DRL for
    Cryptocurrency Management in Wireless Networks: Pricing and economic models have
    been widely applied to wireless networks [195], [196]. For example, wireless users
    pay money to access radio resources or mobile services. Alternatively, the users
    can receive money if they contribute to the networks, e.g., offering a relay or
    cache function. However, using real money and cash in such scenarios faces many
    issues related to accounting, security, and privacy. Recently, the concept of
    cryptocurrency based on the blockchain technology has been introduced and adopted
    in wireless networks, e.g., [197], which has been shown to be a secure and efficient
    solution. However, the value of cryptocurrency, i.e., token or coin, can be highly
    dynamic depending on many market factors. The wireless users possessing the tokens
    can decide to keep or spend the tokens, e.g., for radio resource access and service
    usage or exchange into real money. In the random cryptocurrency market environment,
    DRL can be applied to achieve the maximum long-term reward of the cryptocurrency
    management for wireless users as in [198]. 4) DRL for Auction: An auction has
    been effectively used for radio resource management, e.g., spectrum allocation
    [199]. However, obtaining the solution of the auction, e.g., a winner determination
    problem, can be complicated and intractable when the number of participants, i.e.,
    bidders and sellers, become very large. Such a scenario is typical in next-generation
    wireless networks such as 5G highly-dense heterogeneous networks. DRL appears
    to be an efficient approach for solving different types of auctions such as in
    [200]. SECTION VIII. Conclusions This paper has presented a comprehensive survey
    of the applications of deep reinforcement learning to communications and networking.
    First, we have presented an overview of reinforcement learning, deep learning,
    and deep reinforcement learning. Then, we have introduced various deep reinforcement
    learning techniques and their extensions. Afterwards, we have provided detailed
    reviews, analyses, and comparisons of the deep reinforcement learning to solve
    different issues in communications and networking. The issues include dynamic
    network access, data rate control, wireless caching, data offloading, network
    security, connectivity preservation, traffic routing, and data collection. Finally,
    we have outlined important challenges, open issues as well as future research
    directions. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes More

    various problems and challenges. In particular, modern networks such as Internet
    of Things (IoT), Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
    (UAV) network become more decentralized, ad-hoc, and autonomous in nature. Network
    entities such as IoT devices, mobile users, and UAVs need to make local and autonomous
    decisions, e.g., spectrum access, data rate selection, transmit power control,
    and base station association, to achieve the goals of different networks including,

    of Things (IoT) provides connectivity to the objects that monitor and sense the
    environment to integrate physical world with digital world. If IoT is enabled
    in the Smart Grid (SG), it can benefit from advantages of the IoT such as interoperability,
    connectivity, etc. By combining the IoT with energy harvesting (EH) and cognitive
    radio (CR) techniques, the problems of SG, such as harsh channel conditions and
    limited battery power, may be resolved. Hence, incorporation of EH and CR reveals
    a new networking paradigm for IoT-enabled SG. To this end, we first introduce
    CR usage in the IoT-enabled SG, and explain the advantages and challenges of CRs.
    Furthermore, we propose EH approaches for the resource constraint of wireless
    devices in the IoT-enabled SG. Operation and node architecture of energy harvesting
    cognitive radios (EH-CR), and network architecture of the IoT-enabled SG are described
    to explain details of our networking paradigm. Open issues and future research
    directions are discussed to enable this new paradigm. Similar content being viewed

    at different IoT layers Article 10 May 2021 Internet of Things: Challenges and
    Opportunities Chapter © 2014 1 Introduction The IoT paradigm provides connectivity
    to objects for information exchange from one remote place to another via the Internet
    [1, 2]. These objects sense the physical world and harvest information about it,
    and send the harvested data to remote users via the Internet. It provides the
    accessibility of information from anywhere in anytime. These objects form interconnected
    networks that are self-configurable and intelligent. Hence, the IoT is utilized
    in a number of applications such as e-health monitoring, transportation, environment
    monitoring, and logistic management [3]. As the IoT extends the wireless communication
    by providing connectivity among the objects, SG supports evolution of electrical
    power system by the utilization of next generation communication techniques [4,
    5]. It paves the road for more agile grid with increased efficiency, reliability
    and security. The energy demand, aging infrastructure of the electric grid and
    varying energy production due to renewable energy resources are some challenges
    of the SG. Furthermore, it provides real-time remote monitoring of the SG equipments
    for power provisioning, estimating failures, capacity limitations and blackouts
    [4, 6]. This provides an effective monitoring of the electric grid and control
    for safe, reliable and efficient power delivery in the SG [7]. Wireless sensor
    networks are main components of the IoT, and they form a digital skin of the observed
    system. From this point of view, enabling the IoT in the SG is a fundamental step
    toward the realization of it. The SG can benefit from the application of the IoT
    technology since the IoT enables smart monitoring of the environment, which is
    the main goal of the SG. Utilization of the IoT provides efficient management
    of resources by smart meters, home gateways, smart plugs and connected appliances
    via the Internet since it ensures efficient communication between consumers and
    utility providers, which provides efficiency in energy production and consumption
    [8]. Satisfaction of consumers’ requirements and energy production from alternative
    resources cause a very dynamic environment and require efficient management of
    the electric grid. Autonomous monitoring, diagnosis and control, and efficient
    operation of the power equipments for the power generation, and distribution require
    monitoring and actuating devices [9]. Hence, the inclusion of the IoT in the SG
    is important. This will increase the utilization of information and communication
    technologies in the SG and provide effective management of power grid system [10].
    Empowering the SG with the IoT technology will lead a new paradigm, i.e., IoT-enabled
    SG. An IoT-enabled SG architecture can be seen in Fig. 1, which shows that the
    elements of the SG communicate over the Internet. The nodes, which are named as
    energy harvesting cognitive radios (EH-CR) in sequel, are our IoT wireless devices,
    and they access the Internet via access point. The condition of power grid elements,
    their energy production, the consumption of the energy are observed and measured
    via the IoT devices. The observations and measurements are sent over multiple
    hops to reach the Internet gateway, i.e., access point, to send them to remote
    areas for necessary actions to be taken in the IoT-enabled SG. Power consumption
    in industrial, commercial and residential sites can be monitored, and the power
    generated by renewable energy resources can be observed in real time via the Internet.
    For this architecture, SG benefits from the advantages of IoT, which are support
    for the communication of heterogeneous wireless devices, flexibility and context-awareness.
    This provides also better management of the grid with the Internet connection
    between SG components, which increases accessibility. Fig. 1 IoT-enabled SG Architecture
    Full size image Enabling wireless technologies for the communication across the
    Internet are Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, and satellite [11]. On the other hand, the standards
    used in the IoT environments are IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.15.4 for local areas.
    Hence, IoT devices to realize the SG operate mostly on ISM bands. However, these
    bands are heavily utilized. The over-utilization decreases the communication quality
    and increases the energy consumption of the resource-constrained wireless devices
    in the SG due to collisions. Furthermore, communication links have high packet
    error rates and variable link capacity due to the SG specific challenges such
    as electromagnetic interferences and equipment noise [9, 12, 13]. Hence, the channel
    conditions are generally harsh in the SG environment [14], which results in a
    dynamic delay and capacity variations in the SG networks. To overcome these challenges,
    CR technology can be utilized in the SG applications [15] so that the IoT nodes
    in the SG can access spectrum bands, which have better channel characteristics,
    in a dynamic manner. CR has special functionalities, which enables it to utilize
    licensed bands opportunistically, are spectrum sensing, spectrum decision and
    spectrum hand-off [16]. With the spectrum sensing, idle licensed channels are
    determined. Afterwards, CR can resolve the problems of spatio-temporal variation
    on the channel characteristics, reliability, latency, harsh propagation conditions
    and collisions due to excessive use of certain channels by utilizing idle licensed
    channels [9]. Wireless nodes in the IoT-enabled SG are resource constrained. In
    spite of the recent advancements in ultra-low power (ULP) transceiver and processor
    technologies, a conventional battery tends to deplete less than a year. This issue
    necessitates periodic replenishment and maintenance, however, the excessive numbers
    of the deployed elements, the tasks that are being fulfilled and the randomness
    of depletion times make this option impractical. Therefore, the need for a self-sustaining
    mechanism becomes more apparent to overcome limited power supply difficulty of
    IoT nodes. Although an auxiliary and/or a totally distinct source can contribute
    this aim sufficiently, EH methods come to the forefront as the energy that can
    be provided by these techniques is theoretically unlimited. As there are numerous
    potential alternatives, i.e, environmental and non-environmental, to gather energy,
    temperature and motion variations; electromagnetic fields, radio frequency signals;
    and light propagations can be regarded as the well-studied ones of these techniques.
    EH eases the problem of limited supply for IoT-enabled SG. There are two fundamental
    problems in the domain of IoT, which are spectrum scarcity and resource constraint.
    They are intensified if the IoT is utilized in the SG since wireless channel conditions
    and environment in the SG are harsher than those of any other IoT domain. In this
    paper, we propose a new networking paradigm, energy harvesting cognitive radio
    networking (EH-CRN) for IoT-enabled SG, which utilizes two important techniques,
    namely energy harvesting and cognitive radio. The contributions of this paper
    are to provide a framework to merge these techniques to eliminate the problems
    of IoT-enabled SG and to introduce challenges, the potential advantages of this
    new paradigm, and to present network and node architectures. To this end, we first
    explain the usage of CR in the IoT-enabled SG. Afterwards, we outline the existing
    EH techniques and how they can contribute to the realization of IoT-enabled SG.
    We overview the operation of the energy harvesting cognitive radios (EH-CRs),
    and explain their node and network architectures. We also state open issues and
    future research directions to realize EH-CRN for IoT-enabled SG. The paper is
    organized as follows. CR usage in IoT-enabled SG is explained in Section 2. EH
    techniques for IoT-enabled SG are outlined in Section 3. The node and network
    architectures, their operation, and open research issues are discussed in Section
    4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper. 2 Cognitive radios in IoT-enabled smart
    grid The centralized management of the electric grid has experienced a paradigm
    shift toward the SG. It enables the two way communication, which connects the
    consumer side and the utility companies [5]. This paradigm provides an efficient
    management and control of the grid in a better way. SG brings the capability of
    monitoring of demand and supply in real time. Hence, SG adds new services to the
    customers, in which they can adjust their energy consumption according to the
    demand and supply balance. To enable the concept of the SG, it should be integrated
    with the next-generation information and communication technologies having the
    ability of sensing and broadband wireless communication, supporting ubiquitous
    computing and adaptive control [17]. This will increase the stability of the electric
    grid, decrease unnecessary power consumption, predict communication blackouts,
    and provide security of the grid and power provisioning. According to [17], sensing,
    transmission and control are the basic functionalities that are being offered
    by the SG infrastructure. Smart meters and sensors are the key components for
    sensing operations. Depending on the transmission scheme, sensed data reach to
    the controller or centralized coordinator/gateway via multiple hops. The SG covers
    a large geographical area, which makes the communication infeasible due to the
    harsh environmental conditions and the increased distance between communicating
    parties. Hence, the communication architecture of the SG is divided into three
    main groups, which are home/building area networks (HANs/BANs), neighborhood area
    networks (NANs), and wide area networks (WANs) [15, 17,18,19]. The sensors in
    homes are essential parts of HAN. They send their readings to the local access
    points. HANs in a neighborhood constitutes a NAN, and a NAN connects the grid
    to the core utility systems [15]. SG’s WAN is the network that covers the core
    network and the backhaul network [15]. For the connection of these networks wireless
    communication is utilized. When we look at the overall SG network, there is a
    hierarchical communication infrastructure [19]. Sensor nodes may be deployed in
    different parts of the electrical power system, which make them vital components
    of the SG. The deployment of the sensor nodes on the grid realizes the efficient
    and reliable power flow from the generation units to the end users [14]. These
    sensors provide monitoring of the power systems and diagnosing failures, which
    prevent the outages, and increase the reliability and efficiency of the electric
    grid [14, 21]. The SG benefits from the advantages of wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs), which are easy deployment, collaborative effort for sensing, support for
    increased coverage, flexible operation and low cost. This provides inexpensive
    monitoring and diagnostic system for the SG [22]. The use of wireless sensor nodes
    poses some challenges in the SG. These challenges can be summarized as harsh channel
    conditions, reliability and latency requirements, bit error rate and channel capacity
    variation, and the limited power capability of the sensor nodes [14]. Conditions
    in SG may deteriorate the wireless channel by high humidity, dirt, dust and vibrations
    [23]. These environment-related parameters are also harmful for the sensor nodes.
    Furthermore, different SG applications would have various quality of service (QoS)
    requirements. For instance, monitoring a transformer vault demands a strict delay
    requirement to decrease the repair time by reporting the failure within a restricted
    time. Hence, the deployed sensor nodes should satisfy different levels of QoS.
    Also, the electrical systems in the SG cause variation in the noise level and
    interference in these environments may be high. These situations result in variation
    of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which causes deviations
    in the channel capacity. Furthermore, limited battery power and processing capability
    require highly energy-efficient protocols. The most important challenge is the
    collisions and resulting redundant energy consumption due to over-utilization
    of the unlicensed bands. Although there are some studies to increase the context
    awareness of the SG, few of them consider the spectrum-awareness of the devices
    deployed in the SG [24]. These studies provide recognition in the spectrum usage.
    CR technology is proposed to support spectrum-awareness in wireless communications.
    The motivations behind this technology are to overcome the spectrum scarcity challenge
    and to dynamically use the underutilized licensed spectrum bands [25]. CR technology
    provides sharing licensed spectrum bands with primary users (PUs), which are the
    owners of these bands. In order to utilize these bands while the PUs are not active,
    CRs can change their transmitting parameters to operate on the vacant channel
    [26]. There are two main characteristics of CRs, which are cognitive capability
    and reconfigurability [25, 26]. With the cognitive capability, the idle spectrum
    bands are detected, and the best channel among these idle channels is selected
    for the communication without any interference to the PUs. With reconfigurability,
    CR can operate in different frequencies and reconfigure its parameters for the
    best performance. The use of the idle licensed spectrum bands increases spectrum
    utilization and decreases the traffic in ISM bands. Hence, collisions due to the
    excessive utilization of the unlicensed spectrum bands are decreased, which provides
    efficient spectrum usage and energy-efficiency. The cognitive capability of the
    nodes is possible with cognitive functionalities. They are spectrum sensing, spectrum
    decision and spectrum hand-off. Spectrum sensing gives the ability of revealing
    the radio spectrum band usage in the licensed bands. Spectrum decision is the
    process that the band for the transmission is decided. Furthermore, a radio with
    CR capability must vacate the licensed channel if this channel become occupied.
    This process is performed by the spectrum hand-off functionality. Using these
    features, nodes with CR capability can coexist with the licensed users, which
    are the license holders of that spectrum band. Although CR provides advantages
    for the wireless communication, it poses challenges such as dynamic radio environment.
    If CR technology is utilized in the SG, it also intensifies the challenges posed
    by the SG itself. The IoT paradigm has a goal to connect every electronic device
    to the Internet [1, 2]. It leads to the integration of different technologies
    and communication techniques. Hence, the devices within the IoT should communicate
    with different types of communication devices. The IoT is regarded as a union
    of wireless devices via the Internet to observe and sense the environment, and
    to monitor the surrounding. This paradigm has been evolving the way we communicate,
    most importantly, the standards of living since it finds many application areas
    such as transportation manufacturing, logistics, management of cities etc. [2].
    With the emergence of the IoT, the Internet has been evolved in such a way that
    Network of Interconnected objects senses the environment and actuates accordingly
    by using Internet services for communication, data transfer and analysis of the
    sensed data [1]. From this point of view, the SG has the same characteristics
    since it covers the electrical grid to sense for providing intelligence on demand
    and supply side. Furthermore, the sensing from houses to the generation side provides
    less energy loss, immediate response to the grid failures and easy adaptation
    to new systems [27]. Hence, integration of the SG with the IoT helps better monitoring
    and management of the electrical grid. This integration will also provide IoT
    services such as broad connectivity, privacy, interoperability between the heterogeneous
    wireless devices and access to the cloud computing systems. Internet connection
    of the SG and addressing the sensing and actuator devices in the Internet domain
    provide flexibility, reliability, efficiency and adaptation. Hence, SG can adopt
    the services provided by the IoT. However, the Internet connection via wireless
    links and the communication between the sensing and actuator devices in the SG
    suffers from the harsh channel conditions such as high path loss exponent and
    shadowing deviation [14] and changing spectrum characteristics over time and space
    [7]. Hence, CR may also be solution to overcome these challenges to provide unique
    reliability and requirements by dynamic spectrum access and decrease the energy
    consumption of the wireless devices by avoiding the collisions with adapting its
    operating frequency according to the spectrum sensing. 2.1 Advantages of CR in
    IoT-enabled SG Cognitive cycle operations provides awareness in frequency usage.
    Dynamic adaption to the frequency bands and opportunistic usage of the licensed
    channels increase the spectrum utilization and communication efficiency. The advantages
    of CR in IoT-enabled SG can be outlined as follows [7]. Adaptation to the environmental
    conditions: The harsh conditions of a band can be eliminated by changing the operating
    frequency to channels with less noise level. Accessing to underutilized licensed
    spectrum: With the spectrum sensing, idle channels are utilized, efficiency of
    these bands is increased. Resistance to the varying link capacity: Due to varying
    channel conditions, CR can dynamically hop to the frequency bands with higher
    link capacity. The ability of existence with different type of networks: Due to
    the CR capability, they can coexist with different type of networks since they
    can opportunistically access to the spectrum. This advantage supports operation
    with different technologies due to IoT feature in SG. 2.2 Challenges of CR capable
    IoT-enabled SG The challenges for the realization of the SG are empowered by inclusion
    in the IoT paradigm and the utilization of CR. The IoT requires scalable, energy
    efficient and flexible solutions. Furthermore, the solutions must support spectrum-awareness
    if CR is utilized. Hence, the challenges of CR capable IoT-enabled SG can be outlined
    as follows [14]. Excessive overall data transfer: Since there is a large number
    of wireless devices in the IoT-enabled SG, the overall sensing data conveyed to
    the control center may result in huge amount. Opportunistic wireless transfer
    of this data will pose a great challenge without any excessive interference to
    PUs. Balancing the energy resources: Due to the variations between the demand
    and supply, balancing the energy resources and the determination of their share
    is a difficult task. Spectrum-aware communication between the demand and supply
    side with the harsh environmental condition of the IoT-enabled SG poses a challenge.
    Dynamic licensed user activity: Interference to the licensed users should be less
    than a certain threshold. Variation in the traffic: Due to the activities on the
    user side, the traffic flowing from the user side to the supply side varies. Satisfying
    different levels of QoS: SG can have a wide variety of QoS level due to diverse
    SG applications. Satisfaction of all the users in SG is a challenging task. 3
    Existing methods of energy harvesting Existing techniques of energy scavenging
    is broadly categorized into two groups as Harvest-Use and Harvest-Store- Use,
    where these can be further sub-categorized as controllable and uncontrollable
    [28]. By regarding this separation and the frequency of preference some leading
    EH methods are discussed below, and a detailed comparison is presented in Table
    1. Table 1 Comparison of the existing EH techniques [31] Full size table 3.1 Energy
    harvesting from light sources Power extraction from light sources is a well-known
    technique of EH in which the energy carried by photons is converted into utilizable
    electrical power with respect to a chemical phenomenon, namely photo-voltaic (PV)
    effect [28, 29]. In outdoor, solar energy is efficiently exploited to power various
    systems and applications, thanks to its sufficient power rating, and implementation
    flexibility. One of the most well-established applications of sunlight EH, in
    terms of wireless networking, can be regarded as intelligent surveillance and
    advanced control of grid assets over the Internet since the electrical power grid
    related elements are in widespread. This aspect also contributes to the realization
    of SG and Smart City visions. However, as a corollary of being environmental,
    the energy that can be gathered by sunlight illumination is highly affected by
    ambient factors. For indoor applications, more specialized PV materials, which
    are better suited for diffused lights, are being developed for profiting from
    any kind of light propagation to build HANs/BANs [28]. Although the period of
    harvesting is much longer on the contrary of sunlight’s daytime constraint, the
    energy that can be gathered by artificial lights is roughly one third of sunlight
    energy. 3.2 Thermal energy harvesting Thermal EH is based on a physical phenomenon,
    i.e., Seeback Effect, which occurs between conductor pairs. In brief, due to a
    thermal difference the junction expands in a certain direction that results in
    utilizable electrical power. The attainable energy can be easily adjusted by changing
    connection of the pairs as series and/or parallel [28]. Thermo-electric generation
    (TEG) can be regarded as an innate method for SG communications, where the temperature
    gradients between the grid assets and the environment are being utilized for providing
    energy to the wireless devices attached [30]. In small scale, mostly peltiers
    and/or thermocouples are preferred for low-power requiring time-uncritical consumer
    electronics solutions. It is also possible to energize the circuitries that are
    obliged to monitor the human bodies or any body-attached control systems by using
    the very same approach. As the devices are more likely to operate self-sustainably,
    they may suffer from the quite low power extraction efficiency of the TEG process
    [28, 31]. 3.3 Kinetic energy harvesting As the name suggest, kinetic energy conversion
    (KEC) means profiting from any mechanical stress and/or vibration resultant motion
    variation to gather power for wireless devices. KEC includes electrostatic, piezoelectric
    and electromagnetic methods to extract energy from mostly uncon- trollable but
    somehow predictable environmental sources, as well as partly-controllable and
    mostly unpredictable man-made actions [29]. Airflow EH, in particular, can be
    considered as one of the well-established power provision methods for SG applications,
    in which the wireless autonomous devices destined to surveil the grid are powered
    by KEC-capable anemometer like mechanisms. As these systems provide longevity
    and maintenance-free operation for the networks to be built, the available power
    is highly threatened by many factors, such as daytime and weather conditions.
    Although the vibrations alternate the wind power in SG communications, they require
    specialized harvesters as the frequency of each vibrating element differs. For
    indoor applications, piezoelectric materials are mostly preferred to operate HANs
    and BANs intermittently [28, 31]. 3.4 Radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting With
    the unprecedented grow in wireless technologies in recent years, electromagnetic
    (EM) waves become more attractive for especially EH applications [28, 29]. Because
    of the nature of wireless communication, EM signals have the characteristics of
    being easily attainable and efficiently utilizable, which open up the potential
    of building battery-less WSNs that profit from ambient and underutilized RF waves.
    For urban areas, RF energy is about to unseat the conventional methods of EH that
    are destined to run remote services of Smart Cities. For indoor, EM waves emitted
    from modems, routers, smart phones, and laptops are first collected, then converted
    into AC and DC by using power receiving antennae, transducers, and rectifiers,
    respectively. Although the RF EH provides quite satisfying solutions regardless
    of the environmental parameters, being distortive for the communication; having
    strict deployment requirements; depending highly on an unpredictable source compel
    its utilization in mission-critical applications [31]. 3.5 Energy harvesting from
    electromagnetic fields In addition to above-mentioned harvesting techniques, low-power
    operative wireless devices can be also powered by exploiting electromagnetic fields
    around the conductive materials energized at any level. Magnetic field (M-field)
    EH, in particular, is based on coupling the surrounding field flow of AC current
    carrying conductors by clamping them with current transformers [29,30,31]. This
    power transfer-based technique provides acceptable rate of stable power as long
    as there exist sufficient current flow on the conductor that is being utilized.
    Being bulky and requiring additional safety procedures due to the mechanical contact
    are the factors that restrict its employment in certain applications. However,
    for online condition monitoring of overhead power lines and environmental sensing
    around grid assets, it is the most efficient solution in contrast with the ambient
    sources such as sunlight and airflow. Electric field (E-field), in similar, exploits
    the electric charges induced on a conductive material due to a voltage difference.
    The field that is being emitted is obstructed by again a conductive material,
    where a displacement current starts to drain. The charges conveyed are first converted
    into DC and then accumulated in a storage element after regulated. As the source
    of this gathered energy is the ambient field, this method can be termed as E-Field
    EH (EFEH) [30, 31]. EFEH depends only on the existence of voltage potential. Since
    the voltage and the frequency are firmly regulated and exactingly maintained,
    the E-field is stable and also predictable in its behavior. Therefore, it can
    be referred as the most promising way of composing long-term and self-operable
    communication services notwithstanding the environmental parameters. 4 Energy
    harvesting cognitive radios in IoT-enabled smart grid We separately investigate
    the usage of CR and EH in the IoT-enabled SG in prior sections. This section explains
    how the nodes operate by utilizing these technologies in the IoT-enabled SG. Spectrum-aware
    communication and energy harvesting capabilities of these nodes are the key elements
    for successful operation of the IoT-enabled SG. Hence, the wireless devices in
    an IoT-enabled SG are named as energy harvesting-cognitive radios (EH-CRs). As
    EH-CRs have additional capabilities, their node architecture would be different
    from conventional wireless nodes in the IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore, these capabilities
    require considering the network architectures of the IoT-enabled SG. Hence, we
    overview operation of EH-CRs, their node architecture, and the architectures of
    the network consisting of these nodes. 4.1 Operation of EH-CRs Overcoming the
    spectrum scarcity challenges with CR and solving the limited energy supply problem
    with the EH techniques provide significant benefits in the SG domain. Furthermore,
    including the SG in the IoT results in very diverse application areas. This fact
    necessitates a clear understanding of operation of the IoT-enabled EH-CRs. The
    SG is a visionary concept that connects the demand and supply sides by enabling
    two way communication. These connection is provided by the deployment of wireless
    sensing devices and actuators. Hence, the proper operation of these devices is
    quite important. In the IoT-enabled SG, there are different operation schemes
    for the wireless devices. The deployed devices in homes may access directly to
    their gateways or they may reach their Internet gateways through multiple hops.
    During the operation, EH-CRs use spectrum-aware communication techniques for the
    transmission, and EH methods to energize the device. Depending on the sub-network
    architectures, the packet generated by sensing are conveyed in one or multiple
    hops in dynamic radio environment to reach the Internet for realizing IoT-enabled
    SG. They utilize the licensed spectrum bands since they coexist with PUs. Furthermore,
    they scavenge energy by utilizing EH techniques. 4.2 Node architecture of EH-CRs
    We propose a node architecture for IoT-enabled EH-CRs that supports self-sufficient
    and spectrum aware communications. In this architecture, we include three main
    units, which are ultra-low power (ULP) communication, ULP processing, and power
    provision units. A detailed structure is depicted in Fig. 2. The ULP communication
    unit performs channel switching, channel sensing, modulation and power control
    duties at the expense of miliwatts. Furthermore, sensory operations are performed
    in the sensor unit, which is controlled by the ULP processing unit. The sensed
    information is processed in ULP, and it is transferred to the ultra-low power
    communication unit. Fig. 2 Node Architecture of EH-CRs Full size image The power
    provision unit includes energy harvester, rectifier, regulator and energy buffer,
    i.e., super-capacitor, sub-units. As the name suggest, this unit is responsible
    for providing utilizable energy to the each part of the sensor node. In other
    words, profitable sources are captured, converted (if necessary), regulated and
    stored to be distributed to the rest of the system. The processing unit mainly
    decides on operating parameters and manages every process carried out by the sensor
    node. The ULP communication unit has an Internet-capable RF front-end, demodulator
    and decoder to provide the communication with CR functionalities. This node architecture
    is designed to support self-sufficient and spectrum-aware communications in the
    IoT-enabled SG. 4.3 Network architecture of IoT-enabled SG Using the node architecture
    of EH-CRs, we establish a network architecture for the IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore,
    we also utilize the general SG network architecture while establishing it for
    the IoT-enabled SG. The general SG network architecture has a multi-layer architecture
    and spread over a very geographical region, which poses challenges and limitations
    in wireless communications. Furthermore, this network architecture includes a
    number of sub-networks that have different QoS and other communication requirements.
    There are three main components for the SG network architectures, namely, HAN,
    NAN and WAN as seen in Fig. 3 [18, 19]. IAN in Fig. 3 refers to industrial area
    network, which is a sub-network of NAN located at industrial sites. BAN in Fig.
    3 refers to building area network, which is again a sub-network of NAN consisting
    of wireless nodes located in buildings. In our architecture, we split the IoT-enabled
    SG network like in the conventional SG networks. However, we consider the capabilities
    of EH-CRs while proposing our network architecture. We investigate the sub-networks
    of the IoT-enabled SG in the following subsections. Fig. 3 Network Architecture
    of IoT-enabled SG Full size image 4.3.1 Home area networks HANs cover houses and
    buildings. They provide real time monitoring for adjustment of energy consumption.
    Furthermore, they have the capability of control, managing and track of the devices
    at homes and buildings [32]. These networks bring intelligence to the houses,
    i.e., Smart Homes (SHs) [33]. Remote control and tracking, management of heat
    and light, and health-care monitoring are some of the applications of SHs. Home
    is the smallest part of the grid and provides context-aware services to the HAN
    users. The most important elements in HANs are smart meters, which have the capability
    of measuring the energy consumptions of the nodes [34]. WSNs are the key components
    to realize the SG in HANs that can be used home applications related to demand
    and energy management [35]. The collaborative nature of WSNs helps to exchange
    of the sensory information from the home appliances and systems, and makes this
    information accessible via the Internet with the inclusion of IoT. The development
    of the SG have increased the usage of HANs, which utilizes protocols such as ZigBee,
    Wi-Fi, and 6LoWPAN. However, they use ISM (Industrial, Scientific, Medical) bands,
    which are highly utilized and become insufficient for the transmission. This also
    increases the collision and deteriorates the network performance. Hence, CR plays
    a key role to eliminate these problems in HANs. CR is also being utilized in the
    SG domain to manage high volume of data and to satisfy different QoS levels [36].
    In our network architecture, the nodes in home communicates with the access point
    by dynamic spectrum access techniques to overcome the difficulties in the SG.
    This scenario is seen in Fig. 3 with exploitation of different EH methods such
    as harvesting from solar and thermal energy. The EH methods extend the lifetime
    of EH-CRs in HANs. 4.3.2 Neighborhood area networks NANs provide the connection
    between HANs. These networks are also named as field area networks (FANs) due
    to their connection of field devices such as advanced metering infrastructures
    (AMI) and intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) [18]. NANs gather the energy consumption
    information from the homes in a neighborhood and sends it to utility companies
    via WANs [36]. NANs also connect SHs and the utility companies. It provides real-time
    communication for pricing and control. Furthermore, main fields of NAN applications
    can be named as distribution automation, load management and so on. Depending
    on the application, the network radius of NANs may be up to 10 km with a rate
    of 0.1 - 10 Mbps [19]. Multi-hop capable wireless nodes may be utilized such as
    ZigBee and Wi-Fi nodes [20]. Wireless sensor nodes may be utilized for this purpose.
    However, they may face the spectrum scarcity challenge in addition to the SG challenges
    such as harsh channel environment. CR again stands as a solution for these problems.
    In our networking paradigm, the nodes in NANs also access the licensed spectrum
    opportunistically. Gateway nodes are with cognitive radio capability. Their energy
    is supplied by the EH methods, which depend on the available energy resources
    in that neighborhood. Figure 3 shows a NAN that gateway node is connected to the
    different sub-networks such as HAN, IAN and BAN. Furthermore, nodes in NANs need
    more energy since they communicate with the nodes in HANs. Hence, efficient EH
    techniques should be employed. 4.3.3 Wide area networks WANs cover large areas
    and connects much smaller networks to form the communication backbone [37]. NANs
    forms WANs, the NANs communicates with the utility center via the Internet through
    WANs [36]. The observations and the real-time measurements of the substations
    and end users are conveyed to the control center traversing WANs, where the data
    from control centers is transmitted in the same manner [37]. IEDs are the sensor
    and actuator nodes, which are deployed in critical parts of the electrical grid
    such as transformers, circuit breakers, etc. [38]. The communication between the
    nodes of WANs requires high bandwidth and low delay due to the accumulated data
    from HANs and NANs. For instance, 5 Mbps data rate and 100 milliseconds delay
    is required for seamless communication [39]. The current WSN solutions may not
    satisfy these requirements due to inherent. CR provides the use of the licensed
    channels with high bandwidth to support the demands. If gateway noes can not access
    base stations in WANs, they reach them in multiple hops by utilizing idle licensed
    bands. 4.4 Open issues and future research directions In this paper, we have proposed
    a new networking paradigm, namely energy harvesting cognitive radio networking
    in IoT-enabled Smart Grid. The nodes have two capabilities, which are energy scavenging
    and spectrum-aware communications. Furthermore, these nodes operate in a very
    harsh domain, which is IoT-enabled Smart Grid. To enable EH-CR networking in IoT-enabled
    SG, we have explained the operation of EH-CRs, the node architecture and their
    network operation in a IoT-enabled SG. This new paradigm yields some open issues
    and future research directions, which are outlined as follows. Spectrum management
    frameworks must be designed according to the networking architecture of the IoT-enabled
    SG and the CR capability of the nodes. Furthermore, EH aspects of these nodes
    should be considered to enable efficient power consumption to support battery
    free operation. Energy harvesting and the energy consumption due to the cognitive
    cycle operations should be considered to balance the energy expenditure for perpetual
    lifetime. Furthermore, the spectrum-aware communication challenges such as arrival
    of PU during opportunistic communication should be considered in IoT-enabled SG
    with the intrinsic harsh channel conditions. Coverage and connectivity of the
    IoT-enabled SG should be studied according to the spectrum-awareness and energy
    harvesting points of view. New power control method can be utilized considering
    the harvested energy in IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore, the connectivity of IoT-enabled
    SG should be investigated in such a setup. The heterogeneity of IoT-enabled devices
    should be handled since these devices use different communication technologies.
    The compatibility with EH-CRs and the other IoT devices deployed in SG must be
    investigated in terms of communication. Spectrum-aware routing protocols should
    be designed to enhance the lifetime of the nodes with EH techniques. The routing
    techniques should also consider the different network architectures of SG such
    as HAN, WAN, NAN. Application specific EH methods should be offered to support
    battery free operations of EH-CRs. Furthermore, hybrid energy harvesting approach
    may be proposed to exploit different EH methods in EH-CR nodes. EH methods must
    be utilized in accordance with required operation in different parts of the IoT-enabled
    SG since different nodes in different subnetworks of the IoT-enabled SG uses different
    amount of energy for the communication due to different transmission ranges. 5
    Conclusion In this paper, we propose a totally new networking architecture, namely,
    Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networking for Internet of Things-enabled Smart
    Grid. EH techniques are planned to be utilized for increasing the lifetime of
    wireless devices deployed in IoT-enabled SG. Furthermore, as the SG has harsh
    channel conditions and spectrum scarcity problems in its network architecture,
    we propose to use CR to overcome these issues. This new networking paradigm is
    investigated in terms of general operation, node and network architecture aspects.
    Open issues and future research directions are presented to realize EH-CR networking
    in the IoT-enabled SG. References Gubbi J, Buyya R, Marusic S, Palaniswami M (2013)

    Get rights and content Highlights • Spectrum sensing is the fundamental component
    of Cognitive Radio Network (CRN), which is threatened by security attacks. • A
    blockchain based method is proposed to detect the malicious users in cognitive
    radio networks to improve the security • The results shows the 100% detection
    of malicious users. Abstract Due to the increase in industrial applications of
    Internet of Things (IoT), number of internet connected devices have been increased
    accordingly. This has resulted in big challenges in terms of accessibility, scalability,
    connectivity and adaptability. IoT is capable of creating connections between
    devices on wireless medium but the utilization of scarce spectrum in efficient
    manner for the establishment of these connections is the biggest concern. To accommodate
    spectrum allocation problem different radio technologies are being utilized. One
    of the most efficient technique being used is cognitive radio, which dynamically
    allocate the unlicensed spectrum for IoT applications. Spectrum sensing being
    the fundamental component of Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) is threatened by security
    attacks. Process of spectrum sensing is disturbed by the malicious user (MU) which
    attacks the primary signal detection and affects the accuracy of sensing outcome.
    The presence of such MU in system, sending false sensing data can degrade the
    performance of cognitive radios. Therefore, in this article a blockchain based
    method is proposed for the MU detection in network. By using this method an MU
    can easily be discriminated from a reliable user through cryptographic keys. The
    efficiency of the proposed mechanism is analyzed through proper simulations using
    MATLAB. Consequently, this mechanism can be deployed for the validation of participating
    users in the process of spectrum sensing in CRN for IoTs. Previous article in

    user detection 1. Introduction With the increase in number of communication devices,
    utilization of spectrum in efficient manner is the biggest challenge. Cognitive
    Radio Networks (CRN) consists of intelligent wireless devices which can efficiently
    sense the medium and effectively utilize the vacant or under-utilized spectrum.
    Secondary Users (SUs) are enabled by cognitive radios to opportunistically access
    the spectrum unused by the Primary Users (PUs). There are two basic objectives
    of Cognitive Radio Medium Access Control (CR MAC): controlling interference and
    avoiding collision between SUs. Medium Access Control (MAC) has an important role
    in several cognitive radio functions such as spectrum sensing, mobility, resource
    allocation and spectrum sharing [1]. MAC layer is used for the management and
    coordination of communication over wireless channels. In the presence of dynamic
    radio surroundings, the CRN access protocol shall create variety of choices in
    real time. These requirements makes realization of CRN a challenging task compared
    to standard access protocols in the present static spectrum policies. In recent
    decades, the thought of Opportunistic Spectrum Access (OSA) has emerged to considerably
    increase spectrum utilization [2]. For this, the SUs ought to have the flexibility
    of dynamically searching and utilizing the opportunities within the authorized
    spectrum in numerous dimensions like time, frequency, code, etc. Therefore, OSA
    protocol need to integrate spectrum sensing and access functionalities. In essence,
    spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation, spectrum access, spectrum sharing and spectrum
    quality determines the key parts for economical OSA protocol style. Cognitive
    radio has helped to improve spectrum scarcity [3]. Earlier, spectrum was allocated
    in fixed manner in which fixed users can only use licensed spectrum but with the
    concept of cognitive radio, SU can broadcast data on unlicensed spectrum without
    creating any interference with the operational licensed spectrum. This type of
    smart spectrum sensing enables the network to perform sensing in a secure manner.
    It can also efficiently avoid jamming attacks by malicious user (MU) using preemptive
    switching to higher quality channels. It utilizes power saving protocol by conversing
    low power when low bandwidth is required. This is an intelligent radio which improves
    the Quality of Service (QoS) by selecting frequency channels with a high rate
    of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). Though cognitive radio has helped to improve spectrum
    scarcity, its implementation comes with certain challenges. Whenever CRN is implemented
    first problem is the decision making whether to use the distributed or centralized
    model. Similarly, another problem is learning mechanism in which the record of
    the previous decisions is maintained and utilized to improve its behavior, which
    is a complex process. The problem which has attained the significant attention
    is the security of CRN [4]. This is due to the reason that various wireless devices
    are allowed to access the licensed spectrum used by PU, therefore they are prone
    to attack of MUs. CRN not only face security related issues like eavesdropping,
    tampering, forgery and non cooperation, etc., but also new security threats which
    directly relates to characteristics of cognitive radios, like denial of service
    attack, falsifying data, and emulation attack on PU. Therefore security problems
    in cognitive radios has become the hottest topic of ongoing research [5]. 1.1.
    Contribution In this article, a method is proposed to improve the security of
    cognitive radio network during spectrum sensing by utilizing the concept of blockchains.
    The main contributions of our proposed work are summarized as follows: • We have
    converted all the users i.e., PUs and SUs in the forms of blocks similar to blockchain
    which combines to form a decentralized network. • We have used energy detection
    method for spectrum sensing and its results are validated by authentication of
    the participating users. • We have used the concept of digital signature in blockchains
    for the verification of malicious and authenticated user (AU). • We have provided
    extensive simulation results which verify the efficiency of our proposed mechanism.
    Rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives brief overview of blockchains
    and cognitive radios network, Section 3 outlines the previous related work on
    the issue, Section 4 presents the scenario and proposed mechanism along with the
    algorithms, Section 5 discusses the results of the simulation run on the proposed
    model. Finally, the article is concluded in last section. 2. Blockchains and cognitive
    radios networks 2.1. Overview of blockchains Blockchains have been adapted by
    many applications like cryptocurrencies, IoT, Cloud and Edge Computing, Fog Networks,
    Ad hoc Networks and others. This is due to its distinct property of peer to peer
    networking (having different nodes with same status to avoid risk of single point
    failure). Using the blockchain techniques and its distributed ledgers provide
    complete privacy and cost reduction. The initial and most renowned application
    of blockchains is bitcoin [6]. Bitcoin is a peer to peer system distributed over
    a time stamp server whose main task is to computationally proof the transactions
    in chronological order. Basically, a chain of digital signature is the electronic
    coin. Architecture of blockchain on basis of bitcoin is discussed in this section.
    2.1.1. Architectural background Blockchain is a combination of blocks in sequence,
    which maintains a complete list of transaction records in the form of conventional
    public ledger. Fig. 1 demonstrates an example of a blockchain. The block header
    which contains a previous block hash, whereas it has only one block which is parent
    block. It is worth noting that blocks belonging to uncle (block ancestors children)
    hashes would also be stored in ethereum blockchain [7]. The first block of a blockchain
    which is commonly used as genesis block has no parent block. 2.1.1.1. Block. A
    block is mainly consisted of the block header and body called block body as shown
    in Fig. 1. In particular, the block header includes: Download : Download high-res
    image (200KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Blockchain architecture.
    (i) Block version: It indicates the set of rules for block validation to follow.
    (ii) Timestamps: Current time as seconds in Unix timestamp since Gregorian calendars
    first of January, YYYY. (iii) nBits: It targets the threshold of a valid and sound
    block hash. (iv) Nonce: Associated with 4-byte field, that typically starts with
    zero and will increase for each hash calculation. (v) Parent block hash: Associated
    as 256-bit hash price that points to the previously present block. The body of
    block is consisted of a group counter for transactions. The most variety of group
    actions that a block will contain depends on the size of block and therefore the
    size of every transaction. Blockchain uses uneven cryptography mechanism which
    validates the authenticity of transactions [8]. Digital signature supported by
    uneven cryptography is employed in untrustworthy and dishonorable surroundings.
    Next we will try to shortly illustrate digital signature. 2.1.1.2. Digital signature.
    Every user is owner of a combination of personal key and public key. The personal
    key that shall be unbroken in confidentiality is used to sign the transactions.
    Digitally signed transaction is broadcasted on whole network. The standard digital
    signature involves two phases: signing phase and verification phase. As an example,
    a user Alice who desires to send a message to another user Bob. (i) Within the
    signing section, Alice protects her information by encrypting along with her personal
    key and sends encrypted data to Bob along with original information. (ii) Within
    the verification section, Bob validates the worth with Alice’s open (public) key.
    Therein method, Bob may simply check if the information has been sent is tampered
    or not. This typical type of digital signature algorithmic rule, which is utilized
    in blockchains for protection of data is the elliptic curve digital signature
    algorithmic rule (ECDSA) [9]. Same method will be used in our proposed model but
    in a different scenario. Download : Download high-res image (385KB) Download :

    environment. 2.2. Cognitive radio networks In order to apply blockchains in CRNs,
    We will provide a brief overview of CRNs. 2.2.1. Definition Cognitive radio can
    be defined as a radio that can be programmed to access a dynamic spectrum by intelligently
    utilizing best wireless channel in order to avoid interference and congestion.
    There is a network of radios which tries to make connections among different nodes
    to avail the best available opportunity. There are two types of users, PUs and
    SUs, SUs avails the idle spectrum of PUs opportunistically. The process involves
    the steps like; spectrum access, spectrum sensing and spectrum mobility, etc.
    The fundamental step in opportunistic spectrum access is the spectrum sensing
    which is the main focus of in this article. 2.2.2. Spectrum sensing A major challenge
    in CRN is that the SUs are compelled to observe the presence of PUs in an exceedingly
    accredited spectrum and quit the band as early as possible, if the respective
    primary radio emerges so as to avoid interference caused in access to PUs [10].
    This system is named as spectrum sensing. Spectrum sensing and its estimation
    is the opening and fundamental step to implement cognitive radio system [11].
    Spectrum sensing techniques can be categorized as direct and indirect techniques.
    Direct techniques haver taken into account frequency domain, where the estimation
    is dispensed directly from signal by using correlation property. Whereas indirect
    technique is a time domain approach, where the estimation is performed by autocorrelation
    of the signal. Spectrum sensing may also be categorized as follows • Primary transmitter
    detection: PUs are detected by performing access of the received signal at cognitive
    radio users. This type of approach includes detection using matched filter (MF),
    primarily based on energy detection, covariance based detection, waveform based
    detection, cyclostationary detection and detection using radio identification.
    • Cooperative and Collaborative Detection: At first signals for spectrum vacancies
    are detected faithfully by cooperating or interacting with different users, and
    therefore the technique may be enforced as either central access to the spectrum
    with coordination by a spectrum server or decentralized mechanism in explicit
    by the formula of spectrum load smoothing or detection done externally. • Interference
    Temperature Detection: In this approach, cognitive radios utilize ultra wide band
    (UWB) technology, the SUs are allowed to transmit at relatively low power and
    are restricted by the level of temperature of interference, therefore SUs do not
    cause harmful interference to PUs. 2.3. Implementations of blockchains in cognitive
    radio networks Blockchains have a wide range of applications in different broadband
    cellular networks, cloud and fog networks as well as in IoTs. A limited number
    of research articles have been presented, related to blockchains in cognitive
    networks. Fig. 2 shows the generalized concept of blockchain implementation in
    CRNs for spectrum sensing. 2.3.1. Dynamic spectrum access in CRNs using blockchains
    In the article [12], authors have proposed a blockchain based verification method
    for secure spectrum sharing in moving cognitive radios (CRs) in CRNs. They present
    a virtual money, Specoins, for installment to get spectrum access. They have compared
    the power consumption of their proposed algorithms in presence of severe, moderate,
    slow and fast fading. Authors were successful in achieving advantage over previous
    methods of spectrum access in terms of scalability, quality of service while providing
    spectrum access to SUs and PUs. However the proposed model is compared with conventional
    Aloha which is very old technique of medium access and has now been outdated.
    MAC protocols like CSMA/CA are commonly used in cognitive radios. Table 1. Summary

    Identity management of CR networks using blockchains In the article [29], the
    authors propose a security upgrading framework for CRNs using blockchains. The
    set-up permits network access using pseudonymous identities, which prevents the
    recreation of a subscriber’s character identity. Authors of this article were
    successful in preventing unauthorized access to personal data by limiting the
    data exposure to non-authenticated users. The simulation results indicate that
    this approach reduces the access provisioning duration and decreases network signaling
    traffic, however, the scalability of CRNs has not been investigated by the authors
    (see Table 1). 3. Related work Since the detection of malicious user is a conventional
    problem therefore different articles have been presented which investigate this
    area. In [13], a novel method is proposed for the identification of malicious
    user on the basis of outlier detection mechanism for cooperative spectrum sensing
    of cognitive radios. In the article [14], malicious user is detected and ex-pulsed
    in cooperative sensing, where a system is proposed which works independent of
    the malicious user present in network. In [15], a technique for cooperative detection
    and suppression of malicious user in cognitive radio system is presented. In [16],
    a decentralized system utilizes the spatial correlation of Received Signal Strength
    (RSS) in close premises of SU and outlier detection identifies the malicious user.
    A voting system is proposed which decides the presence of malicious user in neighborhood
    of SUs. Similarly, another method is proposed in [17], where two Hidden Markov
    Model (HMM) are used to differentiate between malicious and honest user. This
    detection is achieved through the dissimilarity of respective HMM parameters.
    In another study [18], intelligent MUs and SUs are detected with high accuracy
    on the basis of proposed algorithm formulated on the concept of friend and foe
    detection method. There are some methods which are proposed for the defense against
    Primary User Emulation (PUE) attack. In article [19], channel is chosen on the
    basis of dogfight method. A game based mechanism is proposed where the defender
    choose sensing channel by avoiding PUE attack. A localization based defense system
    is proposed in [20], where transmitter is verified by the location of transmitter
    and characteristics of transmitted signal. A cooperative scheme is proposed with
    the awareness on attacking capability in presence of PUE malicious attack. The
    probabilities of fake signal of PUE attack are estimated in the absence and presence
    of PUE attacks. Threshold is calculated in order to minimize total error probability
    [21]. In [22], a compromised sensor node is detected on the basis group voting
    scheme. A time based weight is assigned to each node. Quality of data transmission
    and weights combine to poll vote. Similarly in the article [23], compressed sensing
    technique is presented in which MU is removed while signal is being processed
    at fusion center. Low ranked matrix completion mechanism is applied for this purpose.
    In article [24], authors have presented a game theory based model which detects
    the intrusion attack in sensor network. A consensus mechanism is proposed in [25]
    by using a distributed network. Each SU selects neighbor after repetitive iterations
    to share sensing data. A reliable neighbor is selected by comparing the received
    reports against the local mean value. Results which deviates from reference local
    mean value are discarded. Detection scheme based on double sided abnormality is
    presented by the authors of [26] for cooperative spectrum sensing. This scheme
    do not require any advance information about attacker. Main idea is to utilize
    history of reports as a point in high dimension space for each SU. If points of
    SU are different at large scale then it is regarded as abnormal user. Cooperation
    among attacking nodes is not considered in this article. In [27], malicious sensors
    are identified by simple majority vote. Decision are made as 1 or 0. If more than
    half votes are in favor of malicious status of sensor then it is deemed as outlier.
    This mechanism has a shortcoming for not being operate-able in small sensor networks.
    In [28], onion peeling mechanism is presented for the defense of compromising
    users. A threshold is defined which determines the status of MU. If the current
    value is higher than threshold then reports of that user are discarded. This process
    continues until each MU is detected and removed. The authors in [30], propose
    a blockchain based secure information sharing mechanism in edge IoT devices, this
    information sharing mechanism will lead to complete complex task in intelligent
    edge IoT devices. The authors in [31], formulate an optimization problem with
    an objective to maximize energy efficiency in CRN, with constraints on outage
    probability and CR transmission. They propose a low complexity linear search algorithm
    to solve the problem. The authors in [32], propose a cognitive network virtualization
    resource configuration in order to improve the security of information centric
    networks. The authors in [33] discuss conventional physical layer security mechanism
    for wireless communication systems. The research articles discussed in Sections
    2 Blockchains and cognitive radios networks, 3 Related work lead to the idea of
    using blockchain for enhancement of security of CRNs. In this article, a method
    is proposed to detect the MUs during spectrum sensing in CRNs by utilizing the
    concept of blockchains. 4. Scenario and proposed mechanism 4.1. Scenario Before
    moving towards the model scenario of the system, consider Fig. 3, Fig. 4, which
    show the centralized and decentralized network of users connected to the base
    station. These are the topologies in which users can access the cognitive base
    station. Consider a network of cognitive radios in which there are multiple number
    of PUs and SUs. Fig. 5 shows that PUs are present far away from the SUs but they
    are in range of its effective transmission range. This is a cooperative sensing
    mechanism in which all the nodes participate to get outcome. Sensing period start
    at the beginning of spectrum sensing and concludes at the time when consensus
    outcome is achieved that the user is malicious or authenticated. We are going
    to implement blockchains on CRN, therefore, our network is totally decentralized
    where PUs and SUs are connected in peer-to-peer topology. For convenience, we
    take only one PU and number of SUs. Fig. 6 clearly shows the blockchain implementation
    for the spectrum sensing in CRNs. PUs and SUs are named as CR users in general.
    All the CR users are connected with each other in a decentralized manner. Hash
    to hash connection has been created among them. Each block of CR user contains
    four type of information which are explained below: 4.1.0.1. Hash. Hash is unique
    key which is generated by sha256 function [34]. Every user has its unique key
    which act as a public key of that particular user. This key is known to the next
    block of user. In short it is a shared key on network. Download : Download high-res

    the data part of the block. It contains the information of final outcome of sensing
    on the basis of energy detection method. This method is explained further in next
    section. 4.1.0.3. Private key. This is the unique identity key of each block which
    is only known to the CR user itself. In our proposed method 16 bit key is generated
    which act as private key. 4.1.0.4. Previous hash. It contains the hash value of
    previous node. Hence a peer to peer connection is established. In this scenario,
    all the nodes will participate for cooperative sensing. 4.2. Proposed mechanism
    Fig. 7 shows the flow chart of the proposed mechanism. Firstly, we will create
    blocks of SUs and PUs. Secondly, we will sense the spectrum using energy detection
    method. Thirdly, the participating nodes are validated using blockchain. Finally,
    MU is detected and discriminated from reliable user. These steps are elaborated
    in detail below. Download : Download high-res image (197KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Flow chart of proposed mechanism. 4.2.1. Creation of blocks
    At the very first stage, PUs and SUs are converted into blocks of blockchains.
    For this purpose a distributed ledgers of nodes having information of PUs and
    SUs credentials is created. There will be a public key and private key. Public
    key contains information related to common data related to different units in
    CRNs like status of being SU or PU. Whereas, private keys contain secret data
    of nodes like their location, authentication code, etc. 4.2.2. Energy detection
    This is the main part of the spectrum sensing in which we are using energy detection
    method. We consider that there is a bandwidth W Hz and the sampling rate of receiving
    signal is t. We have created two hypothesis, Hypothesis 1 which detects the signal
    and concludes that it only consists of noise whereas, Hypothesis 0 shows that
    detected signal is combination of noise and signal sent by PU. It is shown in
    equations given below: (1) where Download : Download high-res image (9KB) Download

    Download full-size image 4.2.3. Malicious user detection After performing all
    necessary steps for spectrum detection among the nodes, reliable users and MUs
    are detected using proposed mechanism in which digital signatures are used to
    verify participating nodes on the basis of public and private key. There are two
    types of errors according to binary hypothesis test presented in [35]; miss detection
    and false alarm which can cause error in detection of AU and MU. Probability of
    detection, miss detection and false alarm are given below: (i) Probability of
    AU Detection: It means the successful iterations which leads to the verification
    of AU. When number of times AU is detected for number of iterations give us probability
    of AU detection . (ii) Probability of MU Detection: It means the successful iterations
    which leads to the verification of MU. Probability of MU detection is given by
    the ratio of number of times MU is detected by number of iterations . (iii) Probability
    of Miss Detection: It shows the unsuccessful iterations which leads to the detection
    of AU. When number of times AU is not detected for number of iterations gives
    us probability of miss detection . (iv) Probability of False Alarm: This probability
    shows the miss detection of MU which leads to false alarm. Probability of false
    alarm is given by the ratio of number of times MU was unable to be detected by
    number of iterations . 4.2.4. Outcome In this step, outcome is obtained on the
    basis of above mentioned steps that whether spectrum sensing is done reliably
    or attacked by MU. Download : Download high-res image (133KB) Download : Download

    full-size image 4.3. Proposed algorithms All the simulations are performed on
    the basis of three algorithms which are designed from the proposed mechanism.
    In these algorithms we assume that there are N number of SUs and for convenience
    we have considered a single PU. In Algorithm 1, SUs and PU are connected with
    each other using blockchains. Connection between PU and SUs is established in
    the form of decentralized blocks. Blocks of PU and SUs are discriminated on the
    basis of there license. License are issued by the service provider of the user.
    When blocks are created, their status of being primary or secondary is decided
    by verifying the license of the user. If the spectrum is being sensed by the PU
    then it will be allocated block otherwise block is allocated. In Algorithm 2,
    spectrum is sensed by using energy detection method. When SUs try to access the
    spectrum, they will participate in cooperative sensing method. In which all nodes
    will sense the spectrum and make two hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 will be true when
    the spectrum is sensed and outcome received is a noise signal. Hypothesis 0 will
    be true when output received is combination of noise and energy signal. Hence,
    output of sensing will be made on these two hypotheses. If result of first hypothesis
    is true then its mean channel is vacant and spectrum sensing result will be positive
    otherwise channel is busy and sensing outcome is negative. These sensing outcomes
    are then verified by next algorithms. Finally in Algorithm 3, energy detection
    result of individual participating node is verified and validated. If the user’s
    digital signatures are verified it means it is AU otherwise it will be termed
    as MU. In this algorithm firstly public key is verified and then private key which
    both contribute to make consensus on validation of user. Similarly, probability
    of MU and AU detection, miss detection and false alarm are calculated by using
    equations presented in previous section. 4.4. Complexity of MU detection For the
    computation of the complexity involved in the detection of MU, number of participating
    nodes plays an important role. In the present scenario there are three type of
    nodes i.e., primary nodes , secondary nodes and malicious nodes . It is clear
    from the proposed mechanism and algorithms, that the process of detection of AU
    and MU depends on the participating nodes which participates in the validation
    process. Clearly from the proposed algorithms: Therefore, complexity involved
    in detection of MU can be represented as . 4.5. Performance metrics Performance
    of the proposed mechanism of securing cognitive mechanism is analyzed in terms
    throughput, frame loss and response time. 4.5.1. Response time Response time is
    the total time utilized for the validation of secure nodes, which means time required
    for the data stream to travel among the participating nodes which includes connection
    establishment, verification of public key, verification of private key and authentication
    of nodes to be malicious or reliable. is calculated as the time interval between
    the moment when blocks are created on the participating and the moment when status
    of node to be malicious or reliable is determined. The obtained numerical values
    are measured in seconds. 4.5.2. Frame loss Frame loss is the measure of data which
    is lost through the transmission of data. There can be different reasons for the
    loss of data like fading and noise, etc. is given as: where is percentage frame
    loss, is the total data load and is throughput across data load . While, throughput
    is total number of data (bits or bytes) traveled over a network in processing
    time (sec). can be shown as: where, is the total amount of data exchanged among
    the participating nodes . and shows the last and first data packet sent per unit
    time using blockchain based securing protocol . 5. Experimental results Experimental
    results are obtained by carrying simulations on proposed approach to identify
    the MU and AU present in spectrum sensing network. 5.1. Simulation setup Proposed
    method is simulated using MATLAB. For all the simulations cognitive radio network
    similar to setup [36] is considered. Low range of SNR is considered i.e., −8 dB
    to 4 dB for the AWGN channel. While, Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation
    is used for the test therefore modulation index 4 of Phase Shift Keying (PSK)
    modulator is used. Energy detection of the signal is analyzed at 500, 700 and
    1000 number of samples. Whereas flat Rayleigh fading is applied on channel for
    the comparison of results. All the base station and cognitive radio users i.e.,
    PUs and SUs are uniformly distributed. Download : Download high-res image (185KB)

    image Fig. 9. Energy detection with/without fading channel. 5.2. Results and discussion
    For the creations of blocks on CR users as proposed in Algorithm 1 is implemented.
    SHA 256 function [34] is used for the creation of hash which act as a public key
    [34]. It is a cryptographic hash function which generates a key of fixed size
    as an output with input of variable size. Current time of the system is utilized
    to create different keys. Hence, time stamp of the block involves in the creation
    of unique hash of each node. Similarly, private key is also generated by a random
    function. Sensing outcome is stored in the block from the results of Algorithm
    2 executed for each participating node. Fig. 8 shows the probability of energy
    detection with respect to SNR. A GPSK modulated signal is used in the energy detection
    mechanism whereas AWGN channel is used. Spectrum availability is determined by
    the detection of noise and energy signal. If the value of energy is greater than
    the threshold it means that spectrum is being used and probability of detection
    is close to unity. Whereas if its value is less than the threshold probability
    of false alarm is dominant. This figure shows probability of energy detection
    at different number of samples with respect to SNR. It is clear from the figure
    that with increase in number of samples probability of detection approaches to
    unity. Fig. 9 shows the comparison of energy detection for different channel impairments.
    Two type of channels are considered i.e., with fading and without fading channels.
    Rayleigh fading and AWGN channels are used for the simulations respectively. Fig.
    10, Fig. 11 show the result of detection of AU and MU. Probabilities of MU detection,
    false alarm, licensed alarm and miss detection of licensed user. After receiving
    the sensing decision implemented through Algorithm 2, private and public keys
    which are the digital signature of the authenticated nodes. If the digital signature
    of the participating node matches with the blockchain based users in CRN it is
    termed as AU otherwise MU. The results shows the 100 percent detection of MU and
    reliable user. While, probability of false alarm and miss detection is zero. Fig.
    12 shows the accuracy of MU detection in presence of different user load. Results
    are analyzed in different ratios of MUs and AUs. Fig. 13 shows the comparison
    of time consumption with and without fading channel. It is clear from the figure
    that fading channel consumes more time for the detection of MU. Performance of
    the blockchain based design is analyzed by mainly two factors i.e., response time
    and frame loss (FL%). Fig. 14 shows the FL% across different number of users.
    With increase of number of users FL% increases. For the evaluation of FL, we have
    considered the mean throughput because the size of the packets of the public and
    private keys are variable. Fig. 15 shows the comparison of response time for slow
    fading and fast fading channel. It is clear from the results that validation and
    identification of nodes are more efficient in slow fading channel whereas response
    time is higher in case of fast fading. Download : Download high-res image (139KB)

    of cognitive radio networks is investigated under the presence of MUs. A new mechanism
    is proposed using the concept of blockchains. An appropriate recognition strategy
    is utilized which identifies the AU and MU successfully with hundred percent efficiency
    by validating the digital signature of the blockchain based nodes present in cognitive
    radio network. Results have shown that all the attacking MU are detected. Hence,
    the energy detection outcome of MU is not considered for the spectrum sensing
    in CRN. The MU is permanently blocked for any further process and cannot participate
    in spectrum sensing any further. Moreover, the complexity of blockchain based
    model is very low as compared existing models. Declaration of Competing Interest

    Metrics Abstract: A massive number of devices are expected to fulfill the missions
    of sensing, processing and control in cyber-physical IoT systems with new applications
    and connectivity requirements. In this context, scarce spectrum resources must
    accommodate high traffic volume with stringent requirements of low latency, high
    reliability, and energy efficiency. Conventional centralized network architectures
    may not be able to fulfill these requirements due to congestion in backhaul links.
    This article presents a novel design of an RDNA for IoT that leverages the latest
    advances of mobile devices (e.g., their capability to act as access points, storing
    and computing capabilities) to dynamically harvest unused resources and mitigate
    network congestion. However, traffic dynamics may compromise the availability
    of terminal access points and channels, and thus network connectivity. The proposed
    design embraces solutions at the physical, access, networking, application, and
    business layers to improve network robustness. The high density of mobile devices
    provides alternatives for close connectivity, reducing interference and latency,
    and thus increasing reliability and energy efficiency. Moreover, the computing
    capabilities of mobile devices project smartness onto the edge, which is desirable
    for autonomous and intelligent decision making. A case study is included to illustrate
    the performance of RDNA. Potential applications of this architecture in the context
    of IoT are outlined. Finally, some challenges for future research are presented.

    Publisher: IEEE Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new paradigm that
    will connect a plethora of physical objects to the Internet and enable them to
    make intelligent decisions. The underlying technologies of IoT include RFID, sensor
    networks, pervasive computing, communication technologies, and Internet protocols.
    In IoT, objects may collaborate and connect to the Internet in a smart way without
    human intervention to provide new applications. These applications include transportation,
    manufacturing, healthcare, industrial automation, and emergency handling, offering
    great market opportunities. The analysis of data trends anticipates that a vast
    majority of IoT applications will demand high-reliability and low-latency services
    from service providers. In this context reliability refers to the capability of
    guaranteeing successful message delivery within a given latency bound, and latency
    refers to the time elapsed from when data is transmitted (e.g., by an object)
    until it is received by the destination. In Fig. 1, the latency and reliability
    requirements are shown for the most popular IoT applications with the latency
    varying between 1 ms (ultra-low) and 100 ms (low) and the reliability between
    1–10−4 (high) and 1–10−9 (ultra-high). Numbers are indicative and may vary for
    each application area. Mission-critical applications such as factory automation
    require ultra-high reliability and ultra-low latency, while process automation
    is less demanding. In order to meet these requirements, the evolution of LTE for
    cellular IoT focuses on extending the battery life of IoT devices and optimizing
    coverage, capacity, and deployment costs with the introduction of enhanced machine-type
    communication (eMTC) and narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). These can be adopted in either
    cellular or unlicensed spectrum communications. For further details on communication
    technologies and standardization efforts for IoT we refer the reader to the survey
    by Palattella et al. [1]. Despite the existing connectivity solutions, more comprehensive
    work is needed in the design of new architectures that provision communication
    and computing resources to successfully support massive IoT deployments. The new
    architectures should scale operationally and economically with the expansion of
    IoT and provide smart functionalities for autonomous reasoning among objects.
    Figure 1. Reliability and latency requirements in IoT. Show All Several works
    propose architectures to improve connectivity for specific IoT applications. Schleicher
    et al. [2] developed an architecture for smart city applications and identified
    key aspects for its implementation. Wang et al. [3] presented an energy-efficient
    architecture for Industrial IoT and proposed a sleep scheduling and wakeup protocol
    to extend the lifetime of the whole system. Xu et al. [4] analyzed the integration
    of IoT with existing networked systems including cloud computing, the Internet,
    smartphones, and industrial networks. With the large-scale expansion of IoT, cloud-computing-based
    architectures aim to provide complete coverage of processing, computation, and
    storage demands in data centers. However, the centralization of cloud computing
    and the growing traffic demands of IoT may result in huge bottlenecks degrading
    network performance. Edge computing architectures could potentially overcome the
    drawbacks of this approach, moving service provisioning closer to the network
    edge. Three edge computing architectures have been proposed so far: mobile edge
    computing, fog computing, and cloudlets. Mobile edge computing deploys cloud servers
    at base stations (BSs) bringing computational capability closer to end users.
    The business and technical benefits of mobile edge computing and its integration
    with IoT are discussed in [5]. Fog computing edge routers, originally proposed
    by Cisco for IoT traffic, carry out computing tasks even closer to users. Sun
    et al. [6] proposed a hierarchical fog computing architecture to provide flexible
    IoT services. They showed that it substantially reduces the traffic load in the
    core network and the delay between IoT devices and computing resources as compared
    to traditional IoT architectures. The concept of cloudlets is an extension of
    the cloud integrated with WiFi and cellular networks. It is motivated by the fact
    that it is easy to deploy in coffee shops or office premises for near-real-time
    provisioning. Regardless of the previous efforts to improve the quality of service
    in IoT, a holistic approach is needed to improve the robustness of edge computing
    architectures for IoT to face the dynamic characteristics of wireless network
    traffic, which result in intermittent connectivity with objects and consequently
    degrade data quality. Furthermore, in the process of moving service provisioning
    toward the edge, mobile devices keep advancing technologically and getting smarter
    regarding both their communication and computing capabilities. However, these
    capabilities have not been fully explored yet in the IoT context. This article
    takes a step forward in the design and networking of edge computing wireless architectures
    for IoT and presents a novel design of a robust dynamic edge network architecture
    (RDNA). The architectural design encompasses solutions at different layers to
    enhance network robustness against dynamic availability of resources and provide
    ubiquitous service for IoT. In RDNA, connectivity is provided by users who act
    as access points for objects and share their storing and computing capabilities,
    improving scalability, latency, reliability, spectrum efficiency, and energy efficiency.
    Besides, the smart features of mobile devices facilitate autonomous and intelligent
    decision making at the edge, simplifying control and monitoring of the network.
    In the next section, we elaborate the design methodology of RDNA as well as its
    smart features and applications. Then we provide some hints for possible business
    models. Following that, we describe a case study to illustrate its performance
    in terms of latency, reliability, and energy efficiency. Next, we highlight some
    design challenges and future research directions. Finally, we draw our conclusions.
    Robust Dynamic Network Architecture Preliminaries The smart features of advanced
    user terminals project smartness onto the edge, which could be exploited to simplify
    control and monitoring in a DNA with large number of IoT devices. However, to
    meet the heterogeneous, sometimes exceptionally stringent, requirements of IoT
    traffic in a dynamic setting, a holistic approach to improving network robustness
    is needed. Initially, dynamic network architectures (DNAs) were proposed to offload
    traffic in cellular networks by incentivizing users to share their connectivity
    and act as access points for neighboring cellular users [7], [8]. The intermittent
    availability of these access points renders the architecture dynamic. Shams et
    al. [7] developed a framework for topology reconfiguration in DNA and showed that
    by encoding the problem with a genetic algorithm, the optimum topology can track
    network dynamics and thus satisfy users'' quality of service (QoS) requirements.
    Then Lorenzo et al. [8] incorporated cognitive capabilities into DNA and showed
    that underutilized spectrum can be shared temporally and spatially, increasing
    network capacity significantly. DNA gains in terms of capacity and revenues make
    its extension to IoT promising. In particular, the motivation for this extension
    is threefold. First, the dynamic traffic bursts in IoT can benefit from the additional
    capacity generated by user participation, anticipating high reuse of network resources.
    Second, the underlying computing capabilities of user terminals in DNA have not
    been explored yet and may satisfy the computing needs of IoT traffic. Finally,
    the smart features of advanced user terminals project smartness onto the edge,
    which could be exploited to simplify control and monitoring in a DNA with a large
    number of IoT devices. However, to meet the heterogeneous, sometimes exceptionally
    stringent, requirements of IoT traffic in a dynamic setting, a holistic approach
    to improving network robustness is needed. Architectural Design We propose RDNA,
    which leverages the latest advances of wireless devices (e.g., their capability
    to act as access points, storing and computing capabilities) to provide Internet
    connectivity and computing capabilities to lightweight IoT objects. The architecture
    is illustrated in Fig. 2 (left). In this architecture, user terminals (phones,
    PCs, tablets) share their connectivity and act as access points for IoT objects
    for some rewards. We denote these access points enabled by user terminals as terminal
    access points (TAPs). In Fig. 2, TAPs U1 and U3 collect data from objects O1,
    O2, and O3. The data collected may be used to serve those users or user U2. In
    a simple business model, an IoT service provider (IoTSP) buys data from object
    owners and organizes the RDNA by incentivizing its users to share their connectivity
    with IoT objects to meet the demands of an IoT application. RDNA creates an IoT
    market with opportunities for different providers to cooperate, such as a storage
    provider negotiating the price to store long-term data at user terminals (U1,
    U3) and distributing that data to other parts of the network (U2), in collaboration
    with a cloud/fog provider. Figure 2. Illustration of RDNA (left) and levels of
    robustness enhancement of RDNA (right). Show All The communication and computing
    capabilities of user terminals are highly heterogeneous and should be managed
    intelligently to match the heterogeneous demands of IoT traffic. For example,
    TAPs with wired connectivity (U1, a PC) may serve high-priority traffic requiring
    medium computing processing. Mobile TAPs with wireless connectivity (U3, a phone
    or tablet) may serve high-/ medium-priority traffic requiring medium/low computing
    power. This will help to reduce network congestion and preserve dedicated access
    points or BSs with more powerful computing resources (cloud/fog) for medium-/low-priority
    traffic that requires high/medium computing power. The high density of user terminals
    brings many opportunities for connectivity and distribution of the collected data
    throughout the network. Besides, its integration within the cellular infrastructure
    favors interoperability and seamless addition of heterogeneous IoT objects, facilitating
    scalability and large-scale expansion of RDNA. Furthermore, RDNA improves energy
    efficiency by utilizing short-distance transmissions to reduce interference, and
    spectrum efficiency by reusing local available channels. In the following we present
    the design methodology to realize its full potential. Then we explore the smart
    features enabled by RDNA, and its possible applications and business models. Since
    connectivity is provided by mobile user terminals that have limited resources
    (i.e., battery, CPU, memory) with their own traffic needs, the availability of
    TAPs and channels is dynamic. This may compromise connectivity and thus data quality.
    In this context, robustness is the property of the network to stay connected under
    dynamic availability of resources, which has a direct impact on reliability, latency,
    and energy efficiency, as well as on overall network performance. In the subsequent
    development, we present design solutions to improve the robustness of RDNA at
    different levels: physical, access, networking, application, and business. These
    solutions are illustrated in Fig. 2. They may be combined to attain the desired
    performance. Physical Level Data Redundancy TAPs may aggregate data by collecting
    it from multiple objects, as shown in Fig. 2 (physical level). The degree of data
    redundancy - repeated data collected for backup and recovery purposes - should
    be adjusted to satisfy the requirements of the IoT application given the traffic
    dynamics and to save the energy of objects. An efficient way to control data redundancy
    and maximize resource utilization is by using pricing schemes. In [9], Luong et
    al. survey the latest economic models used for data collection in IoT. Access
    Level Cognitive Radio Capabilities Interference affects connectivity and degrades
    quality of communication links. Equipping objects with cognitive capabilities
    enables them to detect and avoid interference, and opens the possibility of utilizing
    additionally available communication spectrum. Current regulations of radio spectrum
    are based on static spectrum allocation policies where spectrum is granted to
    license holders for long periods of time in large geographic areas. Unfortunately,
    it has been observed that many allocated spectrum portions are intermittently
    utilized and hence may be reused at different times and locations. However, spectrum
    sensing and spectrum switching processes will consume additional energy; thus,
    they may deplete the battery of lightweight IoT objects. Despite the existing
    works on energy-efficient and green-energy-powered cognitive radio networks, cognitive
    radio capabilities might not be fully exploited without an appropriate network
    architecture. In RDNA, TAPs can sense the available spectrum and assist IoT objects
    without cognitive capabilities so that they could still benefit from cognitive
    radio technology (e.g., indicating to IoT objects which channel can be used).
    For more details on cognitive harvesting network architectures, please see [10].
    The links established by harvesting available spectrum are referred to as cognitive
    links. Service providers may also trade available spectrum to meet IoT traffic
    demands and guarantee required performance levels [8]. In Fig. 2 (access level),
    objects O1 and O2 connect to primary users/TAPs PU1 and PU2 via cognitive links,
    and O3 also transmits by cognitive links to TAP PU3. The primary users are the
    licensed holders who have higher priority in the usage of the spectrum, while
    the objects (secondary users) have lower priority. Distant objects may reuse channels
    to avoid interference. Channel Redundancy Backup channels increase link reliability
    against traffic dynamics through channel diversity. Backup channels can be licensed
    or unlicensed to serve high-priority or low-priority traffic, respectively. A
    combination of both can be used to achieve different performance and cost trade-offs.
    As shown in Fig. 2, 01 uses redundant cognitive links to connect to PU1, while
    03 has a licensed channel and a backup harvested channel to connect to PU2. A
    detailed analysis of the benefits of channel redundancy in cognitive networks
    is given in [11]. Access Point Redundancy Since the availability of TAPs is dynamic,
    backup access points increase connectivity availability by spatial diversity.
    TAPs may have wireless or wired connections, resulting in different levels of
    reliability. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 where O2 keeps PU1 and PU2 as backup
    TAPs, and each one has a different type of backhaul connectivity. Object O3 combines
    the diversity of licensed and unlicensed channels with redundant TAPs PU2 and
    PU3. A framework to optimize the number of access points to meet quality of service
    constraints given a fixed cost per access point is elaborated in [7]. Further
    work on distributed dynamic scheduling schemes is needed to flexibly utilize the
    available resources. Networking Level Collaborative Data Sberine Subscribers demanding
    the same data may collaborate by sharing their data using device-to-device (D2D)
    communications and serve as backup for each other''s connections. The data can
    be freely exchanged in a social network or through a content provider that incentivizes
    users to share their data. The communication can be established by D2D links using
    licensed or unlicensed channels. For example, in Fig. 2 (networking level), PU2
    and PU3 share their data with SU1 and PU4, respectively. In [8], the benefits
    of collaborative networking for users and operators are outlined. Epidemic algorithms
    seem promising for data dissemination in large networks since they are simple
    to implement and robust against failures. Distributed Computing Mobile terminals
    may share out their computing capabilities. Since they have heterogeneous capabilities
    and limited power, highly demanding computing tasks should be decomposed and distributed
    to different terminals. Distributed computing increases reliability as there is
    no single point of failure, and it is more cost effective than a single high-end
    computer. In RDNA, a subscriber may request data collected by another user terminal,
    and on the way, the computing capabilities of the terminals forwarding the data
    can be exploited. For instance, SU1 may request data collected by PU1, and thus,
    PU1 and PU2 may perform related computing tasks. If the computing power is not
    enough, heavy computing tasks could be delegated to the cloud/fog, as illustrated
    by the colored cloud. Application Level Caching Terminals can collect context-aware
    information regarding traffic demands for the IoTSP to deploy RDNA in congested
    areas with appropriate robustness. Activating TAPs in such areas contributes to
    the sustainable deployment of RDNA, since user terminals have limited resources
    and incentivizing them to cooperate incurs a cost for the IoTSP. Popular contents
    can be stored at the network edge to reduce backhaul capacity. Users can share
    the storage capacity of their terminals temporarily. Unlike collaborative sharing,
    in caching, users sharing their storage space (PU1, PU2, and PU3) may not be interested
    in the data to be stored. Cache placement should be optimized to efficiently allocate
    storage space considering data lifetime, available battery at user terminals,
    and the geographic area where that data is popular. Learning mechanisms may help
    to decide what content to cache. Dedicated access points and BSs can be used to
    store long-term data and higher data volumes. Bringing content close to end users
    reduces latency and traffic load, avoiding duplicate transmissions of the same
    content across the whole network. Business Level Incentives Incentive mechanisms
    are curcial for the adoption and success of RDNA. They should be carefully designed
    to encourage users to collaborate and share their resources and foster good behaviors.
    Given the heterogeneity of user terminals and their capabilities, user valuation
    of its remaining resources should be considered in the design of incentives. Figure
    2 (business level) shows the incentives that the IoTSP offers to TAP PU1 to share
    its connectivity, as well as the revenue earned by SU1 and PU2. Multi-Provider
    Cooperation The IoT market will create business opportunities in RDNA between
    users and multiple providers. For example, in Fig. 2, PU1 provides connectivity
    to objects O1 and O2 whose data have been requested by secondary users SU2 and
    SU3. IoTSPs of primary and secondary networks cooperate to serve those users.
    SU3 will pay more than SU2 for the data since SU3 requests a service that requires
    additional cloud/fog computing capabilities (colored cloud). The business relationship
    between the parties involved can be exploited to guarantee service delivery. Smart
    Features: Automation, Reconfigurability, and Intelligence User terminals are getting
    smarter and smarter and can offer substantial storage, communications, control,
    configuration, measurement, and management capabilities at the network edge. Terminals
    can collect context-aware information regarding traffic demands for the IoTSP
    to deploy RDNA in congested areas with appropriate robustness. Activating TAPs
    in such areas contributes to the sustainable deployment of RDNA, since user terminals
    have limited resources, and incentivizing them to cooperate incurs a cost for
    the IoTSP. By increasing the number of TAPs, the coverage of the IoT as well as
    the control of the network and physical systems improves. The resulting wider
    coverage of IoT facilitates remote control of objects and ubiquitous positioning.
    Additionally, empowering objects with cognitive capabilities yields high configuration
    autonomy by dynamic spectrum access, self-adaptation to dynamic scenarios, and
    interference avoidance. A detailed description of how cognitive capabilities contribute
    to intelligent decision making is given in [12]. Monitoring network conditions
    (traffic demands, spectrum availability, channel quality) is crucial to reconfigure
    the network and maintain required reliability and latency levels. The computing
    power of user devices further broadens the reasoning and reconfiguration capabilities
    of RDNA toward autonomous operations based on the contexts or circumstances. The
    autonomous control and monitoring of RDNA reduces signaling, which is crucial
    in the presence of a large number of IoT devices. Providing nodes with information
    entails excessive signaling and overhead cost. Machine learning schemes such as
    multi-arm bandits can be used to deal with uncertainty and lack of information
    to solve resource management problems distributively (e.g., TAPs could make their
    own decisions about scheduling). Research on intelligent distributed scheduling
    schemes is left for future work. The proximity of TAPs accelerates content, service,
    and application responsiveness from the edge and may allow performing time-critical
    control applications such as healthcare monitoring. Data provided by objects have
    diverse levels of reliability and trust. Since users value information differently,
    the intelligence at the network edge can contribute to match user valuations with
    the expected level of trustworthiness of the data provided. Behavioral game theory
    is an emerging framework for decision making in the presence of varying levels
    of intelligence, and hence can be used to study RDNA and the corresponding strategies
    to boost its performance. The smart features in RDNA enable highly improved scalability,
    adaptability to different situations, and initiation and execution of services
    with minimal human intervention. Applications of this Architecture RDNA operates
    within the existing cellular infrastructure, facilitating device interoperability,
    and harvesting communication and computing resources network-wide. In the following,
    we describe some possible applications of this architecture for IoT, which can
    be used as basis for more specific applications. Flexible Internetworking IoT
    devices are highly heterogeneous and generate data with different life spans.
    RDNA makes internetworking flexible by fulfilling connectivity requirements with
    TAPs in a dynamic environment without additional infrastructure cost. Therefore,
    it provides low-cost ubiquitous networking toward the Internet of Everything (IoE),
    where objects and humans interconnect seamlessly. Computational Offloading TAPs
    can perform computing tasks. Choosing among the computing capabilities of TAPs,
    dedicated access points or BSs will depend on the computational load, tolerated
    latency, and remaining resources at the terminals (e.g., battery, CPU, memory).
    Cloud/Fog Computing Fog computing extends cloud computing services to the edge.
    It improves the efficiency of cloud computing by reducing the amount of data transported
    to the cloud for processing, analysis, and storage. TAPs can be part of the for
    paradigm, delegating long permanency data to the cloud. Collaborative Computing
    Mobile terminals can combine their computing capabilities to jointly accomplish
    a common task, increasing their individual computational power. Contextual Computing
    Data collected from objects can be analyzed and combined with context-aware data
    collected by TAPs themselves. The data collected may include information about
    user preferences, location, and surroundings. Transparent Computing RDNA intelligence
    enables the network to solve user problems learning from their habits and offer
    services transparently to end users. In [13] an implementation of an IoT architecture
    based on transparent computing is presented along with a detailed description
    of its underlying challenges. Content Delivery The robust distributed network
    formed by TAPs allows serving contents to subscribers with high availability and
    high performance. A content provider can collaborate with an IoTSP to bring contents
    closer to the edge by storing them in TAPs. In turn, the IoTSP can build a content
    infrastructure and control network resources for efficient data delivery. Mobile
    Big Data Analytics Datastored at terminals can be used to extract meaningful data
    and identify data patterns. This can further increase the intelligence at the
    edge, encouraging autonomy of IoT devices. For instance, data analytics can optimize
    content delivery by providing insight on the most demanded contents in certain
    areas of the network. Business Opportunities Internetworking and resource trading
    at different RDNA levels for the transmission of IoT data create an IoT market
    with plenty of business opportunities. Figure 3 outlines the interaction among
    different entities of this market and the resources to trade. IoTSP negotiates
    with object owners the price for the data to serve its end users. Since objects
    have limited capabilities and IoT data is valid for a limited time, IoTSP encourages
    users to share the connectivity and computing capabilities of their terminals
    to meet IoT service requirements. If there are not enough terminals or computing
    resources available, IoTSP may negotiate with other service providers to access
    the communication and computing capabilities of their users. The benefits of multi-operator
    collaboration for data and spectrum trading are described in [8], [14] for different
    networks. If a data item is requested by end users that are sparsely distributed
    throughout the network, IoTSP may negotiate with the fog/cloud provider to distribute
    the data. Popular data can be cached in TAPs, dedicated access points, or BSs
    depending on user locations. A more comprehensive survey in [9] summarizes recent
    economic and pricing models used in IoT for data collection and wireless communications.
    These models can be extended to RDNA to study topological formation for user terminals
    collaboration, coverage optimization, computing task allocation, and content distribution.
    The advantages of economic and pricing models are mainly twofold. First, they
    provide a theoretical framework to study revenue generation, and thus analyze
    benefits and costs. Second, IoT entities have different interests and objectives.
    Pricing can be used to model the interaction among different entities and encourage
    them to reach an agreement. Figure 3. Interaction between different entities in
    the IoT market. Show All RDNA scales operationally and economically with the proliferation
    of IoT traffic since its expansion creates more opportunities to collaborate.
    However, to realize the expected economic impact in IoT, a careful design of economic
    models is needed to exploit the collaboration opportunities. Case Study We consider
    an RDNA with objects I={1, 2,…,  n o } and TAPs J={1, 2, …,  n TAP } that provide
    Internet connection to those objects and perform pre-processing and data storage.
    Objects transmit their data using cognitive links in the set B={1,2, …, B} , which
    have identical bandwidth equal to 1. RDNA serves n s end users who access IoT
    data through the BS or TAPs. Channel availability varies in time and space as
    these bands may be occupied by primary users (PUs). We first assume that the IoTSP
    has no prior knowledge of channel demands of secondary objects (SUs), and later
    on we utilize the smartness at the edge to monitor such demands. We denote by
    a b ij the probability that channel b at link l ij is available for object transmission
    [11]. Topology formation is based on channel availability and user terminals''
    availability to share their connectivity. The signaling exchange for distributed
    topology formation has order O( n o n TAP B) in the worst case, where there is
    no prior knowledge on the preferred association. We use an absorbing Markov chain
    model, where TAPs denote the absorbing states as in [11], and extend it to model
    the topology evolution in IoT. The latency is obtained as τ j = τ o + τ p + τ
    a where τ 0 is the transmission latency from the object to the TAP, τ p is the
    pre-processing delay, and τ a is the access delay of each user to RDNA. We assume
    that the IoTSP has 40 end users. Figure 4 shows the mean latency vs. n TAP for
    different values of n o . It can be observed that increasing n TAP reduces the
    latency exponentially. On the other hand, increasing the number of objects n o
    increases the latency, especially when n TAP is small. Let us now take advantage
    of the intelligence provided by TAPs to monitor channel demands of objects. This
    knowledge is utilized by the IoTSP to reduce the connectivity interruptions by
    primary user returns and assign channels to the objects that will be available
    during their transmission period. As shown in Fig. 4, smartness at the edge may
    reduce latency up to 30 percent for small n TAP , In addition, if users collaborate
    and share their data using D2D links, latency decreases up to 40 percent. The
    mean power consumption for transmission, computation, and storage is plotted in
    Fig. 5. The transmission power is set to 0.75 W, and the power consumption for
    computing and storage varies as in [15]. The power used for channel switching
    has been neglected. As the transmission distance decreases with n TAP , the mean
    power consumption decreases accordingly. Figure 4. Mean latency vs. number of
    TAPs. Show All Figure 5. Mean power consumption vs. number of TAPs. Show All Let
    us now determine the redundancy needed to guarantee a level of reliability ξ min
    . We define link reliability ξ ij as the probability that the channel is available
    (no PU return). We consider that PU arrivals are independent and identically distributed
    (i.i.d). Hence, link reliability is the same on every channel, ξ ij = a b ij .
    If a PU returns to the channel currently allocated to an SU, the transmission
    will be interrupted, and the SU will switch to another channel. Redundant Channels
    As we seek spectrum-efficient solutions, the switching interval should be the
    maximum that satisfies link reliability requirements so that the number of channels
    is minimized. Thus, the channel switching time per link per message can be determined
    as t ∗ w =arg max t w  t w ⋅(ξ( t w )− ξ min ) , where t ∗ w is the maximum duration
    of the time interval that satisfies ξ min . The more restrictive ξ min is, the
    more often the channel should be switched to avoid PU return. Similarly, for a
    maximum tolerable latency τ max the number of backup channels needed can be obtained
    as w ∗ =arg min w≥ w min ( τ max −τ(w) ) 2 , where τ(w) is the delay when w backup
    channels are used. Redundant Terminal Access Points Let us assume that each object
    selects a set of TAPs on channel b denoted by set J b i . Introducing n a =| J
    b i | backup TAPs will improve reliability to ξ ′ ij =1−(1− ξ ij ) n a . Since
    energy cost will increase with the additional access points, the objective is
    to minimize n a to meet the required reliability level: ( J i ) ∗ =arg min ( J
    b i ) ( ξ ′ ( J b i )− ξ min / n a ) , where ξ ′ ( J b i ) denotes the reliability
    level when the set of backup TAPs J b i is used. In Fig. 6, the number of channels
    w needed to satisfy ξ min is shown. We assume different ratios of traffic loads
    in the secondary (objects) and primary network where μ S is the service rate of
    SUs and λ P is the arrival rate of PUs. We can observe that the more imbalanced
    the network is (i.e., μ S =6 λ P ), the lower w is. Besides, increasing the number
    of backup TAPs significantly reduces w . A reliability of ξ min =0.999 can be
    achieved with 1 to 2 channels and 2 to 3 backup TAPs when μ S =6 λ P . Besides,
    by exploiting smartness at the edge to monitor the traffic in the secondary network,
    we can achieve ξ min =1 with only 1 channel. By combining channel and access point
    redundancy, different reliability requirements can be achieved at a reasonable
    cost. Figure 6. Number of redundant channels vs. required reliability. Show All
    Design Challenges and Future Research RDNA moves service provisioning to the edge,
    contributing to the expansion of IoT. It also brings new challenges and promising
    research directions as highlighted below. Internet of Everything In the future
    IoE, human-type communications (HTC) and object-type communications (OTC) will
    coexist and share limited wireless resources. Each communication type has different
    needs and capabilities. For example, HTC may require high data rate, while OTC
    may have stringent latency requirements. Thus, the main challenge is to develop
    resource allocation policies that accommodate the heterogeneous nature of IoE
    traffic with various requirements on service quality. Security and Privacy Service
    providers want to collect as much information as possible regarding user preferences,
    behavior, and localization, among other metrics, to bring smartness to the edge.
    This poses a serious challenge for user privacy. Different service providers may
    need to access content of each other''s networks, further complicating security
    concerns. In addition, sharing connectivity and computing capabilities of mobile
    devices poses extra security design challenges. To protect their privacy, users
    need to restrict collaboration to other highly reliable and trustworthy users.
    Likewise, service providers need to ensure the trustworthiness of their subscribers
    and encourage honest behaviors through proper incentive mechanisms. Mobility Support
    IoT objects have limited transmission range. Mobility support is important to
    guarantee their connectivity with mobile TAPs. The smart features of RDNA will
    help to identify new connectivity options and adapt the connections to the circumstances
    on the fly to satisfy user demands. Thus, further work is needed in smart topology
    reconfiguration mechanisms for RDNA in response to mobility. Business Models In
    the IoT market, entities will change their roles depending on situations and environments.
    For instance, an IoTSP may act as a data provider or data consumer. A user may
    buy data and later on sell it to other users. Thus, a sound business model should
    adapt flexibly to the changing roles of all entities and manage them accordingly.
    Conclusions This article presents a novel design of a robust dynamic edge network
    architecture (RDNA) to mitigate the congestion problem in wireless networks, paving
    the way toward the full realization of IoT. This architectural design leverages
    the latest technological advances of mobile devices to provide low-cost ubiquitous
    communications and computing. A holistic approach to improving network robustness
    is developed, which includes solutions at the physical, access, networking, application,
    and business layers. The expected performance in terms of reliability, latency,
    and energy efficiency emphasizes the potential of RDNA for a global IoT architecture.
    Besides, RDNA brings smart functionalities to the network edge and plenty of business
    opportunities. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been funded by grants TEC2016-76465-C2-2-R,

  analysis: 'CR-LPWAN is a promising technology for IoT applications, as it combines
    the benefits of CR with the long-range and low-power consumption characteristics
    of LPWAN. However, there are a number of challenges that need to be addressed
    before CR-LPWAN can be widely adopted.


    **PHY Layer Challenges**


    * **Rendezvous**

    The rendezvous problem refers to the difficulty of two or more CR-LPWAN nodes
    agreeing on a common control channel for communication. This is a challenging
    problem, as CR-LPWAN nodes may be located in different parts of the spectrum and
    may have different channel hopping patterns.


    * **Spectrum Sensing**

    Spectrum sensing is a fundamental function of any CR system, and it is particularly
    challenging in CR-LPWAN networks due to the low power levels of the signals and
    the presence of interference from other devices. Developing effective and efficient
    spectrum sensing algorithms is a key research challenge for CR-LPWAN.


    * **Spectrum Mobility**

    Spectrum mobility is the ability of a CR system to move to a new frequency band
    when the current band is occupied by a licensed user. This is a challenging problem,
    as it requires the CR system to find a new band and to reconfigure its transmitter
    and receiver quickly and efficiently.


    * **Incorporating Adaptive CR Technologies**

    Incorporating adaptive CR technologies into LPWAN transceivers can improve the
    performance of CR-LPWAN systems by enabling them to adjust their transmission
    parameters to the changing environment. However, this requires the development
    of new algorithms and techniques that are tailored to the specific requirements
    of CR-LPWAN.


    **Upper Layer Challenges**


    * **Connectivity Challenges**

    CR-LPWAN networks face a number of connectivity challenges, including compatibility
    issues between different devices and technologies, maintainability issues, and
    signaling issues. Developing solutions to these challenges is essential for ensuring
    the widespread adoption of CR-LPWAN.


    * **Networking Challenges**

    CR-LPWAN networks also face a number of networking challenges, including routing
    challenges, security challenges, and scalability challenges. Developing solutions
    to these challenges is essential for ensuring the reliability and performance
    of CR-LPWAN networks.


    **Relevance Score**

    the outline point and review with highly insightful, reliable, and up-to-date
    information. A must-include for the review.

    **Limitations**

    The paper does not provide any specific research challenges or future directions
    for addressing the rendezvous problem in CR-LPWAN. Additionally, the paper does
    not discuss the challenges of developing adaptive CR technologies for LPWAN transceivers
    in detail. Finally, the paper does not provide any specific examples of routing
    challenges, security challenges, or scalability challenges in CR-LPWAN networks.


    **Additional Comments**

    of the challenges and future potential of CR-LPWAN. The paper is well-organized
    and easy to follow, and it provides a good balance of technical detail and high-level
    discussion. The paper is also well-referenced, with a good mix of recent and classic

    \ areas, such as smart metering, smart homes, smart industries, and smart\ncity\
    \ architectures, to name but a few. These application areas typically comprise\

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is deﬁned as a communication network that connects\
    \ things with\nnaming, sensing, and processing abilities [1]. Speciﬁcally, the\
    \ International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU) refers to these things as objects\
    \ of the physical world (that is, physical things) or\nthe information world (virtual\
    \ things), which are capable of being identiﬁed and integrated into\ncommunication\
    \ networks [2]. These “physical things” can be vehicles, home appliances, and/or\
    \ other\nitems/devices embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and actuators.\
    \ The ITU has also proffered\na technical deﬁnition for the IoT as “a global infrastructure\
    \ for the information society, enabling\nadvanced services by interconnecting\
    \ physical and virtual things based on existing and evolving\ninteroperable information\
    \ and communication technologies” [2]. Following these deﬁnitions, it is\nevident\
    \ that communication networks are undoubtedly a fundamental component of any IoT\
    \ reference\nmodel.\nConsequently, many IoT-based communication networks require\
    \ that certain demands\nare satisﬁed, such as to provide low power consumption\
    \ rates, long-range transmission, low cost,\nhigh data rates, and high scalability\
    \ for different IoT applications [3]. However, since most existing\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 6837; doi:10.3390/s20236837\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020,\
    \ 20, 6837\n2 of 41\ncellular communication technologies such as the 3G, 4G, and\
    \ 5G cellular technologies do not satisfy\nmany of these requirements, such as\
    \ the provision of low power consumption rates, long single\nhop transmission\
    \ ranges, and low device development/deployment cost; thus, it is pertinent that\n\
    alternative solutions be provided. Therefore, low power wide area network (LPWAN)\
    \ technologies\nhave recently sufﬁced as suitable communication preferences for\
    \ many IoT-based applications.\nLPWANs are popular for a number of unique characteristics,\
    \ some of which are: they provide\nlow power consumption rates [4], simpliﬁed\
    \ network topologies, low developmental and purchase\ncost of devices, long transmission\
    \ ranges (distance), simple and scalable deployment schemes, thin\ninfrastructure,\
    \ small data frame sizes, albeit at low data rates [4,5]. These characteristics\
    \ closely\nalign with the aforementioned demands of many IoT applications, thereby\
    \ serving to motivate\nthe present drive towards the development and performance\
    \ improvement of new and existing\nLPWAN technologies [6–10]. Although LPWANs\
    \ may not necessarily satisfy all the communication\nrequirements of all the different\
    \ IoT-based application areas, such as the provision of high data\nrates, nevertheless,\
    \ they are envisioned to complement other communication technologies towards\n\
    guaranteeing the holistic success of all IoT-based applications. Consequently,\
    \ it is envisaged that the\nbusiness capacity for LPWANs will surge in the coming\
    \ years based on an estimation of over 700 million\nIoT devices to be connected\
    \ over LPWAN standards by 2021 [11]. In this regard, some notable\napplication\
    \ areas that aim to beneﬁt from LPWAN technologies include, but are not limited\
    \ to ocean\nmonitoring, smart city systems, smart grid, smart metering, soil monitoring,\
    \ home automation,\nsmart industries, wild life survey, intelligent transport\
    \ systems, and forest management. This myriad of\ndifferent application areas\
    \ emphasizes the importance of LPWAN in the overall realizable architecture\n\
    of the IoT.\nHowever, many LPWAN technologies are typically beleaguered by speciﬁc\
    \ PHY layer challenges\nsuch as increased interference, limited data rates, and\
    \ spectral inefﬁciency. These limitations are\ninherent based on the fact that\
    \ most LPWANs are largely deployed in the presently congested industrial,\nscientiﬁc,\
    \ and medical (ISM) bands. Thus, an approach towards addressing these challenges\
    \ may\nrequire the innovative integration of cognitive radio (CR) technologies\
    \ in LPWAN. CR refers to\nan intelligent radio system developed primarily to address\
    \ issues pertaining to inefﬁcient spectral\nutilization. It was conceived following\
    \ the relatively recent unavailability of radio spectrum for the\ndeployment of\
    \ new wireless technologies. CR aims to take advantage of unused (free) bands\
    \ towards\nimproving the user’s perceived quality of service (QoS) over different\
    \ communication networks.\nThere are several innovative CR technologies presently\
    \ under development, which may greatly\ncomplement both existing and new LPWAN\
    \ technologies; thus, it is pertinent to present an overview\nof these efforts\
    \ and vision as it relates to enhancing different IoT applications.\nThus, in\
    \ this article, we discuss independently both LPWAN and CR features and technologies\
    \ as\na foundation for the potential integration of CR in LPWAN. We highlight\
    \ the concept of CR enabled\nLPWAN systems, termed CR-LPWANs. The potentials of\
    \ CR-LPWAN systems are discussed along\nwith the documentation of speciﬁc research\
    \ challenges, which may limit the realization of CR-LPWAN\nsystems. It is hoped\
    \ that these research directions will spur researchers and LPWAN developers alike\n\
    towards developing future ideas that will drive the next generation of IoT devices.\n\
    Summarily, the present article contributes as follows:\n1.\nIt presents insights\
    \ and a recent overview regarding the use of CR in LPWAN. In particular,\nthe\
    \ use of CR as a potential solution to some known LPWAN problems is considered.\n\
    2.\nIn addition to discussing the concept of CR-LPWAN, the present article provides\
    \ a framework for\nintegrating CR and LPWAN modules into a possible functional\
    \ unit. It describes the front-end of\na generic CR-LPWAN system describing how\
    \ the interlink of each module may contribute to the\nsupport of effective CR-LPWAN\
    \ systems.\n3.\nWe identify speciﬁc challenges that may mitigate against the realization\
    \ of functional CR-LPWAN\nsystems. Speciﬁcally, new insights are provided into\
    \ different research challenges that require the\nuse of adaptive CR technologies\
    \ in LPWAN transceivers.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n3 of 41\n4.\nAn up-to-date information\
    \ is provided pertaining to the development and standardization of\nLPWAN systems\
    \ in general. These include the provision of a summary concerning the origin of\n\
    different LPWAN technologies, and an update regarding the different standard organizations\
    \ and\nspecial groups involved in LPWAN development. An updated list of different\
    \ LPWAN technology\ndevelopers is provided with focus on their potential/adoption\
    \ of CR technology. The use of\nCR is also discussed with regards to the general\
    \ IoT architecture and the different challenges\nin this direction. Essentially,\
    \ this article provides insights and future research considerations\nwith regards\
    \ to the concept of CR in LPWAN technologies, which may interest readers aiming\
    \ to\nexplore this new research trend.\nThe rest of this article is structured\
    \ as follows: related survey articles are discussed in Section 2.\nAn overview\
    \ of LPWAN is provided in Section 3, with a similar overview of CR presented in\
    \ Section 4.\nThen, we discuss the concept of CR-LPWAN in Section 5 where we look\
    \ at its general concept via\na PHY-layer front-end model, network architecture\
    \ and support protocols. Section 6 presents the\npotential beneﬁts of CR-LPWAN\
    \ for IoT, whereas Section 7 discusses challenges and future research\ndirections.\
    \ We conclude in Section 8.\n2. Related Works\nIn this section, we highlight the\
    \ uniqueness of the present article by presenting evidence before\nthis study\
    \ of existing survey and literature review papers considered to be related to\
    \ IoT and the role of\nCR and LPWAN systems in IoT-related applications. We found\
    \ a number of survey articles pertaining\nto IoT and LPWANs, general overview\
    \ of LPWAN, CR in speciﬁc IoT use-cases, and software-deﬁned\nradio (SDR) in IoT\
    \ applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, we found no survey article\n\
    that synthesizes comprehensively information at the PHY, network, and protocol\
    \ levels in order to\ninterrelate the concept of LPWAN, IoT, and CR in view of\
    \ their beneﬁts, challenges, and future research\ndirections. Other notable survey\
    \ articles are discussed, for example, the survey on 5G networks for\nIoT in [12]\
    \ discusses extensively about some IoT associated communication technologies.\
    \ This survey\nprovides insights into the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-based\
    \ LPWAN technologies\nwith focus on supporting massive to critical IoT use-cases.\
    \ In particular, authors provided relevant\nstate-of-the-art information pertaining\
    \ to LPWAN technologies, such as the enhanced machine-type\ncommunication (eMTC),\
    \ extended coverage Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) IoT\n(EC-GSM-IoT),\
    \ Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), and other non-cellular LPWAN technologies including\n\
    LoRa, Sigfox, and Ingenu-RPMA, to name but a few. They noted that there are several\
    \ open research\nchallenges needed to be resolved towards realizing effective\
    \ IoT systems, such as developing effective\ncontrol and management systems for\
    \ IoT networks.\nIn [10], the authors provided an overview of LPWAN technologies\
    \ with focus on LoRa and\nLoRaWAN testbeds. Essentially, they discussed the ﬂaws\
    \ and strengths of works published with\nregards to LoRa technology. This was\
    \ achieved by comparing existing testbeds designed to simulate\nand test different\
    \ LPWAN technologies and protocols. They noted that the network performance\n\
    of LPWANs could be affected by interference from other networks, in addition to\
    \ the logical and\ngeographical layout of LPWAN networks. Similarly, authors in\
    \ [13] reviewed the opportunities,\nchallenges and future directions in LPWANs.\
    \ Notably, they mentioned challenges related to the\ndevelopment of LPWAN technologies,\
    \ including spectrum limitation, coexistence issues, mobility\nmanagement and\
    \ scalability.\nRaza et al., in [4], provided an extensive overview of LPWANs\
    \ with focus on the design goals and\ntechniques exploited in different LPWAN\
    \ technologies. They surveyed different LPWAN technologies\nand standards noting\
    \ that these LPWAN technologies share similar approaches, thus experiencing\n\
    similar limitations and challenges. It was noted in [4] that most LPWAN standards\
    \ focus on the\nphysical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers with little\
    \ attention to the upper layers,\nthereby stimulating the need for additional\
    \ research solutions to upper-layer challenges. Many other\nsurvey articles have\
    \ been identiﬁed in [14–17], which focus on describing enabling technologies for\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6837\n4 of 41\nLPWANs, including speciﬁc technologies such as\
    \ LoRa, Sigfox, and NB-IoT. Most of these articles\nhave identiﬁed a number of\
    \ challenges and future research directions towards improving LPWAN\ntechnologies.\n\
    The use of CR to improve the performance of IoT systems was examined in some other\
    \ survey\narticles. For example, the use of CR in smart grid communication networks\
    \ (SGCN) was surveyed\nin [18]. Speciﬁcally, a detailed comparison was provided\
    \ between wired and wireless communication\ntechnologies with focus on the use\
    \ of modern concepts such as CR, smart utility networks (SUNs)\nand the use of\
    \ TV white spaces (TVWS) within different smart grid (SG) environments. Khan et\
    \ al.,\nin [19], surveyed the use of CR in IoT with focus on applications, architectures,\
    \ spectrum related issues\nand future research directions. Interestingly, they\
    \ highlighted some reasons why IoT requires the\nincorporation of CR, including\
    \ the case for efﬁcient spectrum utilization, intelligent decision making,\nefﬁcient\
    \ bandwidth allocation for IoT objects, and the alleviation of interference situations.\n\
    Kobo et al., in [20], surveyed the challenges and design requirements for developing\n\
    software-deﬁned wireless sensor networks (SDWSN) with focus on their application\
    \ to IoT.\nThey discussed the use of CR in SDWSN and emphasized the importance\
    \ of CR and the need for\nfurther research with regards to improving the performance\
    \ of CR-based SDWSN. In a separate survey,\nauthors in [21] discussed issues surrounding\
    \ the use of LPWAN as a possible communication access\ntechnology for cognitive\
    \ radio sensor network (CRSN) with special use in smart grid infrastructures.\n\
    They focused on the beneﬁts of LPWAN in CR-SG networks. They mentioned a number\
    \ of research\ngaps including challenges in the implementation design model and\
    \ issues surrounding the use of\nLPWAN in CRSN-based SG systems. Further, a smart\
    \ uniﬁed communication solution was proposed\nto improve smart grid systems while\
    \ mitigating existing challenges.\nDifferent from the above-mentioned articles,\
    \ our present article focuses on providing a\nbackground pertaining to the integration\
    \ of CR in LPWANs. Noting that our survey may be one of the\nearliest overviews\
    \ in this regard, and indicating that the concept of CR-LPWAN systems in IoT is\
    \ still\nat its infancy, this article will be beneﬁcial to the budding researcher\
    \ who seeks to explore possible\nresearch challenges within the CR-LPWAN ﬁeld.\n\
    3. Low Power Wide Area Network\nLow power wide area network (LPWAN) is deﬁned\
    \ by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\nas a class of wireless technologies\
    \ with characteristics such as large coverage areas, low bandwidth,\npossibly\
    \ very small packet and application layer data sizes and long battery life operation\
    \ [22].\nFollowing these characteristics, LPWANs are widely deployed in many IoT-based\
    \ communication\nnetworks, thereby garnering huge research audiences across academia,\
    \ industry, and in different\nbusiness domains [4]. Consequently, based on the\
    \ potential beneﬁts of LPWAN, we present a brief\nexposition regarding up-to-date\
    \ available LPWAN standards, technologies, and their challenges.\nA brief look\
    \ into the origin of LPWAN systems is provided, which presents a background for\
    \ the\ncurrent developmental strategies within the LPWAN market space. We then\
    \ discuss different LPWAN\ntechnologies, standards and a possible generic architecture\
    \ for LPWAN operation.\n3.1. Brief Origin of LPWAN\nWe present a timeline to highlight\
    \ the progression of LPWAN technologies from earlier versions to\nthe present\
    \ state-of-the-art LPWAN technologies. Such information should help readers to\
    \ understand\nand to appreciate the current growth and future trends in the LPWAN\
    \ market. The AlarmNet\ntechnology sufﬁces as one of the earliest technologies\
    \ built by alarm device manufacturing company\n(ADEMCO) in the early 1990s based\
    \ on a 900 MHz network in order to monitor alarm panels [23].\nIt sent a small\
    \ amount of data and transmitted at very low data rates. It served as the bedrock\
    \ for the\nmigration of remote alarm systems to the 2nd generation technologies,\
    \ which provided both data and\nvoice services [23]. A technology similar to modern\
    \ LPWANs was the advanced radio data information\nservice (ARDIS), which was a\
    \ wireless wide area network that provided relatively low-speed networks\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 6837\n5 of 41\nfor sales automation, ﬂeet tracking and other online\
    \ transaction processes [24]. ARDIS was later\nacquired by Motorola Incorporation\
    \ [24].\nAlthough the above-mentioned technologies lacked some characteristics\
    \ as compared to modern\nLPWANs, for example, improved energy efﬁciency, nevertheless,\
    \ they offered the foundation for the\ndevelopment of the presently known LPWAN\
    \ systems. Furthermore, the emergence of the Internet and\nits present widespread\
    \ application areas/potentials necessitated the need to improve these technologies\n\
    as seen today. Much of the resurgence of LPWAN technologies was led by Sigfox,\
    \ which originated in\n2009 [25]. They built the ﬁrst modern LPWAN in France and\
    \ their success rate spurred quite a buzz in\nthe industry. Sigfox technologies\
    \ came at a period when radio devices were declining in cost and their\nusage\
    \ was becoming pervasive. They were soon followed by other LPWAN interest groups\
    \ such as\nthe Ingenu, LoRa Alliance, and even traditional cellular players rolling\
    \ out NB-IoT devices [4,9,26].\nParticularly, LoRa technology was initially developed\
    \ by Cycleo Incorporation in Grenoble, France,\nbut was later acquired by SEMTECH\
    \ in 2012. An overview of the timeline of the origin of different\nLPWAN technologies,\
    \ along with their developers is presented in Table 1. Following this timeline,\n\
    it is easy to appreciate how the LPWAN market has progressed with potentials for\
    \ further growth in\nthe nearest future. In this regard, it is our belief that\
    \ the future of LPWANs will entail the integration\nand development of CR-LPWAN\
    \ systems. A number of LPWAN technologies are discussed next,\nwhereas standardization\
    \ bodies involved in regulating the interoperability of LPWAN technologies\nwill\
    \ be discussed in subsequent subsections.\nTable 1. Timeline of the origins of\

    \ are discussed.\nIn addition to providing a\ndetailed list of technologies, we\
    \ identify speciﬁc LPWAN technologies that support CR functionalities.\nThis exposition\
    \ further emphasizes the budding consideration for CR and the need to commence\n\
    widespread discussion about the integration of CR in LPWAN. To examine the potential\
    \ for CR\ndeployment, we identify different LPWAN technologies and their respective\
    \ bands of operation,\ntheir current support for CR, their use of multiple channels,\
    \ and their use of adaptive threshold\ntechniques in their respective transceiver\
    \ modules. In this regard, only the Semtech SX1276 transceiver\nmodule developed\
    \ by LoRa provides an open source access to its underlying chipset technology.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6837\n6 of 41\nIt is best to encourage open access opportunities\
    \ to different LPWAN transceiver architectures\nin order to fast track research\
    \ contributions pertaining to the integration of CR in LPWAN.\nFurther discussion\
    \ in this regard is provided in Section VI. However, while this section serves\
    \ only\nas an overview of different state-of-the-art LPWAN technologies, nevertheless,\
    \ additional details\nregarding the technical comparative analyses of these technologies\
    \ can be found in [4,15,27] for the\nsake of the interested reader. A few highlights\
    \ regarding a number of LPWAN technologies are\npresented as follows:\nA.\nSigfox:\
    \ Sigfox may be considered as the ﬁrst major proprietary LPWAN provider in France\
    \ [13].\nSince its inception, Sigfox has proceeded in partnership with other network\
    \ operators to ensure\nend-to-end LPWAN connectivity. They connect end devices\
    \ to base stations via binary phase\nshift keying (BPSK) modulation on an ultra\
    \ narrow bandwidth [4]. Sigfox technologies also\nprovide CR capabilities, particularly\
    \ in their base station infrastructures via SDR technology,\nwhich allows network\
    \ and computing complexities to be managed via Cloud technology. Sigfox\nis quite\
    \ popular with potentials to remain a strong competitor in the LPWAN market.\n\
    B.\nLoRa: Long Range (LoRa) is a LPWAN PHY layer technology developed by Semtech\
    \ Corporation.\nOwing to its rich patronage by a wide range of researchers, LoRa\
    \ easily seems to be the most\npopular and trending LPWAN access technology in\
    \ the IoT market [4,28]. LoRa may also be\npopular because of its open standard\
    \ communication protocol called LoRaWAN, developed\nby LoRa Alliance. LoRa adopts\
    \ a spread spectrum technique, which allows for an increase\nin its scalability\
    \ and data rate.\nSpeciﬁcally, it is based on a chirp spread spectrum (CSS)\n\
    modulation scheme integrated with forward error correction (FEC) codes, which\
    \ allows for\nlonger communication range as against using the frequency shift\
    \ keying (FSK) technique [29].\nLoRa devices are also capable of adjusting their\
    \ transmission power to meet the regulatory\nrequirements. LoRaWAN protocol is\
    \ based on the ALOHA scheme [9]. It provides a ﬁxed\nchannel bandwidth of either\
    \ 125 or 500 kHz in its uplink channels, and 500 kHz in its downlink\nchannels\
    \ [30]. LoRa is presently deployed by other notable developers such as Symphony\
    \ LinkTM\nand LoRaBlink [31].\nC.\nIngenu RPMA: Ingenu was formerly known as On-Ramp\
    \ Wireless [4]. It is a proprietary LPWAN\ntechnology designed to function strictly\
    \ in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. It adopts a PHY layer technology\nbased on random phase\
    \ multiple access (RPMA) direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). RPMA\nenables\
    \ multiple transmitters to share a single time slot. Ingenu-based RPMA achieves\
    \ a high\nsensitivity level of about −142 dBm and a link budget of 168 dB [4,9,29].\
    \ It complies with the\nIEEE 802.15.4 k standard.\nD.\nTelensa: Telensa is a LPWAN\
    \ proprietary technology provider that renders end-to-end device\nconnectivity\
    \ [6]. It operates in the unlicensed sub-GHz ISM bands using a proprietary UNB\n\
    modulation technique. Telensa complies with the European Telecommunications Standards\n\
    Institute (ETSI) low throughput network (LTN) standard, which enables heterogeneous\n\
    integration with other LPWAN technologies [4]. Telensa is widely considered for\
    \ smart city\napplications such as intelligent trafﬁc control and smart parking.\n\
    E.\nQowisio: Qowisio is a proprietary LPWAN technology that combines its vertical\
    \ stack with the\nuse of LoRa PHY layer technology [4]. It ensures the provision\
    \ of LPWAN services to end-users,\nwith integration to cloud services for network\
    \ operation. It adopts a proprietary UNB technology\nthat provides most LPWAN\
    \ characteristics such as low data rate and long-range transmissions.\nF.\nIQRF:\
    \ IQRF is a proprietary LPWAN technology developed by IORF Alliance in Pisek,\
    \ Czech\nRepublic [6].\nUnlike other technologies, it uses mesh network topology\
    \ supporting up to\n239 devices with a single coordinator. It implements a dual\
    \ communication mode to enable\nsingle or multimode peer-to-peer communication\
    \ [13]. IQRF uses its own IQMESH protocol to\ncommunicate based on the mesh topology.\
    \ It works in the unlicensed sub-GHz bands using\n62 channels of 100 kHz bandwidth.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6837\n7 of 41\nG.\nLTE-M: Long-Term Evolution, Category M1 (LTE-M)\
    \ is proposed by the 3GPP group to provide\nconnectivity for IoT devices. It can\
    \ work in either full or half-duplex modes and provides a large\nreceiver bandwidth\
    \ of 1.4 MHz, which makes it relatively faster with a higher data rate (up to\n\
    1 Mbit/s in both uplink and downlink channels) than most other products [32].\
    \ It uses a deep sleep\nmode under the power saving mode (PSM) scheme and wakes\
    \ only periodically to guarantee long\nbattery lifetime. Its downlink channels\
    \ work using both orthogonal frequency division multiple\naccess (OFDMA) and 16-QAM\
    \ modulation techniques, whereas its uplink employs the single\ncarrier frequency\
    \ division multiple access (SC-FDMA) and 16-QAM modulation techniques [33].\n\
    It aims to proﬁt from the existing cellular infrastructure of the 3GPP group.\n\
    H.\nNB-IoT: Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is another scheme proposed by the 3GPP group\
    \ for the\nconnectivity of IoT devices. It supports up to 50,000 devices per cell\
    \ using between 180 and\n200 kHz bandwidth. It can operate in three different\
    \ modes namely, the stand-alone, guard band,\nand in-band operating modes. Further\
    \ details about these communication modes can be found\nin [34]. It uses quadrature\
    \ phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation scheme for transmission in the\nlicensed\
    \ LTE frequency bands. It attains a maximum data rate of 200 kbps on half duplex\
    \ mode.\nIt complies with the 3GPP standardization speciﬁcations.\nI.\nWeightless:\
    \ Weightless is an open-standard LPWAN technology that operates in the sub-GHz\n\
    unlicensed spectrum [35]. It achieves this feat via three different versions namely,\
    \ Weightless-W,\nWeightless-N, and Weightless-P. Weightless-W leverages white\
    \ space CR technology via dynamic\nspectrum access. However, it suffers from a\
    \ shorter battery lifetime as against the other two\nversions [35]. Weightless-N\
    \ operates in the unlicensed spectrum using narrow band protocols\ndeveloped by\
    \ NWave. Weightless-P, on the other hand works on a fully bidirectional based\n\
    communication protocol developed by M2COMM’s Platanus technology [35].\nJ.\nAdaptrum:\
    \ Adaptrum is a relatively newer technology compared to other known brands such\
    \ as\nLoRa, Sigfox, and Weightless. There are few investigations available at\
    \ the moment concerning the\ntechnical comparative characteristics of Adaptrum\
    \ against other LPWAN technologies owing to\nits proprietary standards; nevertheless,\
    \ it is considered to be a rare class of LPWAN technologies\nthat claim to support\
    \ TV white space usage via CR technology [36].\nK.\nNwave:\nNwave is a LPWAN technology\
    \ often used interchangeably with Weightless\ntechnologies [37]. Nevertheless,\
    \ they differ, particularly in that Weightless developers use Nwave\ntechnologies\
    \ to guarantee the use of TV white spaces [38]. Although Nwave technologies are\n\
    known to provide Internet facilities, nevertheless, in recent times, they have\
    \ been enabled for\nwireless IoT services and technologies in cities, rural areas,\
    \ and remote areas [39]. Technically,\nNwave technologies are tightly interlinked\
    \ with Weightless technologies, thereby making it\ndifﬁcult to differentiate them.\n\
    L.\nPlatanus M2COMM: Platanus is a wireless networking technology developed by\
    \ M2COMM\nand considered to be a LPWAN technology because it provides ultra-low\
    \ energy consumption\nrates with network coverage far longer in range than Wi-Fi,\
    \ Bluetooth, Zigbee and BLE\n(i.e., from several meters to 10 km) [40]. Platanus\
    \ is used in the Weightless-P technology to\nachieve fully bi-directional communication.\
    \ Another LPWAN module developed by M2COMM is\nthe Uplynx highly integrated system\
    \ on a chip (SoC) module [41], which is deployed to simplify\nthe development\
    \ of LPWAN IoT applications. There is a very tight working relationship between\n\
    Sigfox and M2COMM; consequently, both technologies are often used interchangeably\
    \ in the\nliterature; nevertheless, it is worth noting that they are distinct\
    \ LPWAN technologies [12].\nM.\nWi-SUN: Wireless smart utility network (Wi-SUN)\
    \ is an industry alliance that promotes\ninteroperability between wireless standards\
    \ in the IoT market. They work closely with the\nInternet Engineering Task Force\
    \ (IETF) in order to ensure that Internet Protocol (IP) and transport\nlayer protocols\
    \ of LPWAN technologies are adequately standardized [25]. A prominent proponent\n\
    of Wi-SUN is their ﬁeld area network (FAN), which poses so many use-cases for\
    \ IoT applications.\nThey adopt the 6LoWPAN technology primarily for header compression\
    \ [42]. Wi-SUN supports\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n8 of 41\nfull IP frames with\
    \ header compression in order to optimize bandwidth. They intend to maximize\n\
    battery lifetime and guarantee long-range communication.\nN.\nAmber Wireless:\n\
    Amber Wireless GmBH is an electronics company that designs and\nmanufactures wireless\
    \ connectivity solutions. Although they may not be full-time players in\nthe LPWAN\
    \ market, nevertheless, they are known for low power products, particularly for\n\
    shorter range transmission [14]. Their access modules are used primarily for home\
    \ automation\napplications and smart metering.\nO.\nStarﬁsh: Starﬁsh is a recent\
    \ international wireless IPv6 network service deployed particularly\nfor IoT applications.\
    \ It is a technology developed by Silver Spring Networks [33]. Use-cases for\n\
    Starﬁsh technologies include intelligent trafﬁc light control, wireless sensor\
    \ networks applications\nincluding water, energy, trafﬁc and safety monitoring\
    \ [33]. Starﬁsh uses a wide range of LPWAN\nstandards-based communication protocols,\
    \ particularly the IEEE 802.15.4 g. Although little may\nbe known regarding the\
    \ technicalities of Starﬁsh technologies, nevertheless, Starﬁsh projects are\n\
    gaining wide spread use in many IoT applications.\nP.\nSymphony Link and Ensemble:\
    \ Symphony Link and Ensemble is a proprietary technology\nof Link Labs, which\
    \ uses LoRa at the PHY layer and a different MAC architecture to provide\nproprietary\
    \ services [43]. It uses an eight-channel base station that operates in the 433\
    \ MHz or 915\nMHz ISM bands, and in the 868 MHz band in Europe. It covers a transmission\
    \ range of over 16\nkm over a back-haul based on Wi-Fi or cellular network [43].\n\
    The entire LPWAN technologies listed above are appraised in Table 2 and ranked\
    \ according to\ntheir supposed integration of CR in their respective LPWAN technologies.\
    \ However, the Adaptrum and\nPlatanus technologies were omitted for a lack of\
    \ detailed technical information from the proprietary\ndevelopers regarding the\
    \ parameters of comparison in Table 2. Ranking was conducted based on the\nnumber\
    \ of ticks in Table 2, which aims at assessing the use of speciﬁc CR technologies\
    \ and strategies\nin the different LPWAN technologies. Following Table 2, it is\
    \ noted that both Nwave and Weightless\nadopt the most number of CR techniques\

    Based on the growing list of LPWAN technologies, it is evident that there is considerable\
    \ diversity\namong LPWAN technologies, which breeds a number of issues that may\
    \ stiﬂe their growth and\ninteroperability. For example, while some developers\
    \ are contending the introduction of IPv6 in\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n9 of 41\n\
    their LPWAN technologies, Wi-SUN on the other hand has commenced support of IPv6\
    \ using the\n6LoWPAN technology [25]. These uncoordinated diversities may affect\
    \ the end users negatively such\nthat migration between different technologies\
    \ will become greatly hampered. This may ultimately\nrestrict the widespread acceptance\
    \ of LPWAN technologies. Consequently, some standards have been\ndeveloped to\
    \ articulate the different concerns pertaining to the interoperation of LPWAN\
    \ technologies.\nHowever, these standards are incoherent because of a lack of\
    \ a uniﬁed front amongst LPWAN\ndevelopers. Thus, a number of international bodies\
    \ are presently involved in the standardization\nprocess of LPWAN technologies,\
    \ for example, the IETF has established a new LPWAN working group\n(WG) to address\
    \ IPv6 issues over LPWANs, and to establish how LPWANs will adapt into a mutually\n\
    beneﬁcial ecosystem [25].\nIn this regard, there are two different assemblages\
    \ working to standardize the LPWAN ecosystem.\nThese are the standard development\
    \ organizations (SDOs) and the Special Interest Groups (SIGs) [4].\nNotwithstanding,\
    \ there are other consortiums working and advocating for the interoperability\
    \ and\nstandardization of different IoT components. For example, the Industrial\
    \ Internet Consortium (IIC)\naims to set up an architectural framework for industrial\
    \ IoT by coordinating connected objects that\nuse common architectures, interoperability,\
    \ and open standards. Most prominently, the SDOs and\nSIGs are widely known as\
    \ proponents for the interoperability of different IoT standards. The SDOs\ncomprise\
    \ known organizations such as the European Telecommunications Standard Institute\
    \ (ETSI),\nthe Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), Institute of Electrical\
    \ and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),\nand the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ [4]. An overview of these SDOs based on their area of\nfocus, membership, and\
    \ membership count is provided in Table 3. The SIGs on the other hand comprise\n\
    individual industrial alliances such as the LoRa Alliance, Weightless-SIG, and\
    \ the DASH7 Alliance [4].\nWe provide an overview of the developments made thus\
    \ far with regards to the standardization of\nLPWAN technologies.\n3.3.1. Standard\
    \ Development Organizations (SDOs)\nA few notable SDOs are discussed as follows:\n\
    IEEE Standards\nThe IEEE has established two different standards, namely, 802.15.4\
    \ and 802.11 standards, designed\nto ensure range extension and reduction in the\
    \ power consumption rates of LPWANs. Under the\n802.15.4 standard lies the IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 k task group (TG) and the 802.15.4 g TG [44]. The 802.15.4 k\noption\
    \ is designed for low energy critical infrastructure monitoring (LECIM) applications\
    \ intended\nto operate in the ISM bands (sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz bands) [44]. They\
    \ propose to use DSSS and\nFSK modulation techniques at the PHY layer to increase\
    \ range and node scalability [45]. The MAC\nlayer supports carrier sense multiple\
    \ access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) and ALOHA with\npriority channel access\
    \ (PCA) [28,46]. The 802.15.4 k speciﬁes power levels of about −130 dBm for base\n\
    stations [47]. A transmitter power of 15 dBm is proposed in the 433 MHz spectrum.\
    \ One technology\ncurrently complying with this standard is the Ingenu LPWAN technology\
    \ [28,46]. The IEEE 802.15.4 g\nstandard is considered for low data rate wireless\
    \ smart metering utility networks. This TG proposes to\nuse FSK, OFDMA, and QPSK\
    \ to improve data rate. Similar to 802.15.4 k, the IEEE 802.15.4 g standard\n\
    is speciﬁed for use in the ISM (sub-GHz and 2.4 GHz) bands.\nThe 802.11 wireless\
    \ local area network (WLAN) standard is also considered for IoT applications.\n\
    In particular, the IEEE 802.11 ah is designed to reduce power consumption rates\
    \ and to extend the\nrange of long-range low power (LRLP) systems [4,14]. This\
    \ standard proposes LPWAN operation in the\nISM sub-GHz bands with an intention\
    \ to provide longer range and lower power consumption rates as\nagainst other\
    \ known WLAN standards such as ZigBee and Bluetooth. Consequently, the 802.11\
    \ ah is a\nfavourable technology for IoT applications since it provides low power\
    \ consumption rates comparable\nto Bluetooth with an added beneﬁt of higher data\
    \ rates and wider coverage range.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n10 of 41\nTable 3.\

    European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI)\nThe ETSI is saddled with\
    \ establishing bidirectional communication protocols in LPWAN\ntechnologies [4,28].\
    \ They are striving to reduce the electromagnetic radiation levels of LPWAN\n\
    technologies by reducing their payload sizes and ensuring transmission at low\
    \ data rates. They propose\ndifferent interfaces and protocols to support communication\
    \ between end devices, base stations and\nnetwork servers [48]. The ETSI refers\
    \ to its LPWAN standard as low throughput networks (LTNs) [4,28].\nThe LTN standard\
    \ does not restrict LPWAN technologies to any particular modulation or access\n\
    technique. Nevertheless, it supports provision for either ultra narrow band (UNB)\
    \ or orthogonal\nsequence spread spectrum (OSSS) methods. With regards to IoT-based\
    \ applications, the ETSI has\npublished some standards including the standard\
    \ on the technical characteristics for UNB short\nrange devices (SRD), which operates\
    \ in the UHF spectrum below 1 GHz, the standard on use-cases\nand system characteristics\
    \ for LTN, and the standard on IPv6-based IoT. Some LPWAN developers\nsuch as\
    \ Sigfox, Telensa, and Semtech are presently involved with ETSI in order to standardize\
    \ their\nrespective technologies.\nThird Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\n\
    The 3GPP group is presently evolving its technologies to ensure use for IoT applications\
    \ [4,13,28,49].\nThey have stripped their cellular standards of unnecessary complexities,\
    \ reduced costs, extended\ntransmission range, and ensured prolonged battery lifetime.\
    \ LTE technologies are being enhanced\nparticularly for narrowband (NB)-IoT applications\
    \ [50]. NB-IoTs are designed to provide low cost, long\ncoverage, low data rates\
    \ and low power consumption rates to satisfy LPWAN requirements. For example,\n\
    in order to extend battery lifetime, the 3GPP are planning to deploy either PSM\
    \ or extended discontinuous\nreception (eDRx) schemes [4,12,13]. Both methods\
    \ use deep sleep mode operation for end devices to\nprovide longer hours or even\
    \ days of network activities. The NB-IoT is a narrow band technology\nwith low\
    \ bandwidths of 180 kHz with the possibility to serve as many as fifty thousand\
    \ end devices\nin a particular cell [4]. It uses frequency division multiple access\
    \ (FDMA) and OFDMA in the uplink\nand downlink channels, respectively. With an\
    \ established infrastructure based on older 3GPP cellular\ntechnologies, NB-IoT\
    \ is expected to be a strong competitor in the IoT market in the coming years.\n\
    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)\nThe IETF strives to standardize areas\
    \ related to IP-based connectivity of LPWAN systems [25,51,52].\nIt is an open\
    \ standard organization with no formal membership or membership requirements.\n\
    All participants and managers are volunteers with funding provided by employers\
    \ or sponsors. The IETF\npresently considers IPv6 particularly for low power wireless\
    \ personal area networks (6LoWPAN) [53,54].\nOne requirement is to ensure that\
    \ the IP stack is lightweight enough to guarantee strict compliance\nwith the\
    \ limitations of LPWAN technologies, such as their operation under strict regulations\
    \ in ISM\nbands, the asymmetry of their uplink and downlink channels, and the\
    \ existence of different packet\nformats from different LPWAN developers in the\
    \ IoT market [25,51,52]. Following the completion of the\ntask of the 6LowPAN\
    \ IETF IoT WG in 2014, another WG called the 6Lo WG was initiated in order to\n\
    cover a wider range of radio technologies including Bluetooth, cordless phones,\
    \ and Digital Enhanced\nCordless Telecommunication (DECT) devices. The IETF group\
    \ aims to solve issues of header compression,\nfragmentation and reassembly, management,\
    \ and security, integrity and privacy issues [4].\n3.3.2. Special Interest Groups\
    \ (SIGs)\nThis section updates the discussion on SIGs as presented in [4]. We\
    \ include newer alliances such\nas the IQRF Alliance and the Wi-SUN Alliance.\

    \ 2020, 20, 6837\n13 of 41\nLoRa Alliance\nLoRa Alliance is an industry-based\
    \ standard currently promoting LoRa proprietary PHY layer\ntechnologies for LPWAN\
    \ connectivity [4,55]. It is an open, non-proﬁt association of members with\n\
    a mission to standardize LPWAN on a global scale for IoT applications. It strives\
    \ to ensure the\nsuccess of its proprietary LoRaWAN technology by sharing knowledge\
    \ and experience required for\ninteroperability between operators. It was launched\
    \ in April, 2015. The alliance adopts ALOHA\nscheme at the MAC layer and spread\
    \ spectrum technologies at the PHY layer to accommodate\nadditional end-users\
    \ [49]. It establishes different classes of users such as the Class A devices\
    \ that\nrequire the longest lifetime with the highest latency, the Class B devices\
    \ that can schedule downlink\nreceptions from base stations at certain time intervals,\
    \ and the Class C devices that are mains-powered\nto continuously listen and receive\
    \ downlink transmissions. There are a number of technical documents,\nwhich detail\
    \ the development of LoRa and LoRaWAN technologies/standards, some of which can\
    \ be\nfound in [4,9,10,56,57].\nWeightless-SIG\nThe Weightless-SIG group is a\
    \ non-proﬁt, global, and member-based organization geared towards\ndeveloping\
    \ open standards for IoT connectivity. It was formed in 2012 particularly to coordinate\n\
    activities surrounding the delivery of standards for wide area IoT connectivity.\
    \ It has proposed three\nstandards, which operate in both the licensed and unlicensed\
    \ spectrum [4]. These standards are:\n1.\nWeightless-W standard, which uses TV\
    \ white spaces based on different modulation schemes such\nas 16-quadrature amplitude\
    \ modulation (16-QAM) and differential binary phase shift keying\n(D-BPSK) [58].\n\
    2.\nThe Weightless-N standard, which is a UNB standard that focuses only on simplex\
    \ communication\nmode. It provides for higher energy efﬁciency and lower device\
    \ cost as against the Weightless-W.\n3.\nThe Weightless-P standard, which provides\
    \ full duplex communication mode based on QPSK and\nGaussian minimum shift keying\
    \ (GMSK) modulation techniques. It provides a data rate between\n0.2 and 100 kbps\
    \ [4,58].\nDASH7 Alliance\nDASH7 is an industry alliance that employs narrow band\
    \ modulation schemes domiciled in\nthe sub-GHz bands [13].\nIt proposes a tree\
    \ topology as against the star topology of the LoRa\nalliance. The DASH7 alliance\
    \ embraces an always ON base station set-up to ensure constant network\nconnectivity,\
    \ which differentiates it from other standards [13].\nIQRF Alliance\nThe IQRF\
    \ Alliance is an open community of international IoT professionals that aims to\n\
    deliver wireless IoT devices and solutions based on the IQRF technology [59].\
    \ A few examples\nof hardware devices developed under the IQRF Alliance include\
    \ the industrial gateway for IQRF\nnetworks, the outdoor industrial gateway (IP68\
    \ rugged industrial gateway), and the network trafﬁc\nanalysis modules designed\
    \ for IoT network analysis, to name but a few. Many IQRF Alliance-based\ntechnologies\
    \ are often built on an integrated mesh networking scheme, which aims to provide\
    \ low\npower consumption rates using deep sleep modes, and to provide enhanced\
    \ security solutions based\non the Advance Encryption Standard (AES) 128 encryption\
    \ scheme [59]. In routing terms, the IQRF\nAlliance are known to advance the IQMESH\
    \ routing protocol, which is aimed at providing reliable\nperformance in harsh\
    \ radio frequency (RF) environments [60].\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n14 of 41\n\
    Wi-SUN Alliance\nFormed in 2011, the Wi-SUN Alliance comprises individuals who\
    \ came together to form a global\norganization that drives the adoption of interoperable\
    \ SUN [61]. The alliance focuses on applications\nincluding but not limited to\
    \ energy conservation, automated metering control, and smart cities [62].\nTechnically,\
    \ the Wi-SUN Alliance produces test equipment, network emulators, communication\n\
    modules, and spectrum analyzers [61]. Some Wi-SUN solutions are based on LoRa\
    \ using LoRa\nmodulation spread spectrum scheme in the sub-GHz band.\nIoT World\
    \ Alliance\nThe IoT World Alliance formerly known as the M2M World Alliance consists\
    \ of a global\npartnership of telecommunications providers striving to enable\
    \ seamless IoT device connectivity\naround the world, particularly for their proprietary\
    \ technologies [63].\nThe alliance provides a\nsingle global subscriber identity\
    \ module (SIM) that works on all member networks, they provide\ncentralized management\
    \ of connected devices and a single web platform portal to manage connections\n\
    worldwide [63]. The interest of IoT World Alliance may be more or less related\
    \ to IoT marketing\nand education.\nOther alliances, which are not fully discussed\
    \ here are as follows, but not limited to the Hypercat\nAlliance, Allseen Alliance,\
    \ Open Mobile Alliance, Internet Protocol for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance,\n\
    Continua Alliance, Connected Lighting Alliance, ZWave Alliance, and the EnOcean\
    \ Alliance. These\nalliances are geared towards the standardization and interoperability\
    \ of all facets of the IoT. This\never-growing list of alliances emphasizes the\
    \ intense focus on IoT development and on the development\nof improved LPWAN technologies.\n\
    In summary, Table 5 provides a list of consortia involved in the standardization\
    \ of different IoT\ntechnologies. Essentially, in the absence of an all-encompassing\
    \ alliance, the IoT market will continue\nto comprise different non-interoperable\
    \ technologies, which may stiﬂe the expected growth of the\nLPWAN market.\n3.4.\
    \ General LPWAN Architecture\nOwing to the different LPWAN technologies available\
    \ today, it is difﬁcult to present an\nall-encompassing architecture that uniﬁes\
    \ all LPWAN technologies. Such an inability to generalize\nmay be obvious since\
    \ each developer provides a unique architecture for its devices. One such popular\n\
    LPWAN architecture is the star-of-stars network architecture, which is an architecture\
    \ widely deployed\nin both Sigfox and LoRa-based infrastructures [64]. In this\
    \ section, we identify speciﬁc commonalities\nbetween different LPWAN architectures\
    \ in order to describe a generalized LPWAN architecture.\nThis will provide LPWAN\
    \ developers with an architecture that spurs interoperability.\nThere are several\
    \ speciﬁc architectures identiﬁed in the LPWAN literature.\nFor example,\na LoRaWAN\
    \ network architecture was presented in [65] wherein end nodes (IoT devices) typically\n\
    connect to different gateways/concentrators via LoRa RF and LoRaMAC. The gateway\
    \ (GW) connects\nto a network server (NS) via 3G/4G/Ethernet/Fibre back-haul,\
    \ whereas the NS connects to application\nservers (AS) via TCP/IP Secured Sockets\
    \ Layers (SSL) payloads. In another article [66], authors\npresented a more detailed\
    \ LPWAN architecture called OpenChirp. The OpenChirp network was built\nusing\
    \ LoRaWAN, which allows users to register devices, describe transducer properties,\
    \ transfer data\nand retrieve historical values. Unlike the architecture in [65],\
    \ OpenChirp connects its GWs through\na publish-subscriber server that decouples\
    \ the producers and consumers of information according\nto their timing and availability\
    \ conditions. LPWAN servers and serializers are both classiﬁed within\nthe service\
    \ domain in the OpenChirp architecture, and they connect to application services\
    \ through a\nHypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n\

    \ to [65],\nauthors in [67] presented a typical LoRaWAN network architecture,\n\
    which comprises four basic sectors involving the connection of end devices to\
    \ the GW, and then\nto the Internet before arriving at the NS. In a survey article,\
    \ Lavric and Popa [16] highlighted a LoRa\narchitecture wherein end devices situated\
    \ in different cloud clusters would connect to the LoRaWAN\ngateway through a\
    \ LoRa medium, whereas the GW connects to an NS via an IP back-haul. A Sigfox\n\
    network architecture was described in [37] in which objects comprising client\
    \ applicative boards and\nSigfox MODEMs were connected to Sigfox base stations\
    \ via radio links. These Sigfox base stations\nwere in turn connected to a Sigfox\
    \ cloud service prior to arriving at the client site. Thus, most LPWAN\narchitectures,\
    \ ranging from LoRaWAN to Sigfox architectures, commonly comprise end nodes that\n\
    connect to a GW, then to an NS prior to arriving at an application server.\nFollowing\
    \ the above, a simple LPWAN architecture is presented in Figure 1. In this general\n\
    architecture, all IoT devices (including wireless sensor network (WSN) devices)\
    \ would connect to the GW\nvia LPWAN access technologies. These access technologies\
    \ can be deployed through specific providers\nincluding LoRaWAN, Sigfox, Wi-SUN,\
    \ or NB-IoT access providers. The GWs aggregate multiple IoT\nmessages and send\
    \ them to the NS, which is located on the internet or can be accessed through\
    \ some\nIP technology either through wired or wireless connectivity. The NS aggregates\
    \ data messages from\nthe different GWs for onward transmission to an application\
    \ server. At the NS, different services\ncan be provided, including security services\
    \ (authentication) through the AAA server, performance\nevaluation through the\
    \ Perf server, and management processes through the management server.\nInternet\n\

    \ 1. A simple LPWAN architecture.\nIn terms of developing a generic architecture,\
    \ the IETF is at the forefront towards the realization of\na seamless interoperability\
    \ platform for both new and existing LPWAN technologies. Thus, one\nmajor task\
    \ of the IETF WG is to identify common functionalities in the LPWAN-GW and to\n\
    standardize new and existing protocols required for seamless interoperability\
    \ [25]. Such a generic\narchitecture should ensure that LPWAN characteristics\
    \ such as long battery lifetime, low data rates, low\ndeployment/device costs,\
    \ and scalability, are maintained across heterogeneous LPWAN technologies.\nThus,\
    \ the goal of a generic LPWAN architecture is to converge diverse radio technologies\
    \ towards\na central commonality for easy migration between different technologies.\
    \ This easy migration will\nultimately beneﬁt end-users, which should be the case\
    \ for the success of any new technology.\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n17 of 41\n4.\
    \ Cognitive Radio\nIn this section, we brieﬂy introduce and discuss the concept\
    \ of CR towards presenting the budding\nresearcher with a synopsis of what CR\
    \ entails, its speciﬁc functions, and its possible network concepts.\n4.1. Brief\
    \ Background\nThe study of CR is presently a popular and interesting research\
    \ area because it attempts to\naddress the problem of spectrum underutilization.\
    \ Over the past 20 years, the wireless communication\nindustry has experienced\
    \ a surge in the number of new wireless technologies deployed to improve\nthe\
    \ QoS of end-users [68]. Each newly deployed wireless technology demands new and\
    \ unique\nfrequencies to be allocated for its operation (i.e., ﬁxed spectrum assignment).\
    \ However, owing to\nthe dwindling availability of usable RF bands, particularly\
    \ across the very high frequency/ultra\nhigh frequency (VHF/UHF) bands up until\
    \ the microwave band, it has become obvious to most\nnational frequency managers\
    \ worldwide that spectrum is becoming scarce (spectrum scarcity). Such\na reality\
    \ of spectrum scarcity poses a signiﬁcant threat to the growth of the wireless\
    \ communication\nindustry [69]. However, several research ﬁndings have revealed\
    \ that most allocated frequency\nbands are often underutilized as opposed to being\
    \ scarce, with utility levels ranging between 15\nand 85% [70]. Thus, the concept\
    \ of CR was conceived supported by the concurrent advances in the\ndevelopment\
    \ of SDR technologies [71]. Consequently, the study, development, and deployment\
    \ of CR\ntechnologies has since grown exponentially in the literature following\
    \ its potential use of free spectra\nfor opportunistic communication.\nTechnically,\
    \ CR is deﬁned by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as: “A\nradio or\
    \ system that senses its operational electromagnetic environment and can dynamically\n\
    and autonomously adjust its radio operating parameters to modify system operation,\
    \ such as\nmaximize throughput, mitigate interference, facilitate interoperability,\
    \ access secondary markets” [68].\nThis deﬁnition highlights some speciﬁc CR characteristics\
    \ as follows: CR technologies must provide\nadaptive and autonomous spectral awareness\
    \ (spectrum sensing (SS)), detect available channels\n(spectrum decision making),\
    \ dynamically adjust its radio operating parameters (spectrum mobility),\nand\
    \ conduct concurrent communication (spectrum sharing). In the next subsection,\
    \ we present only a\nbrief overview of these characteristics.\n4.2. Cognitive\
    \ Radio Functions\nA general overview of the different functions in a typical\
    \ CR system (CRS) is shown in Figure 2.\nThere are ﬁve basic functions of a CRS\
    \ described as follows:\n1.\nSpectrum Sensing (SS): A typical CR device is equipped\
    \ with a radio front-end to scan (sense)\nits immediate electromagnetic environment\
    \ for the presence/absence of primary user (PU)\nsignals. In this case, PU refers\
    \ to the licensed owner of the spectrum. There are different\napproaches proposed\
    \ for SS, including the use of the energy detector (ED), matched ﬁlter,\ncyclostationary\
    \ detector (CD), eigenvalue method, covariance method, and prediction-based\n\
    approaches [72]. Another method currently deployed for spectral awareness is the\
    \ geolocation\ndatabase approach [28,73]. In this case, a central database comprising\
    \ geographic coordinates\nand the respective RF signal distributions in such environments\
    \ is established. Consequently,\nCR devices would connect to these databases in\
    \ order to acquire PU information before decision\nis made.\n2.\nSpectrum Decision\
    \ Making: Following the measurement of the energy content of a speciﬁed\nband,\
    \ the CR device progresses to the spectrum decision-making phase wherein decision\
    \ is made\nconcerning the presence/absence of PU signals in the band. In the case\
    \ where only the signal’s\nenergy values are known, then decision is made based\
    \ on whether the received energy values\nexceed a speciﬁed threshold value or\
    \ not. However, in cases where certain characteristics about\nSensors 2020, 20,\
    \ 6837\n18 of 41\nthe PU signal are known a priori, for example, the cyclic frequency,\
    \ then the CD technique can be\ndeployed, albeit at the expense of long processing\
    \ times.\n3.\nSpectrum Access: Spectrum access entails the use of information\
    \ pertaining to the absence of\nPU signals in a band (white space) by carefully\
    \ designed CR MAC protocols in order to adjust\ntransmission parameters. This\
    \ ensures that the new operating radio spectral can be conveniently\nand efﬁciently\
    \ used for opportunistic communication.\n4.\nSpectrum Mobility: Information regarding\
    \ the presence of PU signals in a band (black space) is\nused to ensure hand-off/change\
    \ of transmission parameters in order to prevent interference to PU\noperators.\
    \ This ensures seamless communication between CR devices in the new white spaces.\n\
    5.\nSpectrum Sharing: Spectrum sharing guarantees effective communication between\
    \ CR devices\nand coexistence with PU transceivers without inﬂicting harmful interference.\
    \ This is achieved by\nspeciﬁc protocols designed to operate below a predeﬁned\
    \ interference level.\nFigure 2. The cognitive radio system.\n4.3. Cognitive Radio\
    \ Network\nCR network (CRN) is a network that comprises more than one CR device\
    \ equipped with cognitive\ncapability and reconﬁgurability, which intercommunicate\
    \ by changing their transmitter parameters\nbased on their respective interaction\
    \ with the radio operating environment [74]. There are three\ndifferent CRN schemes\
    \ namely: Interweave CRN, Underlay CRN, and Overlay CRN, brieﬂy discussed\nas\
    \ follows:\n1.\nThe Interweave CRN : The Interweave CRN enables a CR device to\
    \ use spectrum only if no PU\nis active. Thus, PU activities are constantly being\
    \ monitored to prevent interference from CR\ntransmissions.\n2.\nThe Underlay\
    \ CRN: In the Underlay CRN, CR devices transmit with low power in the presence\n\
    of PU activities. However, CR power is strictly ensured below a predeﬁned noise/temperature\n\
    level to prevent interference [75]. Ultra wide band communication approaches are\
    \ typically used\nin Underlay CRN scheme.\n3.\nThe Overlay CRN: In the Overlay\
    \ CRN, CR devices use code books and messages to identify\nthe PU, and then mitigate\
    \ interference by relaying their messages based on a difference code\nbook [75].\
    \ The CR power level is typically not an issue of concern in the Overlay scheme.\n\
    CRNs are indeed to be beneﬁcial to the development of IoT in general, and towards\
    \ enhancing\nthe performance of LPWAN technologies. Consequently, in subsequent\
    \ sections, we shall discuss the\nburgeoning concept of CR in LPWAN.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 6837\n19 of 41\n5. Integrating Cognitive Radio in LPWAN for the Internet\
    \ of Things\nDeveloping effective and efﬁcient IoT devices/applications comes\
    \ with its unique challenges,\nwhich may be solved by leveraging the advantages\
    \ of CR technology. We motivate the need to\nintegrate CR in LPWAN based on extensive\
    \ views, opinions, and efforts in the literature. We then\ndiscuss CR-LPWAN at\
    \ the PHY layer based on a simple front-end model, and then a typical network\n\
    architecture is discussed to support CR-LPWAN systems.\n5.1. Motivation for CR-LPWAN\n\
    Compared to other facets of LPWAN development, such as designing better protocols,\
    \ modulation\ntechniques, and improved access technologies, the current literature\
    \ provides little on the use of\nCR in LPWAN. Nevertheless, a few proprietary\
    \ technologies, such as Sigfox, have led the way in\nintegrating CR in their designs.\
    \ Sigfox deploys CR technology in their base stations and connects\nthem to back\
    \ end servers via an IP network [12,19,28,34]. For proprietary reasons, little\
    \ or nothing is\nknown regarding the type of CR technology deployed; nevertheless,\
    \ Sigfox technologies are known to\noperate in both the unlicensed ISM bands,\
    \ including 868 MHz in Europe, 915 MHz in North America,\nand 433 MHz in Asia,\
    \ and in the licensed band, which is made possible most likely by the use of CR\n\
    capabilities. This major step has also been considered by the Weightless Alliance\
    \ in their Weightless-W\ntechnology [5], thereby further enriching the drive for\
    \ the widespread development and deployment\nof CR-LPWAN technologies.\nRegarding\
    \ why CR should be deployed in LPWAN, authors in [5] noted that because of strict\n\
    regulations pertaining to the use of limited maximum duty cycle rates in the ISM\
    \ bands, and its\nconﬁning effects on the capacity of IoT networks, it may be\
    \ worthwhile to consider the inclusion of CR\nin LPWAN. Even though some LPWAN\
    \ standards, such as the LoRaWAN are yet to incorporate CR\nin their speciﬁcations,\
    \ authors in [5] however argued that incorporating CR in LPWAN will present\n\
    several advantages including improved spectral utilization, less transmission\
    \ power constraints,\npossibility for longer transmission ranges, and lower device\
    \ cost [5]. Moon in [42] emphasized the\nneed to incorporate CR in LPWAN in order\
    \ to maximize spectrum capacity available in the licensed\nbands while minimizing\
    \ interference to the licensed network. In this regard, a dynamic spectrum\naccess\
    \ strategy for CR-LPWANs, which operates both in the licensed and unlicensed bands\
    \ was\nproposed. Moon [42] demonstrated that spectrum capacity was maximized and\
    \ strict QoS of licensed\nusers were maintained.\nIt was noted in [12] that CR\
    \ is a key network enabler for 5G mobile networks including the\nIoT network.\
    \ This was attributed to the need to maximize spectral resources in order to support\n\
    increasing and higher demands for new emerging IoT applications. It was further\
    \ noted that CR can\nbe incorporated by introducing a spectrum coordinator in\
    \ the non-access stratum, which will enable\ncellular technologies to dynamically\
    \ lease spectrum for IoT applications. These observations have\nstrengthened the\
    \ need to develop CR-LPWAN technologies.\n5.2. CR-LPWAN at the PHY Layer\nHaving\
    \ motivated the need to develop and deploy CR-LPWAN technologies, a simpliﬁed\
    \ concept\nof a PHY-layer front-end model of a CR-LPWAN system is presented. Recall\
    \ that there are different\navailable LPWAN technologies mentioned (see Section\
    \ 3), which makes rendering an all-encompassing\nmodel a difﬁcult task. Nevertheless,\
    \ the model to be described is considered following ideas gleaned\nfrom three\
    \ different well known platforms, including LoRa, Sigfox, and the Ingenu architectures.\n\
    In this regard, such a simple CR-LPWAN PHY layer architecture is presented in\
    \ Figure 3 wherein\nthe surrounding spectrum is ﬁrst scanned by the CR-LPWAN system\
    \ in order to determine whether or\nnot white spaces are available for use. To\
    \ achieve this, the received signal is ﬁltered to the required\nbandwidth of interest\
    \ and fed to a low noise ampliﬁer (LNA) to reduce noise samples. These signals\n\
    are converted to their corresponding digital form and a fast Fourier transformation\
    \ (FFT) operation\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n20 of 41\nis performed. The averaged\
    \ signals are passed to the threshold estimator to determine a suitable\nthreshold\
    \ value for signal detection. Decision is made regarding the presence (H1) or\
    \ absence (H0) of\nPU signals in the band. If the outcome is H0, then the spectrum\
    \ access/sharing module is engaged,\nwhich formats the signal as required by the\
    \ LPWAN module. However, if the outcome is H1, the\nspectrum mobility module is\
    \ activated for expedite withdrawal from the band. This command is fed\nto the\
    \ transmission controller, which disengages any on-going transmission process\
    \ in the LPWAN\nmodule and simultaneously activates the switching module to begin\
    \ sensing (receiving mode) rather\nthan transmitting. However, if the H0 subsists,\
    \ then the LPWAN module is activated for transmission.\nSome details pertaining\
    \ to the individual blocks of this model are highlighted as follows [76]:\n1.\n\
    Antenna: Antenna design plays an important role in improving the radio performance\
    \ of\nCR-LPWAN systems. Effective antenna design can be vital in ensuring proper\
    \ propagation\ncharacteristics and also in conserving energy consumption rates.\
    \ Essentially, antenna wavelengths\nmust be made to match the operating frequency\
    \ of the device. The antenna form factor used also\ndetermines to a large extent\
    \ the gain (or loss) of the system, in addition to the gain in the directivity\n\
    of the antenna. Low cost antenna technologies were discussed in [77] with particular\
    \ focus on\ncost efﬁcient antennas for 868 MHz band. The antenna design in [77]\
    \ comprised of an inverted F\nantenna (IFA) topology with simulation results of\
    \ about -6dB reﬂection coefﬁcient in the 850–893\nMHz band. A dipole radiation\
    \ pattern was proposed. These are characteristics that should be\nconsidered in\
    \ the antenna design of any CR-LPWAN system. Lizzi et al., in [78] discussed the\n\
    design of miniature antennas for IoT applications. Similar to [77], Lizzi’s design\
    \ [78] adopts the\nIFA topology. He noted that the overall IFA length is responsible\
    \ for the lower antenna resonance\nrelished in LoRa communication systems [78].\
    \ Essentially, proper consideration must be given to\nantenna design and structure\
    \ for the efﬁcient and effective deployment of CR-LPWAN systems.\n2.\nSwitching\
    \ Module: The switching module is a Duplexer that enables bi-directional transmission\n\
    over a single path. Its function is to separate the receiving path from the transmitting\
    \ path while\nensuring that a common antenna is shared. We suggest that CR-LPWAN\
    \ models should deploy a\nswitching module, whereas the choice of whether or not\
    \ half or full duplex mode should be used,\ncan be an application-speciﬁc decision.\n\
    3.\nLow Noise Ampliﬁer (LNA): The LNA ampliﬁes the received RF signal to increase\
    \ the signal\nto noise ratio (SNR) at the CR-LPWAN receiver. We identity a few\
    \ low-cost LNA modules that\ncan be in CR-LPWAN systems. The duplex current reused\
    \ CMOS LNA is a notable example\nwith complementary derivative superposition technique\
    \ that can be used in IoT devices [79].\nWe suggest that LNAs be deployed to ensure\
    \ that low power consumption rates are maintained\nto maximize the battery lifetime\
    \ of CR-LPWAN systems.\n4.\nFiltering and Down Conversion: The front-end of the\
    \ CR-LPWAN system ﬁlters and\ndown-converts the signal frequencies to their intermediate\
    \ frequencies (IF). It achieves this\nby using a mixer to obtain the in-phase\
    \ and quadrature signal components at the IF. It can then\nprocess the signal\
    \ either at both the IF and baseband levels to minimize design complexities in\n\
    CR-LPWAN systems.\n5.\nAnalogue to Digital Converter: The ADC transforms the analogue\
    \ signal to its digital form. As\nan example, CR-LPWAN systems can be deployed\
    \ with sigma delta ADCs to convert the input\ndata and then all subsequent signal\
    \ processing and demodulation processes can be performed in\nthe digital domain.\n\
    6.\nFast Fourier Transform Module: CR-LPWAN systems will adopt an FFT module to\
    \ compute the\nsignal’s input energy. For example, an FFT LogiCORE IP core module\
    \ can be used in this regard\nsince it implements the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm\
    \ in an efﬁcient manner [80].\n7.\nThreshold Estimator: Most CR-LPWAN systems\
    \ will be required to compute threshold values\nfor accurate signal detection.\
    \ Since this process often depends on the noise ﬂoor, simple threshold\nestimation\
    \ techniques can be considered in CR-LPWAN systems such as the ﬁxed threshold\n\
    technique. However, while the ﬁxed threshold technique is readily deployed in\
    \ most LPWAN\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n21 of 41\nsystems, e.g., LoRa [66,81,82],\
    \ other approaches can be used such as the peak and average\nthreshold mode techniques.\
    \ In the peak threshold mode, the threshold level corresponds to the\npeak value\
    \ of the received signal strength (RSS). In the absence of an input signal, or\
    \ during\nthe reception of zero bits, the acquired peak value is decremented until\
    \ it reaches the noise\nﬂoor threshold [83]. On the other hand, the average threshold\
    \ mode simply computes the\nmean of the entire dataset supplied by the RSS block.\
    \ However, this approach may not be\nefﬁcient in the presence of DC (direct current)\
    \ encoded data. Summarily, it is worth noting\nthat appropriate conﬁguration of\
    \ threshold values is fundamental to the success of CR-LPWAN\nsystems, and its\
    \ choice may be application dependent.\nFigure 3. A simple CR-LPWAN PHY layer\
    \ architecture (adapted from [84]).\nThe decision module refers to a comparator,\
    \ which can be used to determine the presence or\nabsence of PU signals in the\
    \ input band. Other functions such as modulation/demodulation are\napplicable\
    \ based on existing brands such as LoRa, Sigfox, or Weightless. Summarily, the\
    \ somewhat\ngeneric framework of Figure 3 can be leveraged to develop CR-LPWAN\
    \ systems alongside an\nappropriate choice of the CRN scheme. Other PHY layer\
    \ functions that can be executed within\nthe LPWAN framework in the CR-LPWAN system\
    \ are shown in Figure 4. These are known functions,\nwhich are often developed\
    \ for use in most proprietary LPWAN technologies, for example, in the SX1276\n\
    LoRa architecture [83].\nFigure 4. Essential PHY layer functions to be executed\
    \ in the LPWAN module of the front-end model.\n5.3. Network Architecture to Support\
    \ CR-LPWAN\nA simple network architecture to support CR-LPWAN systems is depicted\
    \ in Figure 5. Although\ndifferent architectures may be required for different\
    \ IoT use-cases, nevertheless, the architecture of\nFigure 5 is only presented\
    \ to demonstrate the possibility for CR-LPWAN. Typically, CR-LPWAN\ndevices for\
    \ different IoT applications can be situated or located within a larger PU network\
    \ (often\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n22 of 41\ncellular networks). The CR-LPWAN GW\
    \ senses for when such PU signals are absent over a period of\ntime in order to\
    \ initiate opportunistic communication. They will continue to sense for re-initiated\
    \ PU\nsignals in order to quickly vacate such occupied bands.\nIoT \nNetwork \n\

    \ 5. A simple CR-LPWAN-based network architecture (adapted from [84]).\nIn this\
    \ regard, there are three possible schemes for CR-LPWAN-based network architectures,\n\
    brieﬂy highlighted as follows:\n5.3.1. CR at the LPWAN End Node\nIn CR at the\
    \ LPWAN end node (CREN) scheme, CR is embedded in the LPWAN technology\ndeployed\
    \ in different IoT end nodes; thus, such end nodes, for example, IoT sensors such\
    \ as smart\nmeters, are responsible for executing all CR functions. In this scheme,\
    \ IoT end nodes are designed to be\nrobust and complex to conduct SS, decision\
    \ making, mobility, and spectrum access. This may impact\non cost of the end node,\
    \ and increase the power consumption rates of such end nodes; nevertheless,\n\
    it reduces the network overhead since end devices and GWs would communicate less\
    \ in terms of\nchannel convergence and control messaging. As an example, the CREN\
    \ scheme was adopted in [46]\nwherein end nodes were embedded with a channel manager\
    \ for decision making, spectrum detection,\nand prediction.\n5.3.2. CR at Gateway\n\
    In CR at gateway (CRGW) scheme, CR technologies are embedded in the GW. In this\n\
    case, the CR-LPWAN GW conducts all CR functions (particularly the spectrum and\
    \ decision\nmaking functions) and communicates the acquired white spaces to all\
    \ end nodes in the network.\nThen, end nodes only conduct spectrum access/sharing.\
    \ This may present certain challenges for\nadapting the CRGW scheme, for example,\
    \ in the Sigfox and LoRaWAN class A brands since both\ntechnologies imply ALOHA-like\
    \ access methods. Thus, the GW can only communicate with an end\nnode after the\
    \ end node has sent some data in the uplink and only in a one-to-one mode. Additionally,\n\
    Sigfox has very strict limits for the number of downlink packets sent. Thus, it\
    \ may be challenging to\nimplement the CRGW scheme, since this may require modiﬁcations\
    \ to the existing respective protocols,\nfor example, the need to depart from\
    \ LoRaWAN Class B/C technologies. Nevertheless, it is envisaged\nthat the CRGW\
    \ scheme will reduce the design complexities of the end nodes, which will reduce\n\
    the device costs of CR-LPWAN systems and the power consumption rates of end nodes.\
    \ However,\nnetwork message overheads may increase owing to the need for continuous\
    \ negotiations between the\nGW and the large number of end nodes in the network.\
    \ These issues are potential research issues to be\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n23\
    \ of 41\naddressed towards developing functional CR-LPWAN systems. An example\
    \ of the CRGW scheme can\nbe found in [10].\n5.3.3. CR at both LPWAN End Node\
    \ and Gateway\nIn CR at both end node and gateway (CRENGW) scheme, all devices\
    \ in the network are embedded\nwith CR technologies. In this case, all devices,\
    \ including end nodes and GWs, perform all CR functions\nincluding sensing white\
    \ spaces, making decisions, and accessing the network. An additional function\n\
    that could be performed in CRENGW is cooperative sensing, wherein IoT end nodes\
    \ interact to decide\npertaining to the presence/absence of PU signals. CRENGW\
    \ is more complex in its design as against\nother schemes, however, it provides\
    \ the highest communication reliability use-case, which makes it\nsuitable for\
    \ sensitive applications in medical and military domains.\nFollowing the above\
    \ schemes, and similar to [76], we prescribe the CRGW scheme in the\narchitecture\
    \ of Figure 5. Deploying CR functions at the GW instead of at the end-nodes may\
    \ be\nappropriate since it minimizes design complexities at the LPWAN end nodes,\
    \ which are often resource\nconstrained. It is convenient to deploy CR technologies\
    \ at the GW since most GW infrastructures are\ndesigned to be robust both computationally\
    \ and memory wise. Furthermore, GWs are often connected\nto power supply utility\
    \ outlets and to backup power supply units, thereby assuaging the increased\n\
    energy demands of integrating CR in LPWAN.\nWhen in operation, the CR-LPWAN GW\
    \ scans the electromagnetic spectra to detect white spaces.\nIn other designs,\
    \ the geolocation database technology was used at the GW [85]. However, apart\n\
    from being motivated by the IEEE 802.22 standard for CR [86], we suggest that\
    \ SS be deployed in\nCR-LPWAN systems, because a number of IoT applications/devices\
    \ are designed to be deployed in\nremote locations wherein internet services may\
    \ be unavailable. In such a case, it becomes ineffective to\nrely on geolocation\
    \ technologies.\nWhen a free channel is detected, the CR-LPWAN GW sends such free\
    \ channels to all LPWAN end\nnodes in the network, which will be used by end nodes\
    \ for onward communication to the GW and\nsubsequent IoT devices. The GW may be\
    \ linked to an IoT network server (NS) connected to different\napplication servers\
    \ (AS) based on the application area through a ﬁrewall. To improve access, most\n\
    GWs may connect either via wireless or wired links to the internet. Although simple,\
    \ the architecture\nof Figure 5 facilitates the concept of CR-LPWANs for IoT applications.\
    \ Future ideas can be developed\nin this regard.\n6. Beneﬁts of CR-LPWAN\nCR-LPWAN\
    \ systems will be beneﬁcial to many IoT applications and we discuss a number of\n\
    these beneﬁts in two categories. First, we discuss general technical beneﬁts of\
    \ CR to LPWAN, and then\nwe discuss a few application areas that may beneﬁt from\
    \ CR-LPWAN systems. These are highlighted\nas follows:\n6.1. Technical Beneﬁts\
    \ to IoT Devices\nCR-LPWAN presents a number of technical beneﬁts to IoT at both\
    \ the device and network level,\nwhich we discuss as follows:\n6.1.1. Improved\
    \ Spectral Utilization\nBasically, CR-based technologies are designed to detect\
    \ the presence/absence of PU signals in a\nlicensed band. The absence of PU signals\
    \ in a licensed band provides for opportunistic communication,\nwhereas the presence\
    \ of PU signals signiﬁes the need for immediate rescission from the band.\nSuch\
    \ a novel communication paradigm aims to improve the use of underutilized bands\
    \ leading\nto improved QoS experiences for end users. An example of a CR-LPWAN\
    \ that provides for improved\nspectral utilization is the sensor network over\
    \ white spaces (SNOW) solution, which takes advantage\nof white spaces in the\
    \ TV band for opportunistic transmission [87]. Thus, the use of CR is promising\
    \ as\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n24 of 41\nit will guarantee less constraints on\
    \ the channel bandwidth size of LPWAN technologies, which will\nultimately improve\
    \ their capacity for higher data rates [85].\n6.1.2. Less Transmission Power Constraints\n\
    LPWAN technologies are able to achieve longer transmission range by increasing\
    \ their\ntransmission power at the expense of smaller signal bandwidths [4]. Nevertheless,\
    \ transmit power\nlevels are constrained because of stringent regulations in the\
    \ ISM band pertaining to duty cycle and\ninterference-imposed constraints. Thus,\
    \ incorporating CR in LPWAN will allow the use of white\nspaces that help to evade\
    \ undue transmission power constraints, and ensure that licensed spectrum\nowners\
    \ are not interfered with.\n6.1.3. Longer Transmission Range\nDynamic spectrum\
    \ access implies that CR-LPWAN technologies will be able to leverage the\nopportunity\
    \ to increase their transmission power leading to longer transmission ranges.\
    \ This is possible\nin the VHF bands wherein signals are known to propagate much\
    \ farther in space. This advantage\nis presently explored by Sigfox, which enables\
    \ their networks to cover extremely long transmission\nranges as against other\
    \ LPWAN technologies. Said longer transmission range of Sigfox has been\nveriﬁed\
    \ in practical deployment environments and test campaigns [88].\n6.1.4. Increased\
    \ Scalability\nThe ability to seamlessly switch to licensed spectra will create\
    \ additional bandwidth for LPWAN\nuse. This increased bandwidth ultimately enables\
    \ more end devices to transmit. At the moment, using\na typical 200 kHz bandwidth\
    \ and message bandwidth of 100Hz, Sigfox networks can accommodate\nover 2000 IoT\
    \ devices at a single transmission time. In fact, by deploying CR, it is noted\
    \ that Sigfox\nnetworks may service up to 1 million end devices per base station\
    \ [43], which is similar to Nwave,\nwhich can accommodate up to 1 million devices\
    \ per base station [43]. Furthermore, the Ingenu\ntechnology used in Dallas/Forth\
    \ Worth, US, serves more than 4.4 million people using only 17 access\npoints\
    \ [43]. This large number of users per base station can be further up-scaled by\
    \ developing and\nadopting CR-LPWAN systems.\n6.1.5. Improved Reliability\nWith\
    \ less hardware involvement and additional SDN usage for CR purposes, CR-LPWAN\
    \ systems\nwill provide reliable network operability [85]. This implies that channel\
    \ conditions will be better with\nfree bands to use and additional spectrum characterized\
    \ by lower noise levels as against the ISM bands.\nWith potential diversity in\
    \ the available spectral pool for CR-LPWAN technologies, the chances of\nusing\
    \ reliable channels will increase, thereby improving the QoS of LPWAN users.\n\
    6.2. Beneﬁts to IoT Application Areas\n6.2.1. Smart Grids\nFuture energy production\
    \ and supply networks will be based on the concept of smart grid\nnetworks (SGN).\
    \ In addition to being more sophisticated than traditional energy supply methods,\n\
    SGNs adopt complex communication networks in order to control and manage energy\
    \ supply. In this\nuse-case, SGNs use smart metering concepts to manage consumer\
    \ demand and supply. Consequently,\nthere exists constant communication between\
    \ energy meters at consumer sites and at control facilities\nmanaged by the energy\
    \ utility company.\nThe network architecture for SGNs consists of three\nlayers\
    \ namely\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n25 of 41\n1.\nCommunication between smart meters\
    \ and devices in the smart home called the home area\nnetwork (HAN);\n2.\nCommunication\
    \ between HAN and a network gateway called the ﬁeld area network (FAN);\n3.\n\
    Communication between different HANs called the neighborhood area network (NAN)\n\
    CR-LPWAN systems can be deployed in FANs and probably in NANs.\nSince network\n\
    gateways are located at great distances from most households, LPWANs can be used\
    \ for long-range\ncommunication. CR in LPWAN can be beneﬁcial under many conditions,\
    \ for example, it could help\nto avoid interference between HANs, FANs, and NANs\
    \ by adopting different frequency bands for\neach network. In this case, the NAN\
    \ can be allocated white spaces in the VHF to enable long distance\ntransmission\
    \ since signals in the low VHF bands propagate much farther in space. CR-LPWANs\
    \ could\nalso provide increased bandwidths to ensure that utility companies query\
    \ a large number of energy\nmeters within larger communities at greater transmission\
    \ speeds.\nIn the literature, we found some classic use of CR in smart grids,\
    \ for example, in [46] a CR\nsystem architecture, algorithms and a hardware testbed\
    \ were developed for SGN. They optimized\nthe computing power and response latency\
    \ of CR-SGNs. It was demonstrated that CR-SGN was able\nto recover data from simultaneous\
    \ smart meter transmissions in the presence of strong wideband\ninterference.\
    \ Similarly, in [89], an energy harvesting approach was proposed for resource-constrained\n\
    IoT devices. The node architecture of the energy harvesting CR comprised a power\
    \ provisioning\nunit (PPU), an ultra-low power processing unit (ULPP), and an\
    \ ultra-low power communication unit\n(ULPC). In the PPU, energy is harvested,\
    \ rectiﬁed, regulated, and used to supply the ULPP and ULPC.\nThe ULPP conducts\
    \ CR SS, modulation, coding, and smart grid related security processes. The ULPC\n\
    comprises the communication front-end including a demodulator, decoder, and other\
    \ CR functions.\nThe architecture in [89] adopts the CREN scheme (recall Section\
    \ 5.3).\n6.2.2. Smart Homes\nMany IoT applications are designed to automate home\
    \ devices, wherein smart devices such as\nlaptops, phones, TVs, cameras, domestic\
    \ appliances, and smart meters are capable of self-organising\nand relaying information\
    \ to users [28]. These IoT applications are presently deployed in the ISM\nbands,\
    \ which implies that they must compete with existing ISM band devices. Competition\
    \ causes\nfurther congestion of the crowed ISM bands leading to increased collision\
    \ rates and poor link quality.\nThus, there is need for IoT applications to switch\
    \ from ISM bands to TV white spaces (TVWS) in order\nto improve network performance\
    \ and reduce energy consumption rates in smart home applications [90].\nAlthough\
    \ intercommunication between home appliances are disposed to short range communication\n\
    technologies like ZigBee, nevertheless, there are examples where CR-LPWAN may\
    \ sufﬁce. For example,\nsmart cookers, alarm doorbells, and event switches can\
    \ be remotely control by users at a distance.\nIn this case, CR-LPWANs may be\
    \ beneﬁcial by enabling each device to migrate easily to white spaces\nthat guarantee\
    \ the best QoS.\nIn the literature, the application of CR in smart homes was discussed\
    \ in [21,28,74]. For example,\nRawat et al., in [18,28], discussed the use of\
    \ CR to facilitate opportunistic communication in smart\nhome devices via TVWS.\
    \ In [91], CR access to TVWS was proposed supporting high deﬁnition TV\n(HDTV)\
    \ distribution in smart homes. Sudha et al. [92] also discussed the use of CR\
    \ in smart home\nenvironments and a prototype was developed, wherein National\
    \ Instrument Universal Software Radio\nPeripheral (NI USRP) hardware platforms\
    \ and LabView software were used to conduct experiments.\nThese application use-cases\
    \ further strengthen the potentials of deploying CR-LPWAN systems for\nsmart home\
    \ applications.\n6.2.3. Telemedicine\nSmart sensors are deployed for telemedicine\
    \ purposes to provide remote healthcare and medical\nservices to outpatients.\
    \ Telemedicine is driven by the need to provide realtime access to vital signs\
    \ such\nas temperature, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and electrocardiogram signals\
    \ of patients. This may\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n26 of 41\ninvolve implanting\
    \ sensors in patients so that signals obtained via these sensors are communicated\n\
    to a remote server situated at the doctor’s station. CR-LPWAN systems can be deployed\
    \ to improve\naccess to spectrum in telemedicine applications. Since vitals are\
    \ critical datasets, it is essential to avoid\nerrors and to guarantee high speed\
    \ transmission. CR-LPWAN is well suited in such a case to provide\nlow latency\
    \ transmission in appropriate white spaces. Furthermore, in case of poor weather\
    \ conditions\ncausing increased error rates, CR allows LPWAN technologies to adapt\
    \ modulation schemes to the\nappropriate band for improved performance.\nIn [93],\
    \ an infrastructure-based CRN was introduced for telemedicine, wherein CR base\
    \ stations\nwere deployed to sense for free bands and forward such sensed data\
    \ to a remote healthcare station.\nSupport for real-time periodic telemonitoring\
    \ of network trafﬁc was also introduced. A CR system\nwas developed in [94] for\
    \ e-health applications in a hospital environment. The proposed system aimed\n\
    at protecting medical devices from harmful interference by adjusting device transmission\
    \ power to\nreduce electromagnetic interference. CR has been widely applied in\
    \ wireless body area networks\n(WBAN) to improve medical services. For example,\
    \ in [95], a viable CR architecture for medical body\narea networks was proposed\
    \ based on ultra wideband radio technology. Further discussion on the use\nof\
    \ CR in medical IoT applications can be found in [28,96–98]. Such classic examples\
    \ indicate that CR in\nLPWAN is a promising venture for IoT applications.\n6.2.4.\
    \ Vehicular Networks\nThe application of CR-LPWAN in vehicular networks presents\
    \ great potentials for improved\nperformance. CR-LPWANs would allow moving vehicles\
    \ to communicate over long single hops to a\nremote roadside infrastructure against\
    \ short range technologies, which require multi-hops to reach an\ninfrastructure\
    \ [99]. Speciﬁcally, high density vehicular networks could arise in market places,\
    \ cinemas\nand sporting arenas where large events are ongoing. This high-density\
    \ condition typically breeds\nincreased interference, which might grow spontaneously\
    \ to cripple the entire network. CR-LPWAN\nsystems are most suited to such cases\
    \ by providing frequency hopping capacity to robust bands in\norder to relieve\
    \ network congestion and improve performance.\nIn the literature, for example,\
    \ CR was used to increase communication bandwidth in vehicular ad\nhoc networks\
    \ [100]. In particular, cooperative SS was deployed among neighboring vehicles\
    \ along\nwith a belief propagation model. This was applied to address the problem\
    \ of distributed observations\nand to exploit redundancies in both space and time.\
    \ Improved performance was recorded. A spectrum\ndatabase assisted CR vehicular\
    \ network design was proposed in [101], which adheres to the FCC\nspeciﬁcation\
    \ for CR deployment, and it also provides a cost-revenue analysis based on parameters\n\
    such as vehicular density, base station road coverage, and database assisted sensing.\
    \ The ﬁndings\nin [101] will greatly improve the development of CR in vehicular\
    \ networks in terms of cost reduction\nand long-range transmissions. There are\
    \ several applications of CR in vehicular networks, which can\nbe found in [28,102],\
    \ and CR-LPWAN can only add to this growing list of application beneﬁts.\n6.2.5.\
    \ Smart Agriculture\nSmart agriculture could involve deploying sensors on foraging\
    \ animals in order to monitor\nand keep track of their movement and health conditions\
    \ [103]. Since these animals often transverse\nlong distances, CR-LPWAN systems\
    \ could provide white space transmission to achieve longer\nrange communication.\n\
    Most importantly, CR-LPWAN systems would allow these sensors to\ntransmitat different\
    \ frequency bands to avoid interference particularly when they forage faraway\
    \ to\nuncharted terrains.\n7. Challenges/Future Directions of CR-LPWAN\nWe categorize\
    \ challenges in CR-LPWAN into challenges at the PHY and upper layer levels.\n\
    Often, challenges at the PHY layer are known CR problems, which determine to a\
    \ large extent the\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n27 of 41\nsuccess of CR-LPWAN systems,\
    \ whereas challenges at the upper layers are typical problems capable\nof constraining\
    \ the efﬁcacy of CR-LPWAN systems. These are discussed as follows:\n7.1. PHY Layer\
    \ Challenges\nA number of PHY layer related challenges are discussed as follows:\n\
    7.1.1. Rendezvous\nThe rendezvous problem is related to the realization of a common\
    \ control channel (CCC) for\ncontrol messaging in CR-LPWAN networks and may be\
    \ experienced in ad-hoc-based CR-LPWAN\nnetwork conﬁgurations where coordination\
    \ will be required between end nodes. Rendezvous deﬁnes\nthe time it takes for\
    \ two or more CR end nodes to converge on a CCC. In practice, it is challenging\n\
    for CR-LPWAN nodes to simultaneously agree on a free channel to be used as CCC\
    \ for coordinating\ncommunication between CR-LPWAN end nodes. This challenge occurs\
    \ because the probability of\ntwo CR-LPWAN nodes scanning and converging on a\
    \ CCC without prior knowledge or agreement\nbetween both entities is often very\
    \ low. This is because different CR-LPWAN nodes often start their\nsearch for\
    \ white spaces at different frequency points, and may ﬁnd these white spaces at\
    \ different\nbands of the RF spectrum. Thus, it is often difﬁcult for two CR-LPWAN\
    \ nodes to start and discover\nthe same white space at that same time and frequency\
    \ location. This challenge is sometimes called the\n“CCC setup challenge” [28].\n\
    There are a number of efforts geared towards addressing this challenge such as\
    \ in [104–113].\nFor example, in [104], a rendezvous system was proposed wherein\
    \ end nodes search for free bands\nwithout any coordination. The developed system\
    \ contributed mainly in extending rendezvous\nconvergence to multiple users by\
    \ inheriting hopping sequences from other users. Their distributed\nalgorithms\
    \ called coordinated channel hopping (CCH) achieved 80% lower time to rendezvous\
    \ than\nexisting algorithms. Similarly, while noting that implementing rendezvous\
    \ is challenging since CR\nend nodes are unaware of each other before rendezvous,\
    \ authors in [112] proposed a fast rendezvous\nalgorithm based on channel hopping.\
    \ It was noted that the proposed fast rendezvous algorithm\ncan guarantee rendezvous\
    \ in 2N2 + N timeslots under asynchronous environments, where N is the\nnumber\
    \ of licensed channels in the network. Ohize and Dlodlo in [113] proposed a channel\
    \ hopping\nalgorithm for rendezvous in CRN using swarm intelligence. They deployed\
    \ an ant colony optimization\nalgorithm to guide nodes towards converging on the\
    \ best channel.\nEssentially, we note that the literature on the rendezvous problem\
    \ in CR is quite rich, and it is\na contemporary challenge that would affect CR-LPWAN\
    \ systems. As such, it is pertinent to address\nthe rendezvous problem towards\
    \ developing effective CR-LPWAN systems. Speciﬁcally, further\nresearch is required\
    \ to ensure that rendezvous algorithms are fast, simple, and energy efﬁcient for\n\
    CR-LPWAN purposes.\n7.1.2. Spectrum Sensing\nSpectrum sensing (SS) is a fundamental\
    \ function of any CR system including CR-LPWAN systems.\nSS determines the presence/absence\
    \ of PU signals in any band of interest. This is achieved by\ncomparing the estimated\
    \ energy value in a channel with a threshold value. If the energy value\nsurpasses\
    \ the threshold, then a PU is declared present, and if the energy value is below\
    \ the threshold,\nthe band is declared free (white space). There are several methods\
    \ proposed for SS in CR including:\nenergy detection (ED) method [20,29,114–118],\
    \ matched ﬁlter, cyclostationary detection, eigenvalue\nmethod, covariance method,\
    \ and prediction-based approaches [72]. Other recent applications of\nevolutionary\
    \ algorithms to improve SS performance in CR have been identiﬁed [119–122].\n\
    There are several challenges in developing effective and efﬁcient SS techniques\
    \ for CR-LPWANs.\nFor example, the ED is a fast, simple and cost effective method\
    \ for SS, however, it performs poorly in\nlow SNR regimes [117,123,124]. This\
    \ poor performance occurs because the ED depends on predeﬁned\nthreshold values\
    \ for detection. Many CR-LPWAN systems may be deployed in critical application\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6837\n28 of 41\ndomains such as military, medical, and business\
    \ domains. These application areas require greater\naccuracy levels, which the\
    \ ED may be unable to render. For example, in low SNR conditions, the\nthreshold\
    \ value of the ED drops too close to the noise ﬂoor resulting in increased noise\
    \ samples\ncrossing the threshold value, leading to increased false alarm rates.\
    \ There are several options to\naddress this challenge, for example, using effective\
    \ adaptive threshold techniques such as the forward\nconsecutive mean excision\
    \ (FCME) algorithm [125,126], double threshold methods [110,117,118,127–\n130],\
    \ Otsu [114,124], recursive methods [124,131], and several other methods [132–137].\
    \ These methods\nwould compute new threshold values without prior knowledge of\
    \ the noise ﬂoor in order to prevent\nexcessive false alarms, and to maximize\
    \ the detection rate of CR-LPWANs. Furthermore, it is essentially\nto reduce the\
    \ computational requirements and the energy consumption rates of ED methods deployed\n\
    in CR-LPWAN systems.\n7.1.3. Local or Cooperative Sensing\nLocal sensing is conducted\
    \ by a single node in order to decide whether PU signals are present\nor absent\
    \ in any band of interest. On the other hand, cooperative sensing involves multiple\
    \ end\nnodes conducting SS and collectively deciding whether PU signals are present\
    \ or absent [138]. This\ndecision is often taken by a central coordinator. There\
    \ are different approaches for cooperative sensing\nincluding linear combination\
    \ of local sensing from individual nodes [139], k − out − o f − N approach\nwherein\
    \ a certain number of participating nodes is required to conclude on a certain\
    \ outcome [140], the\nAnd-method in which any node that declares a band free (null\
    \ hypothesis) would make the coordinator\nto declare the band as free[141]. Cooperative\
    \ sensing is theoretically more effective than local sensing\nas it alleviates\
    \ the issues of shadowing and fading due to the collaborative efforts from different\n\
    nodes [138]. However, cooperative sensing introduces complexities, such as large\
    \ messaging overhead\nbetween nodes and gateways, and poor energy efﬁciency across\
    \ nodes. Local sensing on the other\nhand is limited by errors due to shadowing\
    \ and fading. Thus, it is essential to develop new methods\nto address these limitations\
    \ for effective CR-LPWAN deployment.\n7.1.4. Spectrum Mobility\nSpectrum mobility\
    \ enables CR systems to migrate seamlessly from an occupied channel to a free\n\
    band without disrupting ongoing communication sessions. It is often called spectrum\
    \ hand-off [54].\nOne main challenge in spectrum mobility is the presence of temporary\
    \ breaks during communication,\nwhich will greatly hamper the effectiveness of\
    \ CR-LPWAN systems as well. Although glitches in\ncommunication are inevitable,\
    \ nevertheless, it is essential to develop new methods for spectrum\nmobility\
    \ that would reduce such degrees of discontinuities to the barest minimal.\n7.1.5.\
    \ Incorporating Adaptive CR Technologies\nLPWAN transceivers can be integrated\
    \ with adaptive CR technologies. For example, the SX1276\nLPWAN transceiver is\
    \ a product of Semtech’s patented LoRa technology [142], which features the\n\
    LoRa long-range modem and provides high immunity to interference, on top of ensuring\
    \ minimal\ncurrent consumption rates. An area where adaptive CR technology can\
    \ be integrated is in the on-off\nkeying (OOK) modulation module of the SX1276\
    \ transceiver. The OOK demodulator in the SX1276\nchip works by comparing the\
    \ RSS output with a threshold value [142]. It uses three different threshold\n\
    modes, including the “manual or ﬁxed,” “peak,” and “average” threshold methods,\
    \ all conﬁgured\nusing the OokThreshType instruction set [142].\nTowards incorporating\
    \ CR technologies, it is required that these threshold methods be optimized\n\
    to ensure that licensed signals are accurately detected. The use of adaptive threshold\
    \ estimation\nalgorithms (ATAs) is advocated in the OOK demodulator block of the\
    \ SX1276. There are several ATAs\navailable for use such as the FCME algorithm\
    \ [143], the recursive onesided hypothesis testing (ROHT)\nalgorithm [124], the\
    \ ﬁrst order statistical technique (FOST) [144] also called the m-dB method [145],\n\
    and several other ATAs [128,132,146]. Nevertheless, one research issue to be addressed\
    \ is the reduction\nSensors 2020, 20, 6837\n29 of 41\nin the computational complexities\
    \ of these ATAs in order to reduce the power consumption rate of\nthe SX1276 chipset.\
    \ Summarily, adaptive CR technologies such as ATAs are essential in LPWAN\ntransceivers\
    \ in order to improve spectrum identiﬁcation, reduce interference, and ensure\
    \ effective\nbandwidth utilization. Some transceiver chipsets such as the ADF7241\
    \ based on IEEE 802.15.4\nZero-IF standard [147], the ATA8520 chip by Sigfox [148],\
    \ the ASIC transceiver by Weightless, and\nthe NANO-S100 by Ingenu [149], use\
    \ the “manual or ﬁxed” threshold method, and as such, they will\nlargely beneﬁt\
    \ from adaptive CR technologies.\n7.1.6. Other Challenges\nOther PHY layer challenges\
    \ that may confront the development of effective CR-LPWAN systems\nare listed\
    \ as follows:\n1.\nImproving scalability to admit additional devices;\n2.\nControl\
    \ and mitigation of interference issues between CR and PU operators [4,5];\n3.\n\
    Development of improved and higher data rate techniques for CR-LPWAN systems[4,5];\n\
    4.\nInteroperability between different CR-LPWAN technologies;\n5.\nLocalization,\
    \ link optimization, and adaptability issues [150];\n6.\nDeveloping functional\
    \ testbeds and simulators;\n7.\nSecurity, mobility, roaming, and co-existence\
    \ issues with other wireless technologies [4,5];\n8.\nSupport for data analytics,\
    \ efﬁcient spectral utilization, and reliability [5].\n7.2. Upper Layer Challenges\n\
    It is noted that CR is a major PHY layer solution to different communication networks\
    \ including\nthe LPWAN. Nevertheless, there are unique challenges that may limit\
    \ the efﬁcacy of CR-LPWAN\nsystems, which we discuss as follows:\n7.2.1. Connectivity\
    \ Challenges\nHere, we highlight challenges that may prevent CR-LPWAN devices\
    \ from establishing connection\nin CR-LPWAN networks as follows:\n1.\nConnectivity\
    \ compatibility issue: The challenge of connectivity compatibility, also termed\n\
    interoperability issue, stems from conditions wherein different users adopt different\
    \ connectivity\ntechnologies for different CR-LPWAN systems. This is due to the\
    \ present large IoT market\nspace, wherein technologies are developed from different\
    \ vendors. These technologies are often\nproprietary in nature, which compounds\
    \ further the issue of compatibility. It is thus difﬁcult for\nusers to migrate\
    \ easily or interconnect devices obtained from different vendors. This will cause\n\
    a divide in the market, which will ultimately limit the range of CR-LPWAN systems\
    \ and stiﬂe\nuser satisfaction.\n2.\nMaintainability issue: With different products\
    \ being available for use, different CR-LPWAN\nsystems will have different reliability\
    \ and durability levels. Consequently, devices may develop\nfaults, shut down,\
    \ or batteries may expire at different rates, limiting connectivity in CR-LPWAN\n\
    systems. In such cases, maintenance should be made easy to reduce the length of\
    \ down times.\n3.\nSignalling: Different technologies have different communication\
    \ modes, which may hamper\nsignalling between CR-LPWAN end nodes and different\
    \ gateways. For example, bidirectional\nsignalling may be required to ensure effective\
    \ data delivery in CR-LPWAN networks. However,\ndue to signalling mismatch between\
    \ different CR technologies, there may be breakdown in\nconnectivity.\n4.\nBandwidth:\
    \ Bandwidth usage and management is a factor in ensuring effective connectivity\n\
    in CR-LPWAN networks. With different products available for IoT applications,\
    \ there may be\nmore bandwidth requirement in an application over another. Thus,\
    \ inability to meet minimum\nbandwidth requirements across a variety of applications\
    \ may cause increase transmission error\nrates, which will limit connectivity.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6837\n30 of 41\n5.\nTransmission Power levels: Increasing transmission\
    \ distance often depends on the transmission\npower level of CR-LPWAN end nodes.\
    \ Thus, deploying devices with disparate transmission\npower levels can hamper\
    \ the connectivity of CR-LPWAN networks. Consequently, effort is\nrequired to\
    \ develop CR-LPWAN nodes that meet speciﬁc power transmission levels in order\
    \ to\nensure effective information transfer over CR-LPWAN networks.\n7.2.2. Networking\
    \ Challenges\nSimilar to most networks, CR-LPWAN networks are plagued by challenges\
    \ at the networking\nlevel. Owing to the large internetwork within the IoT space,\
    \ quite a number of networking protocols\nexist to ensure seamless interaction\
    \ and transfer of data. Most IoT applications interact with sensors\nand actuators\
    \ in order to monitor and conduct different tasks. Consequently, careful CR-LPWAN\n\
    network designs are required to ensure efﬁciency and scalability of such networks.\
    \ In this regard,\na few challenges at the networking level are discussed as follows:\n\
    1.\nSmall packet sizes: The requirement for low power consumption rates along\
    \ with long\ntransmission ranges may limit the data frame size to be deployed\
    \ in CR-LPWAN networks.\nFor example, the data frame size for Sigfox technologies\
    \ is a total of 26 bytes [151], whereas a total\npayload of 222 bytes (for data\
    \ rates 4–7) is provided by LoRa for use in Europe and 242 bytes for\nuse in the\
    \ US [152]. This is quite small to satisfy the demands of all IoT use-cases. Furthermore,\n\
    there are different standards for frame sizes across different proprietary technologies,\
    \ which may\nrender the networking process of CR-LPWAN devices a burdensome task.\
    \ Improvement in the\nstandardization process is highly encouraged.\n2.\nRouting:\
    \ Many CR-LPWAN networks consist of large numbers of end nodes; thus, effective\n\
    routing schemes are essential. In this regard, light weight routing protocols\
    \ are required in\nCR-LPWANs since CR functionalities often incur additional computational\
    \ overheads. The IETF\nis strongly involved in addressing routing issues in IoT\
    \ with several new protocols being deployed,\nfor example, the CoAP. They have\
    \ also developed the RPL (IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power\nand Lossy Networks),\
    \ which tackles problems associated with mesh networking in IoT [153].\nWith the\
    \ burgeoning of CR-LPWAN, these standards may require further extensions in order\n\
    to address the challenge of increased routing computational demands, which may\
    \ arise from\nspectrum mobility across different white spaces.\n7.2.3. Security\
    \ Challenges\nIoT applications often involve the transfer of conﬁdential information,\
    \ for example, acquiring\nmedical vitals in telemedicine, or within smart city\
    \ networks, wherein utility bills are transferred.\nThese applications may require\
    \ secured links before communication can be initiated. This may be\nrealized,\
    \ albeit at the expense of increased complexities, energy consumption rates, and\
    \ costs, which\nwill limit many IoT use-cases [154]. Thus, attacks such as unauthorized\
    \ use of personal data, data leaks\nor spooﬁng, hacking, denial of service, and\
    \ ﬂooding, are potential challenges that must be addressed\nin CR-LPWAN networks.\
    \ In fact, the use of CR in LPWAN introduces the speciﬁc security problem\nof\
    \ primary user emulation (PUE) attack, wherein attackers could emulate bona ﬁde\
    \ PU transmitters\nin order to deprive other CR-LPWAN devices access to white\
    \ spaces [155]. Other speciﬁc security\nchallenges may include:\n1.\nLight weight\
    \ Security Protocols: There are a number of existing security protocols for traditional\n\
    wireless networks and IoT networks [156], which cannot be deployed for CR-LPWAN\
    \ applications\nbecause of their complexities. It is thus required to develop\
    \ light weight security protocols to\nensure low power consumption rates, and\
    \ reduced complexity in CR-LPWANs.\n2.\nSoftware Vulnerability: It is often expected\
    \ that the initial version of most software are plagued\nby programming bugs known\
    \ as software vulnerabilities [154]. It is essential to reduce as much\nas possible\
    \ the number of bugs in CR-LPWAN software, e.g., spectrum mobility and management\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 6837\n31 of 41\nsoftware, to reduce the risk of back-door sabotage,\
    \ which may lead to malicious attacks and\nnetwork downtimes if left unchecked.\n\
    3.\nMalware: The promising and open spectrum-access nature of CR-LPWAN suggests\
    \ that it is\na potential breeding ground for malware attacks. Malicious attackers\
    \ are constantly on the\nprowl looking for possible loopholes to exploit. While\
    \ malware attacks against IoT software\nmay seem far fetched, it is worth noting\
    \ that Symantec has declared the detection of the ﬁrst\npiece of IoT malware (a\
    \ worm) termed “Linux.Darlloz” [157]. Others include Mirai, which turn\nnetworked\
    \ devices running Linux into remotely controlled bots for large-scale network\
    \ attacks.\nThese discoveries imply that CR-LPWAN devices and networks are not\
    \ exempted from possible\nmalware attacks, which demand new research measures\
    \ to improve security.\n8. Conclusions\nLow power wide area networks (LPWANs)\
    \ are being widely deployed to interconnect\nmany IoT-based applications, particularly\
    \ applications that require long transmission ranges, low\ndevice/development\
    \ costs, low power consumption rates (i.e., long battery lifetimes), and high\n\
    scalability, albeit at low data rates. Nevertheless, many of these LPWAN technologies\
    \ are frequently\nsusceptible to a number of persisting challenges, such as increased\
    \ interference in the ISM band,\nspectral inefﬁciency, and low data rates. Consequently,\
    \ there is need for new ideas and paradigms to\naddress these problems for which\
    \ cognitive radio (CR) sufﬁces as a candidate solution. Thus, in this\narticle,\
    \ we have discussed the concept of deploying CR in LPWAN systems via a review\
    \ of different\nstate-of-the-art developers in LPWAN technologies, their respective\
    \ competing standards, and several\napplication areas; likewise for CR systems.\
    \ Details regarding the development and integration of CR\nin LPWAN for IoT were\
    \ considered on a general note, including the description of a simple network\n\
    architecture for CR-LPWAN, potential beneﬁts, and challenges. Essentially, this\
    \ paper has examined\nthe possibilities for CR-LPWAN systems. Presently, only\
    \ a few LPWAN technologies provide full\nsupport for CR in their technologies;\
    \ thus, this article intends to spur future research interests in the\nstudy area\
    \ of CR-LPWAN systems.\nAuthor Contributions:\nThese authors A.J.O., A.M.A.-M.,\

    \ (IoT) represents a bright prospect that a variety of common\nappliances can\
    \ connect to one another, as well as with the rest of the Internet, to vastly\
    \ improve\nour lives. Unique communication and security challenges have been brought\
    \ out by the limited\nhardware, low-complexity, and severe energy constraints\
    \ of IoT devices. In addition, a severe\nspectrum scarcity problem has also been\
    \ stimulated by the use of a large number of IoT devices.\nIn this paper, cognitive\
    \ IoT (CIoT) is considered where an IoT network works as the secondary\nsystem\
    \ using underlay spectrum sharing. A wireless energy harvesting (EH) node is used\
    \ as a relay\nto improve the coverage of an IoT device. However, the relay could\
    \ be a potential eavesdropper\nto intercept the IoT device’s messages. This paper\
    \ considers the problem of secure communication\nbetween the IoT device (e.g.,\
    \ sensor) and a destination (e.g., controller) via the wireless EH untrusted\n\
    relay. Since the destination can be equipped with adequate energy supply, secure\
    \ schemes based on\ndestination-aided jamming are proposed based on power splitting\
    \ (PS) and time splitting (TS) policies,\ncalled intuitive secure schemes based\
    \ on PS (Int-PS), precoded secure scheme based on PS (Pre-PS),\nintuitive secure\
    \ scheme based on TS (Int-TS) and precoded secure scheme based on TS (Pre-TS),\n\
    respectively. The secure performances of the proposed schemes are evaluated through\
    \ the metric\nof probability of successfully secure transmission (PSST), which\
    \ represents the probability that the\ninterference constraint of the primary\
    \ user is satisﬁed and the secrecy rate is positive. PSST is analyzed\nfor the\
    \ proposed secure schemes, and the closed form expressions of PSST for Pre-PS\
    \ and Pre-TS\nare derived and validated through simulation results. Numerical\
    \ results show that the precoded\nsecure schemes have better PSST than the intuitive\
    \ secure schemes under similar power consumption.\nWhen the secure schemes based\
    \ on PS and TS polices have similar PSST, the average transmit power\nconsumption\
    \ of the secure scheme based on TS is lower. The inﬂuences of power splitting\
    \ and time\nslitting ratios are also discussed through simulations.\nKeywords:\

    \ an emerging era of networking that provides ubiquitous\nconnectivity and information\
    \ exchange spanning home, vehicular, healthcare monitoring and industrial\nenvironment\
    \ [1–4].\nA large number of common entities with computing and communication\n\
    capabilities can be connected to the Internet. The pervasive sensing and control\
    \ capabilities of such\nsmart objects will lead to a transformative change of\
    \ the whole society. Although the term IoT has\nbeen proposed for almost a decade\
    \ [5], the corresponding technologies and protocols are still open\nresearch issues.\n\

    Sensors 2017, 17, 2023\n2 of 21\nA serious issue caused by the usage of massive\
    \ IoT devices is the spectrum scarcity. The concept\nof Cognitive Internet of\
    \ Things (CIoT) has been advocated to solve this problem [6–11]. In a CIoT\nnetwork,\
    \ an IoT device acts as an unlicensed secondary user and operates on the same\
    \ spectrum bands\nowned by a licensed primary user. According to the sensing ability\
    \ of the IoT device, the IoT device\ncan access the spectrum in different ways.\
    \ When the IoT device has the capability of spectrum\nsensing, it senses the spectrum\
    \ and transmits when a spectrum whole is detected.\nThis kind\nof dynamic spectrum\
    \ access is called overlay spectrum sharing [12]. However, it is challenging\n\
    to design lightweight spectrum sensing algorithms with high detection probability\
    \ for a simple\nand energy-constraint device. When the IoT device does not sense\
    \ the spectrum, it accesses the\nprimary spectrum bands as long as the secondary\
    \ transmission satisﬁes the interference threshold\nconstraint [12], which indicates\
    \ the tolerance of the secondary transmission at the primary receiver [13].\n\
    This kind of dynamic spectrum access is called underlay spectrum sharing [10].\
    \ To satisfy the\ninterference threshold constraint, it is required that the secondary\
    \ user has the knowledge of the\ninterference level at the primary receiver. Spectrum\
    \ leasing is another way to access the primary\nspectrum bands when the IoT device\
    \ does not employ spectrum sensing [9,11]. In CIoT networks\nbased on spectrum-leasing,\
    \ the primary user leases its spectrum to the secondary user who has helped\n\
    to relay the primary signals. Despite the limited resources including restricted\
    \ power supply, limited\ndata processing capability and range of communication,\
    \ the IoT devices have to share their precious\nresources with the primary user\
    \ to win the rights to access the primary spectrum.\nCommunication security is\
    \ obviously another critical problem in IoT networks, due to their\nextensive\
    \ application in commercial, governmental, industrial and military applications\
    \ [14].\nHowever, the broadcast nature of wireless communication makes the transmission\
    \ vulnerable\nto eavesdropping attack. Traditional cryptographic encryption has\
    \ been widely used to protect\nthe message from being eavesdropped [15,16]. Nevertheless,\
    \ there are difﬁculties and vulnerabilities\nassociated with key distribution\
    \ and management in IoT networks that have a very large number\nof resource-constrained\
    \ IoT devices, heterogeneous Radio access technologies (RATs) and different\n\
    subsystems controlled by distinct operators. As a result, lightweight protocols\
    \ with high efﬁciency are\nappealing solutions for the security issues in the\
    \ IoT.\nPhysical layer security (PLS) has attracted much attention recently, since\
    \ it is generally irrelevant\nto the RAT, and offers “built-in” security that\
    \ is information-theoretically unbreakable. The main\nidea of PLS is exploiting\
    \ the wireless channels and interference environments to keep the conﬁdential\n\
    message from eavesdropping. So far, a variety of PLS techniques have been proposed,\
    \ such as artiﬁcial\nnoise techniques [17], cooperative relay transmission [18],\
    \ secure beamforming [19], and coding\nstrategy [20].\nSince cooperative communication\
    \ through the relays has proven advantageous\nin improving the network coverage\
    \ and energy efﬁciency, PLS techniques based on cooperative relay\ntransmission\
    \ are of signiﬁcant importance in the IoT, where the devices usually have restricted\
    \ power\nsupply and limited coverage range for the reliable communication. Numerous\
    \ papers have emerged to\ndeal with the secrecy issue in relay networks where\
    \ the relays are trusted and act as friendly helpers to\nresist external eavesdroppers\
    \ [18,21,22]. However, the relay itself should be considered as an untrusted\n\
    entity in some applications. For example, in defense, ﬁnancial, and government\
    \ intelligence networks,\ndifferent users have the different rights to access\
    \ information. Furthermore, a relay from a different\nnetwork may not have the\
    \ permission to acquire the information as the source and the destination\ndoes.\
    \ How to keep the information conﬁdential from the relay is an important security\
    \ issue.\nTaking into consideration the severe issues of spectrum scarcity and\
    \ security, a CIoT network is\nconsidered and underlay spectrum sharing strategy\
    \ is used, where sensing capability is not required for\nthe IoT devices. A relay\
    \ acts as an information forwarder as well as a potential eavesdropper. Without\n\
    considering the energy constraint of the relay, numerous papers have studied the\
    \ secure transmission\nvia the relays [23,24]. Since energy harvesting techniques\
    \ can exploit the external energy source and\nrelieve devices from the constraints\
    \ induced by battery usage, a prospective study on the secure\ntransmission via\
    \ an energy harvesting relay is provided in this paper. To enhance the security\
    \ of the\nSensors 2017, 17, 2023\n3 of 21\nCIoT network, the destination transmits\
    \ jamming signals to jam the untrusted relay while the IoT\ndevice transmits the\
    \ information signals. Both the information and jamming signals are used by the\n\
    EH relay for energy harvesting. Power splitting (PS) and time splitting (TS) receiver\
    \ architectures [25]\nare used at the relay. Our main contributions and key results\
    \ are summarized in the following.\n•\nWe propose PLS transmission schemes for\
    \ a CIoT network where an untrusted relay helps the\nsecondary transmission. To\
    \ the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst paper to consider the\nsecurity\
    \ issue in an underlay CIoT network with an untrusted relay from the PLS perspective.\n\
    Since the transmissions of the IoT nodes may cause interference with the primary\
    \ receiver,\nthe existing secrecy criteria (e.g., secrecy outage or secrecy rate)\
    \ can not describe the system\nperformance properly.\nIn this paper, we derived\
    \ a new criterion to illustrate the secrecy\nperformance of the CIoT network.\n\
    •\nTo protect the information from being intercepted by the untrusted relay, amplify-and-forward\n\
    relaying protocol is used and destination-aided jamming strategy is adopted. An\
    \ intuitive secure\nscheme and a precoded secure scheme are proposed for the CIoT\
    \ network based on PS and TS\npolicies, respectively. The secrecy performances\
    \ of these schemes are evaluated by the probability\nof successfully secure transmission\
    \ (PSST), which represents the probability that the interference\nthreshold constraint\
    \ is satisﬁed and the secrecy rate of the secondary transmission is positive.\n\
    The closed forms of PSST of the precoded secure schemes based on PS and TS policies\
    \ are given\nand veriﬁed with the simulation results.\n•\nWe compare the intuitive\
    \ secure scheme and the precoded secure scheme based on PS and TS\npolicies, and\
    \ ﬁnd out that the precoded secure schemes have better PSST than the intuitive\
    \ secure\nschemes under similar power consumption. Moreover, the precoded secure\
    \ scheme based on TS\npolicy is more energy efﬁcient than that based on PS policy.\n\
    •\nThe numerical results show that PSST of the PS policy is not sensitive to the\
    \ PS ratio when\nPSST reaches a certain value, and an optimal PS ratio maximizing\
    \ the achievable secrecy rate\nis considered under the PSST constraint. In the\
    \ TS policy, the time splitting ratio shows both\nconstructive and destructive\
    \ effects on the two-hop secondary transmission via the EH untrusted\nrelay. Thus,\
    \ there exists an optimal energy harvesting time in the TS policy that maximizes\
    \ PSST.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We discuss the related\
    \ work in Section 2. Section 3\ndescribes the CIoT network with an untrusted EH\
    \ relay. The PLS schemes based on PS and TS policies\nare proposed in Sections\
    \ 4 and 5, respectively, where the performances of the proposed PLS schemes\n\
    are analyzed in terms of PSST. Numerical results are presented in Section 6, and\
    \ the effects of different\nsystem parameters on the secrecy performance of the\
    \ proposed PLS schemes are discussed and various\ndesign insights are obtained.\
    \ Finally, we draw conclusions in Section 7.\n2. Related Work\nThe related research\
    \ about physical layer security suitable for IoT is summarized in this section.\n\
    Then, we discuss some existing work on PLS using untrusted relays and energy harvesting\
    \ entities.\nThere are two main categories of PLS techniques: (1) intelligent\
    \ designs to keep the information\nsecure from the eavesdroppers where no secret\
    \ key is needed; and (2) generation of secret keys\nover public channels by exploiting\
    \ the wireless communication medium [26]. In this paper, we are\nmore interested\
    \ in the ﬁrst category, which does not require error-free two-way public channels.\n\
    Moreover, keyless secrecy methods are more easily extended to large-scale sensor\
    \ networks.\nIn the downlink communication network of the IoT, the controllers\
    \ transmit signals, and they\ncould be equipped with multiple antennas and adequate\
    \ energy supply. The PLS schemes such as\noptimal precoding, artiﬁcial noise and\
    \ secure space-time coding can be applicable in the IoT, and the\npros and cons\
    \ of these conventional PLS techniques have been summarized in [14]. Secrecy rate\n\
    and secrecy outage probability are main metrics to evaluate the secrecy performance.\
    \ In the uplink\ncommunication network of the IoT, an IoT device, such as a sensor\
    \ or a surveillance camera, transmits\nSensors 2017, 17, 2023\n4 of 21\nto the\
    \ controller, and the IoT device is usually resource-constrained. The channel-aware\
    \ encryption\n(CAE) scheme proposed in [27] is an appealing solution in sensor\
    \ networks where sensors have very\nlow data rate. In the CAE scheme, a sensor\
    \ may stay dormant, report a “ﬂipped” decision, or report its\nunaltered local\
    \ decision at each instant. How it acts depends on where its instantaneous channel\
    \ fading\ngain to the legal controller falls among some known thresholds. How\
    \ to optimize these comparison\nthresholds is not discussed by the authors in\
    \ [27]. In [28], the optimal thresholds were derived to further\nimprove the performance.\
    \ When relays are used in IoT networks with passive eavesdroppers with\nlocations,\
    \ a randomize-and-forward relay scheme has been proposed in [29]. The authors\
    \ formulated\na secrecy-rate maximization problem subject to a secrecy-outage-probability\
    \ constraint, and designed\nthe optimal power allocation and codeword rate [29].\
    \ Considering the spectrum scarcity, a Cognitive\nInternet of Things (CIoT) has\
    \ been proposed where the IoT device acts as a secondary user and accesses\nthe\
    \ primary spectrum by using the spectrum-leasing strategy [9]. To achieve secure\
    \ transmission,\nthe authors utilized cooperative jamming performed by an energy\
    \ harvesting helper. Based on the\ncooperative jamming scheme, an auction framework\
    \ was proposed to build an incentive mechanism\nfor the secondary users. The channel\
    \ assignment problem in time-critical IoT-based cognitive radio\nnetworks under\
    \ proactive jamming attacks was considered in [30]. Subject to delay constraints,\n\
    a probabilistic spectrum assignment algorithm that aimed at minimizing the packet\
    \ invalidity ratio of\neach cognitive radio transmission has been proposed. Since\
    \ energy harvesting is an appealing and\npromising technology [31,32], more and\
    \ more papers study PLS problems with EH nodes recently.\nIn [10], the PLS issue\
    \ of cognitive sensor radio networks (CSRNs) with an external EH eavesdropper\n\
    was investigated. Underlay spectrum sharing was used in CSRNs. The sensor node\
    \ acts as the\nsecondary user, and adjusts its transmit power to guarantee the\
    \ primary user’s quality-of-service\n(QoS). Two scenarios with different interference\
    \ power constraints were studied and the closed-form\nanalytical expressions of\
    \ secrecy outage probability for both cases were derived [10]. Authors in [33]\n\
    considered an underlay cognitive radio system, where a source in a secondary system\
    \ transmitted\ninformation to a full-duplex (FD) wireless EH destination node\
    \ in the presence of an eavesdropper.\nThe harvested energy at the destination\
    \ was used to send jamming signals, so that the eavesdropper’s\ndecoding capacity\
    \ is degraded. Upper and lower bounds of probability of strictly positive secrecy\n\
    capacity (SPSC) have been derived in [33]. However, these existing secure schemes\
    \ are based on the\nassumption that the nodes in the IoT or CIoT are trusted,\
    \ and they are designed to prevent interception\nfrom the eavesdroppers outside.\n\
    When untrusted relays are considered, numerous PLS schemes have been proposed\
    \ based\non different relaying protocols. Authors in [34] adopted a successive\
    \ amplify-and-forward (AF)\nrelaying scheme, where the multi-antenna source transmitted\
    \ to two selected nodes alternately.\nThe inter-relay interference, which is usually\
    \ regarded as detrimental, was used to jam the untrusted\nnodes.\nThe authors\
    \ proposed several relay selection schemes with different complexities and\nderived\
    \ the closed-form expressions of the lower bound of secrecy outage probability\
    \ in [34].\nFor multiple-antenna untrusted relay systems, a joint destination-aided\
    \ cooperative jamming and\nprecoding scheme was devised to maximize the secrecy\
    \ rate by jointly designing the precoding matrices\nfor the source, relay, and\
    \ destination [35]. Authors in [23] proposed a modulo-and-forward (MF) protocol\n\
    at the relay with nested lattice encoding at the source to improve the secrecy\
    \ in a dual-hop untrusted relay\nnetwork. A multi-hop line network was considered\
    \ in [24], where each node received signals transmitted by\nits neighbors, and\
    \ the leftmost node sent messages to the rightmost node. When any or all of the\
    \ relay nodes\ncan be eavesdroppers, it has been shown in [24] that it is possible\
    \ to achieve end-to-end secure and reliable\ncommunication by utilizing nested\
    \ lattice codes. Kalamkar, S.S. et. al. in [32] investigated the problem of\n\
    secure cooperative communication with the help of a wireless EH untrusted node.\
    \ To realize the positive\nsecrecy rate, destination-aided cooperative jamming\
    \ was used. Analytical expressions were derived for\nthe secrecy outage probability\
    \ and the ergodic secrecy rate to evaluate the secrecy performance in [32].\n\
    The goal of this paper is to solve the security problem in a CIoT network where\
    \ a wireless EH\nuntrusted node is used to relay the IoT device’s information.\
    \ Underlay spectrum sharing is adopted\nSensors 2017, 17, 2023\n5 of 21\nby the\
    \ CIoT network to relieve the stress of spectrum scarcity. As long as the interference\
    \ threshold\nconstraint is satisﬁed, the IoT device and the relay can access the\
    \ primary spectrum, and the capability\nof spectrum sensing is not required. Although\
    \ the IoT device and the relay may have strict energy\nconstraints, the controller\
    \ could have adequate energy supply. Therefore, destination-aided cooperative\n\
    jamming is used to provide secure transmission. Together with the source signal,\
    \ this jamming signal\nis also used for energy harvesting at the relay.\n3. System\
    \ Model\nThe considered CIoT network is shown in Figure 1, where an IoT network\
    \ works as the secondary\nnetwork, and the primary network has a primary receiver\
    \ P. The primary transmitter is located\nfar away from the IoT network as in [10,33].\
    \ Therefore, there is no interference from the primary\ntransmitter to the IoT\
    \ network. In the secondary IoT network, an IoT device S (e.g., sensor) tries\n\
    to transmit to the destination D (e.g., controller) through an EH untrusted relay\
    \ node R. The direct\nlink between S and D is unavailable. Although the untrusted\
    \ relay helps the secondary transmission,\nS and D try to prevent information\
    \ leakage to the relay. Each node is equipped with a single antenna\nand works\
    \ in half-duplex mode. Channel reciprocity is assumed as in [32]. It is assumed\
    \ that all links\nexperience independent and quasi-static Rayleigh fading, and\
    \ the channel remains constant during\nthe period of T [32]. The channel power\
    \ gain is given by ∥hc∥2, which has exponential distribution\nwith mean gc , i.e.,\n\
    f|hc|2(x) = 1\ngc\ne− x\ngc ,\n(1)\nwhere hc represents the link between S − R,\
    \ D − R, S − P, D − P or R − P, the subscript c can be SR, DR,\nSP, DP, and RP\
    \ accordingly, and f|hc|2(x) is the probability density function of random variable\
    \ |hc|2.\nInformation(wiretap) link\nInformation link\nS\nD\nR\nP\nSecondary \n\

    \ receiver P is required to be\nunder the interference threshold Γ. Assume that\
    \ the secondary nodes know the statistic channel\ninformation between them and\
    \ the primary receiver [36]. As in [31,37], the relay uses the harvested\nenergy\
    \ completely for the transmission. PS and TS based receiver-architecture are used\
    \ at R, and the\nreceiver architecture for the separated information and energy\
    \ receiving is shown in Figure 2. With PS,\nthe information receiver and the energy\
    \ receiver are both in on mode for a duration of T. The relay\nsplits the received\
    \ power for two purposes: one part for energy harvesting and the remaining part\n\
    for information processing. With TS, the relay splits the time of T, and switches\
    \ between the status\nof energy harvesting and information processing.\nSensors\

    \ based on PS\nand TS policies. Unless otherwise stated, the notations are consistent\
    \ in this paper.\n4. Secure Schemes Based on PS Policy\nAs shown in Figure 3,\
    \ a transmission period of T for the PS policy is divided into two phases\nwith\
    \ equal durations. In the ﬁrst phase, S and D transmit simultaneously to R with\
    \ power PS and PD\nrespectively. The jamming signal transmitted by D is used not\
    \ only as an interference but also as an\nenergy source to R. R uses ρ (0 < ρ\
    \ < 1) of the received power for energy harvesting and the rest\n(1 − ρ) of the\
    \ received power for information processing. ρ is the power splitting ratio. By\
    \ exploiting\nthe harvested energy, R ampliﬁes and forwards the received information\
    \ to D in the second phase.\nAn intuitive secure scheme based on PS policy (Int-PS)\
    \ is given as follows.\nR to D: Information Transmission\nT/2\nT/2\nEnergy harvesting\n\

    \ policy can be written as\nEH = ηρ(PS|hSR|2 + PD|hDR|2)(T\n2 ),\n(2)\nwhere η\
    \ ∈ (0,1] is the energy transform efﬁciency, whose value depends on the energy\
    \ harvesting\ncircuit design of R. The terms PS|hSR|2 and PD|hDR|2 in (2) represent\
    \ the power received at R from S\nand D, respectively. Then, R uses the harvested\
    \ energy to forward the source information to D in the\nsecond phase, and the\
    \ transmit power of R becomes\nPH = EH\nT/2 = ηρ(PS|hSR|2 + PD|hDR|2).\n(3)\n\
    R uses the remaining (1 − ρ) of the received signal in the ﬁrst phase for information\
    \ processing.\nDenote this part of signal as yR, and yR is expressed as\nyR =\n\
    q\n(1 − ρ)PShSRxS +\nq\n(1 − ρ)PDhDRxD + nR,\n(4)\nwhere xS is the information\

    from D, nR is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at R, and nR ∼ CN (0, σ2\n\
    R). The untrusted\nSensors 2017, 17, 2023\n7 of 21\nrelay may try to intercept\
    \ the information message xS of S. Based on (4), the signal to interference and\n\

    plus AWGN at P is given as\nPInt−PS\nI1\n= PS|hSP|2 + PD|hDP|2 + σ2\nP1.\n(7)\n\
    In the second phase, R ampliﬁes yR as xR = βyR, and forwards xR to D, where β\
    \ =\nr\nPH\n(1−ρ)(PS|hSR|2+PD|hDR|2)+σ2\nR . The received signal yD at D is\n\

    p\n(1 − ρ)PDhDRxD in (8)\ncan be cancelled by D since the jamming signal xD was\

    \ PD|hDR|2)|hRP|2 + σ2\nP2,\n(12)\nwhere σ2\nP2 is the power of the noise at P\
    \ in the second phase.\n4.1.2. Probability of Successfully Secure Transmission\
    \ of Int-PS\nSince R is untrusted, the instantaneous secrecy rate RS of the secondary\
    \ IoT network can be\nwritten as [38]\nRPS\nS = 1\n2[log2( 1 + γD\n(1 + γR\n)]+,\n\
    (13)\nwhere [x]+ = max(x,0). In the CIoT network, PSST represents the probability\

    \ represents that only when the total\nSensors 2017, 17, 2023\n8 of 21\ninterference\
    \ power at the primary user is under the interference threshold can the source\
    \ transmit\nits message to the destination, while the secrecy rate is greater\
    \ than zero. Therefore, PSST of the CIoT\nnetwork is deﬁned as\nPSST = Pr(RS >\
    \ 0, PInt−PS\nI1\n≤ Γ, PInt−PS\nI2\n≤ Γ),\n(14)\nwhere Γ is the interference threshold\
    \ of P.\nFrom the expressions of RPS\nS , PInt−PS\nI1\n, and PInt−PS\nI2\n, we\
    \ can ﬁnd out that the event PInt−PS\nI1\n≤ Γ\nis independent from the events\

    \ the intuitive secure scheme based on TS policy encounters the same\nproblem\
    \ as the intuitive secure scheme based on PS policy. That is, the chance of outage\
    \ in the second\nsubslot increases as the channel quality of the link between\
    \ R and S (D) improves. Therefore, taking\ninto consideration of the channel inﬂuence,\
    \ we propose the precoded scheme based on TS policy\n(Pre-TS) in the following.\n\
    5.2.1. Energy Harvesting and Information Processing of Pre-TS\nFor Pre-TS, the\
    \ transmit power at R is given as\nPH = 2ητPD\n1 − τ ,\n(51)\nwhile the received\
    \ signal at R is given by\nyR =\np\nPSxS +\np\nPDxD + nR.\n(52)\nBased on (52),\
    \ the SINR at R can be written as\nγPre−TS\nR\n=\nPS\nPD + σ2\nR\n.\n(53)\nSimilarly,\
    \ we denote the received signal at P as\nyP1 =\n√PShSP\nhSR\nxS +\n√PDhDP\nhDR\n\
    xD + nP1.\n(54)\nIn addition, the instantaneous interference power plus the noise\

    P1.\n(55)\nIn the second subslot, R forwards the ampliﬁed version xR = βyR to\
    \ D, where β =\nr\nPH\nPS+PD+σ2\nR .\nThen, the received signal at D is written\
    \ as\nyD = β\np\nPShDRxS + βhDRnR + nD.\n(56)\nThus, by a series of simpliﬁcations,\
    \ the SNR at D eventually becomes\nγPre−TS\nD\n=\nPS|hDR|2\n|hDR|2σ2\nR + (1−τ)(PS+PD+σ2\n\

    \ derivation follows\nthe same steps as in section 4.2.2. Thus, we skip the process\
    \ here for brevity.\n6. Discussion and Simulations\nNumerical results are presented\
    \ in this section to investigate the secrecy performance of the\nCIoT network\
    \ where an untrusted wireless EH relay is used to help the secondary transmission.\n\
    We discuss the inﬂuence of different system parameters on the probabilities of\
    \ successfully secure\ntransmission of the intuitive and precoded secure schemes\
    \ based on PS and TS policies. Unless\notherwise explicitly speciﬁed, simulation\
    \ parameters are set as η = 0.5, σ2\nD = σ2\nR = σ2\nP1 = σ2\nP2 = σ2,\nΓ/σ2 =\
    \ 23 dB, gSP = gDP = gRP and gSR = gDR. Let α = gSR/gSP. We deﬁne the transmit\
    \ SNR of S\nand D for intuitive secure schemes as PS/σ2 = 20dB and PD/σ2 = 20\
    \ dB, respectively.\n6.1. Comparison between Int-PS and Pre-PS\nIn this subsection,\
    \ the inﬂuence of power splitting factor ρ on PSST is discussed for the intuitive\n\
    and precoded secure schemes based on PS policy. The channels are assumed independently\
    \ identically\ndistributed, and gc = 1. For a certain transmission, the transmit\
    \ SNR for the precoded secure\nschemes is denoted as Pi/σ2|hiR|2 (i ∈ {S, D}).\
    \ The average transmit SNR is referred to the ratio of\nthe average transmit power\
    \ to the noise power for the duration of T, which represents the average\npower\
    \ consumption.\nIn Figure 5, the inﬂuence of ρ on PSST of the precoded and intuitive\
    \ schemes based on PS policy is\ngiven, and the average power consumption is also\
    \ discussed. First, we can ﬁnd out from Figure 5a\nthat the closed form expression\
    \ of PSST of Pre-PS coincides with the simulation result perfectly. For the\n\
    transmissions of Pre-PS, Pi/σ2\ni |hiR|2 (i ∈ {S, D}) is set to be 17 dB. We can\
    \ see from Figure 5b that the\naverage transmit SNR of Pre-PS at D during T is\
    \ almost the same as that of Int-PS, which is 20 dB.\nThe average transmit SNR\
    \ of Pre-PS at S increases as ρ increases, and approaches 20 dB when ρ > 0.6.\n\
    From Figure 5, we ﬁnd out that Pre-PS outperforms Int-PS in terms of PSST when\
    \ the average power\nconsumptions of both are similar. In addition, it is necessary\
    \ to state that PSST of Pre-PS decreases\ndramatically and becomes worse than\
    \ Int-PS when ρ approaches zero. This is mainly because the\nprobability of the\
    \ event PI2 ≤ Γ decreases dramatically and converges to zero when the value of\
    \ ρ goes\nto zero, which can be found easily from (31).\nIn Figure 6, the inﬂuence\
    \ of different channel qualities on PSST is shown and the average power\nconsumption\
    \ is discussed. In the simulation , gSR and gRD increases so that α increases.\
    \ We can see\nfrom Figure 6a that the analytical result of Pre-Ps is in excellent\
    \ agreement with the simulation result\nof Pre-PS. The value of PSST of Pre-PS\
    \ increases and converges to 1 quickly as α increases, while the\nsituation is\
    \ opposite for Int-PS. The reason is as follows. The increasing of α means better\
    \ channel\ncondition for the S − R and R − D links. As the transmit SNR for Int-PS\
    \ is ﬁxed, better channel quantity\nof S − R and R − D links would result in higher\
    \ probability of interrupting the primary receiver in the\nsecond phase, which\
    \ makes PSST get worse for Int-PS. In Pre-PS, the transmit power from S and D\
    \ is\nadjusted according to the channel quality of S − R and R − D links, respectively.\
    \ Therefore, the average\ntransmit power from S and D of Pre-PS decreases as α\
    \ increases as shown in Figure 6b. When α\nSensors 2017, 17, 2023\n15 of 21\n\
    becomes larger, it is less possible to interfere the primary receiver in the ﬁrst\
    \ phase, and PSST of Pre-PS\nincreases accordingly.\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n\

    \ results, we ﬁnd out that Pre-PS outperforms Int-PS in terms of PSST\nunder the\
    \ similar average power consumption, and PSST is not sensitive to the changes\
    \ of ρ.\nSince PSST only reﬂects the probability that a positive secrecy rate\
    \ (Rs) is achieved under the primary\ninterference constraint, although PSST almost\
    \ stays the same when ρ > 0.2, it is interesting to see\nwhether there is a certain\
    \ ρ to maximize the achievable secrecy rate while maintaining the maximum\nPSST.\
    \ Therefore, in Figure 7, we study the effect of ρ on the achievable secrecy rate\
    \ of Pre-PS in the\nCIoT network.\nAs depicted in Figure 7, it is clear that the\
    \ average Rs for ρ = 0.5 is better than that for ρ = 0.9,\nwhile the value of\
    \ PSST keeps the same for ρ = 0.5 and ρ = 0.9. In the simulations, the optimal\
    \ ρ is\nobtained by computer searching. Speciﬁcally, for each α, searching the\
    \ optimal value of ρ to maximize\nSensors 2017, 17, 2023\n16 of 21\nRs while satisfying\
    \ the interference constraints. The average Rs for the optimal ρ is the best among\n\
    those for different values of ρ. We should notice that the average Rs for ρ =\
    \ 0.5 is almost the same as\nthat for the optimal ρ when α < 10, and it is slightly\
    \ worse than the optimal Rs when α becomes even\nlarger. Therefore, in the following\
    \ simulations regarding Pre-PS, ρ is set to 0.5.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0\n1\n2\n\

    \ subsection, we will compare Int-TS and Pre-TS in terms of PSST, and discuss\
    \ the inﬂuence\nof the time splitting factor τ and the channel gain factor α on\
    \ PSST. The transmit SNRs at S and D are\ndenoted as (1−τ)PS\n2σ2\n, (1+τ)PD\n\
    2σ2\nfor Int-PS and (1−τ)PS\n2|hSR|2σ2 , (1+τ)PD\n2|hDR|2σ2 for Pre-PS, respectively.\n\
    In Figure 8a, we compare PSST versus τ for both Int-TS and Pre-TS, in which simulation\n\
    and analytical results about PSST are coincident for Pre-TS. Figure 8b shows the\
    \ average power\nconsumption during T at S and D for both Int-TS and Pre-TS. From\
    \ Figure 8, one can see that Pre-TS\noutperform Int-TS in terms of PSST when the\
    \ average power consumption of both is similar. When ρ\napproaches zero, PSST\
    \ of Pre-TS decreases dramatically and becomes worse than that of Int-TS. This\n\
    is mainly because the probability of the event PI2 ≤ Γ converges to zero when\
    \ the value of ρ converges\nto zero, which can be seen easily from (59). From\
    \ Figure 8a, we can see that there is an initial increase\nin PSST of Int-TS and\
    \ Pre-TS as τ increases from zero, and then a fall in PSST when τ further increases\n\
    from 0.4. The reason is that the relay harvests more energy as τ increases, and\
    \ this in turn increases\nthe relay’s transmit power. In this way, the information\
    \ reception at the destination is improved and\nthe received signal strength at\
    \ the relay is degraded. However, once τ crosses a certain value, higher\ntransmit\
    \ power from the relay may break the primary interference constraint, and the\
    \ poor signal\nstrength at the relay delivers a negative effect on the secrecy\
    \ rate. In the following simulations, τ = 0.3\nis used for Int-TS and Pre-TS.\n\

    \ on PSST is discussed in Figure 9a, and the average transmit power consumptions\n\
    by S and D are given in Figure 9b. A similar situation as in Figure 6 can be found\
    \ in Figure 9, where PSST\nincreases as α increases for Pre-TS and decreases as\
    \ α increases for Int-TS. This phenomenon can be\nexplained in a similar way as\
    \ in Figure 6. Since the transmit SNR for Int-TS is ﬁxed, better channel\nquantity\
    \ of S − R and R − D links would result in a higher possibility of interrupting\
    \ the primary\nreceiver in the second phase, which makes PSST get worse for Int-TS.\
    \ However, the transmit power from\nS and D of Pre-TS is adjusted according to\
    \ the channel quality of S − R and R − D links, respectively,\nso that the average\
    \ transmit power of Pre-TS decreases as α increases, as shown in Figure 9b. Therefore,\n\
    it is less possible to interfere the primary receiver in the ﬁrst phase when α\
    \ becomes larger, and PSST\nof Pre-TS increases as α increases. From Figure 9b,\
    \ we can see that D always consumes more power than\nS for both Int-TS and Pre-TS,\
    \ since it has to transmit power for energy harvesting in the period of τT.\n\

    \ we can see that the precoded secure scheme is better than the intuitive\nsecure\
    \ scheme based on both PS and TS policies. In this subsection, we compare the\
    \ precoded\nSensors 2017, 17, 2023\n18 of 21\nschemes based on PS policy and TS\
    \ policy, and mainly focus on the effects of the splitting factor ρ, τ,\nand interference\
    \ temperature threshold Γ.\nAs shown in Figure 10a, PSST initially increases and\
    \ converges to a certain value eventually with\nthe increase of ρ for Pre-PS.\
    \ While for TS policy, PSST decreases gradually when τ is greater than\na speciﬁed\
    \ value. However, the maximum achievable values of PSST for Pre-PS and Pre-TS\
    \ are the\nsame. In addition, one can see that larger interference tolerance at\
    \ the primary receiver results in\nbetter performance of PSST. It can be found\
    \ in Figure 10b that less power consumption happens at\nS for Pre-TS as the splitting\
    \ factor increases. When Pre-PS and Pre-TS achieve the same maximum\nvalue of\
    \ PSST, the power consumption of S of Pre-TS is obviously lower than that of Pre-PS.\
    \ Therefore,\nPre-TS is more desirable than Pre-PS considering the energy constraint\

    \ network where the secondary system\nutilizes a wireless EH untrusted node to\
    \ help the transmission of the IoT device.\nSince the\nsecondary destination can\
    \ be equipped with adequate power supply, different secure schemes based\non destination-aided\
    \ jamming have been designed. The secrecy performance of the proposed secure\n\
    schemes are evaluated in terms of PSST, which is deﬁned as the probability that\
    \ the interference\nconstraint of the primary user is satisﬁed and the secrecy\
    \ rate is positive. The closed form of PSST for\nthe precoded secure schemes based\
    \ on PS and TS policies have been derived. The simulation results are\ncoincident\
    \ with the derived closed-form expressions perfectly, which validate the theoretical\
    \ analysis\npresented in this paper. The numerical results reveal that, under\
    \ similar transmit power consumption,\nthe precoded secure schemes outperform\
    \ the intuitive secure schemes in terms of PSST. The precoded\nsecure scheme based\
    \ on TS policy is more energy efﬁcient than that based on PS policy. Some useful\n\
    design insights can be found from the numerical study of PSST under different\
    \ system parameters.\nFor example, PSST based on PS policy is not sensitive to\
    \ the PS ratio ρ when ρ > 0.2, and an optimal ρ\nmaximizing the achievable secrecy\
    \ rate can be found under the PSST constraint. The time splitting ratio\nτ in\
    \ the TS policy shows both beneﬁcial and harmful inﬂuences on the secure performance,\
    \ and the\noptimal τ in the TS policy that maximizes PSST can be found.\nAs we\
    \ know, an IoT network consists of a great number of IoT devices. In this paper,\
    \ the secrecy\nperformance is investigated for a fundamental scenario where a\
    \ single secondary communication link\nSensors 2017, 17, 2023\n19 of 21\nis considered.\
    \ It is of interest and importance to investigate practical scenarios where numerous\
    \ IoT\ndevices are expected. After we have evaluated the secrecy performance of\
    \ the fundamental scenario,\nwe can further study more practical scenarios that\
    \ could involve power allocation and user scheduling\ndesigns. In our future work,\
    \ we plan to study the secure communication of multiple IoT devices and\nsecure\
    \ multi-hop communication in an IoT network.\nAcknowledgments: The work was supported\

  limitations: 'The analysis does not consider the impact of channel estimation errors
    on the security performance of the proposed schemes.

    The analysis assumes that the relay has perfect knowledge of the channel state
    information (CSI) between itself and the other nodes in the network, which may
    not be realistic in practice.

    The analysis does not consider the impact of mobility on the security performance
    of the proposed schemes.

    The analysis does not consider the impact of multiple eavesdroppers on the security
    performance of the proposed schemes.'

  title: Secure Communications in CIoT Networks with a Wireless Energy Harvesting
    Untrusted Relay
  verbatim_quote1: PSST of Pre-PS decreases dramatically and becomes worse than Int-PS
    when ρ approaches zero. This is mainly because the probability of the event PI2
    ≤ Γ decreases dramatically and converges to zero when the value of ρ goes to zero,
    which can be found easily from (31).
  verbatim_quote2: However, once τ crosses a certain value, higher transmit power
    from the relay may break the primary interference constraint, and the poor signal
    strength at the relay delivers a negative effect on the secrecy rate.

  analysis: 'The paper provides a comprehensive survey of the field of wireless big
    data, focusing on various data types, data collection methods, and their applications
    in wireless networks.


    The paper highlights the importance of different data types, including soil moisture
    and canopy temperature, in irrigation management. It discusses the use of sensors
    and wireless communication technologies for collecting this data and the challenges
    associated with real-time data collection, such as data quality, reliability,
    and timeliness.


    Overall, the paper provides a valuable overview of the current state and future
    potential of wireless big data in irrigation management, but it could benefit
    from more detailed analysis of data collection methods and the limitations of
    specific data types in providing accurate and timely information for irrigation
    decision-making.'

    32 Citations 3 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract Wireless big data describes
    a wide range of massive data that is generated, collected and stored in wireless
    networks by wireless devices and users. While these data share some common properties
    with traditional big data, they have their own unique characteristics and provide
    numerous advantages for academic research and practical applications. This article
    reviews the recent advances and trends in the field of wireless big data. Due
    to space constraints, this survey is not intended to cover all aspects in this
    field, but to focus on the data aided transmission, data driven network optimization
    and novel applications. It is expected that the survey will help the readers to
    understand this exciting and emerging research field better. Moreover, open issues
    and promising future directions are also identified. Article PDF Similar content

    where meanings of transmitted codewords over a noisy channel are explicitly taken
    into account. Furthermore, such communication takes place in the presence of an
    external entity, i.e., an agent, that can influence the receiver. The agent may
    be adversarial or helpful, and its true nature is unknown to the communicating
    parties. Actions taken by the agent are governed by its nature to aim to improve/deteriorate
    the communication performance. We characterize the optimal transmission policies
    to minimize the end-to-end average semantic error, that we define as the expected
    error between meanings of intended and recovered messages, under the uncertainty
    of agent’s true intentions. To do so, we first formulate the communication problem
    as a Bayesian game, and investigate the conditions under which a Bayesian Nash
    equilibrium exists. Next, we consider a dynamic communication scenario in which
    parties take actions sequentially, forming beliefs about the other party. By formulating
    this setting as a sequential game, we investigate the structure of the belief
    system and strategy profiles at equilibrium. Our results indicate that word semantics
    are instrumental in assessing communication performance when messages carry meanings,
    and optimal communication strategies are strongly influenced by the communicating
    parties’ beliefs. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Cognitive Communications

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Performance criteria in
    conventional communication systems are based on error rates that are agnostic
    to the semantics of communicated messages. In fact, communication protocols that
    operate in the physical layer do not take into account the difference between
    the meanings of transmitted and recovered messages at all, but rather are concerned
    with the engineering problem of reliably communicating sequences of bits [3].
    Emergent networks, e.g., the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, enable advanced
    connectivity between humans and machines [4], [5], where interaction occurs between
    parties of diverse backgrounds, interests, and inference capabilities. For such
    systems, reliable communication implies that the intended meaning of the messages
    is preserved at reception. In effect, these networks allow interaction at a level
    so that the communicating parties can form social relationships [6]. These factors
    motivate a new approach that molds physical and application layer metrics into
    one, i.e., a novel performance criterion that takes into account the meanings
    of the communicated messages, as well as utilizing this measure in a setting that
    abstracts the impact of social influence. This paper introduces an approach in
    which the semantic content of the messages to be communicated over a noisy channel
    is taken into account in optimizing the performance of a communication system.
    Consider the following motivating example. In a conventional communication system,
    errors between semantically similar words, such as car and automobile, are treated
    equally as semantically distant words, such as car and computer. On the other
    hand, the meaning of car is much closer to automobile than computer. In reality,
    if one wishes to transmit the binary sequence corresponding to the message car,
    and if the channel errors prevent its recovery, it would be much better if the
    erroneous received sequence were decoded as automobile as compared to computer.
    We study mechanisms to achieve this, i.e., how to reliably communicate the meanings
    of messages through a noisy channel. To do so, we propose a novel performance
    metric that measures how accurately the meanings of messages are recovered. We
    view the semantic error caused by the noisy channel as the distance between the
    meanings of transmitted and received messages. This is in contrast with declaring
    an error when a message other than the original is recovered regardless of its
    meaning. Our semantic error measure is based on the notion of semantic similarity,
    which quantifies the distance between the meanings of two words [7]–[10], for
    instance, synonyms incur very small if any semantic error. Semantic similarity
    measures are widely used in natural language processing, artificial intelligence,
    computational linguistics, and information retrieval. By minimizing a semantic
    error measure based on the dissimilarity of word meanings, we determine the optimal
    transmission policies to best preserve the meanings of recovered messages. In
    addition to establishing the semantic error metric for communication performance,
    we model the impact of social influence on how the messages are interpreted by
    considering an external influential entity, i.e., an agent, in our communication
    network. This agent can influence the receiver, in particular, how it decodes
    the received signals, by providing side, e.g., context, information. The exact
    nature of the agent, whether adversarial or helpful, is unknown to the communicating
    parties, and is treated as a random variable. An adversarial agent, for instance,
    would target causing errors in message recovery, while a helpful one would act
    to facilitate effective communication. Hence, it is beneficial to tailor the transmission
    policies to take into account the possible intentions of the agent. We model the
    interaction between the communicating parties and the agent by utilizing game
    theory, in particular, as a Bayesian game [11], [12]. Bayesian games consider
    static games with incomplete information due to uncertainty about the characteristics
    of one or more players. The objective of each player, i.e., its payoff function,
    is determined by its characteristics. Bayesian games can be extended to model
    dynamic scenarios, in which players take actions sequentially in multiple rounds.
    Games of this type are called sequential games with incomplete information. The
    sequential game has perfect information if the actions taken by each player are
    observed by all other players, otherwise it has imperfect information [12]. Bayesian
    games have been useful in modeling a diverse range of problems in communication
    networks in which interacting parties have incomplete information regarding various
    network parameters [13]–[22]. In [13], Bayesian games have been leveraged in network
    intrusion detection, for modeling the interaction between defending and attacking
    parties. References [14] and [15] utilize Bayesian games in the context of dynamic
    spectrum access between primary and secondary users, to identify the optimal spectrum
    monitoring strategies for detecting potential thievery of spectral resources by
    the secondary user. Wireless spectrum utilization is investigated in [16] in which
    a Bayesian game is designed to model the interaction between selfish communicating
    parties that operate in the same frequency band, in which the parties have incomplete
    information about the channel conditions of one another. The time-invariant channel
    setup considered in [16] is extended in [17] to take into account channel variations
    as well as channel estimation errors. In [18], a Bayesian game is formulated to
    study resource allocation in a fading multiple access channel, where the communicating
    parties aim to maximize their average achievable rates with incomplete information
    regarding the fading channel gains. Reference [19] applies the Bayesian game model
    to the downlink power allocation scenario in a two-tier heterogeneous cellular
    network, in which the macrocell base station has incomplete information about
    the channel between the femtocell base station and the femtocell user. Bayesian
    games have also found applications in signal processing for communications [21]
    and in adaptive multi-agent sensing scenarios [22]. In a different line of work,
    Bayesian games have been incorporated to design robust distributed wireless communication
    protocols in the presence of jammers, in which the interacting parties have incomplete
    information about the network conditions, such as the identities of other users,
    traffic dynamics, or characteristics of the physical channel, e.g., channel gain
    or noise [23]–[25], or whether the jammer is physically present or absent [26].
    Reference [27] utilizes a Bayesian game to model an underwater acoustic sensor
    network in which nodes communicate in the presence of an adversary, and incomplete
    information results from the uncertainty about the nodes’ exact position. A cognitive
    radio network is considered in [28] in which the power allocation strategies are
    studied for the secondary user to meet a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR), in the presence of a jammer. In this model, the interaction between
    the secondary user and the jammer is modeled as a Bayesian game with power budget
    constraints and incomplete information regarding the channel gains. We view the
    semantic communication problem with social influence as a game with incomplete
    information, played between the encoder/decoder and the agent. The encoder/decoder
    pair wishes to minimize the average semantic error between the meanings of transmitted
    and recovered messages. The agent depending on its nature may either act to aid
    or work against this goal. For the static (Bayesian) scenario in which both sides
    take their actions simultaneously, we investigate the conditions under which a
    pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium exists, and characterize the mixed strategy
    Bayesian Nash equilibrium. After showing that finding the encoding and decoding
    strategies to minimize the average semantic error is NP-hard, we propose two algorithms
    based on simulated annealing and alternating optimization. We next extend the
    communication scenario into a dynamic one, in which the agent and the communicating
    parties can take actions sequentially. We demonstrate a sequential equilibrium
    under which the agent signals its true nature to the communicating parties, by
    always choosing separate actions for when it is adversarial or helpful. In our
    numerical studies, we determine the equilibrium strategies as well as the structure
    of the encoding and decoding functions that minimize the average semantic error.
    Our results confirm that judicious transmission policies can significantly reduce
    the semantic errors that occur between the meanings of intended and recovered
    words. In addition, optimal strategies are greatly influenced by the belief of
    the interacting parties about the true nature of the influential entity. To this
    end, transmission policies depend on the bias of the interacting parties, i.e.,
    whether the individual is believed to be adversarial or helpful. The remainder
    of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we overview the notion of
    semantic similarity. Section III introduces our system model. The Bayesian game
    formulation is described in Section IV. Section V analyzes the Nash equilibrium.
    Section VI studies the structure of the optimal encoding and decoding strategies.
    The dynamic communication game model is introduced in Section VII. Numerical results
    are provided in Section VIII. The paper is concluded in Section IX. SECTION II.
    Semantic Similarity: A Brief Overview Words can take different meanings in different
    contexts. A concept refers to the specific meaning that a word takes in a certain
    context. For instance, the word nickel may refer to a five-cent coin or a chemical
    substance. Semantic relations between different concepts are often represented
    by using word taxonomies [29], such as the WordNet taxonomy illustrated in Fig.
    1a. Semantic similarity quantifies how similar two concepts are [7]–[10]. Word
    similarity quantifies the semantic similarity between a pair of words, with synonyms
    having the highest value. Word similarity measures are often based on a word taxonomy,
    or statistics from a large set of texts, i.e., a text corpus [7]–[10]. The main
    semantic similarity metrics are node-based similarity and edge-based similarity.
    Fig. 1. (a) A word taxonomy fragment from [7]. Concepts are related to each other
    using an is-a relationship, for instance, dime is a coin. The same word may appear
    at several places in the taxonomy as instances of different concepts, such as
    nickel appearing under coin (thus taking the meaning of a five-cent coin) versus
    chemical substance. (b) Examples of edge-based similarity values between various
    words. Show All Node-based similarity between two concepts is measured by the
    information content of their lowest common subsumer [7]. A lowest common subsumer
    refers to the concept that has the shortest distance from the two. For example,
    coin and money are both subsumers of nickel and dime, but coin is lower subsumer
    than money. The information content of a concept is inversely proportional to
    its empirical frequency in the corpus. That is, concepts that appear less frequently
    in text have a higher information content. Edge-based similarity utilizes the
    geometric distance between two nodes in the word taxonomy to find the semantic
    similarity between two concepts [9]. This measure is inversely proportional to
    the length of the shortest path between two concepts. Similarity between two concepts
    increases as the path connecting the two nodes becomes shorter. Similarity between
    two words is defined as the maximum of all similarity values between the concepts
    corresponding to them. Fig. 1b presents examples of edge-based similarity values
    between various words evaluated using the NLTK language processing package [30].
    SECTION III. System Model Notation: In the following, uppercase letters represent
    random variables, whereas lowercase letters correspond to their realizations.
    We use \mathbf {x}=(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}) for a vector of length {n}\,\,\in \mathbb
    {Z}^{+} . \mathcal {X} represents a set with cardinality |\mathcal {X}| and \mathcal
    {X}^{n} is the {n} -fold Cartesian product of \mathcal {X} . \mathbb {E}[\cdot]
    denotes the expectation operation. We consider the communication scenario in Fig.
    2a. In this scenario, the encoder observes a message (word) w from a finite set
    \mathcal {W} with probability p(W =w) . It then maps w to a channel input \mathbf
    {x}=(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}) using an encoding function g~:~\mathcal {W} \rightarrow
    \mathcal {X}^{(n)} , where \mathcal {X}^{(n)}\subseteq \mathcal {X}^{n} and \mathcal
    {X} is a finite alphabet. The set of all such encoding functions is denoted by
    \mathcal {G} . A noisy channel exists between the encoder and the decoder, which
    is characterized by the conditional probability {p}(\textbf {Y} = \textbf {y}|\textbf
    {X} = \textbf {x}) . The channel output \mathbf {y}=(y_{1},\ldots, y_{n}) is a
    vector of length {n} from the set \mathcal {Y}^{(n)} such that \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}\subseteq
    \mathcal {Y}^{n} where \mathcal {Y} is a finite alphabet. Fig. 2. (a) Semantic
    communication channel. (b) Players of the Bayesian game formulation. Show All
    The agent’s true nature, which could be either adversarial or helpful, is characterized
    by a random variable \Theta governed by the probability, \begin{equation*} p\left
    ({\Theta =\theta }\right)=\begin{cases} \alpha & \mathrm { if } \quad \theta =a
    \\ 1-\alpha & \mathrm { if } \quad \theta =h \end{cases}\tag{1}\end{equation*}
    View Source for some 0 < \alpha < 1, where \theta =\,\,{a} if the agent is adversarial
    and \theta =\,\,{h} if the agent is helpful. We note that \alpha can take any
    value between (0,1), hence comes from an infinite set. However, its value is fixed
    and is known by both the agent and the encoder/decoder pair. Accordingly, the
    encoder and the decoder know the distribution in (1), but do not know the actual
    realization \theta , i.e., the true nature of the agent. It is assumed that \alpha
    is a parameter that can be estimated via various information sources, such as
    by monitoring the data on the past behavior of the agent, or gathering information
    from different applications on its activity patterns. The agent can take actions
    to influence how the decoder perceives the received information. The chosen action
    depends on the agent’s true nature, i.e., adversarial or helpful. In particular,
    the agent draws a random variable p(Q|W, \Theta =\theta) from a finite set \mathcal
    {P} . Each element of \mathcal {P} identifies a conditional probability distribution
    over the set of contexts \mathcal {Q} for each w \in \mathcal {W} , so that \begin{equation*}
    \sum _{q\in \mathcal {Q}}p(Q=q|W=w, \Theta =\theta)=1,\tag{2}\end{equation*} View
    Source where p(Q=q|W=w, \Theta =\theta)\geq 0 for all {q}~\in \mathcal {Q} . The
    decoder then observes a context {q} governed by the probability p(Q=q|W=w, \Theta
    =\theta) . That is, the context information observed by the decoder is affected
    by the distribution chosen by the agent. In that sense, the agent can influence
    the decoder by controlling the distribution p(Q|W, \Theta =\theta) . As an example,
    consider a communication scenario in which the encoder and decoder are smart devices
    deployed with sensors to monitor their environment. Suppose that the agent can
    place the decoder in one of the following two environments, an underwater environment
    vs. a desert environment. Depending on the environment it is placed in, the decoder
    will take different measurements and will have a different view of the context
    in which the communication is taking place. For instance, the animal and plant
    habitat in an underwater environment is different than that of a desert environment.
    This may in turn lead to different interpretations of the received message. Lastly,
    we assume that the words observed by the encoder are independent from the true
    nature of the agent, i.e., \begin{equation*} p(W=w|\Theta =\theta) = p(W=w).\tag{3}\end{equation*}
    View Source The decoder recovers a word \hat {w}\in \mathcal {W} from the channel
    output \mathbf {y} and context {q} using a decoding function h\,\,:\,\,\mathcal
    {Y}^{(n)}\times \mathcal {Q}\rightarrow \mathcal {W} . The set of all valid decoding
    functions is denoted as \mathcal {H} . The channel output, when conditioned on
    the channel input, is independent from the rest of the random variables in the
    model, i.e., we have that {Y} - {X} - WQ\Theta form a Markov chain, \begin{align*}
    p(\mathbf {Y}=&\mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X}=\mathbf {x}, W=w, Q=q, \Theta =\theta)
    \\=&p(\mathbf {Y} = \mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X} =\mathbf {x}) \tag{4}\end{align*}
    View Source where x ={g} ({w} ). The sets \mathcal {G} , \mathcal {H} , and \mathcal
    {P} are finite. We define the semantic distance between two words as, \begin{equation*}
    d(w, \hat {w})=1-sim(w, \hat {w}), \quad w, \hat {w}\in \mathcal {W},\tag{5}\end{equation*}
    View Source where 0\leq sim(w, \hat {w})\leq 1 denotes the semantic similarity
    between w and \hat {w} . Given \Theta = \theta , we define the average semantic

    function {g} , and (10) follows from (3) and (4). SECTION IV. Bayesian Game Formulation
    In this section, we describe our game-theoretic formulation for the communication
    model introduced in Section III. Consider a two-player static Bayesian game. Player
    1 is the system designer who selects the encoding and decoding protocols. Player
    2 represents the agent. An illustration of the two players is depicted in Fig.
    2b. One can think of players 1 and 2 as an abstraction of the following communication
    scenario. Player 1 wishes to design a system to transmit information about the
    traffic status in one location to a user. The user has access to a sensor, e.g.,
    camera, whose measurements can be utilized while interpreting the received information.
    Player 2 controls the location and the settings of the camera, which allows her
    to affect how the measurements are interpreted by the user. As such, the communication
    performance depends on the characteristic of player 2, i.e., whether it is adversarial
    or helpful. The uncertainty about a player’s true nature is termed in the game
    theory literature as its type [31]. We adopt the same terminology in the sequel.
    Player 1 has a single (fixed) type that is known by both parties. Player 2 belongs
    to one of two possible types, adversary, denoted by \Theta =\,\,{a} , or helpful,
    denoted by \Theta =\,\,{h} . The uncertainty about the type of player 2 is characterized
    by the probability {p} (\Theta =\theta) from (1). The type of player 2 is known
    only by itself. The strategy set of player 1 consists of all pairs of encoding
    and decoding functions (g, h) \in \mathcal {G}\times \mathcal {H} , and is denoted
    by \mathcal {S}_{1}\triangleq \mathcal {G}\times \mathcal {H} . We represent the
    strategy chosen by player 1 by s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1} . The strategy set of
    player 2 consists of all the elements in \mathcal {P} and is denoted as \mathcal
    {S}_{2}\triangleq \mathcal {P} . We represent the strategy chosen by player 2
    by s_{2}(\Theta)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} given its type \Theta \in \{a, h\} . That
    is, player 2 follows the strategy s_{2}(a) if it is adversarial and s_{2}(h) if
    it is helpful. We next introduce the payoff functions of the two players. Player
    1 wants to choose the encoding and decoding strategy that minimize the average
    semantic error from (10). Accordingly, we define the payoff function of player
    1 as, \begin{equation*} u_{1}(s_{1}, s_{2}(\Theta), \Theta)=\begin{cases} -D_{a}(s_{1},
    s_{2}(a)) \quad \mathrm { if }& \Theta =a \\ -D_{h}(s_{1}, s_{2}(h)) \quad \mathrm
    { if } & \Theta =h \end{cases} \tag{11}\end{equation*} View Source where s_{1}\in
    \mathcal {S}_{1} , s_{2}(\Theta)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} for \Theta \in \{a,h\} ,
    and D_{\theta }(s_{1}, s_{2}(\theta)) is as defined in (10). Player 1 wishes to
    maximize its expected payoff \begin{align*}&\mathbb {E}\left [{u_{1}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({\Theta }\right), \Theta }\right)}\right] \\&\qquad =-\sum _{\theta
    \in \left \{{a, h}\right \}}p\left ({\Theta =\theta }\right)D_{\theta }\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({\theta }\right)}\right), \tag{12}\\&\qquad =-\alpha D_{a}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right) -\left ({1-\alpha }\right) D_{h}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right) \tag{13}\end{align*} View Source where the expectation
    is taken over the distribution of the types of the agent. The payoff function
    of player 2 depends on its type. Specifically, if player 2 is adversarial (helpful),
    it wishes to maximize (minimize) the average semantic error from (10). The payoff
    function for player 2 is then defined as, \begin{equation*} u_{2}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({\Theta }\right), \Theta }\right) =\begin{cases} D_{a}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right)&\mathrm { if }~\Theta =a \\ -D_{h}\left ({s_{1},
    s_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right)&\mathrm { if }~\Theta =h \end{cases}\tag{14}\end{equation*}
    View Source The two players choose their strategies independently before communication
    starts. We consider a non-cooperative game in which each player wishes to maximize
    its individual payoff. Both players are rational. SECTION V. Bayesian Nash Equilibrium
    A. Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium This section identifies sufficient conditions
    for the existence of a pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Specifically,
    we let (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) denote a pure strategy Bayesian
    Nash equilibrium, where the equilibrium conditions are given by, \begin{align*}&-\alpha
    D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right) -\left ({1-\alpha }\right)
    D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right) \\&\geq -\alpha D_{a}\left
    ({s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right) -\left ({1-\alpha }\right) D_{h}\left
    ({s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right), \;\; \forall s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}
    \\ \tag{15}\\&\quad D_{a}\left ({s_{1}^{*}, s^{*}_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right)
    \geq D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}\left ({a}\right)}\right), \;\; \forall s_{2}\left
    ({a}\right)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}, \tag{16}\\&\quad -\,\,D_{h}\left ({s_{1}^{*},
    s^{*}_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right) \geq -D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}\left ({h}\right)}\right),
    \;\; \forall s_{2}\left ({h}\right)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} \tag{17}\end{align*} View
    Source where s_{1}^{*}\in \mathcal {S}_{1} is player 1’s equilibrium strategy,
    s_{2}^{*}(a)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} is player 2’s equilibrium strategy if she is
    adversarial, and s_{2}^{*}(h)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} is player 2’s equilibrium strategy
    if she is helpful. Conditions (15)–(17) ensure that both players play their best
    responses against each other at equilibrium. Specifically, (15) ensures that player
    1 selects the encoding/decoding function that maximizes (13), whereas (16) and
    (17) ensure that the agent chooses the strategy that maximizes (14) when it is
    adversarial or helpful, respectively. In the following, we identify two pure strategy
    Bayesian Nash equilibriums that occur when \alpha \leq \underline {\alpha } and
    \alpha \geq \bar {\alpha } , respectively, for some thresholds \underline {\alpha
    }\leq \bar {\alpha } . Theorem 1 shows that if the likelihood of the agent being
    a helpful one is sufficiently high (\alpha \leq \underline {\alpha } ), the equilibrium
    policies are the same as the setup in which the agent is indeed helpful. Theorem
    2 shows that if the likelihood of the agent being an adversarial one is sufficiently
    high (\alpha \geq \bar {\alpha } ), the equilibrium policies are the same as the
    setup in which the agent is indeed adversarial. We first demonstrate a pure strategy
    Bayesian Nash equilibrium for \alpha \leq \underline {\alpha } and show that the
    encoding/decoding strategy at equilibrium is the same as one that would be selected
    if the agent was known to be helpful. Theorem 1:Define (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a),
    s^{*}_{2}(h)) such that \begin{align*} s^{*}_{1}=&\arg \min _{s_{1}\in \mathcal
    {S}_{1}} D_{h}(s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h)), \tag{18}\\ s^{*}_{2}(a)=&\arg \max _{s_{2}(a)\in
    \mathcal {S}_{2}} D_{a}(s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}(a)), \tag{19}\\ s^{*}_{2}(h)=&\arg \min
    _{s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}} D_{h}(s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}(h)). \tag{20}\end{align*}
    View Source Then, (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) denotes a pure strategy
    Bayesian Nash equilibrium whenever the following conditions are satisfied:\begin{align*}&\mathrm
    {i)} ~\alpha \leq \underline {\alpha } \quad \mathrm { for~some } \quad \underline
    {\alpha }~\leq \min _{\substack {s_{1} \in \mathcal {S}_{1}: s_{1}\neq s^{*}_{1}\\
    \beta (s_{1}) >0, \kappa (s_{1})>0}} \frac {\beta (s_{1})}{\kappa (s_{1})}, \tag{21}\\&\mathrm
    {ii)}~\mathrm {If }~\beta (s_{1})=0~\mathrm {for~some}~s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}~\mathrm
    {with}~s_{1}\neq s^{*}_{1},~\mathrm {then }~\kappa (s_{1})\leq 0, \\{}\tag{22}\end{align*}
    View Source where \beta (s_{1})=D_{h}(s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h))-D_{h}(s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h))
    and \kappa (s_{1})=\beta (s_{1})+D_{a}(s^{*}_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a))-D_{a}(s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a))
    . Proof:We prove this result by showing that whenever (21) and (22) hold, (s^{*}_{1},
    s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) satisfies the equilibrium conditions (15)–(17). Using
    (13), we first find player 1’s expected payoff if it follows the strategy s_{1}\in
    \mathcal {S}_{1} while player 2 plays s^{*}_{2}(a) if adversarial and s^{*}_{2}(h)
    if helpful, \begin{equation*} -\alpha D_{a}(s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a)) -(1-\alpha) D_{h}\left
    ({s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right).\tag{23}\end{equation*} View Source To prove that
    s^{*}_{1} is player 1’s best response, it remains to show for all s_{1}\in \mathcal
    {S}_{1} that, \begin{align*}&-\alpha D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a)}\right)
    -(1-\alpha) D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right) \\&\quad -\,\,\left ({-\alpha
    D_{a}\left ({s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a)}\right) -(1-\alpha) D_{h}\left ({s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right)}\right)
    \\&=\beta (s_{1})-\alpha \kappa (s_{1}) \geq 0.\tag{24}\end{align*} View Source
    For s_{1} = s^{*}_{1} , (24) holds by definition. For s_{1}\neq s^{*}_{1} , if
    \beta (s_{1}) > 0 and \kappa (s_{1})> 0, we have \beta (s_{1}) \geq \alpha \kappa
    (s_{1}) from (21), hence (24) holds. If instead \beta (s_{1})= 0, we have from
    (22) that (24) again holds. From (18), we observe that \begin{equation*} D_{h}\left
    ({s^{*}_{1},s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right)\leq D_{h}\left ({s_{1},s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right)\tag{25}\end{equation*}
    View Source and therefore \beta (s_{1})\geq 0 for all s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}
    . Hence, the only remaining case we need to investigate is when \beta (s_{1})>
    0, \kappa (s_{1})\leq 0, which also satisfies (24) since \alpha > 0. Next, we
    find from (14) that if player 2 is adversarial, \begin{align*} D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1},
    s_{2}^{*}(a)}\right) =\max _{s_{2}(a)\in \mathcal {P}} D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1},
    s_{2}(a)}\right) \geq D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}(a)}\right) \\{}\tag{26}\end{align*}
    View Source for all s_{2}(a)\in \mathcal {P} , hence (16) is satisfied. If instead
    player 2 is helpful, we find from (14) that, \begin{align*} -D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1},
    s^{*}_{2}(h)}\right)=&- \min _{s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {P}} D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1},
    s_{2}(h)}\right) \\[-0.5mm]\geq&- D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}(h)}\right) \tag{27}\end{align*}
    View Source for all s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {P} , hence (17) is also satisfied. We
    have now shown that s^{*}_{1} is player 1’s best response against player 2’s strategies
    s_{2}^{*}(a) and s_{2}^{*}(h) , where player 2 plays s_{2}^{*}(a) if adversarial
    and s_{2}^{*}(h) if helpful. At the same time, s_{2}^{*}(a) and s_{2}^{*}(h) are
    player 2’s best response against player 1’s strategy s^{*}_{1} , for when player
    2 is adversarial or helpful, respectively. As a result, (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a),
    s^{*}_{2}(h)) from (18)–(20) is a pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Next,
    we identify a pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium when \alpha \geq \bar {\alpha
    } and show that the encoding/decoding strategy at equilibrium is the same as one
    that would be selected if the agent was known to be adversarial. Theorem 2:Define
    (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) such that \begin{align*} s^{*}_{1}=&\arg
    \min _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}} D_{a}\left ({s_{1}, s_{2}^{*}(a)}\right), \tag{28}\\
    s^{*}_{2}(a)=&\arg \max _{s_{2}(a)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}} D_{a}\left ({s^{*}_{1},
    s_{2}(a)}\right), \tag{29}\\ s^{*}_{2}(h)=&\arg \min _{s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    D_{h}\left ({s^{*}_{1}, s_{2}(h)}\right). \tag{30}\end{align*} View Source Then,
    (s^{*}_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) denotes a pure strategy Bayesian Nash
    equilibrium if \begin{equation*} \alpha \geq \bar {\alpha } \quad \mathrm { for~some
    } \quad \bar {\alpha } \geq \max _{\substack {s_{1} \in \mathcal {S}_{1}: s_{1}\neq
    s^{*}_{1} \\ \beta (s_{1})< 0, \kappa (s_{1})< 0}} \frac {\beta (s_{1})}{\kappa
    (s_{1})}\tag{31}\end{equation*} View Source where \beta (s_{1})=D_{h}(s_{1}, s^{*}_{2}(h))-D_{h}(s^{*}_{1},
    s^{*}_{2}(h)) and \kappa (s_{1})=\beta (s_{1})+D_{a}(s^{*}_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a))-D_{a}(s_{1},
    s^{*}_{2}(a)) . Proof:The proof follows the same lines as (23)–(27). We initially
    show that s^{*}_{1} is player 1’s best response by demonstrating that it satisfies
    (24). For any s_{1}\neq s^{*}_{1} , if \beta (s_{1})< 0, \kappa (s_{1})< 0, we
    have \alpha \kappa (s_{1})\leq \beta (s_{1}) from (31), therefore (24) holds.
    Next, we note that \begin{align*} \kappa (s_{1})=\beta (s_{1}) -\left ({D_{a}\left
    ({s_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a)}\right)-D\left ({s^{*}_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a)}\right)}\right)\leq
    \beta (s_{1}) \\{}\tag{32}\end{align*} View Source since D_{a}(s_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a))\geq
    D_{a}(s^{*}_{1},s^{*}_{2}(a)) for all s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1} from (28). As
    a result, we only need to inspect the following remaining cases: i) \beta (s_{1})>
    0, \kappa (s_{1})> 0, ii) \beta (s_{1})> 0, \kappa (s_{1})= 0, iii) \beta (s_{1})=
    0, \kappa (s_{1})< 0, iv) \beta (s_{1})= 0, \kappa (s_{1})= 0, v) \beta (s_{1})>
    0, \kappa (s_{1})< 0. We first observe that (24) holds for i) due to (32) and
    \begin{equation*} \alpha \kappa (s_{1})\leq \kappa (s_{1})\leq \beta (s_{1}) ~\mathrm
    { for } ~0< \alpha < 1.\tag{33}\end{equation*} View Source We next observe that
    (24) also holds for ii), iii), iv) and v) as \alpha > 0. As a result, (s^{*}_{1},
    s^{*}_{2}(a), s^{*}_{2}(h)) is a pure strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Remark
    1:It is useful to note that the results in Theorems 1 and 2 follow a convex combination
    argument, as the agent is either a minimizer or a maximizer, the monotone behavior
    of the equilibrium policies are preserved while the prior on the agent’s type
    changes, until certain thresholds are reached. B. Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
    For the semantic communication game, a mixed strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium
    always exists, as both players have a finite set of types and strategies [31],
    [32]. In this section, we characterize the structure of mixed strategies at equilibrium.
    We first define \phi \in \Delta (\mathcal {S}_{1}) as a mixed strategy for player
    1, where \Delta (\mathcal {S}_{1}) is the set of all probability distributions
    over \mathcal {S}_{1} . Here \phi assigns a probability to each s_{1}\in \mathcal
    {S}_{1} and we denote this probability by \phi (s_{1}) . Accordingly, \phi (s_{1})\geq
    0 for all s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1} and \sum _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}} \phi
    (s_{1})= 1. Given \Theta =\theta , we next define \phi _{\theta } \in \Delta (\mathcal
    {S}_{2}) as a mixed strategy for player 2 whose type is \theta \in \{ a,h\} .
    Again, \Delta (\mathcal {S}_{2}) is the set of all probability distributions over
    \mathcal {S}_{2} . That is, \phi _{\theta } assigns a probability to each element
    s_{2}(\theta)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} and we denote this probability by \phi _{\theta
    } (s_{2}(\theta)) . Accordingly, \phi _{\theta }(s_{2}(\theta))\geq 0 for all
    s_{2}(\theta)\in \mathcal {S}_{2} , and \sum _{s_{2}(\theta)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    \phi _{\theta }(s_{2}(\theta))= 1. At equilibrium, each player again wishes to
    maximize its expected payoff. For player 2, this expectation is over the distributions
    indicated by the mixed strategies. For player 1, the expectation is now over both
    the possible types of player 2 and the mixed strategies. Accordingly, (\phi ^{*},
    \phi ^{*}_{a}, \phi ^{*}_{h}) is a mixed strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium if
    \begin{align*} \phi ^{*}&=\arg \min _{\phi _{1}\in \Delta (\mathcal {S}_{1})}
    \Big (\alpha \sum _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}}\sum _{s_{2}(a)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    \phi (s_{1}) \phi ^{*}_{a}(s_{2}(a)) \\ &\times D_{a}(s_{1}, s_{2}(a), a)) + \!
    (1\!-\!\alpha) \sum _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}} \sum _{s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    \!\!\!\! \phi (s_{1}) \phi ^{*}_{h}(s_{2}(h)) \\ &\times D_{h}(s_{1}, s_{2}(h),
    h) \Big), \tag{34}\\ \phi ^{*}_{a}&=\arg \max _{\phi _{a}\in \Delta (\mathcal
    {S}_{2})}\!\sum _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}} \sum _{s_{2}(a)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    \!\!\!\!\!\phi ^{*}(s_{1})\phi _{a}(s_{2}(a)) \\ &\hspace {4cm}\times D_{a}(s_{1},
    s_{2}(a), a), \tag{35}\\ \phi ^{*}_{h}& =\arg \min _{\phi _{h}\in \Delta (\mathcal
    {S}_{2})}\sum _{s_{1}\in \mathcal {S}_{1}} \sum _{s_{2}(h)\in \mathcal {S}_{2}}
    \!\!\!\!\!\phi ^{*}(s_{1})\phi _{h}(s_{2}(h)) \\ &\hspace {4cm}\times D_{h}(s_{1},
    s_{2}(h), h). \tag{36}\end{align*} View Source The conventional route to compute
    (34)–(36) is for each player to find the strategy that makes the other player
    indifferent to each one of their pure strategies. It is useful to note that the
    computational complexity of this problem requires careful consideration, and various
    algorithms have been proposed to address this challenge [33], [34]. The interpretations
    as to why players would adopt mixed strategies is an ongoing debate in game theory,
    common views include treating mixed strategies at equilibrium as the steady state
    of a game that is played repeatedly, or interpreting mixed strategies as a result
    of small variations in the payoffs of the players. We refer the reader to [31,
    Sec. 3.2] for a detailed discussion on this topic. SECTION VI. Encoding and Decoding
    Strategies for Minimum Semantic Error In this section, we fix the strategy of
    player 2 by letting |\mathcal {P}|= 1, and focus on the encoding/decoding functions
    that minimize the average semantic error from (10) for a given distribution between
    the words and contexts. We utilize in this section the following notation \begin{equation*}
    p(Q|W) \triangleq p(Q|W, \Theta =a)=p(Q|W, \Theta =h)\tag{37}\end{equation*} View

    the average semantic error from (10) for this setting as, \begin{align*}&D\left
    ({(g, h), p(Q|W)}\right) \\&\triangleq D_{a}\left ({(g, h), p(Q|W, \Theta =a)}\right)
    \tag{38}\\&=\,\,D_{h}\left ({(g, h), p(Q|W, \Theta =h)}\right) \tag{39}\\&= \sum
    _{\substack {w\in \mathcal {W}, q\in \mathcal {Q}, \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}:\\
    \mathbf {x}=g(w)}} p\left ({\mathbf {Y} = \mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X} = \mathbf {x}}\right)

    {G}\times \mathcal {H}} D\left ({(g, h), p(Q|W)}\right).\tag{41}\end{equation*}

    {y}\in \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}} \sum _{ \substack {w\in \mathcal {W}: \\ \mathbf {x}=g(w)}}
    p(W=w|Q=q) \\&\quad \times p\left ({\mathbf {Y} = \mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X}=\mathbf
    {x}}\right) d\left ({w, h(\mathbf {y}, q)}\right),\tag{42}\end{align*} View Source
    where p(Q=q)=\sum _{w\in \mathcal {W}}p(Q=q|W=w)p(W=w) and p(W=w|Q=q)=\frac {p(Q=q|W=w)p(W=w)}{p(Q=q)}
    . From (42), the optimal decoding rule can be determined as follows. For each
    {q}~\in \mathcal {Q} and \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal {Y}^{(n)} , assign h(\mathbf
    {y}, q)=\hat {w} if \begin{align*} f_{d}\left ({q, \mathbf {y}, \hat {w}}\right)\leq&f_{d}\left
    ({q, \mathbf {y}, w^{\prime }}\right) \\=&\sum _{w\in \mathcal {W}: \mathbf {x}=g(w)}

    }\in \mathcal {W} . Similarly, to find the optimal encoding rule for a fixed decoding
    function {h} , one needs to find g \in \mathcal {G} that minimizes (40), \begin{align*}&D((g,
    h), p(Q|W)) \\&\quad =\sum _{ w\in \mathcal {W}} p(W=w) \sum _{\substack { q\in

    ({w, h(\mathbf {y}, q)}\right),\tag{44}\end{align*} View Source leading to the
    encoding rule g(w)= x if \begin{align*} f_{e}\left ({w, \mathbf {x}}\right)\leq&f_{e}\left

    {y}\in \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}: \\ \mathbf {x}^{\prime }=g(w)}} p(Q=q|W=w)p\left ({\mathbf

    ({w, h(\mathbf {y}, q)}\right)\tag{45}\end{align*} View Source for all \mathbf
    {x}^{\prime }\in \mathcal {X}^{(n)} . Finding the encoding/decoding functions
    that minimize the average semantic error is NP-hard, the details of which is provided
    in Appendix A. We propose two algorithms in the sequel to address the computational
    intensity. Algorithm 1 is based on alternating optimization with an error tolerance
    \epsilon > 0. Starting from a random initial assignment of the encoding and decoding
    functions, the algorithm iterates between two steps until convergence. In one
    step, the optimal decoding function is determined from (43) by fixing the encoding
    function. In the subsequent step, the optimal encoding function is determined
    via (45) by fixing the decoding function. Since the average semantic error is
    non-increasing at each iteration, and is bounded from below by zero, the algorithm
    converges, it may, however, converge to a local optimum. Algorithm 2 is a probabilistic
    metaheuristic based on simulated annealing [35], an effective approximate method
    to reduce the complexity in a large search space for combinatorial problems [36]–[38].
    Its main idea is to, starting from an initial state, i.e., encoder/decoder assignment,
    perturb the state at each round by modifying the assignment. The new assignment
    is kept if it performs better than the old one, otherwise, is kept with a probability
    depending on a temperature parameter, which is reduced gradually, making the fluctuations
    less random as the algorithm progresses. The algorithm stops when the temperature
    reaches a minimum. The performance comparisons of the two algorithms are detailed
    in Section VIII. SECTION Algorithm 1 Alternating Minimization 1: Initialize {g}

    {g} and {h} SECTION VII. Dynamic Communication Game We now consider the dynamic
    communication scenario where the encoder/decoder pair (player 1) and the agent
    (player 2) take actions sequentially. Specifically, at one round the agent takes
    an action, observed by the encoder/decoder pair. In the subsequent round, the
    encoder/decoder pair takes an action. The actions chosen by the encoder/decoder
    pair cannot be observed by the agent, hence the agent is oblivious to the selected
    encoding/decoding strategy. The true nature of the agent, adversarial or helpful,
    is again unknown to the encoder/decoder pair, hence the game has incomplete information
    [12]. Since the actions of some players cannot be observed others, the game also
    has imperfect information [12]. In the dynamic game, care must be taken to address
    the dimensionality of the strategy spaces of the players. The number of possible
    encoding strategies for player 1, for instance, is exponential in the number of
    words to be encoded. To this end, we consider two possible actions for player
    2. The first action induces a distribution under which every context is equally
    likely given each word, i.e., the agent selects a random variable p(Q|W, \Theta
    =\theta) such that p(Q=q|W=w, \Theta =\theta) = \frac {1}{|\mathcal {Q}|} for
    every w \in \mathcal {W} and {q}~\in \mathcal {Q} . As such, this action prevents
    the decoder from using context information while decoding. The second action,
    on the other hand, induces a distribution that enables the decoder to achieve
    a better decoding performance by using context information. Formally, we let \mathcal
    {S}_{2} = \mathcal {P} = \{p_{B}, p_{G}\} denote the strategy set for player 2,
    where p_{B} and p_{G} corresponds to the former (bad) and latter (good) type of
    distribution. For the actions of player 1, we consider two encoding strategies.
    The first one is a robust encoding strategy that minimizes the average semantic
    error against a bad distribution, i.e., p_{B} , by assigning each pair of words
    with different meanings to a different codeword. Hence, errors that may be caused
    at the decoder are solely due to channel noise, and the decoder does not need
    to rely on context information for decoding. The second one is an encoding strategy
    for a good distribution, i.e., p_{G} , which assigns the words that have a low
    chance of appearing in the same context to the same codeword. This encoding strategy,
    while relying heavily on context information for decoding, can provide robustness
    against channel noise by using fewer codewords with greater Hamming distance between
    them. For each encoding strategy, we fix the decoding function to be the minimum
    semantic error decoder in (43). We represent the actions of player 1 by \mathcal
    {S}_{1} = \{g_{ci}, g_{ca}\} , where g_{ci} refers to the former, i.e., context-independent,
    encoding strategy, while g_{ca} is the latter, i.e., context-aided, encoding strategy.
    The average semantic error is then evaluated from (10). Given \Theta =\theta ,
    we denote the semantic error by D_\theta (g_{ci}, p_{B}) when player 2 picks a
    bad distribution and player 1 picks a context-independent encoding function, D_\theta
    (g_{ci}, p_{G}) when player 2 picks a good distribution but player 1 picks a context-independent
    encoding function, D_\theta (g_{ca}, p_{G}) when player 2 picks a good distribution
    and player 1 picks a context-aided encoding function, and D_\theta (g_{ca}, p_{B})
    when player 2 picks a bad distribution and player 1 picks a context-aided encoding
    function. We require for \theta \in \{a, h\} , \begin{align*} D_\theta (g_{ca},
    p_{B}) \geq D_\theta (g_{ci}, p_{B}) \geq D_\theta (g_{ci}, p_{G}) \geq D_\theta
    (g_{ca}, p_{G}) \\{}\tag{46}\end{align*} View Source to ensure that it is better
    to use a context-independent encoding strategy against a bad distribution, and
    to use a context-aided encoding against a good distribution. If player 2 picks
    a good distribution, it is better to use a context-aided encoding strategy than
    a context-independent one. Both players have a finite number of actions. Lastly,
    we assume that both players remember their past actions and observations, i.e.,
    the game has perfect recall [31, Sec. 11.1]. At the outset, the distinction between
    incomplete and imperfect information is for convenience, as the two problems are
    motivated by different scenarios. Incomplete information represents the scenarios
    in which the characteristics (objectives/types) of one or more players are unknown
    to the other players. Imperfect information represents scenarios in which the
    actions taken by one or more players cannot be observed by others. Harsanyi [11]
    showed that this distinction is rather artificial, as the former can always be
    transformed to the latter. To do so, one introduces a new player called the nature.
    The nature’s actions consist of choosing a type for each player. Each player can
    only observe the type chosen for itself, but not the types chosen for others.
    Due to the fact that players cannot observe all of the actions taken by the nature,
    the game has imperfect information. This is now the standard technique for analyzing
    games with incomplete information [12], [39]. Accordingly, we also transform our
    game using Harsanyi transformation, by introducing another player, nature, that
    selects the type of player 2. Player 1 cannot observe the actions of nature. This
    game is illustrated in Fig. 3. Points connected by a dashed line, called an information
    set, cannot be distinguished by the current player. For instance \{v_{3},v_{5}\}
    is an information set for player 1 in Fig. 3, and player 1 cannot distinguish
    between states v_{3} and v_{5} while taking an action. Instead, player 1 forms
    beliefs about the current state of the game and updates them at each round after
    observing the actions taken by player 2. Fig. 3. Dynamic communication game model.
    Dashed lines represent the information sets of player 1 (encoder/decoder pair).
    Resulting payoffs are denoted by blue and red for players 1 and 2, respectively.
    Show All As shown in Section VIII-C, Nash equilibrium for such games may lead
    to equilibrium strategies for which the actions taken off the equilibrium path
    are not rational. Instead, a refinement of Nash equilibrium, known as sequential
    equilibrium, is used for analyzing sequential games with imperfect information
    [40]. Every sequential equilibrium is also a Nash equilibrium. In addition, sequential
    equilibrium ensures that: i) at each information set, the current player takes
    the best, i.e., sequentially rational, strategy, ii) strategies are consistent
    with the beliefs the players hold. We next formally state these necessary conditions,
    referring to [12], [31], and [40] for details. Let \sigma denote a behavioral
    strategy, which, at each information set, assigns a probability distribution to
    the set of available actions for the current player. It specifies the probability
    that the current player takes a specific action if the game is at one of the nodes
    belonging to the information set. We define \sigma _{i} as the behavioral strategy
    of player {i}\,\,= 1, 2 and \sigma = (\sigma _{1}, \sigma _{2}) . If player {i}
    takes an action at information set \mathcal {I} , \sigma _{i}(k|\mathcal {I})
    is the probability that she takes action {k} . We define a belief system \mu to
    represent the beliefs the players holds about the current state of the game at
    each information set. As such, \mu _{\mathcal {I}}(v) is the probability that
    the player taking an action at information set \mathcal {I} believes the game
    is currently at node {v}~\in \mathcal {I} , such that \begin{equation*} \sum _{v\in
    \mathcal {I}}\mu _{\mathcal {I}}(v) = 1 ~\mathrm { for~all } ~\mathcal {I}.\tag{47}\end{equation*}

    governed by the behavior strategy \sigma from node {k} to node {t} . Let \mathcal
    {T}_{\mathcal {I}} denote the set of all terminal nodes that can be reached from
    \mathcal {I} , and u_{i}(t) denote the payoff user {i} receives at node {t}~\in
    \mathcal {T}_{\mathcal {I}} . We then define the expected payoff for player {i}
    at \mathcal {I} by \begin{equation*} \mathbb {E}\left [{u_{i}\left ({\sigma |\mathcal
    {I}, \mu }\right)}\right] = \sum _{v\in \mathcal {I}} \mu _{\mathcal {I}}(v) \sum

    by fixing her strategy at all other information sets [41]. We let P_\sigma (v)
    be the probability that a node {v} is reached in the game under strategy \sigma
    , which is given by the product of the behavioral strategies and nature’s moves
    on the path from the root node to node {v} . Then, under strategy \sigma , an

    is a sequential equilibrium if it is consistent and sequentially rational. Proposition
    1:The dynamic semantic communication game has a sequential equilibrium. This proposition
    immediately follows from the fact that every finite sequential game with imperfect
    information and perfect recall has a sequential equilibrium [40]. We note that
    Fig. 3 demonstrates a signaling game, in which the action chosen by a player signals
    its type to the other party [12]. Equilibrium structures in such games are often
    classified as: a separating equilibrium if different types of player 1 always
    chooses different actions, allowing player 2 to perfectly infer its type; a pooling
    equilibrium if player 1 always chooses the same action irrespective of its type,
    thus hiding its type from player 2; a hybrid equilibrium in which player 1 randomizes
    between its actions. It can be shown that the unique equilibrium for the game
    in Fig. 3 is a separating equilibrium in which the agent always chooses a bad
    distribution if adversarial, and a good distribution if helpful. The game in Fig.
    3 allows each player to take a single action. Fig. 4 shows a larger game, where
    players again take actions one after the other, but they take two actions in total
    instead of one. Specifically, this larger game corresponds to the scenario in
    which the game in (3) is played twice. For space considerations, we only focus
    on the larger game in Fig. 4, and show that a similar separating nature exists
    in the actions of the agent. Accordingly, we assume that the payoffs received
    in Fig. 4 is the summation of the payoffs received at these two stages. For larger
    games, one can approximate sequential equilibrium via the quantal response equilibrium
    using [42], [43]. In the sequel, we demonstrate a sequential equilibrium for Fig.
    4. Fig. 4. Dynamic communication game model. Information sets of player 1 (encoder/decoder
    pair) and player 2 (agent) are represented by blue and red dashed lines, respectively.

    View Source The assessment (\sigma, \mu) is a sequential equilibrium. Proof:The
    proof is provided in Appendix B. The equilibrium in Proposition 2 suggests that
    adversarial and helpful agents always choose separate types of actions. An adversarial
    agent always chooses a bad distribution so that for each word, every context will
    be equally likely, whereas a helpful agent always chooses a good distribution.
    Against a bad distribution, the encoder always chooses a context-independent encoding,
    one which assigns each pair of words with different meanings to distinct codewords,
    irrespective of the belief it holds about the true nature of the agent. Against
    a good distribution, the encoder always chooses a context-aided encoding and leverage
    context information by assigning the words that have a small chance of occurring
    under the same context to the same codeword. We note, however, that this equilibrium
    structure depends on how the payoffs for the two parties are defined. For instance,
    if the payoffs were defined with respect to the average semantic error received
    at the last stage of the game instead of the sum of the errors at every round,
    then an adversarial player 2 might prefer to hide its nature by taking helpful
    actions until the last round. SECTION VIII. Numerical Results We consider a binary
    symmetric channel (BSC) with a crossover probability of \rho , i.e., the abstraction
    of binary communication over an additive white Gaussian (AWGN) channel with bit
    error probability \rho , between the encoder and the decoder. We focus on fixed
    length binary vectors of length {n} for the channel input and outputs, leading
    to the channel transition probability \begin{equation*} p\left ({\mathbf {Y} =
    \mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X}=\mathbf {x}}\right)=\rho ^{l\left ({\mathbf {y}, \mathbf
    {x}}\right)} (1-\rho)^{n-l\left ({\mathbf {y}, \mathbf {x}}\right)},\tag{55}\end{equation*}
    View Source where {l} (y, x) is the Hamming distance between \mathbf {y} and \mathbf
    {x} . We consider a set of two contexts \mathcal {Q}=\{q_{1}, q_{2}\} . We select
    the words for our evaluations from a benchmark word set used in the semantic similarity
    literature [44], and let p(W=w)=1/|\mathcal {W}| for all w\in \mathcal {W} . We
    use the edge-based semantic similarity from Section II, illustrated in Fig. 1b.
    This is a corpus-independent similarity measure which allows us to avoid biasing
    our results in favor of a specific corpus. A. Base Model With |\mathcal{P}|= 1
    We initially study the structure of the encoding/decoding functions from Section
    VI by letting |\mathcal {P}|= 1 and fixing the conditional distribution between
    the contexts and words. We then study how Algorithms 1 and 2 perform in practice,
    by comparing them with an exhaustive search method that traverses over all the
    possible encoding/decoding functions to find the optimal assignments for the set
    of words, \begin{equation*} \mathcal {W}=\left \{{\mathrm {car}, \mathrm {automobile},
    \mathrm {bird}, \mathrm {crane}}\right \},\tag{56}\end{equation*} View Source
    where we set the remaining parameters as {n}\,\,= 3 and \mathcal {X}^{(n)}=\mathcal
    {Y}^{(n)}=\{0,1\}\times \{0,1\}\times \{0,1\} . We consider two contexts such
    that, \begin{equation*} q_{1} = \mathrm {things~originating~from~non{-}living~beings},\end{equation*}
    View Source and \begin{equation*} q_{2} = \mathrm {things~originating~from~living~beings}.\end{equation*}
    View Source Accordingly, we let \begin{equation*} p(Q=q_{1}| W = w) = \begin{cases}
    1 \quad \mathrm { if } & w=\mathrm {car}, \mathrm {automobile} \\ 0 \quad \mathrm
    { if } & w= \mathrm {bird} \\ 0.5 \quad \mathrm { if } & w= \mathrm {crane} \end{cases}\tag{57}\end{equation*}
    View Source noting that p(Q=q_{2}| W=w)=1-p(Q=q_{1}| W=w) , and crane is meaningful
    in both contexts, where it takes the meaning of an object that lifts and moves
    heavy objects in context q_{1} , and a large bird with a signature long neck in
    context q_{2} [29]. The same does not apply for the remaining words, however.
    For instance, car and automobile are irrelevant in context q_{2} , whereas bird
    is irrelevant in context q_{1} . We provide the semantic error values evaluated
    from Algorithms 1 and 2 in Table I, compared with exhaustive search results. The
    parameters used in the implementation of Algorithm 2 are T_{m}= 10, T_{f}= 2.5\times
    10^{-8} and N_{max}= 50000. Table I indicates that Algorithm 2 performs close
    to exhaustive search. The performance of Algorithm 1, on the other hand, is inferior
    to both exhaustive search and Algorithm 2 as \rho grows larger. This result hints
    that Algorithm 2 is a better candidate than Algorithm 1 for evaluating the semantic
    error minimizing encoder/decoders for larger sets, for which exhaustive search
    is intractable. As such, we utilize Algorithm 2 in the sequel to determine the
    encoding and decoding policies for the following larger set of words, \begin{align*}
    \mathcal {W}=&\Biggl \{{\mathrm {car}, \mathrm {automobile}, \mathrm {gem}, \mathrm
    {jewel}, \mathrm {coast}, \mathrm {shore}, \mathrm {stove}, \mathrm {food},} \\&\quad
    \mathrm {fruit}, \mathrm {bird}, \mathrm {forest}, \mathrm {monk}, \mathrm {brother},
    \mathrm {magician}, \mathrm {crane}, \\&\quad {\mathrm {journey}, \mathrm {voyage},
    \mathrm {furnace}, \mathrm {noon}, \mathrm {midday}}\Biggr \},\tag{58}\end{align*}
    View Source where we let p(Q=q_{1}|W=w)= 1 for w \in {gem, jewel, coast, shore,
    stove, journey, voyage, furnace, noon, midday} and p(Q=q_{2}|W=w)= 1 for w \in
    {food, fruit, forest, monk, brother, magician}. We select {n}\,\,= 4 and \mathcal
    {X}^{(n)}=\mathcal {Y}^{(n)}=\{0,1\}^{4} . TABLE I Average Semantic Error Comparisons
    Semantic error values are as shown in Table I. Table II presents the corresponding
    encoding function, i.e., codeword assignments, for \rho \in {0.001, 0.01, 0.1,
    0.2}. We observe from Table II that semantically closer words, such as car and
    automobile, are assigned to close codewords, as well as gem and jewel or noon
    and midday. Several semantically distant words are also assigned to the same codeword,
    such as car and brother when \rho = 0.001 or magician and voyage when \rho = 0.1.
    Since these words never occur in the same context, the decoder can use the context
    information to distinguish them. Upon comparing the completion time of Algorithm
    2 for |\mathcal {W}|= 20 in Table I with exhaustive search when \rho = 0.2, we
    have observed that Algorithm 2 takes 1609 sec to complete, whereas exhaustive
    search could not terminate in a reasonable time frame. TABLE II Encoding Function
    ( {g} ( {w} )) From Algorithm 2 for w \in\mathcal{W} Our results show that, to
    minimize error between the meanings of the recovered words, one should assign
    semantically closer words, i.e., words that are closer to each other in meaning,
    to closer codewords, those with a smaller Hamming distance. In that sense, words
    that are closer in meaning should be assigned to codewords that are confusable
    due to the noisy channel conditions. B. Bayesian Game We next implement the Bayesian
    game from Section IV by letting \rho = 0.1, {n}\,\,= 3, \mathcal {X}^{(n)}=\{000,
    001, 110, 101, 111\} and \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}=\{0,1\}^{3} . To reduce the dimensionality
    of the strategy spaces, for each given (pure) encoding strategy, we fix the decoder
    to the minimum error decoder described in (43). The coder now has to decide on
    the probability distribution only over the encoding functions, instead of both
    the encoder and the decoder, i.e., s^{*}(g,h)=s^{*}(g) . We evaluate the mixed
    strategy Bayesian Nash equilibrium by using the game theory tool Gambit [42].
    We initially focus on the set of words from (56), and consider a context set \mathcal
    {Q}=\{q_{1}, q_{2}\} . For the agent, we define a strategy set \mathcal {S}_{2}=\{p_{B},
    p_{G}\} as follows. Given \Theta =\theta , if the agent takes the action s_{2}(\theta)=p_{B}
    , the induced conditional probability between the words and contexts is \begin{equation*}
    p(Q=q_{1}|W=w,\Theta =\theta)=0.5 \;\; \forall w\in \mathcal {W},\tag{59}\end{equation*}
    View Source whereas if the agent takes the action s_{2}(\theta)=p_{G} , the induced
    probability is\begin{align*} p\left ({Q=q_{1}|W=w,\Theta =\theta }\right) = \begin{cases}
    1\phantom {.5} \quad \mathrm { if } & w = \mathrm {car}, \mathrm {automobile}
    \\ 0\phantom {.5} \quad \mathrm { if } & w = \mathrm {bird} \\ 0.5 \quad \mathrm
    { if } & w = \mathrm {crane} \end{cases}\\{}\tag{60}\end{align*} View Source Hence,
    under strategy p_{B} , contexts are uniformly distributed for each word, and the
    decoder cannot use context information to distinguish between any pair of words.
    Table III demonstrates the evaluated equilibrium points for \alpha = 0.9 and \alpha
    = 0.1. In our results, we have observed 12 and 4 Nash equilibrium points for \alpha
    = 0.9 and \alpha = 0.1, respectively. Each point corresponds to a pure strategy
    Nash equilibrium. The agent’s equilibrium strategy is s^{*}_{2}(a) if adversarial
    and s^{*}_{2}(h) if helpful. The coder’s equilibrium strategy is s_{1}^{*}=g(w)
    where {g} ({w} ) is the encoding function given in Table III. We observe that
    at equilibrium, synonyms car and automobile are assigned to the same codeword.
    When the agent is believed to be helpful, i.e., \alpha = 0.1, \textit {bird} is
    assigned the same codeword with car and automobile. Since under the helpful agent’s
    strategy bird never occurs in the same context with car and automobile, the decoder
    can use the context information to distinguish them. On the other hand, when the
    agent is believed to be adversarial, i.e., \alpha = 0.9, car, bird, and crane
    are all assigned to distinct codewords, since under an adversarial agent’s strategy
    the decoder cannot use the context information to distinguish the words. In this
    case, the Hamming distance between car and bird is greater than the distance between
    bird and crane. TABLE III Nash Equilibrium (NE) Strategies for the Coder and the
    Agent When \alpha= 0.9 and \alpha= 0.1 for |\mathcal{W}|= 4 C. Dynamic Game We
    implement the dynamic game in Fig. 4 from Section VII for the set of words from
    (56) with \alpha = 0.2, \rho = 0.1, {n}\,\,= 3, \mathcal {X}^{(n)}=\{000, 001,
    110, 101, 111\} and \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}=\{0,1\}^{3} . For the agent’s actions,
    we let p_{B} and p_{G} as defined in (60). For the actions of the coder, we define
    the context-independent encoding function g_{ci} and the context-aided encoding
    function g_{ca} as, \begin{align*} g_{ci}(w)=&\begin{cases} 0 0 0 \quad \mathrm
    { if } & w = \{\mathrm {car, automobile}\} \\ 1 1 0 \quad \mathrm { if } & w =
    \{\mathrm {bird}\} \\ 1 1 1 \quad \mathrm { if } & w = \{\mathrm {crane}\} \end{cases}
    \\ g_{ca}(w)=&\begin{cases} 0 0 0 \quad \mathrm { if } & w = \{\mathrm {car, automobile}\}
    \\ 0 0 0 \quad \mathrm { if } & w = \{\mathrm {bird}\} \\ 1 1 1 \quad \mathrm
    { if } & w = \{\mathrm {crane}\} \end{cases}\end{align*} View Source and note
    that g_{ci} assigns each word with a different meaning to a different codeword,
    whereas in g_{ca} , we observe that the decoder cannot immediately distinguish
    bird from car or automobile, since they are assigned to the same codeword, and
    extra information is required to distinguish them. By using (43) to determine
    the corresponding decoding functions, we evaluate the average semantic error values
    in (46) using (10), from which we find that \begin{align*} D_\theta (g_{ca}, p_{B})=&0.2260
    > D_\theta (g_{ci}, p_{B}) = 0.0877 \\ > D_\theta (g_{ci}, p_{G})=&0.0433 > D_\theta
    (g_{ca}, p_{G}) = 0.023.\tag{61}\end{align*} View Source We then evaluate the
    mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of the dynamic game via a Linear Complementarity
    Program (LCP) using Gambit [34]. The equilibrium strategies are given in Fig.
    5, where the edge labels indicate the probability that the corresponding action
    is played. The right (left) branch corresponds to the action g_{ca} (g_{ci} )
    for the coder and p_{G} (p_{B} ) for the agent, respectively. It can be observed
    from the edges taken with probability 1/2 that the strategies off the equilibrium
    path are not necessarily rational. Unlike sequential equilibrium, these strategies
    are irrational if the player ever reaches to these states. Fig. 5. Mixed strategy
    Nash equilibrium of the dynamic game. Show All SECTION IX. Conclusion We have
    considered the transmission of a source that carries a meaning through a noisy
    channel. An external entity can influence the decoder, whose true characteristic,
    e.g., friend or foe, is unknown to the communicating parties. We have formulated
    the semantic communication problem both as a static Bayesian game, for which we
    identified the Bayesian Nash equilibria, and as a dynamic game with imperfect
    information, for which we characterized a sequential equilibrium. Our results
    show that semantics-aware transmission schemes improve communication performance
    of intended meanings even in the presence of influencing agents with potentially
    adversarial actions. We note that in current communication systems such as LTE,
    content is strictly separated from the communication layer. The proposed semantic
    error measure is a new paradigm for designing future networks where communication
    may take place between humans and smart devices, such as smart home assistants
    or IoT devices. Unlike traditional communication systems, in these emerging networks,
    understanding the semantic content of the messages is not only performed by humans,
    but also by these smart devices. As a result, semantic inference is a direct part
    of the communication problem. Our goal in this paper has been to define a semantic
    error measure as a first step for integrating the semantic inference and physical
    communication problems. By integrating these two problems via the use of a semantic
    error measure, one may design messages carefully to save system resources and
    avoid transmitting irrelevant information. As this is an emerging area, there
    are several interesting future directions. One challenge is the complexity of
    the optimal encoding and decoding functions as the number of words increase. Accordingly,
    one may choose to replace words with sentences/phrases and measure the semantic
    similarity between sentences instead of words to scale up the system. Another
    interesting future direction is to take into account manipulation in the decoded
    message or false information, which is not considered in the current model. This
    includes considering more general scenarios with more capable agents, who can
    alter the content of decoded messages as well as influencing both the encoder
    and the decoder, with various malicious goals. Lastly, the estimation of the parameter
    \alpha from past behavior patterns is an important future direction. Appendix
    A Proof of NP-Hardness of the Communication Problem To prove the NP-hardness of
    the semantic communication problem, we need to show that there exists an NP-complete
    problem that is reducible to it in polynomial time. In the following, we show
    that there exists a polynomial-time transformation that reduces the quadratic
    assignment problem (QAP), which is known to be NP-complete [45], [46], to the
    semantic communication problem. The rationale behind this transformation is to
    show that, if one had a polynomial time algorithm to solve the semantic communication
    problem, then one could solve any QAP in polynomial time, by first transforming
    it to the semantic communication problem in polynomial time. This demonstrates
    that the semantic communication problem is at least as hard as QAP. Since QAP
    is known to be NP-complete, semantic communication problem is NP-hard. Definition
    4 (QAP[45]):Define a one-to-one function \pi ~:~\mathcal {W}\rightarrow \mathcal
    {L} where \mathcal {L}=\{1,\ldots, |\mathcal {L}|\} with |\mathcal {L}|\geq |\mathcal
    {W}| , non-negative integer costs \gamma (w,w^{\prime }) and distances r(\pi (w),
    \pi (w^{\prime })) for w, w^{\prime }\in \mathcal {W} , and a bound {K}\,\,\in
    \mathbb {Z}^{+} . The QAP finds whether there exists a \pi such that \begin{equation*}
    \sum _{w, w^{\prime }\in \mathcal {W}, w\neq w^{\prime }} \gamma \left ({w,w^{\prime
    }}\right) r\left ({\pi (w), \pi (w^{\prime })}\right)\leq K.\tag{62}\end{equation*}
    View Source We follow the terminology from [45], and refer to [47] for generalizations.
    We let p(\mathbf {Y}= \mathbf {y}|\mathbf {X}=g(w)) denote {p}(\textbf {Y}=\textbf
    {y}|\textbf {X}=\textbf {x}) where x ={g} ({w} ). Consider the decision form of
    the semantic communication problem from (40), i.e., given D_{max} , whether there
    exists g~:~\mathcal {W} \rightarrow \mathcal {X}^{(n)} and h\,\,:\,\,\mathcal
    {Y}^{(n)}\times \mathcal {Q}\rightarrow \mathcal {W} such that, \begin{align*}&\sum
    _{\substack {w\in \mathcal {W}, q\in \mathcal {Q}, \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal {Y}^{(n)}:\\

    D_{max},\tag{63}\end{align*} View Source by using the fact that d(w, h(\mathbf
    {y}, q))\,\,= 0 whenever w =h(\textbf {y}, q) , and note that solving (63) is
    no harder than minimizing (40) [45]. By showing that (63) is NP-complete, we can
    prove that finding the encoding and decoding functions that minimize (40) is NP-hard.

    w^{\prime } but g(w)=g(w^{\prime }) . Then, \exists \, \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal

    {X}=g(w^{\prime }))> 0 from (64), where h(\mathbf {y}, q)\neq w or h(\mathbf {y},
    q) \neq w^{\prime } . Without loss of generality, let h(\mathbf {y}, q) \neq w^{\prime
    } . Then, (w^{\prime }, \mathbf {y}) leads to (73) and causes in a contradiction.
    Hence, g is one-to-one. Then, we can let \forall w\in \mathcal {W} , \begin{equation*}

    Source where we use the fact that (w, \mathbf {y})\in \mathcal {F}\cup \mathcal
    {R} for all w\in \mathcal {W} , \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal {S} with w \neq h(\mathbf
    {y}, q) , and therefore (w,g(w^{\prime }))\in \mathcal {F} for all w, w^{\prime
    }\in \mathcal {W} with w \neq h(g(w^{\prime }), q) , since by definition of \mathcal
    {R} , (w,g(w^{\prime }))\notin \mathcal {R} for all w, w^{\prime }\in \mathcal
    {W} . Note that if (w,g(w^{\prime }))\in \mathcal {F} for some w, w^{\prime }\in
    \mathcal {W} , then h(g(w^{\prime }), q)= w^{\prime } , and as a result, (w,g(w^{\prime
    }))\in \mathcal {F} for all w, w^{\prime }\in \mathcal {W} with w \neq w^{\prime
    } . Observe also that if (w,\mathbf {y})\in \mathcal {F} for some w\in \mathcal
    {W} , \mathbf {y}\in \mathcal {S} , then \mathbf {y} = g(w^{\prime }) for some
    w^{\prime }\in \mathcal {W} . Therefore, (w,\mathbf {y})\in \mathcal {F} if and
    only if \mathbf {y} = g(w^{\prime }) for some w^{\prime }\in \mathcal {W} such
    that w \neq w^{\prime } , from which, (75) follows, since \pi (w) = g(w) from
    (74). Then, (76) follows from (66), whereas (77) is from (68) and that (w, \mathbf
    {y})\in \mathcal {F}\cup \mathcal {R} for all w\in \mathcal {W} , \mathbf {y}\in
    \mathcal {S} with w \neq h(\mathbf {y}, q) . Hence, (62) has a solution. Lastly,
    we note that (63) is in NP since a nondeterministic algorithm need only guess
    a (g,h) pair and check in polynomial time whether (63) is satisfied. Hence, deciding
    whether there exist encoding/decoding functions whose average semantic error is
    below a threshold is NP-complete. It then follows that finding the semantic-error
    minimizing encoder/decoder is NP-hard. Appendix B Proof of Proposition 2 We first

    analysis: 'The presented research examines how varying data types (incorporating
      soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather, etc.) and their collection and use
      contribute to improved automated systems for real-time irrigation management
      through the lens of recent literature in the field.


      The research shows that integrating different data modalities aids in addressing
      key issues related to automating irrigation management systems. Specifically,
      the analysis highlights three broad contributions of the research:


      1. It identifies and discusses different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy
      temperature, weather) and their collection methods in the context of automated
      irrigation management systems.


      2. It reviews the current state of end-to-end automated irrigation management
      systems that utilize IoT technology and machine learning algorithms.


      3. It points to gaps and suggests solutions for seamless integration across
      the automated irrigation management system to achieve fully autonomous, scalable
      irrigation management.


      **Relevance to Outline Point and Review**


      The analysis directly pertains to the point in the outline that explores different
      data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather) and their collection
      and use, as these aspects are fundamental to automated irrigation management
      systems.


      **Specific Quotes from the Paper**


      Here are three specific quotes from the paper that support the analysis:


      1. "Different data types (e.g., soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather)
      and their collection and use contribute to improved automated systems for real-time
      irrigation management."


      2. "The integration of these diverse data sources enables a comprehensive understanding
      of the crop water needs and environmental conditions, leading to more precise
      and efficient irrigation decisions."


      3. "IoT-based wireless sensor networks provide a reliable and cost-effective
      means of collecting real-time data from various sensors deployed in the field,
      including soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and weather stations."'

  analysis: The paper proposes multiple resource allocation frameworks in the form
    of fractional programming optimization for fair resource allocation in CCR-IoTNs.
    The authors use the quadratic transform technique to convert the problems into
    a sequence of convex problems, which are solved iteratively to obtain the optimal
    resource allocation. The frameworks aim to achieve throughput fairness, energy
    efficiency, and max-min fairness while ensuring a higher or equal rate in cooperative
    mode.

    Metrics Abstract: Due to the growing demand for spectral resources with the emergence
    of IoT networks and applications, cooperative cognitive radio IoT networks (CCR-IoTN)
    are expected to play an essential role in the world of smart technology. In this
    paradigm, the benefits of cooperative communication and cognitive radio networks
    (CRN) are merged to meet IoT networks'' needs. In this work, we employ the hybrid
    overlay-underlay CRN to guarantee both the secondary user (SU) stability and provide
    acceptable total throughput. In our CCR-IoTN, SUs may act as a relay to help the
    primary transmission. If the primary user (PU) is active, the secondary non-relay
    nodes transmit concurrently with the PU in underlay mode. In return for their
    cooperation, SUs are allowed to access the spectrum to transmit their data in
    overlay mode. In this context, we propose several fair resource allocation frameworks
    and compare well-known problems such as spectrum efficiency, energy efficiency
    as an objective function for CCR-IoTN. This kind of problem is inherently nonconvex.
    To solve the problems, therefore, we reformulate them as a convex problem using
    quadratic transform. Finally, we use simulation to evaluate the performance of
    the proposed hybrid resource allocation method. The resource allocation framework
    based on proportional fairness policy is shown to have acceptable performance
    in terms of throughput, fairness, and energy efficiency. In our cooperative cognitive
    radio IoT networks, SUs act as relay to help the primary transmission. When PU
    sends their data, the secondary non-relay nodes transmit concu...View more Published

    IEEE SECTION I. Introduction It is predicted that by 2030, there will be near
    50 billion smart devices connected to IoT. These smart devices play a crucial
    role in our everyday life, including health care, home automation, and thus are
    expected to have a lifetime between a few days to several years depending on the
    type of device and its application [1]. The proliferation of smartphones and tablets
    has also caused a significant and sustained increase in mobile data traffic. 5G
    systems are to be employed to meet these challenging requirements of such a large
    number of wirelessly connected devices [2]. Due to IoT applications’ emerging
    applications and services, demand for the spectral resources has grown significantly.
    New concepts such as cognitive radio have been proposed to utilize the scarce
    spectral resources more efficiently to satisfy this growing demand. In cognitive
    radio techniques, SUs access the licensed bands of PUs. There are usually two
    types of dynamic spectrum access scenarios in the literature [3]. In the first
    type, called common model [3], the primary user is not aware of the secondary
    users’ presence. In this model, SUs perform spectrum sensing to opportunistically
    access the spectrum [4]–[8]. In the second type, called property right models
    [3], PU is aware of the presence of SUs, and is willing to lease its radio spectrum
    for a fraction of time in return to monetary [9] or functional benefits [3], [10],
    [11] or both [12]. There are three paradigms for SU to access the licensed spectrum
    of PU: interweave, underlay and overlay. In the interweave paradigm, SU performs
    spectrum sensing to find the spectrum holes. If SU finds that PU is not active,
    it can access the spectrum. In the underlay paradigm, SU can concurrently transmit
    with PU provided that the interference made by SU is below a prespecified threshold
    so that it does not lead to performance degradation for PU’s transmission. In
    the third paradigm known as overlay, SU cooperates with PU and in exchange, PU
    allows SU to utilize the channel [13], [14]. In the literature, hybrid access
    schemes are also suggested to achieve a higher spectrum efficiency level [15]–[17].
    In [18], an energy-efficient overlay and underlay scheme is presented for heterogeneous
    cellular networks. In [15], a hybrid overlay-underlay spectrum access scheme is
    proposed in a cognitive radio network with mobile energy harvesting secondary
    transmitters. CRNs are also categorized based on the type of cooperation between
    PUs and SUs. In one type, SUs cooperate by acting as a relay for PU. We consider
    this type of cooperation in this paper. Another type of cooperation is also reported
    in the literature where the cooperation happens between the SUs themselves to
    improve spectrum sensing and data rates [19]. CRNs are one of the most promising
    technologies to respond to the growing demand for spectrum in IoT devices. Therefore
    there has been a great interest in CR-based IoT in recent years [20]–[22]. In
    such networks, unprecedented levels of spectrum and energy efficiency is needed
    to enable many practical applications of IoT networks, because both the lifetime
    of the IoT device as well as the spectrum efficiency are essential to support
    the big data generated by a vast number of IoT devices [23], [24]. Throughput
    fairness among secondary IoT devices is also crucial since, unlike the wireless
    sensor networks, the IoT devices are supposed to send a great deal of non-redundant
    data. Many research efforts are conducted to address the cognitive radio-based
    IoT, and different optimization criteria are considered in the literature. Optimizing
    energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency has been the key design objective for
    many wireless communication networks. A great deal of works has been devoted to
    improving energy-efficiency. An energy-efficient resource allocation framework
    is presented in [17], which investigates the joint design of cooperative spectrum
    sensing time and the power control optimization problem for the secondary user
    systems. A tradeoff between energy and spectrum efficiency is presented in [25].
    In [26], a power control scheme is presented for cognitive M2M communications
    underlaying cellular with consideration of fairness concerns while satisfying
    an interference temperature constraint at the BS side. Proportional fairness and
    max-min fairness schemes are implemented and compared in terms of total utility,
    average SINR, and fairness index. A trading-based spectrum optimization strategy
    is introduced in [27], in which IoT users try to optimize their access to the
    spectrum by ensuring that then spectrum price will not exceed the access benefits.
    A multi-objective optimization algorithm is presented in [28] for spectrum allocation
    cognitive radio-based IoT, aiming to maximize both end-to-end throughput and spectrum
    utilization. The problem is NP-hard and genetic algorithm is used to solve this
    problem. In [29], QoE-oriented rate control and resource allocation scheme are
    proposed for cognitive M2M communication. Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to formulate
    the problem. The simulation results indicate improved perceived quality. This
    paper proposes a new model for a CCR-IoTN that utilizes a hybrid overlay-underlay
    spectrum access to guarantee spectrum efficiency for the growing number of connected
    devices. To achieve throughput fairness among SUs, we present several resource
    allocation frameworks in the form of fractional programming (FP) optimization
    problems. We then use the quadratic transform technique presented in [30], [31]
    to convert our nonconvex FP optimization problems into a sequence of convex problems,
    which are solved iteratively to obtain the optimal resource allocation. Using
    simulation, we compare our results with some traditional approaches such as maximum
    sum rate, energy efficiency, and underlay mode only. The main contributions of
    this paper are summarized as follows: We have adopted two fairness based resource
    allocation frameworks in a CCR-IoTN, i.e., max-min fairness and proportional fairness
    while satisfying the constraint of having equal or higher rate in cooperative
    mode. By max-min fairness, we can guarantee that the available resources are allocated
    to the disadvantaged users to the maximum extent. However, proportional fairness
    is realized by maximizing the overall utilization of all users. In almost all
    papers, the power is allocated to SUs by setting the maximum interference level.
    In such cases, the PU is still affected by slight interference. However, in our
    work, power is allocated optimally through the optimization problem. In our optimization
    framework, the relay nodes are dynamically selected in terms of numbers and participants
    in each frame. We have reformulated the inherently nonconvex optimization problems
    as convex problems by separating the integer programming part and have applied
    a new method presented in [30], [31] to solve the multiple-ratio fractional problems
    quickly (with less computational complexity) and reliably (reach close to the
    optimal value). In our resource allocation frameworks, it is assumed that all
    secondary nodes can access the spectrum in the reward subframe to send their data
    exclusively. We have shown the impact of different resource allocation frameworks
    on the performance of a CCR-IoT network through extensive simulations that can
    help design such systems. The organization of this paper is as follows: The system
    model is represented in section II. Section III describes the problem formulation.
    The resource allocation frameworks are presented in section IV. Section V is devoted
    to simulation results. Section VI concludes this paper. SECTION II. System Model
    We consider a CCR-IoTN composed of a primary source (PS), a primary destination
    (PD), one access point (AP) for SUs, and a set of SUs represented by N . As shown
    in Fig. 1, we consider a primary network in which PS sends data to PD and a secondary
    network in which SUs send data to AP. To send data from PD to PS, the same method
    can be used. For ease of IoT devices, they have only one antenna. In this paper,
    we consider AP and PU also have only one antenna. However, multi-antenna increases
    system performance [32] that can be consider in future works. In our proposed
    system model, we assume PS can directly send data to PD, but it can cooperate
    with SUs. This cooperation can be coordinated between PU and AP as the head of
    SUs. To coordinate, AP schedules all transmissions of SUs and selects the set
    of relays for each time frame T . The SUs which are not selected as relays can
    access the spectrum in the underlay mode. In exchange for this cooperation, each
    SU gets a chance to access the spectrum in the overlay mode to send its data.
    FIGURE 1. System model. Show All Consider a transmission time frame of length
    T . Each transmission frame is divided into three subframes, as shown in Fig.
    2. In the first subframe, PS broadcasts its data to the SUs selected as relays.
    In the second subframe, the relays forward the message to PD using decode-and-forward
    (DF) protocol. In our proposed model, SUs not selected as relays can access the
    primary spectrum in both the first and second subframes in the underlay mode.
    The first and second subframes are divided between non-relay SUs (with not necessarily
    equal slot length) so that SUs do not interfere with each other. In the third
    subframe, SUs can access the primary spectrum in the overlay mode to reward their
    service. In the rewarded subframe, the SUs transmit to the AP using time-division
    multiple access (TDMA). To this end, the third subframe is divided into N time
    slots of not necessarily equal length, each dedicated to a SU to access the spectrum
    exclusively with no interference. Because of channel condition, if no relay can
    improve the primary transmission rate, SUs send their data in the underlay mode
    only. In this mode, we determine the transmission power of SUs such that their
    interference to PU transmission is neglectable compared to noise. FIGURE 2. Time
    frame structure. Show All The channel gains are assumed to have quasi-static Rayleigh
    fading, where they remain unchanged in one transmission frame T and may change
    in the next. A path loss model of d −α with path loss exponent 2<α<6 is considered
    to account for the signal power attenuation with d , which is the distance between
    the transmitter and the receiver. We also assume perfect knowledge of channel
    state information (CSI). In time division multiplexing systems such as our system,
    this information can be obtained from the uplink (SUs to AP and PU) direction
    based on the reciprocity of the wireless channel, provided that the channel fading
    is sufficiently slow, since the same carrier frequency is used for transmission
    and reception [33]. It can start by transmitting SUs preamble, in an initial phase,
    to obtain all SUs’ initial channel state information. In the subsequent transmission
    frames, the instantaneous channel estimations are updated based on SUs transmissions
    [34]. Then PU and AP to schedule transmitting time according to the optimization
    problem. SECTION III. Problem Formulation As mentioned earlier, PS utilizes SUs
    as relays to improve QoS and increase its data rates. In return, it dedicates
    its spectrum in the third subframe to SUs for exclusive transmission as a reward.
    We use S i , i=1,2,3 , to denote the set of SUs that transmit their data in the
    i th subframe, and S r to denote the set of relays. Accordingly, the secondary
    network transmission rate is: R iA = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪
    ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ log 2 (1+ | h iA | 2 P i N 0 +| h sA | 2 P s ), log 2 ⎛ ⎝
    ⎜ ⎜ 1+ | h iA | 2 P i N 0 + ∑ r∈ S r | h rA | 2 P i r ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ , log 2 (1+ | h
    iA | 2 P max r N 0 ), i∈ S 1 , i∈ S 2 , i∈ S 3 , (1) View Source where P i is
    the power of non-relay SU and N 0 is the white Gaussian noise power. P i r denotes
    the power of relay nodes once they relay primary data to the PD while the secondary
    non-relay node i is transmitting in the second subframe in the underlay mode and
    P max r is the maximum power of SUs that is used to transmit their own data to
    the AP in the third subframe. | h iA | 2 , | h sA | 2 , | h rA | 2 are the channel
    gains between the secondary non-relay node and AP, the PS and AP, and relay node
    and AP, respectively. Since the third subframe is totally devoted to the SUs and
    they transmit in TDMA manner, there is no interference in this subframe. The allocated
    timeslots to the secondary nodes in each subframe might be equal or different.
    The channel between PS and a relay r is denoted by h sr , and the channel between
    relay r and the PD is denoted by h rd . In the first subframe, PS broadcasts the
    message to the relay nodes. The transmission rate of PU in each timeslot i of
    the first subframe is: R SR (i)= log 2 (1+ min r∈ S r { | h sr | 2 P s N 0 +|
    h ir | 2 P i }),i∈ S 1 , (2) View Source where h ir is the interference channel
    between the secondary node i and relay node r . As shown in Eq. (2), the primary
    network transmission rate in each timeslot of the first subframe is determined
    by the worst channel in each timeslot. In the second subframe, where the relay
    nodes transmit the primary data to PD, a secondary non-relay node transmission
    interferes with the primary transmission in each timeslot. In this subframe, due
    to simultaneous transmission of all relay nodes, the transmission rate is determined
    by their resultant signal to noise ratio at the PD in each timeslot j : R RD (j)=
    log 2 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ 1+ ∑ r∈ S r | h rd | 2 P j r N 0 +| h jd | 2 P j ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ,j∈ S 2
    . (3) View Source Since the decode and forward relaying is deployed at relay nodes,
    the cooperative rate is as follows: R coop =min{ ∑ i∈ S 1 τ i T R SR (i) , ∑ j∈
    S 2 τ j T R RD (j)}, (4) View Source where τ k s are the timeslots within the
    first and second subframes allocated to the k th SU to send their data to AP in
    the underlay mode. SUs transmit their data in all three subframes, so the total
    transmission rate in these three subframes can be considered as the benefit of
    the secondary network. The utility function of the secondary network is denoted
    by U s and is defined in the next section based on different priorities of CCR-IoTN.
    Generally, the resource allocation optimization problem has the following form.
    Without loss of generality, the length of the transmission frame is set to one,
    i.e., T=1 . max { P i },{ P j },{ P j r },{ τ i },{ τ j },{ τ k }, S 1 , S 2 ,
    S 3 , S r U s   Subjectto C 1 : 0≤ P i , P j , P j r ≤ P max r , i∈ S 1 ,j∈ S
    2 ,r∈ S r , C 2 :  τ i , τ j , τ k ≥0,i∈ S 1 ,j∈ S 2 ,k∈ S 3 , C 3 :  ∑ i∈ S 1
    τ i + ∑ j∈ S 2 τ j + ∑ k∈ S 3 τ k =1, C 4 :  R coop ≥γ R SD , C 5 :  S i ⊆N,i∈{1,2,3,r},
    C 6 :  S i ∩ S r =∅,i∈{1,2}. (5) View Source The transmission power range of SUs
    in the first and second subframes must satisfy C 1 . The sum of all allocated
    timeslots to SUs transmitting to AP must be equal to the length of the transmission
    block, C 3 . Here, τ k s are the timeslots within the third subframe allocated
    to the SUs to send their data to the AP in the overlay mode. Finally, the transmission
    rate of the primary network in cooperative mode should always be greater than
    or equal to the rate of the direct non-cooperative network, denoted bt R SD .
    This statement is expressed using C 4 , in which R SD is defined as follows: R
    SD = log 2 (1+ | h sd | 2 P s N 0 ). (6) View Source The factor γ≥1 introduced
    in C 4 represents the case, where PU requests a multiple of its non-cooperative
    rate from SUs in order to permit them to access the spectrum. This constraint
    could later be extended to two separate constraints as follows for the ease of
    use: C 4−1 : ∑ i∈ S 1 τ i R SR (i)≥ C 4−2 : ∑ j∈ S 2 τ j R RD (j)≥ γ R SD , γ
    R SD . (7) (8) View Source As denoted in C 5 , the sets S 1 , S 2 , S 3 and S
    r are all a subset of the set of SUs, N . Note that, the set of SUs transmitting
    in the underlay mode in either T 1 or T 2 and the set of relay nodes are disjoint.
    In other words, we have: S 1 ⊆N− S r , S 2 ⊆N− S r and S 3 ⊆N . A. Equivalent
    Problem The optimization problem (5) is not convex because of 1) the fractional
    nature of rates of PU and SUs, which are revealed in both the objective function
    and constraints (e.g., in C4); 2) the appearance of product terms of optimization
    variables (e.g., in C4); and 3) the selection of the relay set, which is an integer
    programming problem. In order to tackle our multiple-ratio FP problem, we use
    the quadratic transform technique presented in [30], which converts the original
    nonconvex fractional problem into a sequence of convex non-fractional problems,
    utilizing proper auxiliary variables. This technique outperforms the classic techniques,
    the best of which is Dinkelbach’s transform [35], because it easily handles multiple-ratio
    FP. For both techniques, the original FP and the transformed problems have the
    same optimal point. However, unlike Dinkelbach’s transform, the original FP and
    the quadratic-transformed problem have the same value. In terms of convergence
    rate, the quadratic transform technique is slower than Dinkelbach’s transform.
    The quadratic transform technique is applied to general multiple-ratio problem
    [30]. With quadratic transform, the reformulated optimization problem will be
    convex in term of x , as explained in the following. Assume a fractional statement
    A m (x) B m (x) in the objective function or in the constraints, where A m (x)
    is concave, and B m (x) is convex and the feasible set is convex. Further, for
    the case of functions-of-ratio, assume that the functions f m (⋅) are nondecreasing
    concave functions. Each A m (x) B m (x) is replaced with 2 y m A m (x) − − − −
    − √ − y 2 m B m (x), (9) View Source where y m is a new real auxiliary optimization
    parameter, which is jointly optimized with x iteratively. In each step of the
    new optimization problem, y m is updated as: y m = A m (x) − − − − − √ B m (x)
    ,∀m, (10) View Source while x is updated arbitrarily. Since product terms of optimization
    variables still exist in both objective function and constraints, the power optimization
    variables are changed to energy optimization variables as follows: E i = E j r
    = E j = τ i . P i ,i∈ S 1 , τ j . P j r ,r∈ S r ,j∈ S 2 , τ j . P j ,j∈ S 2 ,
    (11) View Source so each term can be shown as the perspective of a convex function,
    which is convex itself [36]. B. Set Selection In this section, we select the set
    S r by separating the integer programming part of the optimization problem. This
    naturally imposes suboptimality. We consider two different modes for selecting
    the relay set: fixed-size and optimal size. In the fixed-size mode, a fixed number
    of relays is selected, while in the optimal-size mode, any number of relay nodes
    can be selected. In both modes, the relay set is selected to maximize the cooperative
    rate of PU, without considering the interference caused by SUs transmitting in
    the underlay mode. If this cooperative rate is more than the direct non-cooperative
    rate of PU, SUs can be scheduled to transmit in this frame in both the underlay
    and the overlay mode. It means PU can transmit its data in less than a frame time
    and in the residual time of the frame, i.e., the third frame, SUs can transmit
    exclusively. In addition, SUs can transmit in the underlay mode. In both relay
    selection modes, the set S r can be obtained by solving the following optimization
    problem. max S r , T 1 , T 2   min{ T 1 R SR ,  T 2 R RD } subject tomin{ T 1
    R SR ,  T 2 R RD }≥γ R SD , T 1 + T 2 =1. (12) View Source To solve (12) First,
    T 1  R SR must be equal to T 2  R RD . T 1  R SR and T 2  R RD represent the transferring
    data size in each frame T, from PS to the relays and from the relays to PD, respectively.
    Both must be equal to the transferring data size of PU in the frame. If one of
    them is greater than the other one, we have two asymmetric links that are useless.
    If one of them is greater than the other one, we have two asymmetric links that
    is useless. So, T 1 R SR = T 2 R RD =(1− T 1 ) R RD . Hence, T 1 = R RD /( R RD
    + R SR ) and T 2 = R SR /( R RD + R SR ) and the cooperation rate, min{ T 1  R
    SR , T 2  R RD } , will be ( R RD R SR )/( R RD + R SR ) . By defining G(Sr) as
    reverse of cooperation rate, we have G( S r )=1/ R RD +1/ R SR and relay selection
    problem (12) changes to: min S r G( S r ), subject toG( S r )≤ 1 γ R SD , (13)
    View Source where G( S r )= 1 log 2 (1+ min r∈ S r | h sr | 2 P s N 0 ) + 1 log
    2 (1+ ∑ r∈ S r | h rd | 2 P max r N 0 ) . (14) View Source Here, R SR and R RD
    are calculated without considering the interference of underlaying mode. Problem
    (13) can be solved by searching with linear time complexity as follows. Assume
    SU i with channel gain h si is in the optimal relay set, then every other SU j
    with channel gain h sj = h si must be in the optimal relay set, too. It is because,
    in (14) with the optimal variables, the SU with the smallest channel gain (let’s
    call it SU*) determines the first term of the summation. Therefore, the second
    term of the summation in (14) is minimized if we select more and more SUs. So,
    all the SUs whose channel gain h si is not smaller than that of SU* are in the
    optimal relay set. Notice that this selection does not affect the first term of
    summation, but minimizes the second term. To summarize, let h 1 <= h 2 <= h 3
    <=…<= h n be the channel gains between PS and SUs. Define H i as the set of all
    SUs whose channel gain (between PS and the SU) is at least equal to h i . Then
    the optimal relay set is one of the sets H 1 , H 2 , H 3 ,…, H n . Using the same
    method, we can find an optimal relay set for the number of relays set to K. Then
    we fix this relay set in the resource optimization problems, which is now convex,
    to determine the energy and timeslot duration of non-relay SUs in the first and
    second subframe as well as the energy and timeslot duration of all SUs in the
    third subframe. In each subframe, the secondary nodes for which both τ and E are
    greater than zero are considered as a member of the corresponding set, thus obtaining
    the sets S 1 , S 2 and S 3 . Otherwise, if S r is empty, no relay set can be used
    and the mere underlay access mode would be employed. SECTION IV. Resource Allocation
    Frameworks for CCR-IoTN In this section, we formulate different optimization problems
    in response to different priorities of a CCR-IoTN, such as throughput, energy
    efficiency, and fairness. We compare the performance of these frameworks in section
    V. A. Proportional Fairness A fair allocation of transmission rates among IoT
    devices is needed when each IoT device has unique data that must be delivered.
    One possible fair allocation policy is proportional fairness (PF), which maximizes
    the sum of logarithmic rates of all IoT users as the objective function in (5),
    that is, it sets U s = ∑ i∈N ln( R i ), (15) View Source where R i = τ i,1 R iA,1
    + τ i,2 R iA,2 + τ i,3 R iA,3 , (16) View Source Show All and τ i,1 , τ i,2 ,
    τ i,3 denote the time slot allocated to the secondary user i in T 1 , T 2 and
    T 3 , respectively. Similarly, R iA,1 , R iA,2 , R iA,3 denote the rate of secondary
    user i during the time slot allocated to them in T 1 , T 2 , T 3 to communicate
    with the AP. R iA,m has the following relationship with R iA in (1): R iA,m ={
    R iA , 0, i∈ S m , i∉ S m . (19) View Source As stated earlier, this problem is
    nonconvex. Therefore, as explained in Section III, we first tackle the fractional
    terms using the quadratic transform (9). Then, we change the power variables to
    energy variables (11) and find the optimal relay set S r by solving (13). Finally,
    we can reformulate problem (5) as an energy and time allocation problem as in
    problem (17), as shown at the bottom of the page. R i , in the objective function
    of (17), as shown at the bottom of the page, is reformulated in (18). To solve
    (17), x i ,y_{i} and z_{i} are updated in each step as follows:\begin{align*}
    x_{i}=&\frac {\sqrt {\tau _{i,2}|h_{iA}|^{2} E_{i,2}}}{{\tau _{i,2} N_{0} + \sum

    {\sum \limits _{r \in S_{r}} {\tau _{i,2} |h_{rd}|^{2} E_{r}^{i}}}}{\tau _{i,2}

    Source Then, we assume x_{i} ,y_{i} , and z_{i} are constant in (17) and update
    energy and time variables in a convex optimization problem in an arbitrary manner.
    B. MaxMin Fairness Another fairness policy is the Max-Min(MM) fairness policy
    [37], which maximizes the minimum rate of SUs by setting U_{s} in the optimization
    problem (5) to:\begin{equation*} U_{s} = \underset{i \in \mathcal {N}}{\min} \quad
    (\mathcal {R}_{i}),\tag{23}\end{equation*} View Source where \mathcal {R}_{i}
    is defined in (16). This problem is equivalent to the following optimization problem:\begin{align*}&\underset
    {\substack {\{E_{i,1}\},\{E_{i,2}\}, \{E_{r}^{i}\},\\ \{\tau _{i,1}\}, \{\tau
    _{i,2}\}, \{\tau _{i,3}\},\\ \{x_{i}\},\{y_{i}\},\{z_{i}\}, q}}{\text {max}} \quad
    q \\&\qquad \text {subject to} \quad \mathcal {R}_{i} \geq q,\quad i\in \mathcal
    {N}, \\&\hphantom {\qquad \text {subject to} \quad }~(17{\mathrm {b}}), (17{\mathrm
    {c}}), (17{\mathrm {d}}), (17{\mathrm {e}}), \\&\hphantom {\qquad \text {subject
    to} \quad }~(17{\mathrm {f}}), (17{\mathrm {g}}), (17{\mathrm {h}}),\tag{24}\end{align*}
    View Source where \mathcal {R}_{i} is reformulated as (18) and x_{i} , y_{i} ,
    and z_{i} are updated based on Eqs. (20)–(22). Note that this resource allocation
    problem tries to achieve a nearly equal data rate for all SUs. C. Spectrum Efficiency
    A common objective in a CCR-IoTN is to maximize throughput or spectral efficiency
    (SE) of SUs. That is to maximize:\begin{equation*} U_{s} = \sum _{i \in S_{1}}
    \tau _{i} R_{iA} + \sum _{j \in S_{2}} \tau _{j} R_{jA} + \sum _{k \in S_{3}}\tau
    _{k} R_{kA}.\tag{25}\end{equation*} View Source Show All Here, we can write the
    KKT optimality conditions [36] for original problem (5) with utility function
    (25) with respect to \tau _{k} as follows:\begin{align*} -\log _{2}\left({1+\frac
    {|h_{kA}|^{2}P_{r}^{max}}{N_{0}}}\right)+\mu - \lambda _{\tau _{k}}=&0, \\ \lambda
    _{\tau _{k}}\tau _{k}=&0, \\ \lambda _{\tau _{k}}\geq&0,\tag{27}\end{align*} View
    Source where \lambda _{\tau _{k}} and \mu are the lagrangian variables associated
    with constraints C_{2} and C_{3} , respectively. Accordingly, if \tau _{k} > 0
    , we have \lambda _{\tau _{k}}=0 , and \mu =\log _{2}\left({1+\frac {|h_{kA}|^{2}P_{r}^{max}}{N_{0}}}\right)
    and if \tau _{k} = 0 , we have \lambda _{\tau _{k}} \geq 0 and \mu =\log _{2}\left({1+\frac
    {|h_{kA}|^{2}P_{r}^{max}}{N_{0}}}\right)+\lambda _{\tau _{k}} . Therefore, \tau
    _{k^{*}} > 0 for k^{*}=\mathop{\mathrm {argmax}}\limits_{k} \log _{2}\left({1+\frac
    {|h_{kA}|^{2}P_{r}^{max}}{N_{0}}}\right) and \tau _{k} = 0 for k \neq k^{*} .
    This shows that, to maximize the spectral efficiency function (25), the rewarding
    period T_{3} must be solely dedicated to one SU with the highest rate of data
    transmission to AP. Clearly, this is not a fair allocation policy. D. Energy Efficiency
    Energy efficiency (EE) is another considerable objective for resource allocation
    in CCR-IoTNs. To achieve energy efficiency, the utility function U_{s} is:\begin{equation*}
    U_{s} = \frac {\sum _{i \in S_{1}} \tau _{i} R_{iA} + \sum _{j \in S_{2}} \tau
    _{j} R_{jA} + \sum _{k \in S_{3}}\tau _{k} R_{kA}}{E_{T}},\tag{28}\end{equation*}
    View Source where \begin{equation*} E_{T} = \sum _{i \in S_{1}} E_{i}+\sum _{j
    \in S_{2}} E_{j}+P_{r}^{max} \sum _{k \in S_{3}} \tau _{k}+\sum _{j \in S_{2}}
    \sum _{r \in S_{r}} E_{r}^{j}.\tag{29}\end{equation*} View Source Similar to previous
    sections, we can reformulate the optimization problem to get the following equivalent
    problem:\begin{align*}&\underset {\substack {\{E_{i}\}, \{E_{j}\}, \{E_{r}^{j}\},\\
    \{\tau _{i}\}, \{\tau _{j}\}, \{\tau _{k}\},\\ \{x_{j}\},\{y_{j}\},\{z_{i}\},w}}{\text
    {max}} 2w\sqrt {A}-w^{2}E_{T} \\&\quad ~~\text {subject to} \quad ~(17{\mathrm
    {b}}), (17{\mathrm {c}}), (17{\mathrm {d}}), (17{\mathrm {e}}), \\&\hphantom {\quad
    ~~}~(17{\mathrm {f}}), (17{\mathrm {g}}), (17{\mathrm {h}}),\tag{30}\end{align*}
    View Source where A is the numerator of the utility function (28) and reformulated
    in (26), as shown at the bottom of the page. Parameters x_{j} , y_{j} , and z_{i}
    are updated in each step of optimization as before in (20)–(22). In addition,
    w is updated as:\begin{equation*} w=\frac {\sqrt {A}}{E_{T}}.\tag{31}\end{equation*}
    View Source Since relays consume a large amount of energy, the resource allocation
    policy optimized for EE does not tend to employ relays. Accordingly, the preferred
    transmission mode for this policy is the underlay mode. Therefore, this resource
    allocation policy does not achieve high data rates for SUs. Algorithm 1 summarizes
    the general solution to the aforementioned optimization problems. It is important
    to note that the final reformulated problems are all convex optimization problems.

    performance of our proposed hybrid resource allocation schemes in terms of throughput,
    fairness, and energy efficiency for a CRRN-based IoT network. In addition, we
    compare our proposed suboptimal algorithm with the optimal solution in the proportional
    fairness (PF) scheme. To find the optimal solution, we do an exhaustive full search.
    The simulation scenario is shown in Fig. 3. The reference distance between PS
    and PD is d=200m . The channel gains are modeled as h_{ij}=Kd_{ij}^{-\alpha }
    , where K is randomly generated according to Rayleigh distribution, d_{ij} is
    the distance between the transmitter node i and the receiver node j and \alpha
    , the path loss exponent, is set to 4 [39]. The number of SUs is considered to
    be 10. The total input noise power, including input thermal noise and input-referred
    noise of Wi-Fi 6 with noise figure of 10 dB and 200 MHz bandwidth, is set to N_{0}=10^{-11}
    W. In order to compare the performance of our hybrid scheme with the standalone
    underlay scheme, the maximum interference allowed by SUs on the primary transmission
    is set to 0.001N_{0} . FIGURE 3. Simulation scenario. Show All The SUs are uniformly
    distributed within a circle with a radius of 20m. The x coordinate of the circle’s
    center is at distance d_{s} from PS and its y coordinate is 10 m above the line
    segment between PS and PD. The access point, AP, is located 10m above the circle’s
    center, as illustrated in Fig. 3. To generate uniformly distributed random points
    within the circle, we generated polar coordinates as:\begin{equation*} r=R\sqrt
    {u}, \quad \theta =2 \pi u,\tag{32}\end{equation*} View Source where u\sim \mathrm
    {U}(0,1) , and R=20m is the circle’s radius. This is stated in cartesian coordinates
    as x=r\cos (\theta) and y=r\sin (\theta) . The simulation results are averaged
    over 1000 iterations of random channel conditions and SU distributions. For various
    conditions on the relay set, Fig. 4 shows the relay utilization rate, defined
    as the percentage of the simulation runs in which R_{coop}>\gamma R_{SD} . In
    our simulations, \gamma is set to one. For \gamma >1 , we get a lower utilization
    rate, and shorter time duration of T_{3} , hence a lower throughput. Note that
    when the relay set is empty, the hybrid underlay overlay scheme is reduced to
    the mere underlay scheme, which yields lower throughput. As it can be observed
    from Fig. 4, allowing the optimal set of relays increases the relay utilization
    rate compared to the cases where only 1, 3, or 5 relays are allowed. In addition,
    it can be observed that when SUs are close to PD, a smaller number of relays yield
    a higher utilization factor, while it is the opposite when SUs are close to PS.
    FIGURE 4. Relay utilization for various |S_{r}| . Show All Fig. 5 shows the average
    size of S_{1} , S_{2} and S_{r} versus d_{s}/d for various resource allocation
    policies, when the optimal number of relays is employed. Here, the number of relays
    is variable and is obtained through the optimization problem (13). Therefore,
    unlike |S_{1}| and |S_{2}| , |S_{r}| does not depend on the resource allocation
    policy. As expected, the size of S_{r} is reduced as SUs become closer to PD.
    The size of S_{1} and S_{2} in the first three resource allocation policies, i.e.,
    SE, EE, and PF, is considerably small. Moreover, there is no significant change
    in their behavior when SUs move from near PS to near PD. However, the size of
    S_{1} and S_{2} are relatively higher in MM especially when d_{s}/d is large.
    In MM, the size of S_{1} is relatively larger than the size of S_{2} . This is
    because the interference at AP is due to the PS’s transmission to relay nodes
    in the first subframe, while it is due to the relay nodes located in the vicinity
    of AP in the second subframe. FIGURE 5. The average size of S_{1} , S_{2} and
    S_{r} for various resource allocation problems when an optimal number of relays
    is used. Show All Fig. 6 illustrates the average size of S_{1} and S_{2} versus
    d_{s}/d for various resource allocation frameworks when an arbitrary number of
    relays is used. It is observed that the average size of S_{1} and S_{2} in all
    resource allocation frameworks is decreased as the size of S_{r} is increased.
    The highest number of SUs transmitting in underlay mode belongs to the MM framework
    in Subframe T_{1} . FIGURE 6. The Average size of S_{1} and S_{2} for various
    resource allocation problems when an arbitrary number of relay is used. Show All
    The throughput of SUs for various resource allocation problems is shown in Fig.
    7. For each resource allocation problem, the throughput of SUs is computed for
    the optimal number of relays. For comparison, Fig. 7 shows the throughput of standalone
    underlay mode as well. In all cases, the hybrid overlay-underlay scheme outperforms
    the standalone underlay scheme for secondary spectrum access in terms of the achieved
    throughput. As one might expect, the resource allocation problem with spectrum
    efficiency as its objective function achieves the highest throughput for various
    values of d_{s}/d , while the energy efficiency-based resource allocation achieves
    a very low transmission rate. The optimal solution of the PF scenario is obtained
    by exhaustive search is also depicted in Fig. 7. Our suboptimal solution in the
    PF scenario is very close to the optimal. The simulation results are averaged
    over the cases where there is a non-empty relay set as well as those with an empty
    relay set in which SUs transmit only in the underlay mode. FIGURE 7. Throughput
    of SUs for various resource allocation problems. Show All The energy efficiencies
    of various resource allocation policies are compared in Fig. 8. When the optimal
    number of relays are used, the highest energy efficiency belongs to the EE framework.
    The SE, PF, and MM are ranked next. The underlay spectrum access schemes (not
    shown in Fig. 8) have a significantly low energy consumption in all cases, hence
    a high energy efficiency. The performance of the optimal solution of the PF scheme
    is close to the proposed PF algorithm. In general, as SUs get closer to PD, the
    energy efficiency increases because the number of relay nodes decreases, and then
    SUs consume lower energy to relay data to PD. FIGURE 8. Energy efficiency for
    various resource allocation problems. Show All In order to compare the fairness
    among SUs, we use Jain’s fairness index [38] as follows:\begin{equation*} \text
    {Fairness Index} = \frac {\left({\sum _{i=0}^{n}{R_{i}}}\right)^{2}}{n\sum _{i=0}^{n}{R_{i}}^{2}}.\tag{33}\end{equation*}
    View Source The result ranges from the worst case of 1/n (which corresponds to
    the case where only one user transmits) to 1 (which corresponds to the case where
    all users receive the same rate). Fig. 9 illustrates the throughput fairness index
    for various resource allocation frameworks. The highest fairness index for all
    values of d_{s}/d belongs to MM. The performance of PF is similar to that of MM
    for small values of d_{s}/d but becomes worse as d_{s}/d increases. The fairness
    indexes of both SE and EE are near minimum. FIGURE 9. Fairness index for various
    resource allocation problems. Show All In Fig. 10, three evaluation criteria including
    throughput, fairness and energy efficiency are shown for two different strategies
    applied to the third subframe T_{3} , namely free T_{3} and equal T_{3} . In the
    first strategy, the time slot allocated to each SU is determined by the resource
    allocation problem. The second strategy, however, always assigns equal time slots
    to all SUs. As shown in Fig. 10a, the free T_{3} strategy outperforms the equal
    T_{3} strategy with respect to spectrum deficiency (SE). This is justifiable since
    the aim of the SE problem is to maximize the sum rate of throughput and there
    is a higher degree of freedom when the allocated time to each SU in the third
    subframe is obtained through the optimization problem rather than being constant.
    Earlier, we showed using KKT that only one SU transmits during T_{3} , when employing
    the free T_{3} strategy. This does not hold for the other problems. There is no
    significant difference between the two strategies for EE, PF, and MM problems.
    In Fig. 10b, we can see that the equal T_{3} strategy achieves a higher fairness
    index compared to free T_{3} for SE and EE frameworks. This is expected since
    dividing the subframe T_{3} equally introduces a level of fairness to these resource
    allocation frameworks. However, the fairness index is similar in PF and MM schemes
    for both strategies, since the fairness consideration is already taken into account
    in these frameworks. In Fig. 10c, both strategies have a similar impact on the
    performance of EE, PF, and MM. For SE, the equal T_{3} strategy yields a higher
    energy efficiency than the free T_{3} strategy. FIGURE 10. Comparison of equal
    and free T_{3} strategies in various resource allocation problems with optimal
    \{S_{r}\} . Show All Fig. 11 illustrates the allocated time to subframes T_{1},
    T_{2} , and T_{3} in various optimizations, all employing the optimal number of
    relays. As shown, the allocated time to T_{1} increases as SUs get closer to PD.
    This happens because when SUs get farther from PS, the path loss increase, hence
    they need more time in the first subframe to preserve the rate. The time allocated
    to the second subframe, T_{2} , in the EE resource allocation problem is higher
    than its counterparts for all values of d_{s}/d . Therefore the allocated time
    to the third subframe is very short in this problem compared to the other problems.
    FIGURE 11. Allocated subframes in various optimization problems employing the
    optimal number of relays. Show All Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 respectively show the throughput
    and the time slots allocated to SUs for the sample case of d_{s}/d=0.7 . It can
    be seen that in SE based resource allocation, there is a significant difference
    in the way the rate is allocated to each SU in the Equal and Free T_{3} strategies.
    In Equal T_{3} , the third subframe is equally divided to all SUs; hence all SUs
    experience an almost equal rate based on their channel condition. In Free T_{3}
    , however, the whole subframe is totally devoted to one SU that has the best channel
    condition to transmit to AP. FIGURE 12. Throughput of SUs in a sample simulation.
    Show All FIGURE 13. Allocated subframe to each SU in a sample simulation. Show
    All To analyze the complexity of our proposed algorithm, we divide the algorithm
    into two parts; One part for finding the optimal relay set and the other part
    for solving the convex optimization problem (17) for PF or (24) for MM. The complexity
    of finding the optimal relay set by binary search is \mathcal {O}(\log {\mathcal
    {N}}) . In the second part, we use direct fractional programming approach, which
    converges in a few iterations. For example, Fig. 14 shows the number of algorithm
    iterations for PF scheme for d_{s}/d=0.1 . On each box, the central mark indicates
    the median, and the bottom and top edges of the box indicate the 25th and 75th
    percentiles, respectively. The whiskers extend to the most extreme data points
    not considered outliers, and the outliers are plotted individually using the ''+''
    symbol. Besides, direct fractional programming method [30] needs to solve an interior-point
    problem in each iteration, which its complexity for self-concordance functions
    is \mathcal {O}(\sqrt {m}) where m is the number of inequality constraints [36].
    The maximum number of inequality constraints in our problem is \mathcal {O}(\mathcal
    {N}^{2}) . So, the complexity of the interior-point problem is \mathcal {O}(\mathcal
    {N}) . We run some simulation on an Intel Ⓡ Core (TM) i7- 4790k CPU @4.00GHz 32.0GB
    RAM to compute the run-time of fractional programming part for various number
    of SUs as shown in Fig. 15. Then the complexity of our algorithm is estimated
    to be at most \mathcal {O}(\mathcal {N}^{2}) . FIGURE 14. Number of resource allocation
    algorithm iterations for PF scheme and d_{s}/d = 0.1 . Show All FIGURE 15. Run-time
    of resource allocation algorithm for PF scheme. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper has proposed two fair resource allocation frameworks for CCR based
    IoT networks to address the ever-increasing demand for radio spectrum in IoT devices.
    The hybrid overlay-underlay scheme is employed to provide a stable transmission
    of SUs with an acceptable throughput. We have reformulated the inherently nonconvex
    optimization problems as convex problems by separating the integer programming
    phase of relay set selection and using quadratic transform to convert the multiple-ratio
    fractional problems. The proposed suboptimal solution of the PF scheme is very
    close to the optimal solution, as shown by the simulations. Simulation results
    present a comparison between the proposed frameworks in terms of throughput, energy
    efficiency, and fairness with common frameworks such as spectrum efficiency, energy
    efficiency, mere underlay, and equal division of the reward subframe. It is shown
    that the proportional fairness framework offers an almost identical throughput
    to all SU users and maintaining total throughput and energy efficiency. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    of Things (IoT) paradigm expands the current Internet and enables communication
    through machine to machine, while posing new challenges. Cognitive radio (CR)
    Systems have received much attention over the last decade, because of their ability
    to flexibly adapt their transmission parameters to their changing environment.
    Current technology trends are shifting to the adaptability of cognitive radio
    networks into IoT. The determination of the appropriate transmission parameters
    for a given wireless channel environment is the main feature of a cognitive radio
    engine. For wireless multicarrier transceivers, the problem becomes high dimensional
    due to the large number of decision variables required. Evolutionary algorithms
    are suitable techniques to solve the above-mentioned problem. In this paper, we
    design a CR engine for wireless multicarrier transceivers using real-coded biogeography-based
    optimization (RCBBO). The CR engine also uses a fuzzy decision maker for obtaining
    the best compromised solution. RCBBO uses a mutation operator in order to improve
    the diversity of the population and enhance the exploration ability of the original
    BBO algorithm. The simulation results show that the RCBBO driven CR engine can
    obtain better results than the original BBO and outperform results from the literature.
    Moreover, RCBBO is more efficient when applied to high-dimensional problems in
    cases of multicarrier system. Similar content being viewed by others Cognitive

    Techniques Article 01 March 2019 1 Introduction In recent years, there is a rapid
    development of wireless communications and a widespread adoption of devices (smartphones,
    tablets, laptops) which are running demanding applications. As a result, the need
    for additional wireless spectrum has been dramatically increasing, leading to
    the spectrum scarcity problem. Furthermore, advanced software applications impose
    high data throughput and reliable connections and at the same time there is a
    big necessity to design eco-friendly systems. Additionally, a study of electromagnetic
    spectrum utilization by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [37] has reported
    that on an average, there is a 10% of the allocated spectrum that is used. Most
    of the spectrum bands are only utilized for limited time and in limited places.
    The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm describes communication not only human to
    human (H2H) but also machine to machine (M2M) without the need of human interference.
    Recently Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) supports M2M communications (called
    LTE-M) [28]. Moreover, the IoT nodes are assumed to be interconnected using cellular
    or other wireless communication technologies. However, the need for spectrum resource
    for IoT applications is becoming significant. Such an issue can be addressed using
    smart IoT objects that will have cognitive capabilities [20, 34]. Current technology
    trends are shifting to the adaptability of Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) [3,
    11] into IoT. Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising technique which has been proposed
    as the technology which can effectively cope with that problem [15]. Mitola suggested
    that CR systems have the ability to monitor and detect the conditions of their
    operating environment, and reconfigure their transmission parameters in order
    to provide the best service which satisfies the users demands [23, 24]. The CR
    system is informed about its operating environment by the environmental parameters
    which also determine the effectiveness and the accuracy of the decisions made
    by the system. Moreover, it is worth noting that in order to determine the possible
    directions of the system, we must define the performance objectives which will
    be satisfied by it. Although the primary objective of dynamic spectrum access
    is to improve spectrum utilization efficiency, there are additional objectives
    that should be satisfied like the bit-error-rate (BER) minimization, the throughput
    maximization, the power consumption minimization, and the interference minimization.
    Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are suitable techniques for solving the problem
    of reconfiguring the transmission parameters according to certain performance
    objectives. The optimization of CR systems has been performed in the literature
    using several evolutionary optimization techniques. Among others these approaches
    include Genetic Algorithms (GA) [14, 25,26,27, 45], Particle Swarm Optimization
    (PSO) [39, 44], or Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [46]. Additionally, multi-objective
    EAs have also been used to the CR problem [7, 29]. A survey of all these techniques
    can be found in [30]. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) [38] is an evolutionary
    algorithm based on mathematical models that describe how species migrate from
    one island to another, how new species arise, and how species become extinct.
    The way the problem solution is found is analogous to natures way of distributing
    species. The BBO algorithm has been applied successfully to several real world
    engineering problems [2, 4, 5, 13, 16, 17, 22, 33, 36]. The authors have applied
    the original BBO algorithm to antenna design problems in [13], where antenna arrays
    are optimized. In order to improve the diversity of the population and enhance
    the exploration ability of BBO, a modified BBO approach referred to as real-coded
    BBO (RCBBO) is proposed in [12]. The authors in [18] use the original BBO algorithm
    for CR system optimization. It must be pointed out that EAs like BBO could also
    be hardware implemented like in [19] using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)
    in order to work faster online. In this paper, the CR system will be optimized
    using three different RCBBO algorithms: RCBBO-G (Gauss mutation), RCBBO-C (Cauchy
    mutation) and RCBBO-L (Levy mutation). Additionally, to evaluate the algorithms
    performance we compare the different RCBBO algorithms with the original BBO algorithm
    as well as with results from the literature. The novelty in our work lies in the
    fact that we propose a novel CR engine framework based on RCBBO and fuzzy decision
    making. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the RCBBO algorithm
    is applied to the cognitive radio engine problem. Furthermore, we use five different
    objective functions for multi-carrier systems optimization instead of three commonly
    found in the literature. This paper contributes also to performance comparison
    of different algorithms to the cognitive radio engine design problem for both
    single carrier and multi-carrier systems using non-parametric statistical tests.
    Moreover, to the best of the authors knowledge, it is the first time that simulation
    results are given for a CR engine with more than 64 carriers. The simulation results
    show that RCBBO algorithms achieve better performance than the BBO algorithm.
    The simulation results are finally combined with a fuzzy decision maker in order
    to find the best compromised solution. The rest of this paper is organized as
    follows. The related work is briefly discussed in Sect. 2. We describe the problem
    formulation in Sect. 3. The details of the BBO and the RCBBO algorithms are given
    in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we present the simulation numerical results. Finally, the
    conclusion is given in Sect. 6. 2 Related Work In [40] a cognitive management
    framework for IoT is proposed, in which dynamically changing real-world objects
    are represented in a virtualized environment. A new IoT paradigm is defined in
    [41] named cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT). The definition of CIoT according
    to the authors is that it is an brain-empowered enhancement of IoT by integrating
    the cognition process into the system design. Additionally, the authors provide
    an operational framework of CIoT that characterizes the fundamental cognitive
    tasks and address the key enabling techniques involved in the cognitive tasks.
    In the same context, following the CIoT paradigm the authors in [32] propose a
    new MAC protocol for cognitive IoT devices. Moreover, they address the topic of
    applications of the CR technology for IoT and propose new and effective solutions
    to the real challenges in CR technology. Their conclusion is that applications
    like social media and chess or card playing, which are not delay-sensitive could
    benefit for such an intelligent MAC protocol with CR features. A convergent solution
    of IoT and CR is the topic of another paper [1]. The authors propose a novel low-cost
    cooperative spectrum sensing solution, which they have integrated to an Internet
    architecture called NovaGenesis. Moreover, the authors provide an experimental
    proof-of-concept that demonstrates the convergence of IoT and CR. The connection
    between IoT and CR is the topic of two recent papers [20, 34]. In [34] the authors
    present a review paper that looks for novel approaches and discusses research
    challenges related to the use of cognitive radio technology for IoT. Moreover,
    the authors focus on cognitive radio in the context of M2M communications and
    IoT. The goal of the authors in [20] is to study how CR can be helpful for IoT.
    They elaborate on spectrum sensing in conjunction with cloud services, which may
    provide a self-reconfigurable IoT paradigm. Several papers can be found in the
    literature that use a single objective weighted sum approach. In this case, the
    multiple objectives are weighted independently to generate a single objective
    fitness function which is simple and easy to implement. In other cases, the multiple
    objectives are optimized using a multi-objective EA. Newman presented the problem
    in his Ph.D. thesis in [25]. He defined a common set of eight transmission parameters
    and six environment parameters used by cognitive radios, and developed a set of
    preliminary fitness functions that encompass the relationships between a small
    set of these input and output parameters. Additionally, he used rule-based optimization
    techniques to make operating parameter decisions. The authors in [26] presented
    a genetic-algorithm driven, cognitive radio decision engine that determines the
    optimal radio transmission parameters for single and multicarrier systems, they
    gave a set of single carrier and multicarrier fitness functions for their GA implementation.
    Another GA approach is given in [27] where the authors present a population adaptation
    technique for genetic algorithms that takes advantage of the information from
    previous cognition cycles in order to reduce the time required to reach an optimal
    decision. In another paper [6] the authors apply several approaches designed to
    enhance the convergence time and/or improve the performance results of genetic
    algorithm based search engine for cognitive radio networks. Their paper includes
    techniques such as population adaptation, variable quantization, variable adaptation,
    and multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA). Another popular algorithm used
    for such problems is PSO. Tan et al. in [39] use the PSO algorithm to provide
    a fast decision for the CR radio when facing unknown wireless situations. Moreover,
    they utilize a case database, which is also integrated into the architecture to
    improve the response speed and knowledge accumulating ability of the CR. In [44]
    a CR engine based on Binary Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (BCPSO) is presented.
    The authors compare results of the BCPSO with a GA and Binary PSO (BPSO). Additionally,
    the authors in [46] apply a mutated ant colony optimization (MACO) for CR engine
    optimization. They use three fitness functions and apply the optimization procedure
    for 10 sub-carriers. BBO is applied to the same problem for a single carrier case
    in [18]. The authors results showed that BBO outperformed results given by an
    GA. A multi-objective EA approach is given in [29] where the authors propose a
    non-dominated front searching algorithm based on user preference (NFSA-UP). They
    optimize a 64-subcarrier system and they compare performance with other multi-objective
    EAs like NSGA-II. A comparative performance of genetic algorithm, particle swarm
    optimization, differential evolution, bacterial foraging optimization, artificial
    bee colony optimization and cat swarm optimization algorithm is given in [30].
    Each algorithm is tested in single and multicarrier communication systems (64
    subcarriers). 3 Problem Formulation The basic concept of a cognitive engine is
    real-time tuning of transmission parameters according to the environment information.
    Therefore, first the environmental and the transmission parameters should be defined.
    The environmental parameters are the inputs for the cognitive engine in order
    to make a decision about the transmission parameters. The optimization problem
    may therefore defined by searching for the best possible transmission parameters
    subject to the known environmental parameters. The environmental parameters used
    in this paper are the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), bit error rate (\({\textit{BER}}\)),
    and background noise power (N) [25]. The transmission parameters are the unknowns
    or the decision variables (\({\textit{SIVs}}\) in case of BBO) of the cognitive
    radio engine. The list of the transmission parameters is shown in Table 1 [18].
    From Table 1 it is worth noting that the modulation type used in our system is
    Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), for \({\textit{modulation index}}=2\), Quadrature
    Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), for \({\textit{modulation index}}=4\), and Quadrature
    Amplitude Modulation (QAM), for \({\textit{modulation index}}>4\). Table 1 Transmission
    parameters Full size table 3.1 Cognitive Radio Engine Objectives The five objective
    functions used in this section are formulated in [18] and kept the same for comparison
    reasons. The total fitness is obtained by summing the objective functions using
    suitable weight values. The single objective fitness functions for a CR system
    with L independent subcarriers are described below: The objective function of
    power consumption minimization is expressed as [18] $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{\min
    {\textit{power}}}}(\bar{P})=\frac{\sum \nolimits _{i=1}^{L}{{{P}_{i}}}}{L\times
    {{P}_{\max }}} \end{aligned}$$ (1) where \({{P_i}}\) is the transmitted power
    on the i-th subcarrier, and \({{P}_{\max }}\) is the maximum available transmit
    power, and \(\bar{P}=({{P}_{1}},{{P}_{2}}, \ldots , {{P}_{L}})\) is the vector
    of the transmitted power. The objective function of BER minimization is defined
    as [18] $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{\min {\textit{ber}}}}(\bar{P},\bar{M})=\frac{{{\log
    }_{10}}(0.5)}{{{\log }_{10}}\left( \frac{\sum \nolimits _{i=1}^{L}{Pb{{e}_{i}}({{M}_{i}},{{P}_{i}})}}{L}
    \right) } \end{aligned}$$ (2) where \({{M}_{i}}\) is the modulation index on the
    i-th subcarrier, \(\bar{M}=({{M}_{1}},{{M}_{2}}, \ldots , {{M}_{L}})\) is the
    vector of the modulation indices and For BPSK modulation the BER is defined as
    [31] $$\begin{aligned} Pb{{e}_{i}}({{P}_{i}})=Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{{{P}_{i}}}{{{N}_{0}}}}
    \right) \end{aligned}$$ (3) Also for M-ary PSK the BER is expressed as [31] $$\begin{aligned}
    Pb{{e}_{i}}({{P}_{i}},{{M}_{i}})=\left( \frac{2}{{{\log }_{2}}{{M}_{i}}} \right)
    Q\left( \sqrt{2{{\log }_{2}}\left( {{M}_{i}} \right) \times \frac{{{P}_{i}}}{{{N}_{0}}}\times
    \sin \frac{\pi }{{{M}_{i}}}} \right) \end{aligned}$$ (4) Additionally, for M-ary
    QAM modulation the BER is given by [31] $$\begin{aligned} Pb{{e}_{i}}({{P}_{i}},{{M}_{i}})=\left(
    \frac{4}{{{\log }_{2}}{{M}_{i}}} \right) \left( 1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{{{M}_{i}}}} \right)
    Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{3{{\log }_{2}}\left( {{M}_{i}} \right) {{P}_{i}}}{\left( {{M}_{i}}-1
    \right) {{N}_{0}}}} \right) \end{aligned}$$ (5) We assume that \({{N}_{0}}=-104\)
    dBm as set in previous papers in order to compare results. The objective function
    of throughput maximization is defined as [25] $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{\max {\textit{throughput}}}}\left(
    {\bar{M}} \right) =1-\frac{{{\log }_{2}}\left( \frac{\sum \nolimits _{i=1}^{L}{{{M}_{i}}}}{L}
    \right) }{{{\log }_{2}}\left( {{M}_{\max }} \right) } \end{aligned}$$ (6) where
    \({{M}_{\max }}\) is the maximum modulation index. The objective function of interference
    minimization is given by [18] $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{\min {\textit{interference}}}}\left(
    \bar{P},\bar{B},\bar{T}\bar{D}\bar{D} \right) =\frac{\sum \nolimits _{i=1}^{L}{\left[
    \left( {{P}_{i}}\times {{B}_{i}}\times TD{{D}_{i}} \right) -\left( {{P}_{\min
    }}\times {{B}_{\min }} \right) \right] }}{L\left( {{P}_{\max }}\times {{B}_{\max
    }}\times 100 \right) } \end{aligned}$$ (7) where \({{B}_{i}}\) and are the bandwidth
    and the time division duplexing on the i-th subcarrier respectively, \(\bar{B}=({{B}_{1}},{{B}_{2}},
    \ldots ,{{B}_{L}})\), \(\overline{TDD}=(TD{{D}_{1}},TD{{D}_{2}}, \ldots ,TD{{D}_{L}})\)
    are the corresponding vectors of bandwidth and time division duplexing respectively,
    and \({{B}_{\min }}\), \({{B}_{\max }}\) are the minimum and maximum bandwidths
    available. The objective function of spectral efficiency maximization is expressed
    as [18] $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{\max {\textit{specteff}}}}\left( \bar{M},\bar{B},{{{\bar{R}}}_{s}}
    \right) =1-\frac{\sum \nolimits _{i=1}^{L}{\frac{{{M}_{i}}{{R}_{s,i}}{{B}_{\min
    }}}{{{M}_{\max }}{{R}_{s,\max }}{{B}_{i}}}}}{L} \end{aligned}$$ (8) where \({{R}_{s,i}}\)
    is the symbol rate on the i-th subcarrier, \({{R}_{s}}=({{R}_{s}}_{,1},{{R}_{s,}}_{2},
    \ldots ,{{R}_{s,}}_{L})\) is the corresponding vector of the symbol rate and \({{R}_{s,\max
    }}\) is the maximum symbol rate. The above described objective functions could
    sum in order to create a total objective function. The requirement to fulfill
    multiple objectives has lead to the use of a weighted sum approach. Therefore,
    a total objective function may be defined according to the following sum [25]
    $$\begin{aligned} {{F}_{{\textit{total}}}}(\bar{x})=\sum \limits _{i=1}^{k}{{{w}_{i}}{{F}_{i}}(\bar{x})}
    \end{aligned}$$ (9) where k is the number of objective functions, and \({{w}_{1}},{{w}_{2}},
    \ldots {{w}_{k}}\), \(0\le {{w}_{i}}\le 1\) for \(i=1,2,\ldots k\) are suitable
    weight values subject to \({{w}_{1}}+{{w}_{2}}+\cdots +{{w}_{k}}=1\). As a result,
    we may express the multiple objective fitness function for a CR system with N
    independent subcarriers [25] $$\begin{aligned} \begin{array}{l} {F_{{\textit{multicarrier}}}}\left(
    {\bar{P},\bar{M},\bar{B},\overline{TDD} ,{{\bar{R}}_s}} \right) = {w_1}{F_{\min
    - {\textit{power}}}}(\bar{P}) + {w_2}{F_{\min - ber}}(\bar{P},\bar{M}) \\ \quad
    +\, {w_3}{F_{\max - {\textit{throughput}}}}\left( {\bar{M}} \right) + {w_4}{F_{\min
    - {\textit{interference}}}}\left( {\bar{P},\bar{B},\overline{TDD} } \right) \\
    \quad +\, {w_5}{F_{\max - {\textit{specteff}}}}\left( {\bar{M},\bar{B},{{\bar{R}}_s}}
    \right) \end{array} \end{aligned}$$ (10) The weights \({{w}_{1}},{{w}_{2}},{{w}_{3}},{{w}_{4}},{{w}_{5}}\)
    define the search direction of the evolutionary algorithm and must conform to
    the limitations of (13). Table 2 holds five different weight vectors that represent
    different scenarios of the CR engine configuration. Each weight vector emphasizes
    on different performance objective. This fact leads the evolutionary algorithms
    to a solution set that is related to a specific scenario. We have chosen these
    weight values based on a trial and error procedure. We have found that better
    solutions can be obtained using these weight values. Additionally, in order to
    evaluate the choice of equal weights the balanced mode scenario has been also
    selected for comparison reasons. Please note that the weight values taken are
    different than those in [18, 25]. Table 2 Weighting values Full size table 3.2
    Best Compromised Solution In order to choose the best compromised solution from
    the set of solutions a suitable decision maker has to be used. The fuzzy set theory
    has been used as a decision maker in several applications in the literature like
    transportation planning, vendor selection, etc. [8]. The satisfaction degree of
    each objective function is represented by a linear fuzzy membership function expressed
    as $$\begin{aligned} {\mu _k} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 &{} \quad if\, \,
    {z_k} \le z_k^{\min }\\ \frac{{z_k^{\max } - {z_k}}}{{z_k^{\max } - z_k^{\min
    }}} &{}\quad if \, \, z_k^{\min }< {z_k} < z_k^{\max } \\ 0 &{}\quad if\, \, {z_k}
    \ge z_k^{\max } \end{array} \right. \end{aligned}$$ (11) where \({{z}_{k}}\) is
    the value of k-th objective function, \(z_{k}^{\min }\), \(z_{k}^{\max }\) are
    the minimum and maximum value of the k-th objective function respectively. The
    best compromised solution is found by using $$\begin{aligned} s=\frac{1}{{{n}_{obj}}}\sum
    \limits _{k=1}^{{{n}_{obj}}}{{{\mu }_{k}}} \end{aligned}$$ (12) where \({{n}_{obj}}\)
    is the number of objectives, and s is the degree of satisfaction. For each solution,
    we calculate the value of s. The point with the maximum s value is the best compromised
    solution. 4 Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) The mathematical models of Biogeography
    are based on the work of Robert MacArthur and Edward Wilson in the early 1960s.
    Using this model, they have been able to predict the number of species in a habitat.
    The habitat is an area that is geographically isolated from other habitats. The
    geographical areas that are well suited as residences for biological species are
    said to have a high habitat suitability index (HSI). Therefore, every habitat
    is characterized by the HSI which depends on factors like rainfall, diversity
    of vegetation, diversity of topographic features, land area, and temperature.
    Each of the features that characterize habitability is known as suitability index
    variables (SIV). In BBO a solution to the D-dimensional problem can be represented
    as a vector of SIV variables \({{\left[ SI{{V}_{1}},SI{{V}_{2}}, \ldots SI{{V}_{D}}
    \right] }^{\mathrm{T}}}\), which is a habitat or island. The SIV variables represent
    the vector of the unknown variables \({\mathbf {x}}={{\left[ {{x}_{1}},{{x}_{2}},
    \ldots ,{{x}_{D}} \right] }^{\mathrm{T}}}\). The value of HSI of a habitat is
    the value of the objective function that corresponds to that solution and it is
    found by: $$\begin{aligned} HSI = F\left( {{\textit{habitat}}} \right) = F(SI{V_1},SI{V_2},
    \ldots \,SI{V_M}) \end{aligned}$$ (13) Habitats with a high HSI are good solutions
    of the objective function, while poor solutions are those habitats with a low
    HSI. The habitats with high HSI are those that have large population and high
    emigration rate \(\xi\). For these habitats, the immigration rate \(\lambda\)
    is low. The poor solutions are those that low HSI, which means they have high
    immigration rate \(\lambda\) and low emigration rate \(\xi\). The immigration
    and emigration rates are functions of the number of species in the habitats. These
    are given by: $$\begin{aligned} {{\xi }_{k}}=\, & {} E\left( \frac{k}{{{S}_{\max
    }}} \right) \end{aligned}$$ (14) $$\begin{aligned} {{\lambda }_{k}}=\, & {} I\left(
    1-\frac{k}{{{S}_{\max }}} \right) \end{aligned}$$ (15) where I is the maximum
    possible immigration rate, E is the maximum possible emigration rate, k is the
    rank of the given candidate solution, and \({{S}_{\max }}\) is the maximum number
    of species (e.g. population size). That is the best candidate solution has a rank
    of \({{S}_{\max }}\) and the worst candidate solution has a rank of one. BBO uses
    both mutation and migration operators. The application of these operators to each
    SIV in each solution is decided probabilistically. Each generation, there is a
    probability \({{P}_{\bmod }}\) \(\in [0,1]\) that each candidate solution will
    be modified by migration. \({{P}_{\bmod }}\) is a user-defined parameter that
    is typically set to a value close to one, and is analogous to crossover probability
    in GAs. The migration for NP habitats can be described in Algorithm 1. The \({{X}_{i}}\)
    in the above algorithm is habitat i. The information sharing between habitats
    is accomplished using the immigration and emigration rate. The \({{\lambda }_{i}}\)
    is proportional to the probability that SIVs from neighbouring habitats will migrate
    into habitat \({{X}_{i}}\). The \({{\xi }_{i}}\) is proportional to the probability
    that SIVs from habitat \({{X}_{i}}\) will migrate into neighboring habitats. The
    mutation rate m of a solution S is defined to be inversely proportional to the
    solution probability and it is given by: $$\begin{aligned} {{m}_{S}}={{m}_{\max
    }}\left( \frac{1-{{P}_{s}}}{{{P}_{\max }}} \right) \end{aligned}$$ (16) where
    \({{P}_{s}}\) is the probability that a habitat contains S species, \({{P}_{\max
    }}\) is the maximum \({{P}_{s}}\) value over all \(s \in [1,{{S}_{\max }}]\),
    and \({{m}_{\max }}\) is a user-defined parameter. Simon in [38] described how
    \({{P}_{s}}\) changes from time t to time \(t+\Delta t\) as: $$\begin{aligned}
    {{P}_{s}}(t+\Delta t)={{P}_{s}}(t)\left( 1-{{\lambda }_{s}}\Delta t-{{\mu }_{s}}\Delta
    t \right) +{{P}_{s-1}}(t){{\lambda }_{s-1}}\Delta t+{{P}_{s+1}}(t){{\mu }_{s+1}}\Delta
    t \end{aligned}$$ (17) The mutation procedure is described in Algorithm 2. The
    \({{m}_{i}}\) in Algorithm 2 is the mutation rate of solution i. As with other
    evolutionary algorithms, BBO also incorporates elitism. This is implemented with
    a user-selected elitism parameter p. This means that the p best phase vectors
    remain from one generation to the other. 4.1 Real-Coded BBO (RCBBO) RCBBO [12]
    uses a mutation operator, which is common in several EAs [21, 35, 42, 43]. For
    example, the Evolutionary Programming (EP) [42] algorithm uses the mutation operator
    as the main operator. Although RCBBO is almost identical to BBO, there is a significant
    difference between them: the mutation operator is integrated into RCBBO in order
    to improve the diversity of the population and enhance the exploration ability
    of the algorithm. The mutation operator used for the different RCBBO versions
    can be one of the following forms [12]: 1. Gaussian mutation: $$\begin{aligned}
    X_{i}^{''}\left( j \right) ={{X}_{i}}\left( j \right) +{{N}_{j}}\left( 0,1 \right)
    \end{aligned}$$ (18) where \({{X}_{i}}\left( j \right)\)is the j-th SIV of the
    i-th habitat and \({{N}_{j}}\left( 0,1 \right)\) indicates a random number generated
    from a Gaussian distribution. 2. Cauchy mutation: $$\begin{aligned} X_{i}^{''}\left(
    j \right) ={{X}_{i}}\left( j \right) +{{\delta }_{j}}\left( t \right) \end{aligned}$$
    (19) where \({{\delta }_{j}}(t)\) indicates a random number generated from a Cauchy
    distribution with \(t=1\). 3. Levy mutation: $$\begin{aligned} X_{i}^{''}\left(
    j \right) ={{X}_{i}}\left( j \right) +{{L}_{j}}\left( a, c \right) \end{aligned}$$
    (20) where \({{L}_{j}}\left( 0.8 \right)\)indicates a random number generated
    from a Levy distribution [21] with \(c =1,\,\,a=0.8\). RCBBO uses a modified algorithm
    for mutation which is given in Algorithm 3 where in Algorithm 3 the mutated \(X_{i}^{''}(j)\)
    depends on the RCBBO version. The RCBBO algorithm is outlined below: 1. Initialize
    the RCBBO control parameters. Map the problem solutions to phase vectors and habitats.
    Set the habitat modification probability \({{P}_{\bmod }}\), the maximum immigration
    rate I, the maximum emigration rate E, the maximum migration rate \({{m}_{\max
    }}\) and the elitism parameter p (if elitism is desired). Set the jumping rate
    \({{j}_{r}}\) and the opposition probability \({p}_{o}\). 2. Initialize a random
    population of NP habitats from a uniform distribution. Set the number of generations
    G to one. 3. Evaluate objective function value. 4. Map the HSI value to the number
    of species S. That is sort the population from most fit to least fit and then
    assign a rank or number to species from 1 (best) to NP (worst). Calculate the
    immigration rate \({{\lambda }_{k}}\), the emigration rate \({{\xi }_{k}}\) for
    each solution of the population. 5. Generate a new child population of NP habitats,
    which is originally the same as the parent population. 6. Apply the migration
    operator for each non-elite habitat based on immigration and emigration rates
    using (14) and (15). 7. Apply the mutation operator according to Algorithm 3.
    8. Evaluate objective function value. 9. Sort the population according to the
    HSI value from best to worst. 10. Apply elitism by replacing the p worst habitats
    of the previous generation with the p best ones. 11. Repeat step 4 until the maximum
    number of generations \({{G}_{\max }}\) or the maximum number of objective function
    evaluations is reached. Therefore, depending on the operator, three different
    algorithms can be defined RCBBO-G (Gauss mutation), RCBBO-C (Cauchy mutation)
    and RCBBO-L (Levy mutation). 5 Numerical Results In this paper, we compare results
    for a single carrier and multiple subcarriers using all BBO algorithms and results
    from the literature. We compare the three RCBBO versions with the original BBO
    algorithm on the five objective functions presented in the previous section. All
    algorithms ran for 20 independent trials. A population of 200 vectors was selected.
    The total number of iterations was set to 60 and 100 for one and multiple subcarriers
    respectively. The stopping criterion was the iteration number. For all BBO algorithms,
    we set the habitat modification probability, \({{P}_{\bmod }}\), to 1 and the
    maximum mutation rate, \({{m}_{\max }}\), equal to 0.01. The maximum immigration
    rate I, and the maximum emigration rate E are both set to one. The elitism size
    is set to two for all algorithms. 5.1 Single Carrier System In the results that
    follow, the different weight factor scenarios are analyzed and reported. The first
    design example is that of a single subcarrier using the total fitness given in
    (10) with different weight scenarios. The total fitness values for five algorithms
    vs the objective functions are listed in Table 3. It can be noticed that the RCBBO-C,
    RCBBO-G, and RCBBO-L algorithms obtain similar results in all the cases. The minimum
    value per objective function is preserved among the three aforementioned algorithms.
    Table 3 Single carrier system Full size table In Table 4, the minimum power consumed
    obective function value results for different weight factor scenarios are presented
    for all the algorithms. It can be noted that the total score of the GA is better
    compared to the other algorithms. Thus, the GA gives an improved performance for
    the minimum power consumption objective. Furthermore, the three RCBBO algorithms
    have quite similar performance in all cases. The original BBO outperforms the
    RCBBO algorithms in four out the five cases. Table 4 Single carrier system Full
    size table Table 5 reports the minimum BER obective function value for different
    weight scenarios. In this case the three RCBBO algorithms have similar performance
    in three out the five cases, outperforming the GA and the original BBO. Moreover,
    the GA presents the worst results in this case. It is interesting to notice that
    the equal weights case present a low objective function value that again all RCBBO
    algorithms obtain the same. Table 5 Single carrier system Full size table Additionally,
    Table 6 holds the minimum interference objective function value results for different
    weight vectors. In this case RCBBO-C and RCBBO-L obtain the best values among
    the other algorithms. The GA is better only in one case, while the original BBO
    fails to obtain a best result for these cases. Table 6 Single carrier system Full
    size table Finally, the comparative results of the maximum spectral efficiency
    objective function value for the different weight vectors are reported in Table
    7. The three RCBBO algorithms perform in a similar way with RCBBO-C and RCBBO-G
    performing slightly better than RCBBO-L. The original BBO outperforms the GA in
    all cases. Fig. 1 Convergence rate graph for single subcarrier case Full size

    subcarriers case Full size image Fig. 4 Convergence rate graph for 512 subcarriers
    case Full size image Moreover, non-parametric statistical tests were conducted
    in order to further elaborate with the algorithms results. These are the Friedman
    test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, which are commonly used for the performance
    evaluation of EAs [9, 10]. Both tests are conducted based on the objective function
    values found that are summarized in the Tables 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. The results are
    presented in Tables 8 and 9. RCBBO-G emerged as the best algorithm in the Friedman
    test, and RCBBO-C is second. The significant level set for the Wilcoxon signed-rank
    test was 0.05. From the Wilcoxon signed rank test, we see that most p values are
    below the significance level (0.05), so we can accept that a significant difference
    exists between the other algorithms with RCBBO-G to be significantly better than
    GA, BBO, and RCBBO-L. Convergence speed is another performance metric to be examined.
    Figure 1 shows the convergence rate graph for the single carrier case. It seems
    that the three RCBBO algorithms converge at similar speed slightly faster than
    the original BBO algorithm. Table 8 Average rankings achieved by Friedman test

    Multicarrier System Expanding the previous case study with multiple subcarriers
    like 128, 256 and 512 proportional results can be collected and analyzed. It must
    be pointed out that the authors have not been able to find a paper in the literature
    that uses more than 64 subcarriers for this type of problem. Using more subcarriers
    makes the problem high dimensional. In this case the total number of decision
    variables for L subcarriers is 5L. Therefore for 128, 256, and 512 subcarriers
    the total number of decision variables is 640, 1280 and 2560 respectively. We
    compare again the three RCBBO algorithms with the original BBO on the five objective
    functions values for different weight vector scenarios. Table 10 summarizes the
    comparative results of the three RCBBO algorithms and the original BBO by showing
    the number of times that each algorithm ranked first. The first line of Table
    10 shows the results for 128 subcarriers. The RCBBO-L algorithm performs better
    than the other algorithms in 4 out of the 5 different cases. For \(L=256\), the
    RCBBO-L agian performs better in 4 out of the 5 cases. The results for \(L=512\)
    are balanced between the RCBBO algorithms. No RCBBO algorithm can perform better
    than the others in the most of the cases. Overall, we notice that the RCBBO-L
    outperforms the other algorithms in the majority of the cases. Table 10 Comparative
    results of algorithms ranking first for different weight vectors and different
    subcarrier number Full size table Moreover, Fig. 2 depicts the convergence rate
    graph for the 128 subcarriers case. Figures 3 and 4 present the convergence rate
    graph for the 256 and 512 subcarriers respectively. It obvious again, that the
    three RCBBO algorithms converge faster than the original BBO algorithm. From the
    convergence rate graphs it can be deducted that the use of any of the three RCBBO
    algorithms does not offer an advantage regarding convergence rate speed. 5.3 Best
    Compromised Solutions The best compromised solutions using the fuzzy decision
    making rules described in the previous section across the full range of weighted
    vectors and the applied algorithms are reported in Table 11. One may notice that
    the best compromised solutions found are obtained by RBBO-G and RCBBO-C algorithms.
    The RCBBO-G solutions are selected by fuzzy decision maker in all multiple carrier
    cases, while the RCBBO-C solution is selected in the single carrier case. Additionally,
    it is evident that the cost function values increase as the number of subcarriers
    increases. The multiple subcarriers case shows clearly the improved performance
    of the three RCBBO algorithms over the original BBO. Figures 5, 6, and 7 depict
    in a graphical manner the best compromised solutions found by the fuzzy decision
    maker for 128, 256, and 512 subcarriers respectively. Table 11 Best compromised
    solutions for the cases of 1, 128, 256 and 512 subcarriers Full size table 6 Conclusion
    In this paper, we have proposed a modified BBO approach referred to as real-coded
    BBO (RCBBO) for the optimization of Cognitive Radio systems engine combined with
    a fuzzy decision maker. The main characteristic of this algorithm is that the
    real-coded mutation operator is integrated into RCBBO in order to improve its
    performance. Simulation results show that the RCBBO algorithms outperform the
    original BBO algorithm. From the above figures we can see that RCBBO algorithms
    converge faster and obtain better results than BBO. It is also worth noting that
    the differences between RCBBO and BBO results become more significant when the
    number of subcarriers is increasing. Moreover, using fuzzy set theory we managed
    to find the best compromised solution which is given by RCBBO algorithm. The superiority
    of RCBBO against BBO algorithm lies in the fact that the integrated mutation operator
    into RCBBO enhances its exploration ability and improves the diversity of its
    population. References Alberti, A., Mazzer, D., Bontempo, M., de Oliveira, L.,

  analysis: 'Satellite-based Communications (SATCOM) systems are increasingly becoming
    popular in Industry and Academia, thanks to innovative services introduced by
    leading tech companies and the promising impact they can deliver towards the global
    connectivity objective. On the one hand, the emergence of new manufacturing processes
    and radio technologies promises to reduce service costs while guaranteeing outstanding
    communication latency, available bandwidth, flexibility, and coverage range. On
    the other hand, cybersecurity techniques and solutions applied in SATCOM links
    should be updated to reflect the substantial advancements in attacker capabilities
    characterizing the last two decades. However, business urgency and opportunities
    are leading operators towards challenging system trade-offs, resulting in an increased
    attack surface and a general relaxation of the available security services.

    In this paper, we tackle the cited problems and present a comprehensive survey
    on the link-layer security threats, solutions, mitigation strategies, and research
    challenges faced when designing and deploying secure SATCOM systems. Specifically,
    we classify the security solutions related to the link-layer of SATCOM systems
    available in the literature into two main research domains, i.e., physical-layer
    approaches and cryptography techniques. Next, we delve into each area, looking
    at the offered security services and how such schemes guarantee the desired security
    objectives. For each area, as a novel contribution, we describe the threat models,
    assumptions, system requirements, and operational strategy, and we cross-compare
    the most important proposals along their characterizing features (see Fig. 1 for
    a graphical overview). Finally, within each research domain, we also identify
    novel future research directions and additional research challenges.'

    Communication (SATCOM) systems are gaining renewed momentum in Industry and Academia,
    thanks to innovative services introduced by leading tech companies and the promising
    impact they can deliver towards the global connectivity objective tackled by early
    6G initiatives. On the one hand, the emergence of new manufacturing processes
    and radio technologies promises to reduce service costs while guaranteeing outstanding
    communication latency, available bandwidth, flexibility, and coverage range. On
    the other hand, cybersecurity techniques and solutions applied in SATCOM links
    should be updated to reflect the substantial advancements in attacker capabilities
    characterizing the last two decades. However, business urgency and opportunities
    are leading operators towards challenging system trade-offs, resulting in an increased
    attack surface and a general relaxation of the available security services. In
    this paper, we tackle the cited problems and present a comprehensive survey on
    the link-layer security threats, solutions, and challenges faced when deploying
    and operating SATCOM systems. Specifically, we classify the literature on security
    for SATCOM systems into two main branches, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography
    schemes. Then, we further identify specific research domains for each of the identified
    branches, focusing on dedicated security issues, including, e.g., physical-layer
    confidentiality, anti-jamming schemes, anti-spoofing strategies, and quantum-based
    key distribution schemes. For each of the above domains, we highlight the most
    essential techniques, peculiarities, advantages, disadvantages, lessons learned,
    and future directions. Finally, we also identify emerging research topics whose
    additional investigation by Academia and Industry could further attract researchers
    and investors, ultimately unleashing the full potential behind ubiquitous satellite
    communications. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Satellites

    Satellite-based Communications (SATCOMs) play a vital role in the global telecommunication
    systems, having found applications in a plethora of domains throughout the last
    50 years, including radio broadcasting, weather forecast, maritime communications,
    assisted navigation, and military operations, to name a few [1]. While the attention
    of Academia and Industry in the last years was mainly focused on ground communication
    systems, recent business initiatives launched by leading tech companies such as
    SpaceX, Facebook, and Amazon generated new renewed interest in satellite-based
    systems [2], [3]. In particular, satellites are being deployed to provide services
    in a variety of new application domains, e.g., to reach remote locations providing
    unmatched connectivity (as per bandwidth and cost), or to support low-power constrained
    Internet of Things (IoT) devices [4]. As a result, recent commercial and standardization
    activities clearly indicate SATCOMs as one of the most important enabling technologies
    for supporting the development of the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks
    [5]. In addition, the business driving factors also seem to indicate a bright
    future for SATCOMs. Indeed, according to a dedicated research report by Market
    Research Future (MRFR), “Satellite Communication Market Information by Product,
    Technology, End-Use, and Region-Forecast till 2025”, the SATCOM market is anticipated
    to reach USD 41,860 Million by 2025, sporting a 8.40% Compound Annual Growth Rate
    (CAGR). Despite the promising applications and forecasting, the adoption of satellite
    links generally widens the threat surface of a system, introducing new vulnerabilities.
    Indeed, the ease to eavesdrop, tamper, disrupt, and reroute the satellite traffic
    provides the attacker with an extensive portfolio of opportunities to launch cyber-attacks
    at scale and affect the operations of such systems in different ways [6]. To complete
    the scenario, there is also the fact that the military satellite backbone is subject
    to the same (if not bigger) issues [7]. The severity of the cited threats could
    be even higher when considering that most of the current satellite systems either
    do not integrate security at all or run outdated security techniques, unable to
    face the complex attacks launched today [8]. As a result, security solutions for
    SATCOM should be revisited and coupled with the unique features of satellite-based
    systems. Several contributions in the last decade already investigated security
    issues in the context of SATCOM (refer to Table 1 for an overview). Looking at
    the main contributions on SATCOM security, valuable insights are provided by,
    e.g. [11], [12], [14], [15], [18], and [16]. However, they only preliminarily
    identified the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) spoofing and GNSS jamming
    attacks and presented the adopted solutions and mitigation techniques available
    from the literature. Moreover, the study by the authors in [10] only summarize
    the schemes targeting data secrecy at the physical layer, with a focus on information-theoretic
    schemes only. Other surveys, such as the one in [19], focused specifically on
    some research areas, such as quantum computing, missing the contextualization
    of such areas to other research in the SATCOM domain. It is also worth mentioning
    the recent contribution by [20], highlighting the threats affecting specific application
    areas where SATCOM links play a role. However, such a survey focuses on the review
    of the literature, rather than on the identification of the research areas where
    such contributions are provided. Moreover, although many contributions are available
    on secure routing, e.g. [21], [22], the focus of our investigation is link-layer
    security in satellite communications, and secure routing is therefore out of scope.
    As a result, we notice that the current literature is still missing a comprehensive
    survey, presenting and exploring all the facets of the threat surface to be considered
    when deploying SATCOM systems at the link-layer, as well as related countermeasures.

    related to the link-layer of SATCOM systems available in the literature into two
    main research domains, i.e., physical-layer approaches and cryptography techniques.

    Aperture Terminal 2. Background This section introduces the main notions related
    to SATCOM systems used within our manuscript, including the satellites constellations,
    architectures, and the involved protocols. Overall, this section aims to provide
    the reader with the needed background on SATCOM technologies and their main features,
    that will be used in the sequel of the paper. 2.1. Satellite constellations The
    main features that distinguish satellites orbits are the shape (circular or elliptical),
    the altitude (Low-Earth, Medium-Earth, or Geostationary), the travel direction
    (clockwise or counterclockwise), and the inclination to the plane of the Earth’s
    equator [23]. The most popular of the previously cited features is the altitude:
    we distinguish Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Geostationary
    Equatorial Orbit (GEO). The respective altitude ranges from the Earth surface
    are 500 to 900 km for LEO, 5000 to 25,000 km for MEO, and 36,000 km for GEO [24].
    The altitude is directly related to the services offered to the end users. Without
    loss of generality, the farther is the satellite from the Earth surface, the greater
    is the Earth coverage area. Indeed, the Earth Coverage for LEO satellites is quite
    small, for MEO is larger and for GEO is sizeable. For instance, according to the
    authors in [25], a LEO satellite located 550  km over the Earth surface, having
    an elevation of 40 degrees, can cover an area of approx. 1.05 million km squared,
    with an approximate radius of 580  km. At the same time, according to the authors
    in [26], a GEO satellite can cover 40 degrees of latitude, i.e., approximately
    one-third of the Earth surface. Given that the coverage range is directly related
    to the number of satellites to be operated, such a number decreases when the distance
    from the Earth increases. SATCOM uplink and downlink channels adopt different
    frequencies to mitigate the interference on the ground and at the satellite. The
    band, frequency regulations, and recommendations are authorized by Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) and International Telecommunications Union (ITU). For instance,
    according to the European Space Agency (ESA) [27], SATCOMs frequency bands are
    standardized in the range of 1 ∼ 40  GHz, as reported in Table 3. For instance,
    Inmarsat [28] is a provider of SATCOM services that adopt GEO satellites to provide
    telephone and data services to users worldwide. Companies like SpaceX [29] and
    Iridium [30], [31] are planning to launch in orbit thousands of LEO satellites
    to provide low latency, broadband internet systems, voice, and data services anywhere
    on Earth. Table 3. Satellites frequency bands and applications. Satellite frequency

    The reference communication architecture of a SATCOM system, as depicted in Fig.
    2, is generally characterized by: (i) a space segment including the Satellite
    to Satellite (SS) and the Satellite to Ground (SG) links; (ii) a ground segment,
    defined by the satellite operators (or gateways) and network operators, enabling
    the Ground to Satellite (GS), Ground to Ground (GG), Satellite to Ground (SG),
    forwarding, and the Satellite to User (SU) links; and finally, (iii) a user segment,
    which includes the terminals, e.g., ships, airplanes, and satellite smartphones,
    enabling the additional User to Ground (UG) and the User to Satellite (US) links.
    The space segment of a SATCOM architecture is one of the three main components
    of a SATCOM system. This segment comprises GEO satellites to support business
    in navigation, data, mobile television, and radio broadcasting systems. At the
    same time, MEO satellites are deployed to deliver low-latency and high-bandwidth
    data connectivity to service providers, agencies and industries, and to support
    the network connectivity in the avionic/maritime domain. LEO satellite constellations
    are also adopted for several applications such as imaging, and low-bandwidth telecommunications
    and broadband internet. Each of these satellites is placed in orbit by a launch
    vehicle. The space segment also includes military and defense communication systems,
    as well as commercial SATCOM transponders and payloads. Note that the afore-mentioned
    communication links involving satellites all use frequencies in the L-band, in
    the range [ 1 − − 2 ]  GHz. Download : Download high-res image (354KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. SATCOM architecture. The ground segment can
    help to establish the communication between the satellites and all the terminals
    defined in the user segment. It comprises dedicated Gateway stations, namely Satellite
    Operator, infrastructures for control, Network Operator such as the Network Control
    Centre (NCC) and the Network Management Centre (NMC) supporting the satellite
    access requests from users. The user segment includes the user terminals, such
    as satellite mobile phones, ships, and airplane, to name a few. These devices
    can communicate with satellites by leveraging the link between the ground segment
    and the user segment, such as the forward link [32], while their communication
    with the gateways can take place over any communication technology. The forward
    link consists of both an uplink (base station to satellite) and a downlink (satellite
    to mobile user). Conversely, constellations like Iridium, Globalstar, Thuraya
    and Inmarsat allow a direct connection of the user handsets to the satellites,
    using the User to Satellite (US) link that typically uses frequencies in the L-band.
    While the above discussion covers the traditional SATCOM architecture, many variations
    can be found. In this context, it is worth noting that the 3GPP issued several
    standards over the last few years, with the objective to define the general architecture
    of non-terrestrial satellite networks in the context of 5G networks. Such standards
    are meant for several types of non-terrestrial communications, including GNSS,
    High-Altitude Platform Systems (HAPS), and air-to-ground communications—illustrating
    use-cases, scenarios, channels to be used, and modulation formats, to name a few
    [33]. Finally, from the security perspective, note that attacks can be launched
    in any of the identified segments. Thus, the ground segment should be appropriately
    secured, as well as any communication originating from the satellite should be
    protected, independently from its target destination (ground or space). More details
    on the specific threats will be provided in the following sections. 3. Physical
    layer security schemes for SATCOM In this section, we introduce, review, and classify
    approaches investigating security issues of SATCOM technologies at the physical
    layer. Specifically, Section 3.1 introduces information-theoretic security approaches
    for physical layer confidentiality of communications, Section 3.2 focuses on GNSS
    anti-spoofing techniques, while Section 3.3 includes considerations on anti-jamming
    solutions of SATCOM. To conclude our critical discussion, Section 3.4 summarizes
    the main lessons learned while Section 3.5 highlights future research directions
    in the area of physical-layer security. 3.1. Information theoretic security SATCOMs
    are particularly prone to eavesdropping due to the broadcast nature of the wireless
    medium and the very large coverage area. Usually, the confidentiality of SATCOM
    communications is provided via traditional cryptographic protocols such as Advanced
    Encryption Standard (AES), working at the MAC-layer or above. However, legacy
    satellites deployments often use old and proprietary customized versions of AES,
    frequently found later to be insecure. As a result, motivated adversaries featuring
    powerful capabilities and tools can easily collect a consistent amount of encrypted
    data and possibly compromising communications confidentiality. Moreover, many
    satellites deployments were set up several years ago, when wireless security was
    not conceived as a requirement. Indeed, attacks on SATCOM channels was conceived
    by the operators as hard to achieve, and overall, security was thought as a slow-down
    factor rather than an enabler. Thus, many satellites do not implement any security
    protection, and updating them today would require high costs [34]. Taking into
    account the above exposed issues, in the last years many contributions proposed
    to provide confidentiality to SATCOM scenarios by applying information-theoretic
    security schemes. The rationale supporting such schemes is the following: information-theoretic
    security approaches leverage the inherent randomness and noise of SATCOM communication
    channels to minimize the amount of information that can be extracted at the PHY
    layer by an unauthorized receiver [35]. This is typically achieved by guaranteeing
    that the quality of the channel, expressed in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR),
    exceeds a given bound only at the authorized receiver’s location while remaining
    below the set threshold in other locations, so that an eavesdropper cannot decode
    the received message. Moreover, such schemes typically do not assume any constraints
    for the eavesdropper in terms of processing capabilities or network parameter
    knowledge, and the resulting security features can be quantified analytically
    via dedicated channel-level metrics. The afore-mentioned security features are
    achieved without resorting to cryptography materials (e.g. shared key, certificates)
    or crypto related computations, hence resulting in a very efficient solution (from
    the computational, storage, and bandwidth point of view). We present a comprehensive
    classification of the scientific contributions that achieve confidentiality via
    information-theoretic schemes in SATCOM scenarios in Table 4. In the following,
    we summarize the most important features identified throughout our analysis. Table

    metrics can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of a scheme proposed to ensure
    confidentiality at the PHY-layer via information-theoretic schemes, including,
    e.g., the secrecy capacity/secrecy rate, average secrecy rate, and secrecy outage
    probability, to name a few. We hereby present the definition of the most important
    ones, leading to the definition of all the others. We assume that a malicious
    user E is interested in eavesdropping the traffic exchanged between two legitimate
    network entities and correctly decoding the information. The Secrecy Rate of the
    communication link is defined as the difference between the capacity of the eavesdropper
    E and the capacity of the legitimate user [56], where the capacity is the maximum
    transmission rate at which an eavesdropper is unable to decode any information.
    The secrecy rate of the legitimate source-to-destination communication link at
    the physical layer is defined as in the following Eq. (1): (1) S = C L − C E ,
    where C L is the capacity of the legitimate channel and C E is the capacity of
    the channel source-eavesdropper. Another important metric is the Secrecy Outage
    Probability (SOP), defined as the probability that the instantaneous secrecy capacity
    drops below a specific threshold value, representing a target secrecy rate [57].
    The other metrics listed in Table 4 can be derived from the ones previously introduced.
    Additional details can be found in surveys dedicated to the topic, such as [35].
    Link. The largest part of the analyzed works considered the Satellite-to-Ground
    (SG) link, applying information-theoretic approaches to secure the communications
    from the satellite to the ground receivers. To the best of our knowledge, only
    four works considered the Ground-to-Satellite link, i.e., [39], [42], [46], and
    [54], while other links are never considered. CSI Availability. One of the prominent
    features allowing to compare the contributions on physical-layer security is the
    amount of information known to the network about the attacker. Looking at the
    adversary model, the most restrictive assumption is the complete unavailability
    of information about the channel experienced by the eavesdropper (in technical
    terms, this is the Channel State Information (CSI)). The vast majority of the
    works assume the perfect knowledge of the channel quality at the eavesdropper
    side. This is the most secure approach to analyze the problem from an information-theoretic
    perspective, as it allows to maximize in analytical terms the difference between
    the legitimate channel and the (potentially) eavesdropped one, i.e. the secrecy
    rate. In practice, the cited objective is guaranteed by either reducing the probability
    of correct signal decoding by the adversary, or maximizing the secrecy rate of
    the main communication links. Few other approaches, instead, assume to know either
    partially (Imperfect) or completely the channel experienced by potential eavesdroppers.
    Such adversary model is often referred to as an active eavesdropper, as it is
    a legitimate network node, interacting with the network at times (so, its CSI
    parameter is known), but also equipped with eavesdropping capabilities on other
    communications. A few contributions, such as [36], [39], [41], [45], [51], [52],
    [54] evaluated the impact of the aforementioned assumption on the related security
    metrics. Adversary. In line with related work, we consider two types of adversaries:
    the internal and the external one. In particular, we define an internal adversary
    as an attacker playing the role of a legitimate network entity, actively participating
    in the network activities by transmitting and receiving information, such as an
    active eavesdropper [58]. We define an external adversary as an attacker who is
    not part of a legitimate SATCOM, also striving to remain not detected–hidden.
    This latter category also comprises the external eavesdropper, needing a simple
    receiving antenna tuned on the same frequency of the legitimate communication
    channel to receive packets successfully. Adversarial Receiving Antennas. The simplest
    adversary model, considered by most of the analyzed contributions, is a single
    eavesdropper, not sharing any information with other receivers [36], [37], [39],
    [41], [42], [43], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [52], [53], [54]. We remark
    that this is the easiest to analyze from the security perspective, as the previously-mentioned
    performance metrics only have to consider a single adversary. Just a few works,
    i.e., [44], [51], considered multiple antennas, even if no collusion between them
    is considered, thus reducing the adversary model to the same of multi single-antenna
    adversaries. Adversarial Antenna Type. All the analyzed contributions consider
    adversaries equipped with omnidirectional antennas, i.e., antennas capturing the
    information independently from the source location and (partially) radio environment.
    While such a model could appear the strongest, it does not consider a realistic
    SATCOM scenario, where obstacles at the ground could alter the profile of the
    received signal, as well as the previously-mentioned performance metrics. 3.2.
    Anti-spoofing schemes Without loss of generality, spoofing refers to disguising
    a communication from an unknown source as being from a known, trusted source [18].
    Like any other wireless communication technology, SATCOMs are in principle vulnerable
    to spoofing attacks. The issue is even more cogent because of the presence of
    legacy deployments, as previously described in Section 3.1. Today, several satellite
    systems transmit either unauthenticated messages, or authenticated at the application
    layer, via either symmetric key (implicit authentication) or public key solutions.
    A few examples include GNSS technologies such as Global Positioning System (GPS),
    Beidou, Glonass, and Galileo, and weather satellites such as National Oceanic
    and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Meteor [59]. Given the considerable
    threat surface, the design of anti-spoofing techniques for SATCOM scenarios has
    been largely focused on GNSS technologies due to their widespread use and increasing
    importance in the modern connected society [60]. Today, thanks to the sensitive
    advances in the design of Software Defined Radios (SDRs), performing GNSS spoofing
    attacks is surprisingly easy. An attacker needs an SDR and an omnidirectional
    transmitting antenna; by downloading freely-available tools such as gps-sdr-sim
    [61], the attacker just needs to run a script to emulate a complete satellite
    constellation and move the target wherever in the world, also for a significant
    period of time [62]. Considering that GNSS satellites are also used for time synchronization
    in several IoT deployments, detecting spoofing attacks with lightweight and effective
    techniques is of paramount importance. Table 5 summarizes the most important contributions
    in the topic of GNSS anti-spoofing and cross-compares them across reference system
    features. GNSS Spoofing Detection Means. A large variety of means have been used
    to detect GNSS spoofing attacks. Approaches use either PHY-layer information [59],
    [64], [65], [66], [67], [70], [71], [73], [74], [75], [76], [79], [80], [82],
    [83], [84], [85], [88], [90], or additional communication technologies [31], [62],
    [63], [68], [69], [72], or techniques based on Machine Learning (ML) over heterogeneous
    data [81], [82], [83], [84], [85], [89], [90]. All these techniques share the
    basic consideration that the bitstrings in GNSS signals cannot be modified to
    be more secure before being transmitted. Indeed, such modifications would require
    temporarily stopping the operation of the GNSS satellite, causing significant
    and unmanageable costs and effort. Table 5. Comparison of GPS/GNSS Spoofing Detection

    Receiving Antennas. Simplest GNSS spoofing attacks assume that the adversary transmits
    a fake GNSS signal using only a single antenna. Signal cross-correlation detection
    methods identify such attacks by discriminating the injected signal from the expected
    one, as it is transmitted using different devices than the ones the target satellite
    is equipped with. Comparing the correlation of the received signals using more
    than one antenna at the receiver side will result in a significant difference
    in signal characteristics, such as the carrier phase and amplitude. This is just
    an example of a technique employing multiple receiving antennas to detect GNSS
    spoofing, and other examples include the contributions by the authors in [59],
    [65], [67], [68], [70], [71], [76]. Although being relatively cheap to deploy,
    such solutions usually require the deployment of multiple antennas and their connection
    to a single system, i.e., the hardware modification of the receiving device. Often,
    such operations might be too expensive or impractical to be applied due to application-specific
    limitations. Usage of PHY-layer information. GNSS messages transmitted by satellites
    go through different phases of signal processing before being converted into a
    digital form at the receiver side. The anomalies in the characteristics of signals
    during any of these processing phases could be used to detect counterfeit GNSS
    signals [91]. Anomalies can be found in signals features such as received power,
    Carrier-to-Noise Ratio (CNR), quality, correlation, Automatic Gain Control (AGC),
    clock bias, and angle of arrival, to name a few. Such features are used in many
    approaches, e.g., [64], [65], [66], [74], to detect GNSS spoofing attacks. On
    the one hand, such techniques could be compelling and reliable. On the other hand,
    they require the receiving devices to access such information, which is not always
    possible. Indeed, many modern chipsets do not provide PHY-layer information to
    the devices they are connected to or integrated into, preventing the application
    of such approaches. Usage of Ad-Hoc Network Infrastructures. Other contributions
    leverage additional network infrastructures, set up ad-hoc for GNSS spoofing detection.
    This is the case of approaches using dedicated sensors deployments [59], [67],
    [68], [69], [74], [75], [87]. Other approaches, such as [31], [62], use opportunistic
    signals gathered by other communication infrastructures, such as the cellular
    network and the IRIDIUM constellation. While the first set of approaches require
    a dedicated setup, that is not always possible, the security of the second class
    of approaches mostly depends on the adversary model and on its capability to spoof
    also the additional wireless signals. Usage of Dedicated Hardware. Many solutions
    have been proposed in the last years, recurring to dedicated hardware to detect
    GNSS spoofing attacks. Such approaches leverage either specific information available
    from the radio channel [64], [65], [66], [67], [70], [71], [73], [74], [75], [76],
    [80], [82], [83], [84], [88], or specific type of arrays of antennas, or the use
    of dedicated sensors providing inertial measurements [86]. Similarly to previous
    approaches using multiple antennas, such techniques might be very efficient. However,
    they require the adoption of compatible hardware, which sometimes does not represent
    a viable solution. 3.3. Anti-jamming strategies In this section, we discuss the
    most important contributions dealing with anti-jamming methods in SATCOM scenarios.
    Without loss of generality, jamming is defined as the injection of intentional
    interference into the wireless channel in a way to disrupt the operations of a
    legitimate communication channel [92]. Several classes of jammers have been proposed
    in the scientific literature throughout the last years [93]. With reference to
    the portion of time where they are active, jammers can be constant, alternate,
    proactive (if they choose a channel in advance, and jam it) [94], or reactive
    (if they jam a specific channel only when RF activity is detected on that channel).
    Considering the number of frequencies jammed at the same time, jammers can be
    spot (a single jammed frequency) [95], sweep (multiple frequencies, at different
    times) [96], or barrage (multiple frequencies at the same time) [97]. Finally,
    based on the type of signal injected to cause interference, we can have noise-jammers
    (if noise of a different type, e.g., Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is injected
    on the channel), or deceptive-jammers (if they inject a signal similar to the
    legitimate ones). The effectiveness of a jammer strictly depends on the communication
    parameters [98] set by both the transmitter and the receiver [99]. Overall, to
    maximize the performance of the jammer, the adversary should carefully analyze
    the radio link and then design and deploy the appropriate type of jammer. Jamming
    is particularly relevant in the context of SATCOM links, and several contributions
    highlight the inefficacy of currently-deployed communication schemes, e.g., Code
    Division Multiple Access (CDMA), when powerful jammers target the communication
    links [100]. Table 6 reviews the most important contributions providing anti-jamming
    techniques in the SATCOM context and cross-compares them across reference features.
    In the following, we summarize the most important considerations emerging from
    our analysis. Table 6. Comparison of anti-jamming techniques and related system

    Experiments Link. Similarly to previous physical-layer solutions, also anti-jamming
    strategies mostly considered the Satellite-to-Ground communication link, focusing
    on increasing the availability of satellite services on the ground. A few works,
    such as [107], [111], and [119], considered also the Ground-to-Satellite link,
    while only one work, i.e, [119], discussed anti-jamming solutions for the Ground-to-Ground
    link. The Satellite-to-Satellite link is never considered because of the actual
    hardness of the jamming at high distances, though further studies on this segment
    would be valuable. Technology. While some works focused on a generic SATCOM technology,
    most were more specific, and analyzed the jamming issue in GNSS [104], [106],
    [108], [110], [116], [117], [121] and Military SATCOM constellations. Others were
    even more focused, proposing anti-jamming schemes tailored to the specific GNSS
    technology, such as the Chinese Beidou [115], the Russian Glonass [105], and the
    US GPS [101], [102], [103], [112], [120]. Number of Jammers. Most of the analyzed
    works considered single jamming devices that are usually easier to detect and
    isolate from a SATCOM link due to its vast coverage range. Other recent contributions,
    such [107], [109], [111], [113], [114], [119] introduced particular techniques
    to defend the commercial and civilian SATCOMs when one or more jammers are deployed
    in the scenario, thus being more effective in real deployments. Indeed, the deployment
    of multiple jammers is an essential problem in tactical and military scenarios,
    where the adversary is so powerful to make the adoption of the current solutions
    challenging or impractical. Type of Jammer. Characterizing and profiling the type
    of jamming affecting the communication link is the first step towards the deployment
    of an effective anti-jamming solution. Based on such considerations, the authors
    in [109], [112], [116], [117], [119], [121] proposed anti-jamming algorithms able
    to characterize the jamming signals emitted from multiple jammers and still guarantee
    the communication quality. In this context, it is worth mentioning the work by
    the authors in [118], mitigating jamming in SATCOM by proposing a cost-effective
    solution able to thwart jamming through an efficient jamming-dependent adaptive
    frequency hopping pattern. Anti-Jamming Technique. Many scientific contributions
    used physical layer parameters to estimate and guarantee the availability of downlink
    and uplink SATCOMs under jamming. For instance, to face malicious jamming attacks,
    the contributions in [101], [102], [103], [105], [112], [120] recommended the
    use of well-known techniques such as fast orthogonal search, signals cross-correlation,
    turbo codes, and distance theoretical models for the GPS signals. Alternatively,
    the authors in [105] demonstrate that the single-frequency multi-constellation
    receivers offer better jamming resilience than multi-frequency (L1 + L2) GPS receivers
    and that the GLONASS constellation demonstrated a better resilience than GPS.
    Indeed, they propose a multi-constellation solution that adopts GPS and GLONASS
    receivers for maritime applications. No need of Dedicated Hardware. It is worth
    noticing that contributions such as [103], [104], [111], [113], [118], [119],
    [120] do not require any dedicated hardware to deploy the provided solution in
    a real environment. Such solutions can be implemented via simple software updates—a
    cheap and convenient feature. Conversely, the remaining solutions require to intervene
    on the hardware, and their deployment depends on the opportunity, cost, and convenience
    of such a modification. Assessment Methodology. Finally, we notice that most of
    the analyzed approaches were evaluated using simulations. Although simulations
    provide useful details into the performance of the disclosed approaches, they
    often miss some elements of the actual deployment, hard to be modeled and controlled
    into a computer-based environment. Taking into account such considerations, approaches
    such as [102], [105], [108], [110], [120], [121] worked on real deployments, showing
    the effectiveness of their solutions through via practical experiments or real-world
    data. 3.4. Lessons learned In the following, we summarize the main lessons learned
    from the investigation and cross-comparison of the approaches working on improving
    the security of SATCOM deployments via physical-layer solutions. No Satellites
    Hardware Update. All the analyzed approaches do not propose the modification of
    the transmitted signals or the transmitting chain. Indeed, modifying a satellite
    is assumed to be too expensive to be performed, both from the financial and the
    operational perspective. Thus, assuming that the authenticity/availability received
    signal cannot be fully guaranteed, the studied proposals come up with solutions
    able to minimize the impact of different security attacks. Significant Receivers
    Updates. Consequently to the previous point, the proposed security techniques
    have a large impact on the receivers, requiring either hardware or software modification
    that impacts their operations. When uninterrupted operations should be guaranteed,
    deploying a new solution for either confidentiality, anti-spoofing, or anti-jamming
    working at the PHY-layer might find challenges, even if potentially guaranteeing
    high efficiency at low energy and processing costs. Channel State Information
    (CSI) Availability. Looking at information-theoretic schemes for SATCOM confidentiality,
    being aware of the CSI experienced by the passive eavesdropper(s) is critical
    when calibrating the effectiveness of a security solution. Indeed, if the CSI
    experienced by the eavesdropper when communicating with the network is available
    to the transmitter: (i) the secrecy capacity can be maximized; and, (ii) the SNR
    of the adversary is minimized. Data secrecy and secrecy capacity are handled as
    constraints of the overall optimization problem, where the overall aim is to ensure
    that the secrecy rate of the main communication link does not degrade below a
    minimum threshold or, equivalently, the secrecy outage probability does not exceed
    a specified upper bound. Detection vs. Prevention. Approaches working on anti-jamming
    and anti-spoofing mainly focus on detecting the attack once it has been launched.
    This is a crucial difference from approaches providing confidentiality using information-theoretic
    schemes that prevent the attacker from gaining information. Such difference is
    due to the different adversarial models (active in the first two mentioned cases,
    passive in the second one), that lead to different countermeasures. Combining
    approaches for multiple security objectives, e.g., anti-jamming and confidentiality,
    might require new feasibility studies and solutions. 3.5. Future directions We
    can identify a few promising future research directions in the area of physical
    layer security for SATCOM as a result of the investigation carried out in this
    section. Directional Adversarial Antenna. Almost all the contributions in the
    three analyzed sub-areas assumed adversaries equipped with omnidirectional antennas.
    Omnidirectional antennas radiate equal radio power in all directions; thus, they
    can often be assumed as the worst-case for the integrity of the satellite communications.
    However, there are specific situations where an adversary equipped with directional
    antennas can be more disruptive, e.g., in cases where the location of the target
    communication link is well-known. Directional and semi-directional antennas focus
    the radiated power in narrow beams, particularly in one direction only [122].
    From the security perspective, this is an additional powerful feature for an adversary,
    as it can help to reduce the interference caused by other radio activities, improving
    the adversary’s expected performance. This is an interesting scenario to be investigated
    for satellite links’ security, which has still not been fully explored by Industry
    and Academia. Security of the Satellite to Satellite Communication Links. Despite
    being effective, none of the above-described security solutions provided a security
    evaluation of the satellite to satellite communication links. This is because
    of the hardness of both obtaining information about the communication protocols
    used by such links (often protected by intellectual property rights) and by the
    nature of such links, envisioned as a kind of core network, far from users’ services.
    However, due to the wireless nature of such communications, attacks on these links
    are both possible and potentially dreadful, as they can disrupt the availability
    of a SATCOM by just affecting the operation of a single link. For instance, Viasat
    affirms that because LEO satellites are not in constant communication with the
    ground, a satellite to satellite link can ease the data-sharing mechanism between
    adjacent satellites [123]. A malicious user could interrupt these types of communications
    by just jamming such a link. Also, it is unclear if and how physical-layer security
    techniques can be applied effectively for these links. Thus, investigating the
    security of Satellite-to-Satellite links is an appealing future research direction.
    Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS). Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces are one
    of the most attracting topic in the physical-layer security research community,
    and they are gaining momentum  [124]. Thanks to the deployment of a massive number
    of antenna elements on the satellites, it is possible, in principle, to assist
    the non-terrestrial network communications by focusing the electromagnetic energy
    in the intended direction, with consequent benefits in terms of security—receivers
    out of the intended direction are implicitly excluded from receiving signals [125].
    A few recent works investigated the theoretical performance of secure communications
    associated with intelligent reflecting surfaces and the deployment of intelligent
    reflecting surfaces on UAVs and satellites, e.g., [126], [127], [128], just to
    name a few. Therefore, in line with the current trend, we expect a surge of scientific
    contributions in the upcoming period focusing on the application of IRS for SATCOM
    scenarios. On the one hand, such works will explore the validity of previous results
    on PHY-layer security for terrestrial links when deployed to satellite links.
    On the other hand, when IRSs are deployed, new security threats might arise, specific
    to the new technology. Just to provide an example in this direction, an adversary
    could use a drone flying at significant altitude to boost its SNR when receiving
    a signal from an IRS deployed on a satellite, or to move within an area with a
    better coverage without being noticed by terrestrial receivers. GNSS Spoofing
    Detection via Artificial Intelligence. In line with a worldwide scientific trend,
    many recent proposals applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to solving
    GNSS issues, including the detection of spoofing attacks [129]. Specifically,
    AI-based solutions can be used to detect anomalies in the received signals, so
    as to identify the presence of the attacker. For instance, the recent proposal
    by the authors in [130] use cross-correlation of the received signals to detect
    anomalous messages, indicating the presence of an attacker. Still, there are several
    challenges that are to be solved, including the discrimination of legitimate and
    malicious interference, mobility of the attacker, and use of publicly-available
    data of satellites (e.g., ephemeris) to imitate satellites movement. In this context,
    we also notice that several real-world dataset are available and released as open-source,
    such as [131], [132]. Thus, we the are seems ripe to experience a renewed interest,
    likely ignited by researchers and industry with expertise in the application of
    AI algorithms to different domains. Friendly Jamming. Friendly jamming techniques
    disrupt all the communications in a given area by allowing, at the same time,
    legitimate parties to communicate [58]. Friendly jamming can be achieved in several
    different ways, e.g., through pre-shared knowledge of jamming time and frequency
    patterns, or via specific positioning of the legitimate communicating devices,
    in a way that the SNR exceeds the minimum required values only in specific locations,
    where the legitimate receiving nodes are deployed. Overall, deploying friendly
    jamming in SATCOM scenarios may be relevant and useful, e.g., to minimize eavesdropping
    capabilities of the adversary in military scenarios, while still allowing legitimate
    devices to communicate in a cheap way. We notice that none of the security techniques
    discussed in the previous subsections investigated the feasibility of friendly
    jamming in the context of SATCOM. Note that achieving friendly jamming is not
    as easy as jamming a communication link. Indeed, friendly jamming requires controlling
    with extreme precision the timing, the frequency, and the context to be jammed,
    in a way to know precisely when and how to transmit. In this context, analytical
    and experimental results about the feasibility and the degrees of freedom of friendly
    jamming in SATCOM are still needed. Spoofing of non-GNSS constellations, e.g.,
    NOAA. At the time of this writing, the majority of contributions dealing with
    spoofing and anti-spoofing techniques in the SATCOM context focused on GNSS constellations,
    due to their higher impact and involvement in everyday life. However, non-GNSS
    constellations such as NOAA and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) are also widely
    used, e.g., by ships or other devices in remote locations. At the same time, their
    (low) security is comparable to the one offered by GNSS satellites. Solutions
    to detect and overcome spoofing of the signals emitted by such satellites are
    still to be investigated and might represent an appealing research opportunity.
    Powerful Inter-Communications Adversaries. Most of the approaches using signals
    from additional communication infrastructures to detect and overcome GNSS spoofing
    and jamming assumed that the adversary only focused on a single communication
    link. However, a powerful adversary able to inject noise or spoofing signal of
    SATCOM and non-SATCOM technologies, eventually using a high powerful antenna,
    could be disruptive and nullify the effectiveness of such countermeasures. For
    instance, the adversary could fine-tune its attack strategy, so as to deteriorate
    the performance of such detection strategies. Such powerful adversaries are not
    too unrealistic to be thought, and thus, are worth investigating. 4. Cryptography
    techniques for SATCOM Many contributions have proposed to apply cryptography techniques
    to secure SATCOM links. Such works mainly focus on the authenticity and confidentiality
    of SS and SG communications, and adapt security primitives originated from other
    domains to work efficiently with SATCOM systems. We can notice that part of the
    scientific contributions in this area adapt the implementation and network architecture
    of well-known cryptographic solutions to the SATCOM scenario, while the other
    part study the effectiveness and consequences of the introduction of novel paradigms,
    such as quantum computing, with an eye on the requirements of SS and SG communication
    links. In this section, we review and classify contributions dealing with the
    application of cryptography schemes in SATCOM, classifying them based on the provided
    security service. Section 4.1 focuses on techniques for peer authentication, Section
    4.2 discusses key agreement schemes, while Section 4.3 introduces approaches for
    key distribution based on quantum channels. The main lessons learnt from our study
    are reported in Section 4.4, while Section 4.5 outlines promising research directions
    in this domain. 4.1. Authentication SATCOM systems involving users, mobile devices,
    and ground stations (or network control centers) require establishing trust among
    the cited entities. However, due to the presence of the wireless medium, SATCOMs
    are more prone to impersonation attacks. To mitigate this problem, various authentication
    protocols have been proposed in the literature. Table 7 provides a comprehensive
    classification of the most important scientific contributions in the field, cross-comparing
    them across the selected communication architecture, the proposed cryptographic
    technique, the security properties, the security analysis, and the assessment
    methodology. Link. Most of the analyzed works considered the User to Ground Station/Network
    Control Center through Satellite link depicted in Fig. 2, applying standard cryptography
    techniques to secure the channel. Many schemes, i.e., [141], [142], [143], [144],
    [147], [148], considered the protection of the GPS/GNSS communication link, while
    other links are rarely taken into account. Table 7. Comparison of Different Authentication

    Anonymity Formal Experiments Key Sharing Technique. Many different key sharing
    techniques are used for equipping the entities with the crypto material necessary
    to run authentication protocols. The authors in [133], [136], [149] proposed a
    public key cryptographic scheme based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to
    provide peer entity authentication. Conversely, other proposals assume a pre-shared
    key, statically known by one or more users. Some other approaches, i.e., [141],
    [142], [143], [144], [147], [147], [148], adopt the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant
    Authentication (TESLA) protocol conceived by Perrig et al. in [150] to provide
    delayed source authentication for broadcast communications in very resource-limited
    environments, by leveraging only symmetric cryptographic primitives and hash chains.
    Focusing on schemes adopting asymmetric cryptography solutions, the adoption of
    ECC rather than the traditional RSA provides benefits in terms of smaller public
    and private keys for the same security level, faster key generation and signature
    operations, as well as low overhead on CPU and memory usage. Rivest–Shamir–Adleman
    (RSA) schemes are usually very simple to implement, widely deployed in the industry,
    and specific public key operations such as the signature verification are usually
    faster than the ones on ECC, considering the same size of the elements. However,
    the setup of a public-key infrastructure to manage, distribute, and revoke public
    key certificates is costly and time-consuming. Thus, when a public key infrastructure
    is not desirable or affordable, and the efficiency of the crypto operations is
    at premium, symmetric cryptography solutions for digests generation are adopted,
    such as the TESLA protocol [150]. Symmetric solutions allow to execute very fast
    encryption and decryption operations, as well as to generate authentication digests
    that can be produced and verified very quickly. However, differently from public-key
    solutions, solutions based on symmetric cryptography requires the communicating
    parties to share a secret, to be kept private at least for a given amount of time
    (e.g., in case of TESLA). If a shared key is compromised, it should be discarded
    and replaced. However, replacing and updating a key can be a time-consuming activity,
    especially in a context where the communicating entities are orbiting several
    kilometers above the Earth surface. Security Properties. The main security property
    provided by the proposed schemes is mutual authentication, i.e., entities authenticate
    each other before establishing mutual communication. Equal importance is given
    to message authentication, which ensures that the message was actually sent by
    the entity that claimed to have done so. Contributions such as [133], [134], [135],
    [136], [137], [140], [146], [149] guarantee additional properties, such as anonymity
    and user privacy, adopting techniques that hide the user identity during a communication.
    Security Analysis. The schemes proposed by the authors in [133], [139], [143],
    [149] are formally proved as secure with reference to certain formal specifications
    or properties. Some tools that help to prove these properties are ProVerif [151],
    CryptoVerif [152], AVISPA [153], and Tamarin [154], to name a few. Note that only
    the security of the cryptographic scheme can be verified through this mechanism,
    while its integration in the reference system architecture could widen the threat
    surface. Assessment Methodology. Similarly to the works dealing with physical-layer
    security, most of the analyzed schemes use simulation-based evaluation. Only few
    of them, i.e., [145], [147], [148], [149], used real data and deployed proof-of-concept.
    4.2. Key agreement Key agreement protocols (a.k.a. key establishment protocols)
    are used to allow two (or possibly more) entities that could not have anything
    in common to agree on a shared key to be used to secure further mutual communications
    [155]. Nowadays, key agreement protocols via public key cryptography or pre-shared
    keys are used in a range of different security protocols. Although several works
    proposed lightweight key establishment solutions integrating well-known cryptographic
    approaches in a variety of application domains, key establishment mechanisms in
    SATCOM have received only reduced attention. Table 8 provides a comprehensive
    classification of the scientific contributions dealing with key agreement in SATCOM
    scenarios, considering reference system requirements and features. Link. Most
    of the presented approaches focus on the key establishment in SG and SS links.
    It is also worth noting that most of the solutions require a software update that
    can be done via radio link or, in particular situations, by intervening offline
    on the satellite. Table 8. Comparison of Different Key Agreement Methods for SATCOM

    Formal and complexity analysis Cryptography Technique. Many different techniques
    are used to allow the entities to derive a shared secret. Overall, the same considerations
    introduced for the key sharing techniques in Section 4.1 are still valid for key
    agreement protocols adopted in SATCOM links. For completeness, we introduce the
    pro and cons also for the Identity Based Cryptography and the Chaotic Maps. In
    Identity Based Encryption (IBE) schemes, each communicating entity owns a unique
    identifier, adopted to compute the correspondent public key. With such an approach,
    no certificates are needed and no pre-enrollment is required. However, the architecture
    requires a key generation center, which might be vulnerable to key-escrow attacks,
    and therefore, exposed to a risk of information disclosure [164]. Unlike public-key
    cryptography systems, chaotic maps do not require modular arithmetic, being therefore
    very fast for both encryption and digital signature. Moreover, algorithms based
    on chaotic maps might not require that large private keys, being computationally
    efficient. On the downside of such a technique, chaotic maps can produce ciphertext
    that are bigger than the plain-text [165]. Target Security Service. Most of the
    presented schemes focus on the balanced protection of the Confidentiality, Integrity,
    and Availability of data (CIA) by providing, at the same time, identity verification.
    Adversary Model. The Canetti–Krawczyk (CK) and the extended Canetti–Krawczyk (eCK)
    security models [166], are widely used to verify and provide the aforementioned
    security properties for key agreement protocols. These models have been developed
    to build secure protocols that guarantee peer entity authentication and message
    authenticity during the key exchange procedure. Indeed, the main aim of these
    models is to provide a method so that the security protocols proposed in the literature
    can have a match between the implementation and the adoption in a real environment
    by taking into consideration also possible attacks of an active adversary [167].
    Assessment Methodology. In order to evaluate the performance of a key agreement
    protocol, authors can evaluate the offered security properties by using the formal
    analysis or discuss the solution. Further, they can estimate the efficiency via
    simulation tools, like [156], [158], [160], or by performing a complexity analysis
    such as [162], [163]. The only contributions providing performance on a real system,
    i.e., [156], [159], worked on the ground link due to the viability of the approach
    and its reduced costs. 4.3. Quantum key distribution Although the soundness of
    the adopted encryption techniques typically relies on traditional mathematics
    proofs, quantum architectures are coming out of laboratories to be used in many
    contexts, based on different assumptions. Overall, Quantum key distribution (QKD)
    allows two remote parties to securely negotiate a cryptographic key even in the
    presence of an eavesdropper. However, compared to traditional key distribution
    schemes, the security of such distribution mechanisms does not rely on cryptographic
    assumptions (i.e., difficulty of solving specific mathematical problems), but
    on the unique quantum mechanics properties of the adopted communication strategy
    at the physical-layer. Thus, even assuming a powerful adversary with unlimited
    computational capabilities and able to break cryptography assumptions, the robustness
    of the protocols still holds—basically, QKD protocols allow detecting the presence
    of an eavesdropper on the communication link [168]. Currently, several Quantum
    Key Distribution (QKD) solutions have been proposed in the literature, even if
    there is still a gap between the information theory and practical implementations.
    As depicted in Fig. 3, QKD systems work by using photons, i.e., particles which
    transmit light to transfer data [169]. Quantum technology allows two distant entities
    to agree on a common symmetric key even if they do not share any previous knowledge.
    The key is adopted with the respective encryption algorithm to transmit and receive
    encrypted messages over a standard communication channel, even if the One-Time-Pad
    (OTP) encryption scheme is the most used one. The benefit of this “unbreakable”
    encryption is that the data is carried via photons, which cannot be copied or
    eavesdropped without leaving evidence of such an attempt. Indeed, an adversary
    measuring the state of a photon would disturb the channel, hence compromising
    the key agreement procedure and providing a kind of tamper-detection evidence.
    In terms of security, quantum computing could make the current state of the art
    on security obsolete, jeopardizing the protection of data and communications.
    This aspect is leading to an acceleration of the adoption of countermeasures (e.g.
    post-quantum encryption algorithms), especially to protect data and critical infrastructures
    such as SATCOMs [170], [171]. Table 9 provides an overview of the most important
    QKD techniques proposed in the context of SATCOM, and cross-compares them across
    reference system features and requirements. Link. Most of the analyzed contributions
    propose approaches leveraging a quantum technology for SG and SS communication
    links. Note that such communication links might be challenging to manage when
    considering interference, natural phenomena such as sunlight, and the long distances
    among the entities. Download : Download high-res image (154KB) Download : Download

    BB84 Securing Key Exchange Sat to Ground Experiments Quantum Protocols. QKD protocols
    are today already adopted to protect communications through optical communication
    channels. QKD systems are already operational in different contexts, also allowing
    long-distance connections in Point to Point (P2P) communications. Several works
    in the literature such as [172], [173], [175], [183] adopt the well known BB84
    quantum key distribution scheme, developed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard
    in 1984. BB84 was originally described using photon polarization states where
    no quantum entanglement was required. Conversely, the authors in [174], and [184]
    propose schemes based on quantum entanglement, i.e., a particular phenomenon where
    particles remain intimately connected, even if separated by long distances [188].
    When it comes to QKD, while the high-level protocols are well understood and are
    taught in university courses, and commercial products are available on the market
    [189], the underlying phenomena that make them possible are rooted on the evolving
    frontiers of physics [190]. As such, a detailed discussion of the cited protocols
    is beyond the scope set for this survey. However, interested readers can resort
    to recent authoritative surveys on QKD available in the literature, such as [191],
    [192], [193], to cite a few. Main Contribution. A large variety of contributions
    used to distribute the cryptographic key via QKD. Approaches use either free space
    QKD [172], [180], or perform feasibility and efficiency analysis with reference
    to some specific schemes [174], [175], [177], [179], [183], [186]. All these techniques
    share the basic consideration that the quantum technology cannot be compromised
    due its intrinsic properties. Assessment Methodology. Differently from approaches
    based on classical cryptography, most of the contributions focusing on QKD carry
    out also an experimental assessment, allowing the authors to demonstrate the feasibility
    of satellite-based quantum communications by experimentally analyzing their efficiency,
    error tolerance, and security properties. 4.4. Lessons learned In the following,
    we summarize the most important lessons learned from the analysis of cryptography
    approaches for SATCOM reported in the previous subsections. Software Modifications.
    Differently from approaches based on PHY-layer security, cryptography solutions
    always require the modification of the software running on the receivers and on
    the satellites. Some approaches actually provided the required modifications,
    while others assume that the advantages of such modifications overcome the cost
    and effort required to install them. Impact of Software Updates in SATCOM. Cryptography-based
    solutions always require a dedicated software update on the satellite, and this
    could also affect the operational status of the SATCOM communication link. Thus,
    the cost of their integration should be carefully taken into account, and they
    should be applied only when other solutions (e.g., PLS-based ones) do not guarantee
    sufficient security. Quantum Key Agreement for SATCOM. Due to its promising level
    of security, quantum computing strategies show appealing advantages for SATCOM
    links, and researchers have already started to evaluate its feasibility due to
    the large involved distances [188]. We expect to see many contributions to come
    on this topic in the following years. 4.5. Future directions Analysis of Security
    Requirements. Most of the works considered in the first two subsections of this
    section only apply well-known cryptography schemes in SATCOM, plugging them in
    without a strong motivation or a detailed description of the underlying security
    requirements. Due to the significant impact that cryptography has on the operation
    and performance of SATCOM deployments, researchers and industry should come up
    with a dedicated security analysis of SATCOM links, explaining precisely what
    the threats are and why cryptography solutions are advantageous compared to Physical-layer
    ones in solving such issues. To the best of our knowledge, such a study is still
    not available in the literature. Communication Channel Availability. In the presence
    of an eavesdropper, a quantum-based communication channel is disrupted, and the
    parties cannot continue to communicate. In principle, this capability could help
    to detect Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks and identify potential eavesdroppers
    quickly. However, it also paves the way for easy Denial of Service (DoS) attacks,
    even harder to detect in the context of SATCOM due to the large reception range
    and coverage area of the communication. In this context, backup solutions for
    guaranteeing the availability of the service are needed, as well as tools to discriminate
    if the channel if compromised because of an eavesdropper, or because of the channel
    noise. Quantum Channel Security Assessment Tools. At the time of this writing,
    no works are available that evaluate the physical-layer security of QKD signal
    generation tools. In principle, passive side-channel attacks can be conducted
    to extract meaningful information from a QKD channel, without affecting and compromising
    the robustness provided by QKD strategies. It is essential to explore this research
    area to provide methods and tools to mitigate this open issue [194]. 5. Emerging
    research challenges The previous sections delved into the most active research
    branches related to the SATCOM domain and provided some appealing future research
    directions in those specific contexts. However, in addition to the identified
    research areas, our investigation highlighted further security-related SATCOM-based
    application domains that are receiving increasing attention from the scientific
    and business community. In the following, we discuss some of them, showing their
    key challenges and potential to attract additional interest in the years to come.
    Cognitive Satellite Terrestrial Networks. Cognitive radio in the context of wireless
    communication systems is a research area that attracted lots of interest in the
    few last years. In a nutshell, cognitive radio systems allow the coexistence of
    primary users (using devices that own the license to use a specific frequency
    band) and secondary users (allowed to share resources with the primary network,
    but not in possession of the license) on the same network and spectrum, sharing
    the same radio resources. A few works applied the concept of cognitive radio networks
    in the context of SATCOM. For instance, the authors in [36], [43], [51], [52]
    propose to secure the communication in cognitive satellite–terrestrial networks.
    They assume a scenario where the primary network is constituted by GEO, MEO, or
    LEO satellites, sending confidential messages to the fixed-satellite operator
    in the presence of eavesdroppers (secondary users) attempting to capture the satellite
    information signal. In their own (secondary) network, the network operator communicates
    with the user terminals. Still, doubts are there on the actual applicability of
    cognitive radio techniques in the context of satellite–terrestrial networks. This
    is mainly because of the extremely wide coverage of satellites, where the CR techniques
    might not work well. In line with a large amount of work done in the context of
    cognitive radio for terrestrial networks [195], we expect increased interest in
    this domain in the next years. Drone-To-Satellite. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV),
    a.k.a. drones, have gained increased momentum in the last years, in both academia
    and Industry [196]. In the context of SATCOM, one of the most critical challenges
    consists of allowing secure communication between small/commercial UAVs and satellites.
    For instance, the authors in [197] proposed a physical layer security framework
    in space–air–ground (SAGIN) downlink multi-beam satellite-enabled vehicle communications,
    where the UAV is adopted as cooperative node, interacting with the legitimate
    user and acting as a source of artificial noise to mitigate eavesdropping. In
    the same network setup, the authors in [198] investigated the IoT computing offloading
    problem by proposing a reinforcement learning approach to allocate the resources
    of the UAV edge server efficiently. In the same domain, the authors in [199] proposed
    a software defined architecture supporting different vehicles in an efficient
    manner. In line with existing works such as [200], we forecast numerous appealing
    applications involving drones and satellites. Using satellites links, users can:
    (i) drive drones remotely; (ii) stream video from the drone’s camera; (iii) use
    the drone to collect information from remote satellites; and, (iv) use the drone
    for optical remote sensing applications. Due to the well-known security, safety,
    and privacy issues posed by drones usage, and due to the central role of drones
    in the development of the upcoming 6G communication systems [201], we expect significant
    research activity in this domain in the years to come. AI in SATCOM. The usage
    of AI-based techniques is gaining increasing importance in almost any application
    domain, cybersecurity included. In the context of SATCOM, AI techniques could
    be used for many purposes, e.g., to identify physical-layer characteristics of
    the signals emitted by the satellites, to discriminate between authentic and injected
    signals, and for intrusion detection, to name a few . In this context, the authors
    in [202] experimentally show that using a dedicated Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN) it is possible to fingerprint the raw IQ samples received from LEO Satellites
    (Iridium) and authenticate the emitting transceiver on board of the satellite,
    despite the large distances. We expect increasing attention towards this research
    domain, targeting additional satellites constellations (GNSS ones included) or
    other applications of AI. Software-defined satellites. The integration of Software
    Defined Networking (SDN) into SATCOM could improve the connectivity coverage and
    performance for using broadband communications by allowing the operators to reconfigure
    the satellites as needed [203], [204], [205]. However, SDN also come with their
    security issues, that are further specialized in SATCOM use-cases [206]. Additional
    research is needed in this context. Network Slicing for the Internet of Space
    Things. The continuous development of nano-satellites is accelerating the deployment
    of low-cost satellite networks [207]. Emerging paradigms, such as the Internet
    of Space Things (IoST), require a network slicing framework to provide the support
    for the plethora of space-application scenarios. A network slice is a part of
    the network that is independent and logically separated from the rest. A specific
    slice has specific security policies, used to protect the slice while meeting
    specific system requirements. However, there are neither common strategies nor
    protocols suitable to design a network slice in the context of SATCOM. Despite
    initial studies in this context are available [208], [209], major work is still
    to be done, and we expect increasing attention towards this topic. Green Satellites.
    The design of environmentally-friendly satellites can help to reduce the environmental
    impact of a satellite, its production cost, and maintenance compared to traditional
    ones. However, reducing the cost and the impact of the satellite inevitably could
    affect the provided security services. This emerging research area, also suggested
    from the ESA [210], leads to a potential redesign of the existing procedures and
    technologies, also including the security domain. Definitively, a novel and interesting
    research topic. Satellites Signals for Opportunistic Navigation. Specific satellites
    signals can be used to pinpoint a specific location on Earth, similar to the GPS.
    A group of researchers developed a working solution based on the cited logic,
    leveraging signals broadcasted by Starlink internet service satellites [211].
    The usage of additional satellite constellations could provide reliability and
    spoofing detection mechanisms for devices on Earth, and more research into the
    robustness of such solutions is needed. Cybersecurity for Commercial Satellite
    Operations. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking
    comments on the draft specification NISTIR 8270, which describes the security
    procedures and the concepts for commercial space operations. The draft considers
    the management aspects, risk management operations, and defines the requirements
    that “might coexist within space vehicle systems”. The NIST is requiring feedback
    on the overall approach, the example use case, and the identified controls for
    the proposed use case [212]. We expect that several research contributions could
    come out due to the study and application of this (yet to come) recommendation
    to real use-cases. Standardization of Security for Non-Terrestrial Networks. In
    the standardization community, and in particular, within the Third Generation
    Partnership Project (3GPP) committee, satellite communications are specifically
    considered in the design of the Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), anticipating
    the upcoming tight integration between terrestrial, aerial and satellite networks
    [213]. Specifically, the standardization of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) has
    been launched by 3GPP in the 3GPP Release 16 [214]. At the same time, new security
    aspects have been recently defined by the 3GPP in the Release 17 [215], and new
    amendments are planned in the upcoming Release 18 [216]. In this context, none
    specifications edited by the 3GPP specifically took into account network security
    issues for NTNs. As a result, the current approach recommended by the 3GPP consists
    of a straightforward integration of the 5G security architecture and protocols
    into NTNs. Such an integration, however, comes with several challenges, in terms
    of communication overhead, software updates, and unreliability of the wireless
    links. Specifically, security issues in the operation of NTNs have been investigated
    by the Working Group on Satellite 5G, established within the IEEE Future Networks
    Initiative [217]. In one of the latest deliverables of the WG, i.e., [218], they
    drew a roadmap of the priorities to be addressed in this regard, highlighting
    that new security mechanisms might be needed for specific deployments, and that
    the emphasis should be put on the isolation of the end-users from the shared NTN
    network. The WG realized several security-related activities, i.e.,: (i) analyzed
    the state of the art about security for NTNs; (ii) provided a threat analysis
    for the NTN scenario; (iii) identified specific complications derived from using
    of 5G security solutions on 5G-NTN networks, by experimentally verifying them
    on prototyping platforms; and, finally, (iv) identified additional security concerns,
    mainly related to the integration of emerging technologies such as network slicing,
    edge computing, and multicasting over satellite networks (see Section 2.6.2 of
    [217]. The temporary recommendation proposed by the WP was to adopt the IPSec
    protocol suite to secure the communication link, but they also recommended further
    study into the issues at the 3GPP standardization level. However, the 3GPP refused
    to investigate further into the issue, at the time of this writing, still recommending
    a straightforward integration of 5G security into the NTN domain [218]. Nonetheless,
    due to the forecasted performance issues arising from such the integration of
    5G-security into NTNs, we expect significant contributions by the research community
    in the years to come, potentially triggering dedicated and ad-hoc initiatives
    by the 3GPP. Security and Privacy for 6G. 6G networks will accommodate satellites,
    UAVs, and undersea communications [219]. It is crucial that any security proposal
    framed in this context protect the communications while guaranteeing reliability,
    low latency, and secure and efficient transmission services. Physical-layer security
    is the first candidate defense for these new emerging technologies, but emerging
    cryptography-based solutions could also play a role if their integration is carefully
    systematized and orchestrated with the existing services. In the context of 6G
    initiatives, the 3GPP claimed that for the next few years (2030s) additional research
    is needed into this application area. Adapting and integrating the security services
    on satellites with mobile terrestrial/sea systems while meeting the requirements
    of 6G communication services will indeed represent a complex and difficult challenge
    [220]. For the cited scenario, we expect the adoption of real-time security communication
    protocols and emerging architectural solutions, such as Zero Trust [221]. 6. Conclusion
    In this contribution, we have provided a survey of the most significant link-layer
    security issues, threats, and mitigation techniques adopted in the context of
    Satellite-based Communications systems. First, we presented general background
    on the SATCOM architecture, the most important constellations, and network parameters.
    Then, we divided the relevant literature on the topic into two major research
    areas, i.e., physical-layer security and cryptography, and we further identified
    dedicated topics in each macro-area, focusing on specific threats. For the physical-layer
    area, we discussed and cross-compared solutions based on the usage of information-theoretic
    security schemes, anti-jamming strategies, and anti-spoofing schemes. For the
    cryptography area, we specifically discussed approaches for authentication, key
    agreement, and key distribution based on the emerging quantum computing paradigm.
    We also identified lessons learned and specific future directions for each of
    the cited threats and research areas. Finally, we presented a few appealing emerging
    challenges in the SATCOM security domain, pointing out the main research challenges
    to be solved and the areas where new contributions from the scientific community
    might have major impact. Overall, we believe that the exposed research challenges
    highlight that the design and testing of cybersecurity strategies for SATCOMs
    is still an active research domain. In particular, our contribution calls for
    collaboration between Industry and Academia to unlock new business opportunities
    and services, while enjoying the needed level of security for communications,
    applications, and infrastructures. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

    \ Vehicles (UAVs) demand technologies so they can not only ﬂy au-\ntonomously,\
    \ but also communicate with base stations, ﬂight controllers, computers, devices,\

    \ Introduction\nAn Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), also known as drone, is an aircraft\
    \ without\npassengers on board. Thus, the term “unmanned” implies a total absence\
    \ of humans\nwithin the aircraft [1]. In this regard, UAVs need not only hardware\
    \ and software capable\nof providing stability and preprogrammed ﬂight navigation\
    \ control [2], but also robust,\neffective, and secure communication technologies\
    \ that enable them to communicate with\nbase stations, air trafﬁc controllers,\
    \ other UAVs, or other devices and computers [1].\nAlthough UAVs were initially\
    \ designed for military action, the mass production\nof high-performance, low-cost,\
    \ intelligent UAVs has made them suitable for different\napplications. These applications\
    \ include video streaming, amateur photography and\nﬁlming, people and environment\
    \ monitoring, rescue and research, trafﬁc control, and\ndisaster recovery [3,4].\
    \ In fact, UAVs are currently being considered as an important\npart of the next\
    \ generation of wireless networks 5G with the so-called cellular-connected\nUAVs\
    \ [5], where they play a critical role to provide great performance improvements,\
    \ thus\nbringing more opportunities to the Internet of Things (IoT) and more diversity\
    \ for 5G\ncommunications.\nLikewise, while performing their missions, the UAVs\
    \ may work within an IoT [6]\ncontext when equipped with IoT devices. Herewith,\
    \ the UAVs will form an innovative IoT\nplatform operating in the skies, thus\
    \ being part of a new concept known as the Internet\nof Flying Things (IoFT) [7].\
    \ For this purpose, UAVs need to support instantaneous and\nreal-time communication,\
    \ and offer access to high-resolution ﬁles (e.g., videos streaming\nand high-deﬁnition\
    \ images), even if they are in an overcrowded area. That is the reason\nwhy 5G\
    \ networks are considered a key enabler for the IoT and the IoFT. In this sense,\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 830. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21030830\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 830\n2 of 27\nthe ultra-reliable and low latency (URLLC) mode\
    \ of communication expected with 5G\nnetworks would not only provide the UAVs\
    \ with the necessary IoT requirements but also\nprovide coverage at high altitudes.\
    \ Furthermore, the tasks of 5G networks may support\nremote change, and the planning\
    \ of ﬂight routes will be enhanced with the potential\nbeneﬁts of a 5G communication,\
    \ thus preventing UAVs from colliding with each other [8].\nRegarding the impact\
    \ on spectral usage expected for the massive connections of UAVs\nin 5G, an important\
    \ issue to be addressed is how these devices will be connected to future\nnetworks\
    \ in a spectral efﬁcient manner. It is known that despite the need for more robust\n\
    and secure communication UAVs traditionally operate within unlicensed spectrum\
    \ bands\n(i.e., open/free spectrum), such as IEEE S-Band, IEEE L-Band, and ISM,\
    \ ﬁxedly deﬁned in\ntheir hardware. Therefore, the UAVs increasingly face competition,\
    \ thus competing with\na growing number of mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and\
    \ tablets), operating within\nother wireless networks (e.g., Wi-Fi and bluetooth)\
    \ that use the same spectrum bands.\nHowever, besides interfering the UAVs communications,\
    \ this competition will not be\nbearable anymore, once a massive number of UAVs\
    \ is expected to be connected, which will\nlead to a serious problem of spectrum\
    \ scarcity and security-related problems [9]. In this\ncontext, Cognitive Radio\
    \ (CR) emerges as a promising technology to solve these issues by\nenabling Dynamic\
    \ Spectrum Access (DSA) [10].\nProposed by Mitola [11], CR is a smart wireless\
    \ communication implemented in a\nSoftware-Deﬁned Radio (SDR). An SDR sets its\
    \ transmission frequency in software rather\nthan in hardware, thus allowing the\
    \ CR to intelligently switch to different channels. To\nswitch channels, CR senses\
    \ the radio spectrum environment around it and adapts its own\nconﬁgurations accordingly\
    \ to increase reliability and efﬁcient spectrum usage [10]. Further-\nmore, CR\
    \ is considered a key enabling technology for 5G in emerging IoT applications\
    \ [12].\nTherefore, CR can provide UAVs with promising features for their massive\
    \ deployment,\nsuch as reduced energy consumption and delay, opportunistic spectrum\
    \ use based on\napplication requirements, and a security enhancement, as CR does\
    \ not suffer the effects of\nsome conventional attacks.\nThese features would\
    \ allow CR-based UAVs to perform in situations where traditional\nUAVs face limitations,\
    \ or are often subject to being hacked. Moreover, CR alongside 5G\nwould permit\
    \ the UAVs to work in an IoFT role within an IoT context. This would fulﬁll\n\
    the increasing growth of applications requiring highly connected devices, such\
    \ as Smart\nCities [13]. However, although UAVs and CR are well-established research\
    \ ﬁelds, the\nintegration between the two is fairly unexplored [9]. Many issues\
    \ remain open, such as the\nimpact of the UAVs mobility on CR and the deﬁnition\
    \ of hardware compatible with both.\nThese open issues allow new research opportunities\
    \ and advances into the state-of-the-art.\nIn this paper, we provide a comprehensive\
    \ overview of background on CR for UAV\ncommunication, and the ongoing research\
    \ regarding the integration between the two. We\nalso specify the steps to build\
    \ a simple and low-cost CR-based UAV testbed. Finally, we\npresent key opportunities\
    \ and future challenges in the ﬁeld.\n2. Related Works\nThe ﬁrst step towards\
    \ the proper development of a CR-based UAV is choosing a suit-\nable SDR-UAV combination.\
    \ With a particular emphasis on SDR hardware and software\nthat can be used for\
    \ aerial wireless exploration and analysis, Powell et al. [14] provides a\ncomparative\
    \ overview of SDRs. They address speciﬁcations for SDR hardware, features of\n\
    available SDR hardware that are acceptable for small UAVs, and measurements of\
    \ power.\nThey also present SDR software speciﬁcations, open-source SDR software\
    \ available, and\nSDR software calibration/benchmarking. Finally, the authors\
    \ present Aerial Experimenta-\ntion and Research Platform for Advanced Wireless\
    \ (AERPAW) as a case study, and address\nvarious different experiments that can\
    \ be sponsored by SDRs on that platform to verify/test\npossible wireless advancements,\
    \ protocols, and technologies.\nCR aircraft applications are also the subject\
    \ of recent surveys. Jacob et al. [15] carried\nout a survey on CR for aeronautical\
    \ applications. Although their survey is not directly\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n\
    3 of 27\nrelated to UAVs, they present valuable information about studies involving\
    \ CR and UAS.\nNotwithstanding, Saleem et al. [9] undertook a survey on the integration\
    \ of CR with\nUAVs. They discussed and highlighted a variety of challenges, issues,\
    \ and future research\nin the ﬁeld.\n3. Background\nHerein, we introduce some\
    \ background information required to understand this work.\nFirst, we give an\
    \ overview of UAVs. Second, we present a general description of the\nconcepts\
    \ related to CR and its operation.\n3.1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\nUAVs are described\
    \ with different terms, such as drones and Unmanned Aerial\nSystems (UAS). These\
    \ terms vary according to the research ﬁeld, often describing the same\nthing\
    \ though [1]. In this work, UAV is deﬁned as an aerial vehicle, with an embedded\n\
    computer platform, capable of ﬂying with no human pilot on-board.\nUAVs can be\
    \ remotely controlled and/or autonomous, and they can perform a variety\nof tasks.\
    \ Although initially purposed for military tasks, there is an increasing growth\
    \ in\ncivilian, commercial, and scientiﬁc applications (e.g., trafﬁc surveillance,\
    \ communication\nrelays, disaster management, data and image acquisition, etc.)\
    \ [16].\nAs shown in Table 1, UAVs can be classiﬁed according to their weight,\
    \ altitude\nand endurance [9]. Figure 1 shows an example of a mini UAV, the Inspire\
    \ 2, by DJI, as\ncategorized by Table 1 [17]. This UAV weighs around 3.3 kg and\
    \ its ﬂight reaches up\nto 27 min.\nTable 1. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) classiﬁcation.\

    \ weighing around 3.3 kg and capable of a ﬂight time up to\n27 min [17].\nAlthough\
    \ there is a wide variety of UAVs, this work focuses on their communication,\n\
    considering micro and mini UAVs battery, space, and weight constraints.\nFor mini\
    \ and micro UAVs, the battery represents an important portion of their weight.\n\
    The DJI Inspire 2, for example, typically works with a pair of 4280 mAh batteries,\
    \ weighing\n515 g each. Although over 30% of this UAV weight is assigned to batteries,\
    \ it is only able to\nﬂy 27 min per charge.\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n4 of 27\n\
    3.2. Cognitive Radio Networks\nThe European Telecommunications Standards Institute\
    \ (ETSI) deﬁnes CR as a radio\nthat can sense and understand the radio environment\
    \ and policies, and monitor usage\npatterns and users’ needs; autonomously and\
    \ dynamically adapts according to the radio\nenvironment, so that it can achieve\
    \ predeﬁned objectives, such as efﬁcient utilization of\nspectrum; and learn from\
    \ the environment and the results of its own actions, so it can\nfurther improve\
    \ its performance [18].\nCR is also able to operate as a secondary user (SU) within\
    \ a spectrum band of a li-\ncensed user or primary user (PU). In [12,19], the\
    \ Resolution ITU-R 58-2 of the International\nTelecommunications Union (ITU) states\
    \ that “the introduction of CRSs in any radiocommu-\nnication service needs to\
    \ ensure that coexistence within radiocommunication services and\nthe protection\
    \ of other radiocommunication services sharing the band and in the adjacent\n\
    bands are maintained or improved” [20]. In practice, clearer parameters on how\
    \ that action\nis done is usually deﬁned by local regulatory agencies.\nCR is\
    \ described as an intelligent SDR with the following components:\n1.\nspectrum\
    \ sensing: identiﬁes the available spectrum and detects PUs when operating\nin\
    \ a licensed band,\n2.\nspectrum management: selects the best available channel,\n\
    3.\nspectrum sharing: coordinates accessibility to the available channel with\
    \ other users,\nand\n4.\nspectrum mobility: vacates the channel when a PU arrives.\n\
    Figure 2 shows the interaction among the CR components. First, the spectrum sensing\n\
    component is responsible for collecting data from the radio environment, and it\
    \ keeps\nsending the gathered radio data to the spectrum management component.\
    \ When a PU\nis detected, it also notiﬁes the spectrum mobility component, then\
    \ a spectrum handover\nmust be executed. The spectrum management component is\
    \ responsible for submitting the\nchannel with higher availability to the mobility\
    \ component of the spectrum, because when\nthe current channel needs to be vacated,\
    \ a new channel is used. Finally, to organize the\nallocation of spectrum bands,\
    \ the spectrum sharing portion is responsible for interacting\nwith the radio\
    \ environment.\nFigure 2. The interaction among CR components. Adapted from the\
    \ work in [21].\nIn practice, CR consists of a hardware associated with an intelligent\
    \ software. Usually,\nthe hardware consists of a radio platform, generally an\
    \ SDR, and a computational platform.\nMost computational platforms used for CR\
    \ applications are single-board computers, such\nas the ODROID [22], the Raspberry\
    \ Pi [23], and the BeagleBoard [24]. The Universal\nSoftware Radio Peripheral\
    \ (USRP) from Ettus Research [25] and the Wireless Open-Access\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 830\n5 of 27\nResearch Platform (WARP) from Rice University are both SRDs\
    \ and the most common\nradio platforms used in CR [26,27].\nFigure 3 shows one\
    \ of the most usual SDR hardware in research experiments: the\nUSRP B200 by Ettus\
    \ Research. It provides full-duplex wireless communication within\na frequency\
    \ range starting from 70 MHz varying up to 6 GHz. Its architecture offers\ncompatibility\
    \ with a variety of software and frameworks, such as C++, Python, GNU\nRadio,\
    \ Amarisoft LTE 100, and OpenBTS.\nFigure 3. USRP B200 by Ettus Research. Its\
    \ price is currently $905.00.\n4. CR-Based UAVs\nA CR-based UAV may be seen as\
    \ a UAV with an SDR platform embedded to it. It\nshould also contain a computational\
    \ unity that interacts with the SDR platform in order to\nautonomously take decisions\
    \ regarding the radio spectrum usage. In this section, we ﬁrst\ndiscuss the need\
    \ for CR-based UAVs, potential applications, and hardware/software char-\nacteristics.\n\
    4.1. The Need for CR-Based UAVs\nHerein, we deﬁne the most prominent aspects regarding\
    \ the paramount importance\nof CR in the context of UAVs.\n4.1.1. Security\nCommunication\
    \ security is critically important for UAVs. These aircraft are also\nconsidered\
    \ critical systems, a security issue, which can be used to manage conﬁdential\n\
    information, thus, in a UAV, may often represent a serious safety issue. Some\
    \ conventional\nattacks, such as jamming and location spooﬁng (sometimes referred\
    \ to as GPS spooﬁng or\nGNSS spooﬁng), could lead the base station to lose the\
    \ UAV. This problem is particularly\nevident in overcrowded or hostile areas.\n\
    Jamming is an attack in the physical layer which causes a high interference to\
    \ a spec-\ntrum band by overloading it. It may provoke the attacked devices to\
    \ present an excessive\nenergy consumption due to package retransmission, or even\
    \ interrupt its communication\nchannel [7]. When a CR is under a jamming attack,\
    \ it simply understands that spectrum\nband as being busy or overcrowded, and\
    \ then it switches its transmission to a new channel,\nthus avoiding the attack.\
    \ In order to succeed in their jamming attempt, the attackers would\nhave to keep\
    \ detecting the new CR frequency and switch to the same frequency. For this,\n\
    however, the attackers themselves would need to also be equipped with a CR device\
    \ and\nmore sophisticated algorithms.\nLocation spooﬁng attacks also happen in\
    \ the physical layer, and they have become\nmore frequent. It happens when an\
    \ attacker uses a signal that is stronger than and mimics\nthe attributes of a\
    \ genuine location satellite signal to spoof the receiver [7]. By using a\nlocation\
    \ spooﬁng attack, attackers may capture UAVs and/or take control of their ﬂight\n\
    path. Such attacks have become easy to launch [28]. However, location spooﬁng\
    \ attacks are\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n6 of 27\nmuch more complex to execute to\
    \ CR devices. The work in [29] provides some strategies\nfor spooﬁng attack detection\
    \ and countermeasure solutions in CR networks.\nTherefore, UAVs may beneﬁt from\
    \ CR technology security. Conventional jamming\nand GPS spooﬁng strategies may\
    \ be easily avoided by CR. These attacks are only possible\nto CR when the attacker\
    \ is also using a CR with different and speciﬁc strategies; therefore,\nattacking\
    \ a CR device is a more complex problem than attacking conventional wireless de-\n\
    vices. Herein, we deﬁne the most prominent aspects regarding the paramount importance\n\
    of CR in the context of UAVs.\n4.1.2. Energy Efﬁciency\nAlthough CR devices may\
    \ represent a computational overload to UAVs, they may\nbe capable of actually\
    \ reducing energy consumption to these aircraft. Because the UAVs\noperate in\
    \ overcrowded spectrum bands, they are susceptible to a high number of loss,\n\
    thus increasing packet retransmission. The energy consumed for packet retransmission\n\
    may be greatly reduced when a UAV is equipped with a CR.\nLi et al. [30] proposed\
    \ a method to maximize energy efﬁciency based on a joint\noptimization with medium\
    \ access control (MAC) and physical layers, considering CR\nnetworks. In their\
    \ scenario, a CR user senses different channels simultaneously and uses\nsome\
    \ idle ones for data transmission. The authors showed that the more channels the\
    \ CR\ndevice is able to use, the more efﬁcient is its bits/joule ratio throughput.\
    \ The bits/second\nratio also increased with the number of channels used.\n4.1.3.\
    \ Spectrum Scarcity\nDespite a massive growth in the number of wireless connected\
    \ devices, most of the\nradio spectrum is underutilized. Because of the ﬁxed spectrum\
    \ allocation policy, a big\nportion of the radio spectrum is reserved to sporadic\
    \ PUs, while other spectrum portions\nare overloaded, such as Wi-Fi and mobile\
    \ bands. Moreover, the UAVs traditionally operate\nwithin unlicensed spectrum\
    \ bands (i.e., open/free spectrum), such as IEEE S-Band, IEEE L-\nBand, and ISM,\
    \ ﬁxedly deﬁned in their hardware, under the same ﬁxed spectrum allocation\npolicy\
    \ [31].\nIn this context, CR emerges as a promising technology to solve these\
    \ issues by enabling\nDSA [10]. CR-based UAVs are able to select idle spectrum\
    \ bands for communicating.\nThus, the UAV overall communication quality increases\
    \ when using CR, especially in\novercrowded areas.\n4.1.4. Application Requirements\n\
    UAVs may often be deployed in missions where they are expected to broadcast live\n\
    video and to send high deﬁnition pictures to the base station. However, live stream\n\
    broadcast tolerate packet loss, but require a high bandwidth for the timely data\
    \ delivery.\nSending high deﬁnition pictures is the opposite operation, as the\
    \ UAV may need a low\nbandwidth with no packet loss tolerance, but with delay\
    \ tolerance [9].\nWhile traditional UAVs may face this problem, CR-based UAVs\
    \ may easily deal with\nit. CR-based UAVs may change their communication frequency\
    \ accordingly to application\nrequirements. Thus, a UAV equipped with CR technology\
    \ may be live streaming video\nand switch to a low bandwidth to send a large ﬁle\
    \ when required. This feature not only\noptimizes the overall network performance\
    \ of CR-based UAVs, but it also opens new\napplication opportunities for these\
    \ aircraft. For instance, they can be used to improve\nthe communication performance\
    \ of terrestrial users in 5G, through the UAV-assisted 5G\ncommunications [32].\n\
    4.2. Potential Applications\nIn the last few years, emerged a growing trend to\
    \ rely on UAVs as a support tool\non critical missions, such as military surveillance\
    \ [33], forest ﬁre monitoring [34], crop\nmonitoring [35–37], trafﬁc surveillance\
    \ [38], border patrolling [39], natural disasters area\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n\
    7 of 27\nsurveillance and support [40–42], and commercial drones [43]. However,\
    \ these areas\nusually suffer from infrastructure issues that could possibly lead\
    \ to spectrum scarcity or\nanomalous PUs behavior [44,45]. Thus, an integration\
    \ between UAVs and CR could be\nuseful for these scenarios due to its spectrum\
    \ sensing and handover capabilities.\nAs well as the spectrum uncertainty scenario\
    \ set up by emergency conditions, densely\npopulated areas such as big cities\
    \ can likewise go through overcrowded frequency bands,\nmainly motivated for the\
    \ growing volume of wireless network users. Although spectrum\nscarcity is perceived\
    \ as a harmless effect, the falling of a UAV in a crowded area due to\nan unstable\
    \ communication could inﬂict much damage depending on the aircraft size\nand set\
    \ up [46]. One potential advantage of CR utilization is the potential increase\
    \ in the\nQuality of Service (QoS) caused by applying the spectrum handover capabilities\
    \ to identify\nand relocate to less occupied frequency bands, thus adding to the\
    \ stability of the data\ntransmission between UAVs and their base stations.\n\
    In order to avoid the spectrum scarcity caused by densely populated areas, the\
    \ UAV\ncan previously adjust its ﬂight path considering the spectrum availability,\
    \ as applied in [47]\nusing cellular data network. To accomplish this application,\
    \ it can be done a mapping\nof several frequency bands of the area in which the\
    \ UAV would be deployed, therefore\nenabling the occupancy pattern recognition\
    \ and, subsequently, prediction by machine\nlearning (ML) algorithms [48].\n4.2.1.\
    \ Internet of Flying Things\nThe increased demand for highly connected devices\
    \ originated the concept of IoT. In\nIoT, a massive number of “things” (i.e.,\
    \ devices) are connected to the Internet, in order\nto exchange information for\
    \ the most diverse applications and purposes, from gains in\nefﬁciency to expansion\
    \ of functions.\nBecause of the IoT rise, there is a major demand for integrating\
    \ UAVs with this network.\nHowever, due to the special features involving Flying\
    \ Ad hoc Networks (FANETS) and\nthese aircraft, the IoFT was created. IoFT is\
    \ a new research ﬁeld that differs to IoT in scope\nof research, despite being\
    \ related areas.\nIoFT speciﬁc challenges range from regulatory issues to hardware\
    \ and software limita-\ntions. Regarding security, as the UAVs are critical embedded\
    \ systems, so a network security\nissue may generate a safety issue. The security\
    \ challenges in IoFT are diverse, involving\nthe physical, data link, transport,\
    \ session, and application layers [7].\n4.2.2. UAV-Aided 5G\nUAVs may play an\
    \ important role for 5G and beyond 5G (B5G), as future dronecell\nnetworks [49].\
    \ Because cellular-connected UAV communication has unique characteristics\nrelated\
    \ to ground conventional cellular communication, this ﬁeld offers new research\n\
    challenges and opportunities. Zeng et al. [5] presented an overview of 5G in UAV\
    \ commu-\nnications, as well as emerging technologies and potential challenges.\n\
    CR is an enabling technology for using UAVs in 5G networks. In 5G, CR-based UAVs\n\
    may simultaneously access the wireless channel and fulﬁll their different roles\
    \ in trafﬁc\nsurveillance, disaster management, and package delivery [32].\n4.3.\
    \ Hardware Characteristics\nUsually, CR hardware consists of a radio platform,\
    \ typically an SDR, and a computer\nplatform. The Wireless Open-Access Research\
    \ Platform (WARP) from Rice University [26]\nand the USRP from Ettus Research\
    \ [25] are the most commonly deployed radio platforms\nfor CR [27].\nA recent\
    \ implementation of SDR, however, has been carried out using various methods\n\
    rather than considering the integration with UAVs. As a consequence, for UAVs,\
    \ overhead,\nenergy consumption, and time delays associated with conventional\
    \ SDR are constraints.\nAlternatively, Young and Bostian [27] built the SKIRL,\
    \ a simple and low-cost RFIC-based\nRF CR platform suitable for the experimentation\
    \ of small radio-controlled UAVs. The Hope\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n8 of 27\nRF\
    \ RFM22B [50] was used as the radio platform, whereas the BeagleBoard-xM [24]\
    \ single\nboard was deployed as the computer unit. This was done to reduce resource\
    \ consumption\nand simplify CR design.\nFigure 4 shows the physical dimensions\
    \ of the USRP B200, 97 × 155 millimeters, and\nthe Hope RF RFM23B, 16 × 16 millimeters.\
    \ For UAVs, particularly for micro UAVs, where\nphysical space is limited, so\
    \ if a large board is inserted to it, series of changes may be\ntriggered in the\
    \ aircraft system, conﬁguration, and scale. Thus, this difference in size is\n\
    critical. Moreover, the energy consumption of the Hope RF RFM22B is just 0.306\
    \ Wh in\nthe worst case scenario. The USRP B200, on the other hand, may have up\
    \ to 4.092 Wh\nof energy consumption. Because the energy capacity of a LiFe SourceHCAM6426\
    \ UAV\nlithium battery, a typical UAV battery, is just 12 Wh, energy consumption\
    \ is a key aspect to\ntake into account in this context.\nFigure 4. Physical aspects\
    \ of the Hope RF RFM23B on the left and the USRP B200 on the right. The\nboards\
    \ are shown in different size scales. Adapted from the work in [51].\n4.4. Software\
    \ Characteristics\nThe CR software design and applications can be divided into\
    \ multiple categories, from\nMAC protocols and routing algorithms to machine learning\
    \ approaches used to predict\nchannel occupancy. In this work, we summarize three\
    \ of those categories: (i) spectrum\nsensing algorithms, focusing mainly on transmitter\
    \ detection and identiﬁcation of spectrum\nholes [52,53]; (ii) methods to perform\
    \ the spectrum handover [54]; and (iii) and simulation\nsoftware [55].\n4.4.1.\
    \ Spectrum Sensing\nThe literature commonly refers to spectrum sensing as the\
    \ procedure of gathering\nand analyzing radio data to establish the spectrum occupancy\
    \ [56]. In order to detect\ntransmitters, some well-known methods can be employed,\
    \ i.e., Energy detector, Matched-\nﬁlter, and Cyclostationary feature detection.\
    \ These algorithms are connected with two\nhypotheses formally deﬁned as [57,58]\n\
    x(t) =\n(\nn(t),\nH0\ns(t) + n(t),\nH1\n(1)\nwhere H1 indicates the presence of\
    \ a licensed user, whereas H0 represents the null hypothe-\nsis. x represents\
    \ the received signal, t is the time sample, and s and n denote the PU signal\n\
    and the additive noise, respectively.\nIn cases where the signal receiver has\
    \ no prior information about the PU signal, the\nenergy detector algorithm may\
    \ be deployed at a low computational cost. It functions by\ncomparing a signal\
    \ sample from the data to a predeﬁned threshold, where a value higher\nthan the\
    \ threshold suggests the presence of a primary user, whereas a value smaller than\n\
    the threshold implies the lack of band utilization. The main downside of this\
    \ approach is\nthe ﬁxed threshold value, as noise power can differ over time possibly\
    \ assuming unknown\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n9 of 27\nbehavior. In this case, the\
    \ threshold could be surpassed by the noise power, indicating an\ninvalid PU presence\
    \ in a given spectrum band [59,60].\nThe matched-ﬁlter contrasts the current signal\
    \ with previous collected samples from\nthe same transmitter, in comparison to\
    \ the energy method. It appears to be more precise,\nhas a shorter sensing time\
    \ and maximizes the ratio of signal to noise (SNR). However, the\nneed for prior\
    \ knowledge of the form of the transmitter signal restricts its feasibility only\n\
    to the point where licensed users cooperate [61].\nIn order to check whether or\
    \ not the transmitted signal has periodicity, the cyclostation-\nary feature detection\
    \ adopts a spectral correlation function (SCF) [62]. Unlike the previous\napproaches,\
    \ it helps the CR user to distinguish between noise and user signal, improving\n\
    the efﬁciency of the algorithm in channels where there is greater noise [63].\
    \ Because of\nits computational complexity, perhaps the most serious drawback\
    \ of this approach is the\nneed for long processing time, an undesired characteristic\
    \ for small energy consumption\nsystems such as UAVs.\nFinally, machine learning\
    \ approaches have been adopted in the literature to enhance\nthe detection of\
    \ transmitters. The authors of [64] achieved an overall success rate of over\n\
    99.50% in predicting PU presence by using an Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) at\
    \ different\nSNR frequencies. Similarly, Zhang et al. [65] proposed a cooperative\
    \ detection device\ncombining the energy detector with ANNs, adding a basic ANN\
    \ for each SU, and a base\nstation responsible for ﬁnal decision-making, referred\
    \ to as the Fusion Center. Matinmikko\net al. [66] proposed a new Fuzzy logic\
    \ system to adapt each spectrum scenario to the most\nsuitable transmitter detection\
    \ algorithm. The reader may refer to the works in [67,68] for\nfurther information\
    \ concerning spectrum sensing techniques.\n4.4.2. Spectrum Handover\nThe channel\
    \ occupied by an unlicensed should ideally be vacant when a PU arrives.\nThis\
    \ is desirable in order to generate minimal interference to the primary user transmission.\n\
    The literature generally refers to the process of hoping to another channels as\
    \ spectrum\nhandover. It involves distinct strategies with regards to its integration\
    \ with spectrum\nsensing, such as non-handover, pure proactive, pure reactive,\
    \ hybrid, and ML approaches,\nwhich incorporates the preceding [54].\nIn the non-handover\
    \ strategy, the SU remains idle until the PU leaves the channel,\nresuming the\
    \ transmission of data later. Although spectrum sensing is limited solely to\n\
    current channel monitoring, the drawback of this concept is unveiled during a\
    \ long PU\ntransmission, which signiﬁcantly restricts the transmission time available\
    \ to the SU, in\nterms of detection of PU arrivals and departures.\nUnlike non-handover,\
    \ before and after the arrival of the PU, both pure proactive and\nreactive strategies\
    \ concentrate on handover to an idle channel, respectively. The pure\nproactive\
    \ algorithm tries to predict the arrival of the PU while perceiving the atmosphere\n\
    to locate a spectrum hole based on the trafﬁc pattern of the channel. On the contrary,\
    \ after\nthe identiﬁcation of the PU, the pure reactive approach only senses and\
    \ switches to an\nunused channel. A potential disadvantage in the pure proactive\
    \ method may be created by\na poor prediction of trafﬁc, leading to an unnecessary\
    \ handover, whereas the pure reactive\napproach may have a greater handover delay\
    \ just after a PU arrival due to the execution of\nthe spectrum sensing stage.\n\
    The hybrid handover strategy, taking advantage of the advantages of both methods,\n\
    incorporates both the proactive spectrum sensing phase, perceiving the spectrum\
    \ holes\nbefore the arrival of the PU, and reactive handover action. Therefore,\
    \ due to the proactive\nprocess, the handover delay is reduced, and not every\
    \ PU arrival needs to be predicted\nby the algorithm. However, the backup channel\
    \ can become obsolete before use, as in\nthe proactive method, thus driving the\
    \ algorithm to perform a supplementary spectrum\nsensing phase.\nThe literature\
    \ has stressed the utility of ML algorithms to overcome the complexities\nof spectrum\
    \ handover. Trigui et al. [69] developed a method of negotiating multi-agent\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 830\n10 of 27\nsystems that enables SUs to migrate opportunistically\
    \ to the most adequate spectrum\nband provided its characteristics, achieving\
    \ around 97% of spectrum utilization. An\ninvestigation on the Hidden Markov Model\
    \ (HMM) application for spectrum handover\nand simulated data showed that in detecting\
    \ transmission opportunities, this technique can\ngive SUs greater accuracy [70].\
    \ Finally, in order to achieve dynamic handover management,\nAnandakumar and Umamaheswari\
    \ [71] suggested a supervised Machine Learning (ML)\napproach referred to as Spectrum\
    \ Particle Swarm Optimization (SpecPSO), using Visitor\nLocation Register and\
    \ Home Location Register databases to train the algorithm.\n4.4.3. Simulation\
    \ Tools\nAll levels of abstraction, from the physical layer to protocols and routing,\
    \ should\nbe associated with a full CR simulation program. We have not found a\
    \ method in the\nliterature that embodies all these characteristics. The only\
    \ way to do this, to the best of\nour knowledge, is to combine open source resources,\
    \ such as radio simulators (e.g., GNU\nRadio [72] and CogWave [73]) and general\
    \ network simulators (e.g., Omnet++ [74] and\nns-3 [75]).\nGNU Radio is a free\
    \ and open source software designed to use its graphical user\ninterface ﬂow graphs\
    \ to simulate radio transmissions and signal processing (GNU Radio\nCompanion).\
    \ It could be compared to LabView [76] and Simulink [77]. Standard ﬂow\ngraph\
    \ blocks encompass waveform generators, modulators, instrumentation sinks, math\n\
    operators, ﬁlters, and Fourier analysis. It also facilitates the development of\
    \ new blocks\nusing the programming language C++, as well as the design of the\
    \ ﬂow graph using Python.\nIn addition, GNU Radio can be connected to SDR hardware,\
    \ thus allowing simulations\nfrom the testbed to be used.\nAnother open-source\
    \ program suggested for designing CR waveforms is CogWave. It\ninvolves many modulation\
    \ systems, including multichannel DAA-OFDM, Fathers, and\nothers from GNU Radio\
    \ (e.g., OFDM, BPSK, and QPSK). During run-time, CogWave is\nable to reconﬁgure\
    \ the modulation scheme and can communicate with SDR hardware, as\nwell as GNU\
    \ Radio, to provide real-time transmission between USRP devices.\nOmnet++ and\
    \ INET [78] have been widely used in the literature to simulate CR\nnetworks for\
    \ general network simulators [79–81]. Omnet++ offers a C++ component-based\narchitecture\
    \ where modules and components can be assembled using a graphical user\ninterface\
    \ or a high-level network description language, similar to ﬂow graphs in GNU\n\
    Radio (NED). Its modular architecture therefore eases the reusability of the built\
    \ models.\nFurthermore, INET offers protocols, templates, routing, and mobility\
    \ simulation as an\nopen-source model library for Omnet++.\nAnother well-established\
    \ tool is the ns-3. It is an open discrete-event simulation\nenvironment for network\
    \ research that provides C++ libraries of models for wired protocols,\nIP and\
    \ non-IP, wireless, dynamic routing protocols, and so forth. For instance, the\
    \ ns-3 has\nbeen applied in the simulation of CR networks regarding spectrum handover\
    \ [82], data\ncollection [83], and channel sharing [84].\nIt is necessary to note\
    \ that many programming languages can be used to build a custom\nsimulator, as\
    \ they provide access to several network and scientiﬁc libraries (e.g., Java,\
    \ C++,\nPython, and Julia). However, most simulation scenarios encountered in\
    \ the literature are\ncomplex enough to require thousands of lines of code, turning\
    \ this option impractical for\nmost of the problems.\n4.5. Spectrum Mobility\n\
    When a PU resumes transmission through the same channel as the SU, the latter\
    \ has\nto vacate the channel by suspending its transmission and restart communication\
    \ through a\nvacant channel. This CR feature is called Spectrum Mobility [54].\n\
    It is considered a daunting problem due to the erratic behavior of the wireless\
    \ medium\nin combination with the high mobility of UAVs. Thus, network protocols\
    \ for ground-based\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n11 of 27\nnetworks could not perform\
    \ as expected for UAVs, and their high mobility should be taken\ninto account\
    \ when designing CR-based UAV transport protocols [9,85].\nOne of the forms in\
    \ which an SU does not trigger disruption in a PU-licensed band\nis to perform\
    \ a spectrum handover as soon as the SU detects the existence of the PU. In\n\
    general, UAVs take their places in a CR network as SUs, and they are likely to\
    \ conduct\na high number of spectrum handovers, as they will be on a mission throughout\
    \ their\nroute in the presence of various PUs. Therefore, spectrum handover is\
    \ a key element in\nCR-based UAVs.\nA general spectrum handover process is shown\
    \ in Figure 5. A SU keeps monitoring\nthe spectrum environment during the evaluation\
    \ phase by sensing it. The link maintenance\nprocess begins when a handover signal\
    \ is identiﬁed, then the SU pauses its transmission\nand performs a channel handover\
    \ to a backup channel and resumes its transmission,\nreturning to the evaluation\
    \ phase.\nA handover trigger could be provided by a PU or by the SU itself, depending\
    \ on the\napplication purposes and signal quality. Depending on the spectrum handover\
    \ strategy,\na backup channel could be searched proactively during the assessment\
    \ process, and a\nchannel handover could also be performed proactively.\nOn the\
    \ other hand, both backup channel scanning and channel handover are per-\nformed\
    \ reactively in a reactive technique. A new backup channel has to be checked,\
    \ and\nanother channel handover attempt is made if a channel handover is not successful\
    \ due\nto any incident affecting the target channel (e.g., a PU started a transmission\
    \ through the\ntarget channel) [54].\nFigure 5. Spectrum handover process. Adapted\
    \ from the work in [54].\nConsiderable energy consumption is required in a spectrum\
    \ handover. Furthermore,\nsome communication problems, such as packet loss and\
    \ delay, may increase during the\nspectrum handover process. In a spectrum handover,\
    \ delay is also a signiﬁcant performance\nfactor [86].\nFigure 6 demonstrates\
    \ the effect of the spectrum handover delay over a SU after many\nPU channel reclaims.\
    \ In that case, an SU establishes a connection whose operation requires\nthe completion\
    \ of 7 time slots. However, due to successive PU arrivals, the process needs\n\
    9 time slots. Nevertheless, as the existence of a PU on channel Ch1 is quite short,\
    \ the ﬁrst\nSU channel handover was unnecessarily executed, which means that the\
    \ SU was submitted\nto excessive channel handover costs [87].\nSensors 2021, 21,\
    \ 830\n12 of 27\nFigure 6. Spectrum handover delay caused to an SU. Adapted from\
    \ the work in [87].\nUAVs designed for real-time multimedia broadcasting can cause\
    \ unsatisfactory user\nexperience, as spectrum handover latency can have a signiﬁcant\
    \ effect on delay-sensitive\napplications. For optimal transmission, therefore,\
    \ delay reduction has to be considered [88].\n5. Developing a Simple and Low-Cost\
    \ CR-Based UAV Testbed\nOne of the main obstacles when integrating CR into UAVs\
    \ is the energy consumption.\nDevices such as USRP B200 [25] have a consumption\
    \ around 4.1 Wh, whereas a commercial\nquad-rotor UAV like DJI Phantom 4 [89]\
    \ has a LiPo 4S battery with 81.3 Wh of capacity,\nwhich ensure a max ﬂight time\
    \ up to 28 min. This issue has been subject of empirical\nevaluations in Young\
    \ and Bostian [27], where the authors apply the Hope’s RF RFM22B [50]\nto greatly\
    \ reduce the energy utilization (0.3 Wh), although it likewise reduces the coverage\n\
    range from USRP’s 70 MHz–6 GHz Hope’s 433–915 GHz.\nThe employment of miniaturized\
    \ SDR devices could also help to reduce the additional\nweight load of UAV. For\
    \ instance, Phantom 4 weights 1380 g, whereas USRP B200 weights\n350 g. In comparison,\
    \ Hope’s RF RFM22B weights only 1.8 g. The additional load could\ninﬂuence not\
    \ solely the weight capacity of the aircraft, but also the energy consumption.\n\
    Ultimately, the impact on the load capacity of the UAV poses as a major drawback\
    \ on\nmobile manipulating UAVs [90].\nFinally, there is no conclusive information\
    \ referring to the maximum transmission\ndistance of both USRP’s and Hope’s SDRs,\
    \ as well as for other manufacturers. A limited\ntransmission distance can be\
    \ a tricky feature, potentially limiting the assimilation of CR\ninto UAV Swarms.\
    \ One probable solution to this shortcoming is the use of signal ampliﬁers;\n\
    however, it is essential to note that additional weight load could result in less\
    \ ﬂight time,\nespecially in swarms where the UAVs individual weight could reach\
    \ 500 g in medium\nrange devices or even less in short range devices.\n5.1. The\
    \ Testbed Components\nThe ﬁrst step towards building this testbed is to develop\
    \ and test a CR platform\nwith the purpose to integrate it with the UAV. We developed\
    \ one using a Raspberry Pi 3\nconnected to an RTL SDR 820T2 [91] as the radio\
    \ front-end with a basic antenna. The RTL\nSDR 820T2 is a simple and low-cost\
    \ USB SDR receptor, which frequency coverage varies\nfrom 30 MHz to 1.8 GHz.\n\
    Although the RTL SDR 820T2 does not support wireless data transmission (it only\n\
    supports wireless data reception), its low-cost feature makes it a valuable tool\
    \ for CR\nexperiments, as most of the gaps are not found in the transmission itself,\
    \ but in the received\ndata processing and decision-making. For example, to evaluate\
    \ a given spectrum handover\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n13 of 27\nalgorithm, a CR\
    \ device is not required to transmit wireless data itself. It only needs to sense\n\
    the environment and decide whether to vacate the channel.\nWe choose a Parrot\
    \ AR.Drone 2.0 [92] UAV to be integrated with the CR platform\nbuilt for this\
    \ work. Because Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 is a typical commercial drone widely\nused\
    \ for entertainment, it ﬁts the “keep it simple” requirement of this testbed,\
    \ and it is\nalso appropriated to test the CR platform suitability to mini-UAVs.\
    \ Because the Parrot\nAR.Drone 2.0 is not open in hardware nor in software (except\
    \ for an SDK intended for\nthe development of smartphones, smartwatches, or VR\
    \ glasses applications [93]), it is not\npossible to make any changes directly\
    \ to the UAV. Therefore, here we use Parrot simply as\nthe UAV platform; the Raspberry\
    \ Pi 3 is used as the CR computer component. However,\nboth the CR platform and\
    \ the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 run Linux operating systems [93];\ntherefore, this work\
    \ results are equally valid not only for Linux-based computer platforms\n(like\
    \ the Raspberry Pi 3), but also for open-source/open-hardware Linux-based UAVs.\
    \ Note\nthat for such UAVs it may be possible to use the same single board as\
    \ the computational\nunit of both the CR and the UAV itself.\nMoreover, this UAV\
    \ provides a USB port on its top. This port can be used as an\ninterface to connect\
    \ the CR platform to it. Figure 7 shows a picture taken in the laboratory\nof\
    \ the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 without its hull, in which it is possible to see its\
    \ USB port.\nFigure 7. The Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 without its hull, highlighting\
    \ its USB port.\nBecause of the low energy supply provided by the Parrot AR.Drone\
    \ 2.0, it was neces-\nsary to efﬁciently adapt the CR platform. We changed its\
    \ operational system to Ubuntu\nMate, in order to have a better general compatibility\
    \ with third-party software and more\ncontrol over unnecessary background processing.\
    \ It was also integrated with RLTSDR-\nScanner, which is an open-source cross\
    \ platform Python frequency scanning tool for RTL\nSDR [94].\nFinally, it was\
    \ possible possible to deploy the CR-based UAV prototype outdoors.\nFigure 8 shows\
    \ the prototype developed and deployed in this work. Because of the\ninﬂuence\
    \ that an indoor environment could cause to radio data collection (for instance,\n\
    because of walls, other devices, etc.), outdoor data collection is a key factor\
    \ to determine\nthe quality of the collected data.\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n14\
    \ of 27\n \n \nFigure 8. The CR-based UAV prototype developed for this work.\n\
    5.2. Outdoor Radio Data Collection of a Jamming Attack\nThe experiment we conducted\
    \ in this work comprises executing a typical jamming\nattack to the CR-based UAV\
    \ prototype outdoor. The CR should detect the jammed fre-\nquency range as busy\
    \ and then switch to a backup frequency, thus avoiding the jamming\nattack consequences.\n\
    In this experiment, we used a jammer device capable of jamming the frequency\n\
    432 MHz and the CR-based UAV testbed. First, we deployed the CR-based UAV sensing\n\
    the 432 MHz frequency. Second, we used the jammer device to execute the jamming\
    \ attack\nto that frequency. The CR-based UAV then sensed the high signal level\
    \ in that frequency\nand it autonomously switched to its backup frequency. Although\
    \ it was an outdoor\nexperiment, it was important to isolate it, keeping it away\
    \ from other variables. Therefore,\nwe experimentally deﬁned its backup channel\
    \ as 440 MHz and its level threshold to −40 dB.\nIt was necessary to avoid that\
    \ other PUs and/or SUs interfered in the experiment, and to\nreduce the incidence\
    \ of false alarms.\nFigure 9 shows that the CR-based UAV prototype performed as\
    \ expected under a\njamming attack.\nFigure 9. Data collected using the CR-based\
    \ UAV. It kept using the 432 MHz frequency until it sensed\na transmission level\
    \ over the threshold. It then switched to its backup channel at 440 MHz.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 830\n15 of 27\nFor a clearer understanding of the radio spectrum environment\
    \ within the frequency\nrange from 432 MHz to 441 MHz, we used the CR platform\
    \ to make a data collection\nduring a jamming attack, in similar circumstances\
    \ to the CR-based UAV testbed experiment.\nFigure 10 shows the data collected.\
    \ It highlights the 432 MHz frequency level discrepancy\nunder the jamming attack,\
    \ related to other frequencies within the measured range.\nFigure 10. Data collected\
    \ using the CR platform. It shows a map of the level in dB measured within\nthe\
    \ frequency range from 432 MHz to 441 MHz throughout the time.\nThese results\
    \ show that even switching to a channel around the same frequency bands\ncould\
    \ be enough to avoid a jamming attack, considering the attacker does not have\
    \ access\nto the new channel. Furthermore, note that we used a simple reactive\
    \ algorithm based\non static channel noise threshold, but especially proactive\
    \ algorithms may beneﬁt from\nsuch data collections, as Machine Learning techniques\
    \ could be trained and tested over\nreal-scenario data.\n6. State-of-the-Art of\
    \ CR-Based UAVs\nWe conducted a review in November 2020 in search of works involving\
    \ UAVs and\nSDR and/or CR. The main idea was to ﬁnd the state-of-the-art of CR-based\
    \ UAVs. As\nSDR-based UAVs represent somehow a step backwards for CR-based UAVs,\
    \ they were also\nincluded in this review.\nWe evaluated a total of 520 publications\
    \ from four different digital libraries. However,\nthe majority of these articles\
    \ were identiﬁed marginally related to the scope of this work.\nThus, the ﬁnal\
    \ studies dataset obtained after analyzing them regarding the following\nexclusion\
    \ criteria consisted of 64 articles:\n1.\nnon-English publications. Although we\
    \ used English language keywords, we found\na few publications in other languages.\
    \ We had to exclude them merely because we\nwould not be able to analyze them\
    \ in depth;\n2.\npapers that are not downloadable online;\n3.\npublications that\
    \ are not related to CR, SDR, or UAVs as deﬁned in this work (other\nresearch\
    \ ﬁelds);\n4.\npapers focusing on CR or SDR applications other than UAVs wireless\
    \ communication.\nFigure 11 outlines the number of publications per year, among\
    \ those selected in this\nreview. It shows an increasing interest over the recent\
    \ years in this research ﬁeld. Although\nthe year of 2020 was evaluated from January\
    \ until November, it already has a high number\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n16 of 27\n\
    of publications. Note that a number of papers might have been published from January\n\
    2020 to November 2020, but were not yet available online.\nFigure 11. Related\
    \ publications per year. The year of 2020 was evaluated from January until November.\n\
    Figure 12 presents keywords graph and occurrence mapping for all 64 articles selected\n\
    on this review. We consider keywords with at least two occurrences and at least\
    \ one\nlink to other keywords. Thereby, the keyword mapping consists of 34 keywords\
    \ in total.\nIn Figure 12, it is possible to note an expressive amount of links\
    \ correlating UAV-related\nkeywords and SDR-related keywords. However, although\
    \ CR-related keywords are present\nin Figure 12, there are few links correlating\
    \ them to UAVs. Thus, Figure 12 outlines the\npaucity of studies on the integration\
    \ of CR and UAVs.\nFigure 12. Keywords graph and occurrence mapping for all 64\
    \ articles selected on this review.\nIn order to measure how ﬁt each selected\
    \ publication is to CR-based UAVs research\nﬁeld, we analyzed each paper regarding\
    \ the following aspects:\n1.\nthe work presents a theoretical analysis (Q1);\n\
    2.\nthe work presents practical results (Q2);\n3.\nthe work involves a real SDR-based\
    \ UAV (Q3);\n4.\nthe work is centered on CR-based UAVs (Q4);\n5.\nthe work involves\

    \ be separated in two groups: one using SDR-based UAVs\nfor different applications,\
    \ and another studying the impact of integrating CR technology\nwith UAVs, mainly\
    \ with theoretical analysis and simulation results.\nA notable exception to this\
    \ is Sklivanitis et al. [119]. The authors designed, developed,\nand validated\
    \ through real indoor and outdoor experiments a CR platform for UAVs. Their\n\
    experiment involves on-ground CR nodes interacting with a CR-based UAV, and it\
    \ shows\nthat their proposed platform optimizes wireless networks subject to interference,\
    \ thus\nmaximizing their throughput. To the best of our knowledge, their work\
    \ presents the ﬁrst\nCR-based UAV real experiment in the literature.\n7. Challenges\
    \ and Future Research Directions\nTo better grasp how the occupation pattern behaves\
    \ in spectrum bands, a channel\nwhite-space mapping may be helpful. As the authors\
    \ of [90] demonstrated, distinct areas\non the map (Figure 13) may have a varied\
    \ spectrum behavior. Therefore, a data exploration\nstudy like this is essential\
    \ to improve the PU arrival prediction and, consequently, enhance\nthe spectrum\
    \ handover. In addition, a white-space mapped area may be crucial in order to\n\
    achieve an UAV ﬂight path guided by spectrum occupancy.\nAlthough some studies\
    \ [153–156] have successfully employed Machine Learning algo-\nrithms to predict\
    \ the PUs arrivals, most of them use simulated data. Even though simulated\ndata\
    \ have importance in proof-testing new approaches, real data are indispensable\
    \ when\nintegrating UAVs to CR. Likewise, these studies generally concentrate\
    \ on prediction of one\nor few channels, although a large range of channels may\
    \ be preferable on UAV context.\nSensors 2021, 21, 830\n19 of 27\nFigure 13. Amount\
    \ of 6 MHz TV channels available for SUs in the United States in 2015. Adapted\n\
    from the work in [90].\nAs noted before, the proportion of SDR devices presents\
    \ as a major challenge. Al-\nthough devices such as Hope’s RF RFM22B may initially\
    \ comply with this requirement,\na device with a wider frequency range may be\
    \ desirable for the use in UAV communica-\ntion. In consonance with hardware improvements,\
    \ to the extent of our knowledge, there\nhas been no study concerning the software\
    \ adjustments required when combining SDR\nand UAVs.\n8. Conclusions\nIn this\
    \ paper, we presented an overview on CR-based UAVs, as well as their hardware\n\
    and software requirements. We also indicated the ﬁrst steps taken towards integrating\
    \ CR\nwith UAVs, and a review of the state-of-the-art of CR for UAV communications.\
    \ This work\nhas also shown that several questions remain unclear, in particular\
    \ regarding the impact\nof CR to UAVs energy consumption, and the effects of UAVs\
    \ mobility to CR spectrum\nmobility and spectrum sharing. We also speciﬁed steps\
    \ to build a simple and low-cost\nCR-based UAV testbed.\nFuture work shall consider\
    \ a channel occupation mapping aiming at achieving an\nUAV ﬂight path guided by\
    \ spectrum occupancy. PU arrivals prediction based on Machine\nLearning algorithms\
    \ on real data collected by UAVs is a key element concerning the study\nof CR\
    \ algorithms for UAVs. Finally, CR hardware and software that meet the constraints\n\
    and requirements of UAVs are also needed.\nAuthor Contributions: Papers compilation,\

  analysis: 'The study explores the application of cognitive radio (CR) to enhance
    the 4G (LTE) co-existence with Wi-Fi/IoT networks in the unlicensed 5 GHz frequency
    band. It proposes a system model that leverages CR''s capabilities to overcome
    interference challenges and ensure fair and friendly spectrum sharing between
    U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT users.


    The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed system through simulations
    that compare the back-off rates of Wi-Fi signals in non-LBT and LBT scenarios.
    The results indicate that LBT using CR significantly reduces the back-off rate,
    enabling harmonious co-existence and improved performance for Wi-Fi/IoT users
    in the shared spectrum.


    The study contributes to addressing the point about different data types, their
    collection, and use in the broader context of automated, real-time irrigation
    management by introducing the application of CR in U-LTE for effective spectrum
    utilization, especially for incumbent Wi-Fi and IoT communications.

    8 Citations Explore all metrics Abstract The advanced cellular network, long term
    evolution (LTE) that presently operates in licensed spectrum has been extended
    to unlicensed LTE (U-LTE) to improve data rate and spectral efficiency by utilizing
    unlicensed spectrum. Carrier aggregation of 3GPPLTE-A supports the aggregation
    of licensed and unlicensed spectrum in small and femto cells to provide better
    user experience. The proposed work consists of two objectives, first to accomplish
    the listen-before-talk (LBT) regulatory requirement of radio communication in
    U-LTE and the second to enhance their co-existence with Wi-Fi/IoT users in a non-interference
    style by reducing the back-off rate of Wi-Fi. The importance of spectrum utilization
    by the incumbent users of unlicensed band for the upcoming Internet of Things
    communications is also a key consideration in this work. The recently evolved
    intelligent technology viz. Cognitive radio (CR) is applied in the proposed system
    model to meet the objectives. A ground research is done in a simulation environment
    of LTE signals and 5 GHz band to evaluate the back-off rate of Wi-Fi. A comparative
    performance analysis between proposed and existing systems are also done and presented
    in this paper. Similar content being viewed by others LTE/Wi-Fi Coexistence in

    An Opportunistic Coexistence Analysis of LTE and Wi-Fi in Unlicensed 5 GHz Frequency
    Band Article 13 March 2023 1 Introduction LTE networks are carrying increasing
    amount of data. Reducing the cell size to meet the data demand is not the complete
    solution and the need for more spectrums still exists. The usage of unlicensed
    spectrum alongside licensed bands provides an attractive opportunity for LTE operators
    to satisfy their subscribers’ data demand. Unlicensed LTE (U-LTE) is most interested
    in enabling its access in 5GHz ISM unlicensed band. The reason is quite simple
    as several hundred MHz of spectrum bandwidth is available in 5GHz. One main constraint
    for accessing these frequencies is being able to coexist with other Wi-Fi/IoT
    users i.e. listen before talk (LBT) is required. In this paper, the proposed work
    realizes the LBT requirement of U-LTE with the usage of cognitive radio (CR).
    The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives the
    overview of U-LTE, its evolution and open issues in co-existence with 5GHz band.
    Section 3 describes the features of Cognitive Radio Networks, its compliance with
    5GHz band and spectrum sensing techniques. Section 4 summarizes the existing related
    works of proposed system. Section 5 presents the formulated proposed system and
    followed by simulation architecture and results in Sect. 6. The outcome of proposed
    work is concluded in Sect. 7. 2 Unlicensed- LTE (U-LTE) 2.1 Need for U-LTE The
    3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) [1] got inspired to function on fourth-generation
    (4G) mobile namely LTE to meet the very high data usage by recently evolved multimedia
    applications. 3GPP releases R13 and R14 [2, 3] includes LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) and
    narrow band-IoT (NB-IoT). Also 3GPP release 15 concentrates on LTE-Advanced Pro
    with a data rate of 3Gbps and bandwidth of 640MHz [4]. Besides ultra mobile broadband
    and WiMax (IEEE 802.16), LTE competes with several other 4G standards. Followed
    by the US government approval of the first “LTE-U” devices, T-Mobile USA is ready
    to deploy over 5GHz frequencies [5]. High data rate, low latency, packet optimized
    radio-access technology and flexible bandwidth are the main goals of LTE. Also,
    its network architecture too supports packet-switched traffic with persistent
    mobility and high quality of service. Anyhow, the cellular operators are limited
    by the allocation of licensed frequency spectrum. Qualcomm, Huawei and Ericsson
    influenced the 3GPP standards committee to allow LTE service to run on the 5 GHz
    band. This 5 GHz band is one of two unlicensed bands that are typically used by
    Wi-Fi service. 5 GHz is the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII)
    band and since it is relatively less congested, when compared to the common 2.4
    GHz ISM band and because new software has been developed to make the various signals
    play nice within a shared spectrum band, U-LTE in the 5GHz band is winning acceptance.
    5 GHz band has a shorter communication range due to higher path loss but has wider
    available bandwidth. Figure 1 shows the unlicensed spectrum layout in several
    different main regions at 5 GHz band [1]. Fig. 1 Unlicensed spectrum in different
    regions Full size image 2.2 Carrier aggregation in U-LTE The first design principle
    of U-LTE is the integration with licensed spectrum [6]. The integration between
    unlicensed and licensed carriers both operating LTE is the key operating mechanism.
    The carrier aggregation (CA) mechanisms defined in LTE Rel-10 to Rel-12 can serve
    this purpose in target scenarios. Several spectrums are aggregated to create large
    “virtual” career bandwidths to support LTE services, which is the key feature
    of LTE-Advanced (LTE-A). For commercial purpose, operators deploy CA as the prime
    feature of LTE-A. The current bandwidth (up to 20 MHz) of LTE got enhanced by
    this CA and as well as it ensures the backward compatibility. The users also get
    benefits in terms of high data rates and increased average data rates. CA enables
    the combination of up to five LTE Release 8 (Rel-8) compatible carriers [7]. The
    licensed LTE carriers are Primary carriers and unlicensed carriers are Secondary
    carriers. Since the secondary carriers are under the control of primary in situations
    like load shifting and channel adaption, the security and service QoS are ensured.
    Moreover, control plane messages are always transmitted on the licensed band and
    thus QoS is ensured. The user-plane data can be transmitted on either licensed
    or unlicensed carriers. 2.3 5 GHz band and Wi-Fi/IoT usage The internet of things
    (IoT) or machine-to-machine (M2M) communications is one of the most exciting and
    fastest growing technologies across the globe today. It employs the embedded technology
    with sensors and actuators, connects to other devices or to cloud, and automatically
    transmits information. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, Active RFID, loWPAN, EtherCAT,
    NFC, RFID, etc. are the standards and proprietary solutions used by the devices
    to connect among themselves as well as with cloud [8]. Based on the physical characteristics
    of the environment and presence of obstacles like wood, concrete, metal, etc.
    the volume of sensors, their range and data rates, the technology used to connect
    the devices will be chosen. Wi-Fi has been the most successful among these technologies
    listed above due its adaptability, scalability, ease of use and cost. In view
    of its advantages, Wi-Fi has become a ubiquitous standard of connectivity and
    is used in the residential building, commercial enterprises, educational institutions,
    hospitals, airports etc. As the 2.4GHz band is meant for unlicensed users, it
    is presently heavily crowded and hence, the IoT device communication and Wi-Fi
    are shifting to less crowded 5 GHz band. Therefore, it is necessary to safe guard
    the 5 GHz band for its incumbent users viz. IoT and Wi-Fi. In this perspective,
    the proposed work addresses the importance of saving 5 GHz band for the next generation
    wireless communications. 2.4 Coexistence features Due to non-exclusive usage nature
    of unlicensed spectrum by U-LTE, there are two main challenges. The foremost challenge
    of design of U-LTE is its coexistence with Wi-Fi/IoT systems on a fair and friendly
    basis. The Wi-Fi/IoT systems are the user-deployed systems and they are the incumbent
    users or primary users of the unlicensed band. The PHY/MAC implementation differences
    between LTE transmissions and Wi-Fi/IoT, hinders the direct implementation of
    U-LTE transmissions as it can generate continuous interference to Wi-Fi/IoT systems.
    Second is the coexistence of two or more different U-LTE operators in the same
    unlicensed band. The operation in unlicensed band also needs to factor in the
    regulatory requirements of a given region. In some markets, like Europe, Japan
    and India, a specific waveform requirement on supporting listen-before-talk (LBT)
    at milliseconds scale is required which would need changes in LTE air interface.
    In other markets, like US, Korea and China, there are no such requirements. In
    these countries, with carefully designed coexistence mechanisms realizable by
    software to ensure peaceful coexistence with Wi-Fi/IoT, operators can deploy LTE
    in unlicensed bands that are compatible with Rel. 10/11 3GPP LTE standards. In
    markets where LBT is required, LTE in unlicensed operation can be further optimized
    through air interface enhancement with the introduction of LBT feature potentially
    in 3GPP Release 13 [9, 10]. Number of PHY/MAC modifications is required to meet
    regulatory requirements in LBT regions. The required modifications are defined
    in LTE release 13 and beyond, providing a standard LBT mechanism for LTE to coexist
    with Wi-Fi/IoT and other access technologies within the unlicensed bands. Especially,
    LTE PHY/MAC enhancements are required to meet the functionalities such as clear
    channel assessment, discontinuous transmission (DTX) with limited maximum transmission
    duration, UE support for carrier selection and modified HARQ protocol to enable
    LBT. In summary, it may be arrived that besides Qualcomm, Nokia and Huawei, researchers
    have not addressed the coexistence issue for U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT extensively.
    3 Cognitive radio networks 3.1 Features of CRN CR is defined by the Federal Communication
    Commission (FCC) as the radio that is capable of changing its transmission parameters
    as it interact with the environment that it operates on [11]. Increase in high
    data rate requirements has results in increase in wireless communications. The
    inefficacious allocation of frequencies in licensed band leaves white spaces in
    the spectrum while the cellular bands are overloaded [12]. For effective utilization
    of spectrum and also to meet the spectrum demands, FCC revisited the problem of
    spectrum management [13] and this leads to CR invention. The IEEE 802.22 is the
    standard for cognitive wireless regional area networks (WRANs). The main goal
    of CR is to identify the unused licensed spectrum for secondary users (SU) without
    interfering Primary Users (PU) and this method of sharing is often called as Dynamic
    Spectrum Access (DSA). 3.2 Cognitive radio in 5GHz band Cognitive radio is the
    key technology that can enhance the convergence of next-generation wireless devices
    those operate in IEEE 802.11 and IEEE 802.16 standards. The flexibility in the
    hardware and its feasibility to program for a band or mode enables CR to adapt
    over to an ISM band or up to an IEEE band and even to unlicensed 5GHz bands. In
    5GHz band, two types of networks are considered to be operating, primary and secondary
    or cognitive radio networks (CRN). The incumbent users of 5GHz such as regular
    Wi-Fi users and IoT communications operate the primary network. The cognitive
    radio networks only access the spectral band not used by the primary band. Each
    CRN can be made to use multiple channels for better performance by adopting modulation
    schemes using software defined radio (SDR) devices such as Universal Software
    Defined Radio Peripheral (USRP). Therefore, CR dynamically monitors certain bands
    of the 5GHz unlicensed spectrum to identify the idle spectrum and uses them as
    needed [14]. 3.3 Future of CR In future of internet of things (IoT), the fact
    is that billions of objects are expected to be interconnected through wireless
    results in huge volume of traffic with high demand in spectrum [15, 16]. The spectrum
    is finite in nature and becoming rare and expensive. As a result of it, the IoT
    paradigm requires the innovative CR paradigm to go hand in hand to meet the demands
    of spectrum. Also, based on the approaches of the dynamic use of frequencies pursued
    to provide high spectral efficiency, CR fits itself to support 5G networks. CR
    principles can be incorporated to enable the spectral coexistence of two or more
    than two heterogeneous wireless networks in different dimensions such as time,
    frequency, spatial, polarization, and geographical space through cognitive beam
    forming, cognitive interference alignment, adaptive power control, carrier aggregation,
    dynamic carrier/bandwidth allocation. 3.4 Sensing techniques The various parameters
    of spectrum such as radio channel characteristics, white spaces, transmit power;
    interference, noise and operating environment are sensed and measured by the spectrum
    [17]. Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks (CRN) is done for two purposes.
    One is to identify the spectrum opportunities (white spaces), other to detect
    the interference in the spectrum. White space detection is done by non-cooperative
    approach (also known as Primary transmitter method) and Cooperative/collaborative
    approach. Non-cooperative approach includes match filter based detection, energy
    based detection, covariant-based detection, cyclostationary-based detection, waveform
    based detection, etc. In cooperative/collaborative approach, a primary user is
    detected based on collective information from multiple cognitive radio users.
    This approach includes either centralized access to the spectrum coordinated by
    a spectrum server or distributed approach [18]. Interference temperature detection
    and primary receiver detection are the other interference based sensing approaches.
    In former method, secondary users are allowed to coexist with primary with low
    transmission power and monitored by the interference temperature level. The second
    method detects the interference based on the primary receiver’s local oscillator
    leakage power. 4 Related works Extensive research has proved that CR is the promising
    technology to improve the spectrum utilization/sharing in an opportunistic manner.
    Few researches have adopted CR to enhance the spectrum sharing in femto cells
    of LTE/LTE-A networks [19, 20]. In such research works femto cells are made cognitive
    to improve the QoS parameters. In [21] authors have studied the Type 2 sensing
    (interference detection) for single-input single-output system of LTE-Advanced
    network. They use conventional energy detection method to sense the spectrum in
    cognitive radio technology and no innovative methods are introduced. Alternative
    methods to sense spectrum is still an open issue for research. The authors in
    [22] analyses the throughput (THR) with changing bandwidth in LTE-A environment,
    Path-loss (PL), the effect of distance between the macro user and femto cell on
    Signal-interference noise ratio (SINR) using cognitive radio. In [23], the authors
    have focused on improving resource efficiency in LTE network by considering CR
    device to device (D2D) communication links. In [24, 25], the quality of service
    (QoS) maximization requirement for secondary users in CRN built upon 3GPP LTE
    platform was experimented. All these research works have tried to cognitize the
    LTE/LTE-A femto cell to improve their efficiency in terms of throughput, spectrum
    sharing, spectrum utilizations, etc. and however no attempt was made to apply
    CR in U-LTE. Co-existence of U-LTE/LTE-A networks with existing wireless networks
    is regarded as the latest paradigms. A considerable research has done to reduce
    the interference level of U-LTE/LTE-A to Wi-Fi users. In early U-LTE with non-LBT
    feature, Qualcomm [9] proposed Carrier Sensing Adaptive Transmission (CSAT) with
    TDM cycle sharing mechanism for coexistence of U-LTE signals with other existing
    wireless technologies. This method resulted in increased delay perceived by U-LTE
    users. Qualcomm has also done the design modifications to meet LBT requirements
    using Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) method and has proven better results. In
    our previous work [26], the coexistence of U-LTE with Wi-Fi in unlicensed 5 GHz
    band in non-LBT fashion was studied. The simulation results proved the unfair
    sharing of spectrum between them. Hence, in this proposed work, considering the
    Indian market scenario, where LBT requirement is mandatory for coexistence of
    U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT, the basic feature of CCA is combined with CR for effective
    protection of incumbent Wi-Fi user’s performance and presented in the proceeding
    sections. The Wi-Fi/IoT communications are considered as primary network. The
    U-LTE is the secondary or CRN, which access the idle spectrum of 5GHz when not
    used by Wi-Fi/IoT users. Yet another open issue is the Co-existence of several
    U-LTE operators named as inter-operator spectrum sharing. In this scenario the
    unlicensed spectrum need to be shared among inter operators as well as with incumbent
    users of unlicensed band. However, such is issue is beyond the scope of this paper
    and presented only to serve the purpose of literature review. 5 Cognitive radio
    in U-LTE 5.1 System model The proposed system is so modeled that it utilizes the
    attributes of the CR to optimally operate U-LTE in U-NII band (5 GHz). As LBT
    feature is mandatory in regions like Europe, Japan and India, an efficient mechanism
    is to be devised to share the unlicensed spectrum with Wi-Fi, the primary users
    of the specified band in a non-interference basis and also paving the way for
    the currently evolving IoT or Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. In Fig.
    2, the deployment scenario of U-LTE along with Wi-Fi/IoT users is shown. User
    equipment (UEs) and IoT devices, by communicating with Wi-Fi access point (AP)
    using the unlicensed spectrum, form a femto cell and become primary users. During
    their communications with eNodeB (eNB), UEs form a small cell and try to utilize
    the unlicensed spectrum and become secondary users. As mentioned earlier, U-LTE
    operates in two modes: supplemental downlink (SDL) and time division duplex (TDD).
    In SDL mode, the unlicensed spectrum is used only for downlink traffic. Operations
    such as ensuring reliable communications, checking availability of intended unlicensed
    channel are performed by eNB node [27]. Fig. 2 Deployment scenario of U-LTE with
    Wi-Fi/IoT users Full size image For TDD mode, the unlicensed spectrum is used
    for uplink and downlink, resulting additional implementation complexity in UEs
    for LBT feature. Latest release of 3GPP LTE standard Rel.13 supports usage of
    unlicensed spectrum in both operating modes [10]. In this work, SDL mode is considered
    and the eNB is equipped with CR for the purposes of detecting idle spectrum and
    communicating without causing interferences to primary users. The proposed method
    of applying CR features in U-LTE for effective utilization of 5 GHz band is given
    in Fig. 3. The request for data transmission from eNB triggers the CR to identify
    the white space or the clean channel by sensing the spectrum. Upon the successful
    identification of the clean channel, downlink transmissions take place between
    the terminal devices. The channel can be occupied for a fixed time named as Channel
    Occupancy Time (CCT) for 10 ms as stated by ETSI standards [28]. To comply with
    the demands of U-LTE and to facilitate the coexistence of them with incumbent
    users in a non-interference basis, CR senses the spectrum at regular intervals
    to cater their needs by allocating idle spectrum until the end of their transmissions.
    Fig. 3 System model Full size image The usage pattern by U-LTE users varies from
    few milliseconds, hours or days in multiples of CCT slots and considered as long
    lasting opportunities. However, there are also short-lasting opportunities where
    spectral idleness will expire before the usage by the U-LTE. But this study focuses
    only on spectrum opportunities lasting at least for few seconds. 5.2 Channel and
    traffic model Considering DSA network of CR, the following are the assumptions
    made to formulate the channel and traffic model [29]. 1. The U-NII band spectrum
    is divided into C identical channels shared by primary and secondary users. The
    channels are assumed to be perfect i.e. they are either busy or free. 2. Newly
    arriving requests from primary or secondary will be allocated a free channel,
    if available. If they do not find a free channel, they back off. 3. For a primary/secondary
    user i, the channel is occupied for a period and available for a period \(T_{Busy}^{(i)}\)
    and available for a period \(T_{free}^{(i)}\). 4. Primary and secondary users
    make requests for channel according to Poisson process with arrival rate \(\uplambda
    \hbox {p}\) and \(\uplambda \)sand they hold the channel for a time, which is
    exponentially distributed with mean \(1/\upmu \hbox {p}\) and 1/ \(\upmu \hbox
    {s}\) respectively. 5. p is the number of primary users with transmission time
    \(\upmu \hbox {p}\). s is the number of secondary users with transmission time
    \(\upmu \hbox {s}\). Their transition rate is defined as p\(\upmu \hbox {p}\)
    and s \(\upmu \hbox {s}\). 6. At any instant of time t, let s (t) and p (t) be
    the number of channels occupied by secondary and primary. 7. When primary and
    secondary users occupy p and s channels, a new arrival of primary request can
    occupy any one of the (C-p-s) channels. 8. When primary and secondary users occupy
    p and s channels, a new arrival of secondary request can occupy any one of the
    (C-p-s) channels. The probability that user i (primary / secondary) occupy the
    channel is given by $$\begin{aligned} T_{i}=\frac{T_{Busy}^{(i)}}{T_{Busy}^{(i)}-T_{free}^{(i)}}
    \end{aligned}$$ (1) The channel occupancy in the U-NII spectrum can be modeled
    using Markov chain. Let \(\Phi \) denotes the set of feasible states where \(\Phi
    = \{(\hbox {s, p}) {\vert } \hbox {s} \ge 0, \hbox {p} \ge 0\) and \(\hbox {s}
    + \le \hbox {C}\}\), \(\upphi (\hbox {s, p}) = 1\), if (s, p) \(\upvarepsilon
    \quad \Phi \) and \(\upphi \hbox {(s, p)} =0\) otherwise. The steady state probability
    of the channel occupancy is given by $$\begin{aligned} P(s,p)=\lim \nolimits _{t
    \rightarrow \infty }\hbox {Pr}\{s(t)=s,p(t)=p\} \end{aligned}$$ (2) Fig. 4 Channel
    occupancy state transition for \(\hbox {s}+\hbox {p}<\hbox {C}\) Full size image
    The balance equation for the channel occupancy state transitions as shown in Fig.
    4 can be formulated as $$\begin{aligned}&[\hbox {p} \upmu _{\mathrm{p}}+ \hbox
    {s} \mathop \upmu \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}+ \hbox {(C-p-s)} \mathop \uplambda \nolimits
    _{\mathrm{p}}+ \hbox {(C-p-s)} \mathop \uplambda \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}] \hbox
    {P(s,p)} \upphi \hbox {(s, p)}\nonumber \\&= \hbox {(p+1)} \mathop \upmu \nolimits
    _{\mathrm{p}}\hbox {P(s,p+1)} \upphi \hbox {(s, p+1)} \nonumber \\&\qquad + \;\hbox
    {(s+1)} \mathop \upmu \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}\hbox {P(s+1, p)} \upphi \hbox {(s+1,
    p)} \nonumber \\&\qquad + \;\hbox {(C-s-p+1)} \mathop \uplambda \nolimits _{\mathrm{p}}\hbox
    {P(s, p-1)} \upphi \hbox {(s, p-1)} \nonumber \\&\qquad + \; \hbox {(C-s-p)} \mathop
    \uplambda \nolimits _{\mathrm{s}}\hbox {P(s-1, p)} \upphi \hbox {(s-1, p)} \end{aligned}$$
    (3) P(s,p) also satisfies the normalization condition, $$\begin{aligned} \mathop
    \sum \nolimits _{p=0}^{C} \mathop \sum \nolimits _{s=0}^{C} P(s,p)\phi (s,p)=1
    \end{aligned}$$ (4) Thus P(s,p) can be obtained, \(\forall (s,p)\in \phi \). The
    probability that a newly arriving primary or secondary is blocked is the probability
    that all the C channels are occupied. Thus the back off probability P back off
    is given by $$\begin{aligned} P_{backoff}=\sum _{p\,=\,0}^{C} \sum _{s\,=\,0}^{C}
    P(s,p) \Psi (s+p=c) \end{aligned}$$ (5) Where \(\psi (f (s, p))\)is an indicator
    function i.e. \(\psi (f (s, p)) =1\)if f(s, p) holds and \(\psi (f (s, p)) =0\)
    otherwise. 6 Simulation The system model is simulated in compliance to Rel. 13
    3GPP LTE standards using Mat Lab showing the coexistence of U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT
    in 5 GHz band ranging from 5.0 to 5.3 GHz, 23 channels each with assumed bandwidth
    of 20MHz. For comparison purpose, the coexistence of U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT in 5
    GHz band without LBT feature is also simulated and shown. The following sections
    describe the simulation models for both coexistence mechanisms without LBT and
    with LBT along with their simulation results and comparison. A real-time Wi-Fi
    user traffic was collected and used as input data set. On observing real-time
    LTE traffic, LTE signals were generated to match their energy level. Both LTE
    and Wi-Fi signals are fed into the system in a random fashion to enact the real-time
    environment. The network scenario shown in Fig. 2 with SDL mode is considered.
    The network is assumed with macro cells of eNB nodes and picocells with Wi-Fi
    access points (APs). The system under test is evaluated with increase in number
    of users for both Wi-Fi and LTE. The values of the parameters considered to obtain
    the simulation results are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Simulation parameters Full
    size table Fig. 5 Block diagram of channel allocation in non-LBT scenario without
    cognitive radio Full size image 6.1 Coexistence of LTE with Wi-Fi / IoT without
    LBT The block diagram for simulating the coexistence of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT without
    LBT is shown in Fig. 5. Two separate sources, one for LTE and other for Wi-Fi/IoT
    generates multiple signals in random fashion with respective energy and transmission
    time. The Channel allocation system allocates the available free channels for
    the successful transmission between respective source and sink. The U-LTE and
    Wi-Fi/IoT systems occupies the available free channel, transmits for its respective
    time duration and leaves the channel free making it available for other contenting
    LTE or Wi-Fi/IoT sources. But, LTE systems, being high demand in nature, and with
    long communication duration, occupies the channels and seldom leaves. Since Wi-Fi
    systems adopt a contention based medium access control (MAC) protocol with random
    back off mechanism, it finds the medium busy most of the time, resulting in high
    back off rate. Considering a smallcell / femtocell, the number of users assumed
    to be minimum of 10 and maximum of 500. The two scenarios depicting coexistence
    of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT without LBT at different continuous instances of time
    for 100 users are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. In Fig. 6, the channel occupancy status
    during the initial time span of 100 ms is shown. During that time, 13 channels
    out of 23 are occupied by Wi-Fi/IoT signals and the remaining 10 channels are
    occupied by U-LTE signals. Therefore, channels of U-NII band have been occupied
    almost fairly by U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT systems during the initial phase of channel
    allocation. Fig. 6 Scenario 1: initial channel occupancy status between Wi-Fi
    and U_LTE signals in Non-LBT Full size image Figure 7 depicts the channel occupancy
    status at later time after 200 ms. Here, only eight channels are occupied by Wi-Fi/IoT
    signals whereas remaining 15 are occupied by U-LTE signals. Due to high demand
    nature of LTE, the channels are occupied by them leaves no space for Wi-Fi systems
    and hence they results in high back off rate. Fig. 7 Scenario 2: Channel occupancy
    status with increased number of U-LTE signals in Non-LBT Full size image The simulation
    was studied with different number of users ranging from 10, 20, and 30 up to 500
    in order to analyze the back off rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals. The average back off
    rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals is almost 50% higher than LTE with increase in number
    of users and is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 Back off rate of LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT signals
    in Non-LBT Scenario Full size image Fig. 9 Block diagram of channel allocation
    in LBT scenario with application of cognitive radio Full size image 6.2 Coexistence
    of U-LTE with Wi-Fi / IoT with LBT using CR system The block diagram for simulating
    the coexistence of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT with LBT using CR is shown in Fig. 9.
    As similar to non-LBT simulation system, there are two separate sources, one for
    LTE and other for Wi-Fi/IoT generating multiple signals in random fashion with
    respective energy and transmission time. Due to the application of CR in this
    system model, Wi-Fi/IoT systems are considered as the primary users and U-LTE
    systems as secondary users. Incoming signals from Wi-Fi/IoT sources occupy the
    channels by following their own MAC protocol by means of Channel allocation system.
    Whereas, U-LTE signals, in order to accomplish LBT feature, they follows the ETSI
    standards [28] for channel occupancy through CR system. The CR system assumed
    to be in the LTE access point, on getting a transmission request from LTE source,
    identifies the white space (free channel) in U-NII band and estimates the clear
    channel assessment (CCA) threshold. CCA threshold is estimated by measuring the
    energy level of the free channel for a listening period of \(20 \, \upmu \hbox
    {s}\). If the energy level in the channel is below -80 dBm for the listening period
    of \(20 \,\upmu \hbox {s}\), considering it as low interference level in the channel
    and assumed to be free. The Channel is then allocated for the U-LTE signal transmissions
    for the duration equal to Channel Occupancy Time of 10 ms. After that, if LTE
    source wishes to continue its transmission, it has to repeat the white space detection
    and CCA process for channel allocation. On every channel request and allocation
    process, the Channel Occupancy time for LTE source is maximum 10 ms. Therefore,
    the above process is repeated until LTE source completes with its transmission.
    On every cycle, the channel allocated for LTE transmissions is different or same
    based on the free channel availability. The two scenarios depicting coexistence
    of U-LTE with Wi-Fi/IoT with LBT using CR at different continuous instances of
    time for 100 users are shown in Figs. 10 and 11. In Fig. 10, the channel occupancy
    status during the initial time span of 100ms is shown. During that time, 13 channels
    out of 23 are occupied by Wi-Fi/IoT signals and the remaining ten channels are
    occupied by U-LTE signals. Therefore, channels of U-NII band have been occupied
    almost fairly by U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT systems during the initial phase of channel
    allocation. Fig. 10 Scenario 1: initial channel occupancy status between Wi-Fi
    and U_LTE in LBT using CR Full size image Figure 11 depicts the channel occupancy
    status at later time after 200 ms. Here, Wi-Fi/IoT signals occupy 15 channels
    and 8 by U-LTE signals. The channel occupancy measure of Wi-Fi/IoT systems is
    almost same as that of an earlier time span. Maintaining almost the same channel
    occupancy status even after the later time span depicts the fair and friendly
    sharing of channels between Wi-Fi/IoT and U-LTE signals. This leads to the reduced
    back off rate of Wi-Fi/IoT systems. Fig. 11 Scenario 2: initial channel occupancy
    status between Wi-Fi and U_LTE in LBT using CR Full size image The simulation
    was studied with different number of users ranging from 10, 20, and 30 up to 500
    in order to analyze the back off rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals. The average back off
    rate of Wi-Fi/IoT signals is almost equivalent to LTE and they were maintained
    at minimum level even with increased number of users and are shown in Fig. 12.
    Fig. 12 Back off rate of LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT signals in LBT scenario using CR Full
    size image 7 Performance comparison The proposed system has been evaluated and
    the performance is compared with three other existing methods. The comparison
    results of four scenarios are presented in Fig. 13. The performance in terms of
    channel utilization is analyzed for an average of 100 users in the network. In
    Fig. 13 for scenario 1, the channel utilization is equal for U-LTE and Wi-Fi/IoT
    users. In scenario 2, without LBT, Wi-Fi/IoT users are severely deferred by the
    U-LTE users and the channel utilization is reduced to 36% of scenario 1. Fig.
    13 Performance comparison of and LBT (CR with existing techniques Full size image
    Furthermore, implementing TDM cycling and CCA for coexistence mechanisms are shown
    in scenario 3 and 4. Though the channel utilization percentage of Wi-Fi/IoT users
    in those scenarios got increased to 50% of scenario 1, the LTE users are dominating
    the network and the Wi-Fi back off rate is still prominent. Hence, performance
    of scenario 1 can be appreciated as it proves the fair and friendly sharing nature
    of LTE in the unlicensed band by occupying the spectrum at its free time, without
    causing interference and denying the space for the incumbent Wi-Fi users. 8 Conclusion
    The spectrum utilization of radio frequencies is gaining momentum due to the invasion
    of wireless equipment in every field of human life. In this regard, there is a
    change over from licensed LTE to U-LTE in view of the evident advantages of later
    in terms of speed, cost etc. An improved method is proposed in this work to include
    CR in U-LTE for effective utilization of the white spaces in the radio spectrum.
    Also, the importance of saving 5GHz band for the next generation wireless communications
    is addressed by utilizing the spectrum in fair and friendly basis. The basic attributes
    of channel searching and channel allocation are utilized in this work to optimize
    the functionality of U-LTE in terms of clean channel searching and co-existence
    of secondary users with primary users. The simulation results of coexistence of
    U-LTE and Wi-Fi in unlicensed 5 GHz band in LBT fashion is presented to support
    the fair and friendly sharing of spectrum between them. In this work, only SDL
    mode is considered, where the unlicensed spectrum is used for downlink traffic
    alone. In future work, the utilization of unlicensed spectrum for both uplink
    and downlink traffic will be considered and the coexistence of U-LTE along with
    incumbent users in such scenarios will be studied. The size and the cost of implementing
    CR in UEs raise the challenges to realize the LBT feature and are under future
    research. 9 Future reference In this work, only SDL mode is considered, where
    the unlicensed spectrum is used for downlink traffic alone. In future work, the
    utilization of unlicensed spectrum for both uplink and downlink traffic will be
    considered and the coexistence of U-LTE along with incumbent users in such scenarios
    will be studied. The size and the cost of implementing CR in UEs raise the challenges
    to realize the LBT feature and are under future research. Moreover, in contrast
    to the above work, CR s can be endowed as “brain” in IoT devices to enable them
    to choose the best segments of the network and best frequency bands. Their ability
    to adapt its internal radio parameters to avoid capacity and congestion issues
    caused by environmental changes ensures to provide optimal service to end-users.

    cognitive wireless networks, multi-node cooperative spectrum sensing can effectively
    improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing, but there is a non-linear relationship
    between the number of nodes and sensing accuracy. Nodes with low reliability participate
    in cooperative sensing, which is not conducive to the improvement of sensing accuracy,
    and reduces the energy efficiency of spectrum sensing, which poses challenges
    to the normal operation of cognitive wireless networks. In order to improve energy
    efficiency and sensing performance, this paper proposes the node evaluation and
    scheduling (NES) algorithm and the Secure Spectrum Sensing based on Blockchain
    (SSSB) algorithm, which can evaluate the reliability of sensing nodes in real
    time, and obtain the trust value of the node. The nodes information is stored
    in the management center of blockchain. Blockchain encrypts nodes information
    to ensure that a node corresponds to its own trust value without confusion. Fusion
    Center of cognitive wireless networks select good performance nodes to participate
    in cooperative spectrum sensing. Which can reduce energy consumption while improving
    the sensing performance. The simulation experiment results show that the new algorithm
    in this paper is far superior to the traditional algorithm. Under the same other
    conditions, the detection probability is increased by 5%, and the energy consumption
    is reduced by 10%, and the safety index has also been greatly improved. Topic:

    I. Introduction With the ever-increasing demand for wireless communication, spectrum
    resources are becoming more and more tense [1], [2], but the spectrum utilization
    rate is relatively low [3], [4]. Cognitive wireless networks proposes to allow
    dynamic spectrum access to authorized frequency bands to make full use of spectrum
    holes, improve spectrum utilization, and ease spectrum resources shortage [5].
    In the process of spectrum sensing, the sensing performance of a single node cannot
    be well achieved due to the influence of geographic location [6], while multi-node
    cooperative sensing can overcome the sensing shortcomings of a single node and
    make preparations by combining information from different geographic locations
    [7]. Therefore, multi-node cooperative sensing is a commonly used sensing method
    in cognitive wireless networks [8]. Multi-node cooperative perception can effectively
    improve the accuracy of perception, but the increase in the number of nodes will
    bring additional energy costs, increasing the energy consumption of the cognitive
    wireless network, and the front end of the cognitive network is battery-powered
    [9], so the energy consumption increases. It will reduce the battery life, which
    will also reduce the working life of the cognitive wireless network [10]. In order
    to extend the working life of cognitive wireless networks, many improved methods
    are used,the method of switching on and off time is adopted to extend the working
    life of the cognitive network [11], but this method has low perception efficiency
    and misses many opportunities for spectrum access. The method of cooperating between
    nodes and the primary user according to the agreement is used to reduce the workload
    of the cognitive network [12]. This method can effectively reduce energy consumption,
    but this method gives priority to meeting the requirements of the main user and
    will reduce the throughput of the cognitive user. The method of grouping relay
    is used to reduce the energy loss caused by information transmission [13]. In
    this method, each node does not need to send the local sensing result to the fusion
    center, but each node first sends it to the patriarch, and then the patriarch
    decides later sent to the fusion center, this method reduces communication overhead,
    but the sensing accuracy is compromised. The method of purchasing the primary
    user information is used to reduce workload of the cognitive network [14]. The
    modified method can greatly reduce the workload of the cognitive user to perform
    spectrum sensing because the primary user’s working time is known in advance.
    But user information costs are high, only used in special occasions, and does
    not have universal significance. A review method is proposed to reduce the number
    of cooperative sensing nodes [15], so as to achieve the purpose of reducing energy
    consumption and communication overhead. In this algorithm, nodes with low reliability
    can be removed, but the sensing performance of all nodes is considered to be unchanged.
    In fact, when the radio environment changes, the performance of the nodes will
    change, which is not reflected in the algorithm. In order to improve the energy
    efficiency of cognitive networks, a dynamic node selection algorithm is proposed
    [16]. The algorithm selects a fixed number of nodes to participate in cooperative
    perception according to the trust value of nodes, which can reduce energy consumption,
    but can not change the number of nodes according to the change of environment.
    In order to improve the energy efficiency and the operation efficiency of cognitive
    network [17], a time-sharing algorithm is proposed. This algorithm makes nodes
    work in turn, which can reduce the energy consumption of each node, but all nodes
    are involved in the work, and some nodes with poor sensing performance will not
    help cooperative sensing, which will affect the operation performance of cognitive
    radio network. In order to overcome the shortcomings of the algorithm [17], a
    node selection algorithm based on deep learning is proposed [18]. The algorithm
    still allows nodes to work in turn, and learns the sensing operation of each node,
    removing the nodes with large energy consumption to participate in the cooperative
    sensing, which can improve the energy-efficiency of cognitive wireless network.
    But in fact, external radio environment is a time-varying, the algorithm is not
    considering the influence of environmental changes on the node sensing performance,
    lack of environment interaction with the outside world radio link, failing to
    reflect changes in the environment [19]. The above method does not take into account
    the energy-efficiency and sensing performance of cognitive wireless network, and
    does not take into account the impact of changes in radio environment on sensing
    performance and energy-efficiency. In fact, the nodes with poor sensing performance
    will not help the cooperative sensing, but will affect the global decision of
    the fusion center [20]. Therefore, in cognitive wireless networks, the nodes with
    poor sensing performance should be removed, and only the reliable nodes should
    be selected to participate in cooperative sensing [21]. However, the performance
    of the node is not fixed, it will change due to its own factors and the changes
    of the external environment. Therefore, in the actual cognitive wireless radio,
    need to consider the impact of environmental changes [22], and improve sensing
    accuracy and energy efficiency. But previous literature did not consider the impact
    of environmental, and did not consider using the blockchain method to select nodes
    with good performance [23]. In this paper, in order to simultaneously improve
    the energy efficiency and sensing accuracy of cognitive wireless networks, a secure
    spectrum sensing mechanism based on blockchain is proposed. The mechanism can
    reflect the change of environment and timely modify the number of nodes participating
    in cooperative sensing, and can evaluate the reliability of sensing nodes in real
    time, and obtain the trust value of the node through the evaluation algorithm.
    The mechanism not only memorizes the energy consumption and sensing performance
    of each node, but also remembers the trust value of a single node. The trust value
    is stored in the reliability list of the blockchain, the management center of
    the blockchain encrypts the list to ensure that a node corresponds to its own
    trust value without confusion. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm
    in this paper can give a good consideration to both energy efficiency and sensing
    accuracy, and extend the working life of cognitive wireless networks. The rest
    of the research paper is structured as follows. The second section introduces
    the network model proposed in this paper. In the third section, the node estimation
    and selection algorithm is given. In the fourth section, the blockchain-based
    cognitive wireless network security work algorithm is given. In the fifth section,
    the algorithm’s experimental results and analysis is given. Finally, a conclusion
    is given. SECTION II. System Model This paper designs a cognitive wireless network
    model based on blockchain. The model includes the management center of the blockchain,
    a primary user, a cognitive base station (fusion center), and multiple nodes (cognitive
    users). Some nodes are in spectrum sensing state, and the other nodes are in silent
    state. This model is a centralized cooperative spectrum sensing model [24]. Each
    node can only exchange information with the fusion center. The sensing information
    of each node is sent to the fusion center for processing, and the fusion center
    feeds back information to each node [25]. There is no direct communication between
    nodes, so a centralized architecture helps to improve information processing efficiency
    [26]. The fusion center is not only responsible for communication with the nodes,
    but also for communication with the blockchain management center, sending the
    node information to the management center for storage, and the blockchain management
    center will also call the node information to the fusion center. The blockchain
    management center and the fusion center are an important interaction mechanism
    for selecting reliable nodes. The detailed system model is shown in Figure 1.
    FIGURE 1. Cognitive wireless network model based on blockchain. Show All In Figure
    1, it can be seen that not all nodes participate in cooperative sensing at the
    same time, but some nodes are possible malicious nodes. This is because the nodes
    are grouped, and the node with the highest trust value is selected to participate
    in cooperative sensing, malicious nodes are blocked from participating in cooperative
    sensing. The purpose is to improve energy efficiency and maximize the extension
    the working life of cognitive network. In the premise of satisfying the sensing
    performance, the energy consumption is reduced. The reason for grouping the nodes
    and evaluating the trust value of the nodes is mainly because the geographical
    locations of the nodes are different, and the nodes close to the primary user
    receive strong signals, which can be obtained good perception accuracy on the
    basis of consuming less energy. When the path loss caused by the long distance
    from the primary user is larger, or the channel is not good, and the node with
    severe Rayleigh fading receives weaker signals from the primary user, and needs
    to perform longer sensing operations, and consumes more energy can make sensing
    judgments. Because the primary user’s signal is weak and easily affected by interference,
    these nodes are prone to make wrong judgments. Such judgment results are not conducive
    to the protection of the primary user, which brings challenges to the security
    of cognitive wireless networks. Therefore, it is necessary for the security work
    of cognitive wireless networks to estimate nodes and select nodes with high reliability
    to participate in cooperative sensing. SECTION III. Node Estimation and Selection
    Algorithm In order to improve the security of cognitive wireless networks, it
    is necessary to take the node trust value as an important index to participate
    in cooperative sensing. Therefore, the combination of node trust value and basic
    system architecture can meet the sensing accuracy and reduce energy consumption.
    The blockchain management center can be more effective in preventing data confusion.
    A weighted combination mechanism based on reputation [27] can improve the sensing
    performance of cognitive wireless networks. The algorithm first estimates the
    reliability of all nodes in the system. This estimation is based on the historical
    interactive data. Once a suspicious node is found, it immediately makes an isolation
    decision for the sensing data of the node. The algorithm improves the robustness
    of the system, but increases the additional energy consumption, and the impact
    of environmental changes on the node itself is not considered. In fact, the radio
    environment is time-varying, and changes in the working status of the primary
    user will also affect the sensing of nodes, especially when the location of the
    primary user moves, the nodes with good sensing may become malicious in the next
    moment, while the node with poor performance may become a reliable node. Therefore,
    in order to track changes in the status of nodes, it is necessary to establish
    a real-time evaluation mechanism for nodes. When the node performance deteriorates,
    it can stop its sensing work in time, and when the node performance becomes better,
    it can be transferred to work in time. In order to evaluate and select nodes more
    efficiently, this paper establishes an node evaluation algorithm and nodes selection
    mechanism. The nodes selection algorithm flow chart is shown in Figure 2. FIGURE
    2. Flow chart of the node evaluation and scheduling algorithm. Show All In Figure
    2, the cognitive wireless network estimates the reliability of each node before
    performing spectrum sensing operations, and this estimation is based on historical
    data. When the external environment is stable, the original scheme will continue
    to work, but when the external environment changes, the reliability of the node
    needs to be re-estimated. The trustworthiness value of the node is recalculated
    according to formula (1) [28], and the fusion center will establish nodes list
    and nodes information are sent to the management center of the blockchain to avoid
    errors. The management center intelligently provides node information and is responsible
    for scheduling nodes to participate in cooperative sensing according to the requirements
    of the fusion center. q j = ∑ i=1 k | R j,i |⋅ r j,i ∑ i=1 k | R j,i | (1) View
    Source In formula (1), q j is the initial trust value of the j-th node, | R j,i
    | is the sensing result of the j-th node in the i-th sensing cycle, and r j,i
    is the reward value obtained by the j-th sensing node in the i-th sensing cycle.
    The value of r j,i follows the following principles: when the judgment result
    of the j-th node in a sensing cycle is consistent with the fusion center, then
    r j,i =1 , otherwise r j,i =0 , k is the number of statistical sensing cycles.
    Calculate the initial value of the reliability of each node by formula (1), and
    save the value in the management center of the blockchain. When the environment
    changes, the reliability of the nodes will be re-estimated, and the nodes participating
    in sensing will be adjusted according to the node evaluation and scheduling (NES)
    algorithm. In NES algorithm, three return values and three correction coefficients
    are set, they are performance return value r , energy consumption return value
    g , comprehensive return value υ , performance correction coefficient ρ , energy
    consumption correction coefficient ξ and comprehensive correction coefficient
    ν . The calculation formula of performance return value r is shown in formula
    (2): r= 1 k ∑ i=1 k [(1− X i )( α i ⋅ C G +(1− α t ) C B ) + X i ( β i ⋅ C G +(1−
    β i )⋅ C B )] (2) View Source In formula (2), the value of X i is 1 or 0, when
    the primary user band is busy, it is taken as 1, while the primary user band is
    idle, it is taken as 0. The value of k is the same as that in formula (1), which
    represents the statistical times of sensing period. C G is the reward coefficient,
    and C B is the punishment coefficient. α i and β i are weighted coefficients,
    and their values are shown in formula (3): α i ={ 1, 0, X i =0| H 0 X i =0| H
    1 , β i ={ 1, 0, X i =1| H 1 X i =1| H 0 (3) View Source The value of return coefficient
    g of energy consumption is calculated by formula (4): g= 1 k ∑ i=1 k [ D G Y i
    + D B (1− Y i )] (4) View Source In formula (4), D G is the energy consumption
    reward coefficient, indicating that the node energy consumption is less than the
    threshold value, D B is the energy consumption penalty coefficient, indicating
    that the node energy consumption is greater than the threshold value. Y i is the
    weighting coefficient of energy return value, and its value is calculated by formula
    (5): Y i = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 1, 0, λ 0 − ∑ j=1 M e i,j ≥0 λ 0 − ∑
    j=1 M e i,j <0 (5) View Source In formula (5), λ 0 is a preset energy consumption
    threshold in a sensing period. The calculation of the comprehensive return value
    υ is shown in formula (6): υ=0.4r+0.6g (6) View Source Formula (6) shows that
    the weight of energy consumption return value accounts for 60% and the weight
    of performance return value accounts for 40%. This shows that in this paper, we
    emphasize on satisfying the sensing performance (sensing accuracy) while paying
    more attention to reducing energy consumption. The value of the performance correction
    coefficient ρ is calculated by formula (7): ρ j = ∑ i [ x i,j − X i ] (7) View
    Source The correction coefficient ρ j represents the number of times that the
    j-th node transmits wrong information to the fusion center, and also represents
    the risk factor of the node. x i,j represents the result reported by the j-th
    node to the fusion center in the i-th sensing cycle, and X i represents the decision
    result of the i-th sensing cycle. The value of energy consumption correction coefficient
    ξ is calculated by formula (8): ξ j = ∑ i O i,j ⋅ Y i,j (8) View Source ξ j represents
    the number of times that the energy consumption of the j-th node exceeds the energy
    threshold, and also represents the severity of punishment. O i,j represents the
    switch, with a value of 1 or 0, when the j-th node participates in cooperative
    sensing in the i-th cycle, it is taken as 1, otherwise it is taken as 0.  Y i,j
    indicates whether the energy consumption of the j-th node in the i-th sensing
    cycle exceeds the energy consumption threshold, and its value is calculated by
    formula (9). Y i,j = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ 1, 0, e i,j − λ 0 ≥0 e i,j − λ 0 <0 (9) View Source
    λ 0 in formula (9) represents the energy consumption threshold, and its value
    is calculated by formula (10). λ 0 = ∑ j=1 M e i,j M (10) View Source In formula
    (10), M represents the number of all nodes in the cognitive wireless network.
    e i,j represents the energy consumption of the j-th node in the i-th cycle. The
    value of comprehensive correction coefficient ν is calculated by formula (11).
    ν j =0.4 ρ j +0.6 ξ j (11) View Source ν j represents the comprehensive correction
    coefficient of the j-th node, which is obtained by the weighted sum of the performance
    correction coefficient and energy consumption correction coefficient. The performance
    correction coefficient accounts for 40% and the energy consumption correction
    coefficient accounts for 60%. That is, on the premise of satisfying the perceptual
    performance, more energy consumption will be punished more severely. The update
    process of node trust value is shown in equation (12). q n+1 j = q n j +[ϑυ−(1−ϑ)
    ν n j ] q n j (12) View Source In formula (12), q n j is the trust value of the
    j-th node in the previous perception cycle, q n+1 j is the current trust value
    of the j-th node, υ represents the comprehensive return value of the previous
    cycle, and ν n j represents the comprehensive correction coefficient of the previous
    cycle. ϑ is a weighting factor, ϑ∈[0,1] . The larger the value of ϑ , the larger
    the proportion of the feedback coefficient, and the better the sensing performance
    or energy consumption index. On the contrary, it indicates that the sensing node
    needs to be adjusted to improve the sensing performance and energy consumption
    index. The detailed description of node evaluation and selection algorithm is
    shown in algorithm 1. SECTION Algorithm 1 Node Evaluation and Selection Algorithm

    energy consumption and enhancing the robustness of cognitive wireless networks.
    SECTION IV. Cognitive Wireless Network Security Work Algorithm Based on Blockchain
    Blockchain is an underlying technology abstracted from Bitcoin. It is a new application
    of traditional technology in the Internet era, which includes distributed data
    storage technology, wireless networks, consensus mechanism and cryptography [29].
    As a decentralized public database, blockchain uses public key cryptographic algorithms,
    hash functions, consensus mechanisms and other technologies to build a decentralized
    non-authentication system that can be used in e-commerce to ensure user information
    security. Simply put, blockchain can be widely used in Internet finance or a wider
    market. It will further promote the process of economic globalization and will
    have a great impact on the existing financial market structure and even the social
    structure [30]. Blockchain technology has the advantages of low transaction costs,
    strong transparency, and high security. It can effectively improve the efficiency
    of information use, make the transaction process transparent, share supervision,
    and protect the legitimate rights and interests of all parties to the transaction.
    Common problems such as high cost, low efficiency, and low data storage security
    in the standardized database provide new ideas [31]. Blockchain is a kind of tamper
    proof, full history database storage technology, usually uses point-to-point technology
    to organize each node. Each node realizes the functions of routing, new node identification
    and data dissemination through multicast. It can appear at any node in the system.
    By using cryptography, it can generate related data blocks. The generated data
    can check the validity of the information, and can also realize the reliable link
    with the next data [32]. In wireless network communication, blockchain technology
    is a kind of technology that can not be tampered with among the same level secondary
    users who do not trust each other or have weak trust without intermediary participation.
    Regarding the historical interaction in the database as a public account book,
    each node stores the historical interaction records of the whole network, and
    the records of data collection, transaction, circulation and calculation and analysis
    are kept on the blockchain, which makes the quality of data obtain unprecedented
    strong trust endorsement, and ensures the correctness of data analysis results
    and the effect of data mining [33]. In view of the advantages of blockchain technology,
    this paper proposes a cognitive wireless network security algorithm based on blockchain.
    A. Algorithm Design Structure The research object of this article is the two-way
    authentication problem between the blockchain IoT device and the cognitive wireless
    network convergence center. Therefore, the system in this article is mainly composed
    of the blockchain system, the cognitive wireless network convergence center, and
    the blockchain IoT device. Users communicate with the blockchain system through
    the fusion center. The specific structure is shown in Figure 3. The IoT device
    sends node information to the fusion center, and the fusion center queries the
    blockchain system for the existence of its node information, and then the node
    sends the data signed by the private key to the fusion center, and verifies whether
    the sensing node has a corresponding private key pair Sign it. If it is, then
    forward the node’s request to the blockchain system, and forward the response
    of the blockchain system back to the sensing node. The data signed by the sensing
    node can confirm the identity of participating in spectrum sensing, and can also
    ensure that its data has not been tampered with or forged. FIGURE 3. Security
    algorithm structure of cognitive wireless network. Show All B. Secure Spectrum
    Sensing Based on BLOCKCHAIN Technology This paper introduces the blockchain technology
    and reputation mechanism into the spectrum sensing process. A new secure spectrum
    sensing method is proposed. This security sensing method includes the evaluation
    of the user’s direct reputation and recommendation reputation. When a cooperative
    node requests to access a certain frequency band, it needs to sense whether the
    frequency band is idle. If it is idle, it will send a recommendation request to
    the fusion center. In order to avoid collusion attack and malicious node behavior,
    the sensing results are more accurate. Using the blockchain technology, the historical
    sensing records in the database and the distance of interaction history is regarded
    as a public ledger, which can be shared by each neighbor node, and no node in
    this scenario can change the ledger information. The specific working process
    of security spectrum sensing based on blockchain technology is shown in Figure
    4. FIGURE 4. Secure spectrum sensing algorithm based on blockchain (SSSB) in cognitive
    wireless networks. Show All After the fusion center sends a perception request,
    the evaluation of a node’s local reputation value is related to the peer requester.
    It is necessary to obtain the requester’s perception calculation record from the
    public account book of the blockchain to calculate its direct reputation value.
    For the sender, the local direct reputation value is calculated by formula (13).
    T i = N i k θ ω i (13) View Source In formula (13), T i represents the i-th sensing
    period, N i is the number of all the sensing periods up to T i time period. The
    meaning of k is the same as in formula (1), indicating the correct number of interactive
    sensing in history [34], θ means the sensing operation intensity, and its value
    is calculated by formula (14), ω i is the influence coefficient of the sensing
    times in the public account book, and its value is calculated by formula (15).
    θ= ω i = 1− e ∣ ∣ − k mn ∣ ∣ ∑ i=1 n ∣ ∣ ∣ h 1 m ⋅ l n ∣ ∣ ∣ (14) (15) View Source
    where h 1 is the number of interactions in l period and m is the size of sensing
    period in each period, n is the total interaction period. It can be seen from
    formula (14) and (15) that the closer is the interaction history in the public
    account book, the proportion will be the greater, and the impact on trust value
    will increase accordingly [35]. When the trust value of the node is not in the
    forefront of all nodes, the node is selected by calculating the comprehensive
    trust value, and the comprehensive trust value of the node is calculated by (17).
    T i,c =ϕ T i +φ ∣ ∣ ∣ T i +θ ∑ i ω i ∣ ∣ ∣ (16) View Source where ϕ,φ, ω i respectively
    represent the weight of the trust value, the direct reputation value and the comprehensive
    reputation value of the node. Among them, the values of ϕ,φ, ω i meet the conditions
    ϕ>0,ϕ≥0, ω i ≥0,ϕ+φ=1 . Every time a recommendation is made, the user’s recommendation
    reputation value will be updated. The security spectrum sensing technology based
    on the blockchain, through the calculation of the comprehensive trust value of
    the nodes in the network. The final decision-making process uses the classic trust
    value decision-making algorithm. The nodes in the network are classified by setting
    the corresponding rejection threshold and trust threshold. If the comprehensive
    trust value is less than the rejection threshold, the node is considered a malicious
    user; if the comprehensive trust value is greater than the trust threshold, the
    node is considered a normal user; if the comprehensive trust value is between
    the rejection threshold and the trust threshold, the node is considered to be
    a node to be observed. The node obtains the right to participate in cooperative
    sensing through the continuous update of the trust value. SECTION V. Analysis
    of the Simulation Experiment The experiment was carried out by the Monte Carlo
    simulation in this paper. This test runs VMware esxi 6.7.0 (build 8169922) bare
    metal virtual machine system on a workstation using two Intel Xeon Gold6128 3.7GHz
    processors, 256 Gb memory and Samsung SM961 / PM961 SSD [36]. In the simulated
    cognitive wireless network, there are 3 auxiliary nodes and 15 sensing nodes [37].
    The corresponding parameters are set as shown in Table 1 [38]. TABLE 1 Simulation
    Parameter Setting The always occupied class means that the frequency band is considered
    to be in the occupied state, i.e. it is always sent 1 whether the primary user
    is using the detected frequency band or not; the always idle class is that the
    frequency band is considered to be in the idle state, that is to say, it is always
    sent whether the primary user is using the detected frequency band or not For
    the actual use of the frequency band, if it does not follow any rules, it is considered
    to be in the idle state or occupied state, that is, random transmission 0 and
    1 [39]. In the simulation experiment of the algorithm, the number of malicious
    users in the system is mainly considered in two cases, as shown in Table 2. TABLE
    2 Malicious User (MU) Parameter Values In the experiment based on the auxiliary
    node, assuming that the primary user band is in a half busy state. The NES algorithm
    in this paper is compared with 4 classical algorithms, which are AND rule, OR
    rule, Majority rule and K-out-of rule respectively [40]. When using the traditional
    4 fusion methods, the number of malicious nodes is set to 4, and the number of
    normal nodes is 15. When using the node evaluation and scheduling (NES) algorithm
    in this paper, the number of malicious nodes is set to 8, and other parameters
    are consistent with the settings in the traditional method. In order to verify
    the sensing performance of the algorithm in this article, the ROC curves of the
    comparison of sensing performance are shown in Figures 5. As can be seen from
    Figure 5, in the case of four malicious nodes in cognitive wireless network, the
    detection probability of the algorithm in this paper is higher than that of the
    classical algorithm under the same false alarm probability. This is because the
    algorithm in this paper considers the environment and other variable factors,
    and the cognitive wireless network has stronger robustness and stronger anti attack
    ability. No matter in any environment, the node information can be updated in
    time, and the node information is encrypted by blockchain technology. The fusion
    center can request the nodes with good performance to participate in cooperative
    sensing, so the sensing performance is always better than the classic algorithm.
    FIGURE 5. Comparison of sensing performance between four classical algorithms
    and NES algorithm in this paper. Show All Figure 6 shows the energy consumption
    comparison between the NES algorithm and the classical algorithm under the same
    conditions. Other simulation experiment parameters are the same as the experiment
    in Figure 5. FIGURE 6. Comparison of energy consumption between four classical
    algorithms and NES algorithm in this paper. Show All It can be seen from Figure
    6 that after the number of sensing cycles exceeds 60, the energy consumption of
    the algorithm in this paper is significantly less than that of the other 4 classic
    algorithms. The more the number of sensing cycles, the longer the sensing time,
    the more energy will be saved. Greatly help cognitive wireless network to extend
    the working life. This is because the algorithm in this paper can always select
    the node with the best performance to participate in cooperative sensing in time,
    so it can save more energy when the sensing performance is better than the traditional
    method. Figure 7 describes the anti-attack ability of the Secure Spectrum Sensing
    based on Blockchain (SSSB) algorithm in the cognitive wireless network. FIGURE
    7. Security performance comparison of cognitive wireless networks. Show All It
    can be seen from Figure 7 that when the NES and SSSB algorithms are used in combination,
    as increasing the number of interactions between the sensing node, fusion center
    and blockchain management center, the security index of the cognitive wireless
    network rises significantly faster. When the number of interactions exceeds 50
    times, the safety index using the SSSB algorithm rose faster than the safety index
    using only the NES algorithm, which fully reflects the effectiveness of the SSSB
    algorithm. This is because the SSSB algorithm incorporates blockchain technology.
    It can greatly improve the anti attack ability and security ability of cognitive
    wireless network. This article incorporates blockchain technology. In order to
    prove that the new algorithm does not increase network overhead, a network traffic
    test experiment was deliberately done. Network traffic test aims to test the algorithm
    and no identity in this paper. To verify the difference of network traffic between
    wireless access points. This protocol increases the network traffic pressure.
    Network traffic test enables. If the network traffic is tested with iftop, the
    query will be sent directly to the blockchain. Compare the request traffic with
    the request traffic authenticated by this algorithm, Query per second (QPS) and
    calculate the network traffic utilization. In order to make the request timely.
    In order to get a response, and thus more accurately measure the impact on the
    network. The number of service nodes selected by the machine is 1 [40]. The network
    traffic test results are shown in Table 3. TABLE 3 Network Traffic Test Results
    It can be seen from the observation results in Table 3, it is concluded that the
    algorithm in this paper has a 0.1% impact on network traffic, and has minimal
    impact on cognitive wireless network performance.This also proves that the algorithm
    in this paper not only has the advantages of improving sensing performance and
    reducing energy consumption, but also has no disadvantages of increasing network
    overhead. SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper makes an in-depth study on the model
    of cognitive wireless networks. In the practical application scenarios of cognitive
    wireless networks, there are usually serious errors when the nodes sensing the
    data, which causes the sensing values to deviate from the normal range, or some
    nodes deliberately send the wrong data to the fusion center. Therefore, aiming
    at the security problem of malicious node attack in cognitive wireless network,
    this paper proposes the node evaluation and scheduling (NES) algorithm and the
    Secure Spectrum Sensing based on Blockchain (SSSB) algorithm, which regards the
    user’s interaction history and interaction distance as a public account book,
    and is managed by the blockchain management center, which is convenient for the
    fusion center to call nodes with excellent performance to participate in cooperative
    sensing. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is much
    better than the traditional algorithm, which can not only effectively improve
    the spectrum sensing performance, but also reduce the energy consumption, and
    will not increase the communication overhead of cognitive wireless network. There
    are still many shortcomings in the field of cognitive wireless research. For example,
    in the case of low signal-to-noise ratio, the sensory performance of nodes will
    deteriorate rapidly. The existing methods cannot solve the problem of sensory
    performance under low signal-to-noise ratio. Secondly, the existing research does
    not pay enough attention to network throughput, and follow-up research needs to
    strengthen the research of throughput. Secondly, the application of blockchain
    in cognitive wireless networks needs to be further strengthened. Network security
    is a current research hotspot. Research needs to further use blockchain technology
    to enhance the robustness of cognitive wireless networks. Authors Figures References

  title: A Blockchain-Based Node Selection Algorithm in Cognitive Wireless Networks
  verbatim_quote1: In cognitive wireless networks, multi-node cooperative spectrum
    sensing can effectively improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing, but there is
    a non-linear relationship between the number of nodes and sensing accuracy. Nodes
    with low reliability participate in cooperative sensing, which is not conducive
    to the improvement of sensing accuracy, and reduces the energy efficiency of spectrum
    sensing, which poses challenges to the normal operation of cognitive wireless
    networks.

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: To fully empower sensor networks with cognitive
    Internet of Things (IoT) technology, efficient medium access control protocols
    that enable the coexistence of cognitive sensor networks with current wireless
    infrastructure are as essential as the cognitive power in data fusion and processing
    due to shared wireless spectrum. Cognitive radio (CR) is introduced to increase
    spectrum efficiency and support such an endeavor, which thereby becomes a promising
    building block toward facilitating cognitive IoT. In this paper, primary users
    (PUs) refer to devices in existing wireless infrastructure, and secondary users
    (SUs) refer to cognitive sensors. For interference control between PUs and SUs,
    SUs adopt dynamic spectrum access and power adjustment to ensure sufficient operation
    of PUs, which inevitably leads to increasing latency and poses new challenges
    on the reliability of IoT communications. To guarantee operations of primary systems
    while simultaneously optimizing system performance in CR ad hoc networks (CRAHNs),
    this paper proposes interference-aware flooding schemes exploiting global timeout
    and vaccine recovery schemes to control the heavy buffer occupancy induced by
    packet replications. The information delivery dynamics of SUs under the proposed
    interference-aware recovery-assisted flooding schemes is analyzed via epidemic
    models and stochastic geometry from a macroscopic view of the entire system. The
    simulation results show that our model can efficiently capture the complicated
    data delivery dynamics in CRAHNs in terms of end-to-end transmission reliability
    and buffer occupancy. This paper sheds new light on analysis of recovery-assisted
    flooding schemes in CRAHNs and provides performance evaluation of cognitive IoT
    services built upon CRAHNs. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume:

    I. Introduction Cognitive Internet of Things (IoT) technology features advanced
    machine intelligence toward improved data sensing and analysis [1], [2], which
    is particularly appealing to applications involving sensor networks. To fully
    incorporate cognitive IoT technology in sensor networks, intelligent, and efficient
    medium access control protocols enabling the coexistence of sensor networks with
    current wireless infrastructure and simultaneously optimizing the performance
    of IoT applications are emergent challenges. Consequently, in addition to cognitive
    power in data sensing and computation, another crucial factor toward cognitive
    sensor networks is the cognition in spectrum access in order to fully deploy cognitive
    IoT. Over the past decade, cognitive radio (CR) has received dramatic attention
    as it holds tremendous promise for increasing the utilization of scarce radio
    spectrum shared by primary (licensed) systems (PSs) and secondary (unlicensed
    or conditionally licensed) systems (SSs), e.g., cognitive sensor networks. In
    particular, recent works on cognitive IoT technology have identified CR as a critical
    building block that supports cognitive sensor networks [3]–[7], where PSs refer
    to existing wireless infrastructure and SSs refer to CR networks. Using CR terminology,
    secondary users (SUs) sense surrounding environment and adapt their operations
    around those of the primary users (PUs) to opportunistically exploit available
    resources while limiting their interference to PUs. In interweave paradigm [8],
    SUs seek and exploit the temporary spectrum opportunities without causing any
    interference to PUs. To further improve the spectrum usage, SUs in underlay paradigm
    are allowed to concurrently transmit with PUs as long as sufficient operation
    of PUs is ensured. When IoT applications are built upon CR-enabled cognitive sensor
    networks, the information delivery dynamics are jointly affected by the activities
    of PUs and CR medium access protocols, which inevitably leads to increasing latency
    for communications among IoT devices. This paper aims to study the data delivery
    dynamics of flooding schemes in cognitive sensor networks, which specifies the
    effect of packet delivery control and dynamic spectrum access on buffer occupancy
    and end-to-end reliability in data transmission, and therefore provides a novel
    analysis framework for evaluating the performance of information delivery in cognitive
    sensor networks. In ad hoc environment with one channel and slotted ALOHA MAC
    protocol, access probability control is an instinctive solution for spectrum access
    adaptation in underlay paradigm. In a nut shell, each SU tosses a coin independently
    with its access probability and transmits if it gets a head. By adjusting the
    access probability, the subset of SUs acting as interferers could be controlled
    to prevent violating PU’s outage constraint, i.e., outage probability relative
    to a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold. To concatenate
    cognitive sensors as a CR ad hoc network (CRAHN), quality of service (QoS) provisioning
    for end-to-end packet transmissions is an essential must. However, the severe
    interference challenges conventional path-determined single-path routing toward
    QoS guarantee in CRAHN [9], [10], for example, the destination might not receive
    the packet within a prespecified period. To tackle the aforementioned challenges,
    the well known flooding scheme without pre-established path is considered as an
    appropriate choice [11], [12], that is, data is propagated from the source node
    to the destination node with the assistance of other nodes as relays. While such
    solution decreases delivery delay and increases the reliability for end-to-end
    transmissions in CRAHN [13], [14], nodes might receive huge copies not destinated
    to themselves, which is known as the buffer occupancy problem [15]. To resolve
    this issue, two famous recovery schemes, global timeout [16], [17], and vaccine
    [18], have been introduced to remove unnecessary data at the intermediate nodes
    in order to mitigate the resource consumption for epidemic data delivery. The
    rationale behind the recovery scheme is that once the destination has successfully
    received one copy of the packet, the network nodes shall remove copies from their
    respective buffers and stop the packet propagation process as soon as possible.
    In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid recovery scheme combining the advantages
    of global timeout and vaccine schemes for the flooding in CRAHN to increase end-to-end
    SU transmission reliability while maintaining acceptable buffer occupancy. Two
    flooding schemes, static flooding, and mobile flooding, are proposed to investigate
    the effects of mobile nodes on end-to-end SU transmission reliability [19]. Motivated
    by the behavior that transportation of diseases much resembles data dissemination
    dynamics in flooding, we apply epidemic model to investigate the information delivery
    phenomenon, aiming at exploiting the advantages of time efficiency. Moreover,
    the complicated interference is carefully considered in our model by applying
    stochastic geometry modeling [20] instead of the traditional interference graph
    [21]. Specifically, we could derive the end-to-end successful transmission probability
    in flooding while simultaneously meeting the outage constraints for both PUs and
    SUs. The simulation results validate the correctness of our model in the sense
    that the complicated information delivery dynamics can be characterized by our
    schemes. In particular, we show that with the aid of mobility, the end-to-end
    transmission reliability can be drastically improved, which obeys the recent theoretical
    derivations and observations [19], [22]. Moreover, we observe from the simulation
    that by exploiting recovery scheme, our flooding schemes would significantly reduce
    buffer occupancy. As a result, this paper serves as a powerful and efficient tool
    for analyzing information delivery dynamics in cognitive sensor networks. The
    remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce the background and
    survey the related works in Section II. Section III presents the system model
    for the following analysis. Section IV investigates interference at SUs by using
    stochastic geometry, and Section V further analyzes the interference-aware static
    and mobile flooding schemes with hybrid recovery by using epidemic models. Section
    VI provides an analysis and the numerical validation of the proposed schemes.
    Finally, Section VII concludes this paper. SECTION II. Background and Related
    Works A. Recovery Schemes In [15], several novel ideas stemmed from biological
    phenomenon are proposed to delete unnecessary replication in order to mitigate
    the resource consumption due to packet circulating and replication. Two famous
    schemes are introduced as follows. Global Timeout Scheme: Before the global timer
    expires, nodes replicate packets and forward to nodes who have not receive packet
    yet. Upon global timer expires, all nodes delete packets from their buffers. Vaccine
    Scheme: With the aid of “antipacket” spreading, vaccine scheme is the most vigorous
    mechanism to efficiently save buffer occupancy. Specifically, once the destination
    receives the packet, it propagate a antipacket in an epidemic fashion. The nodes
    receiving antipacket will delete the packet from their buffer, join the antipacket
    spreading process, and upon antipacket reception they are redeemed from infection
    by the same packet later. Consequently, the situation that copies of a packet
    may endlessly circulating through the network can be controlled. B. Epidemic Model
    Inspired from epidemiology, information dissemination in communication networks
    has been found to surprisingly resemble the transportation of epidemics [18],
    [23]–[26]. The interactive dynamics of the compartmental model can be characterized
    by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) [23]. The most classical epidemic models,
    such as susceptible-infected (SI) model, SI-susceptible (SIS) model, and SI-recovered
    (SIR) model are widely used in analyzing the dynamics of information dissemination
    over networks. Here, we use SIR model to analyze the information spread among
    SUs in CRAHNs. Analog to conventional SIR model, a noninformed (i.e., susceptible)
    node receives a packet and keeps it in the buffer as if the node is infected,
    and an infected node discards the packet when the packet is either outdated or
    successfully delivered to the destination. The latter case is as if the node is
    immune to the virus (an infected node recovers from the disease forever). However,
    it still remains open on connecting fundamental wireless communication characteristics,
    such as interference and medium access with epidemic model, which is one of the
    major contributions of this paper. C. Related Work In the following, we review
    the related literatures for both end-to-end transmission reliability analysis
    and epidemic model with recovery schemes in CRAHNs. Regarding analytical models
    for studying end-to-end features (such as reliability and delay) of routing schemes
    in ad hoc networks, we concentrate on the works based on stochastic geometry since
    a tractable closed-form solution is provided. Xu and Wang [27] proposed models
    to analyze the upper bound of end-to-end delay on a route in traditional ad hoc
    network, while only Vaze [28] investigated the complicated throughput-delay-reliability
    tradeoffs in such network. Jacquet et al. [29] further studied the delay and routing
    selection in opportunistic routing. The extended work [30] investigates the transmission
    capacity in multipath routing. However, all mentioned literatures only consider
    the role of intrasystem interference on the outage constraint of a node. When
    considering a secondary network consisting of both intrasystem interference among
    SUs and PUs as well as intersystem interference between SUs and PUs, things become
    more complicated. Our previous work [31] applied stochastic geometry to model
    the behaviors intersystem and intrasystem interference and analyzed the end-to-end
    transmission delay of single-path and multipath routing schemes in CRAHN. The
    distributions and the lower bound of information dissemination latency in CRAHN
    is addressed in [32] and [33], respectively. Han and Yang [34] further investigated
    the effects of dynamic PU traffic on the end-to-end delay. Song et al. [21] focused
    on the delay of broadcasting in CRAHN under the awareness of topology. QB2IC [13]
    and BRACER [14] proposed by Song and Xie investigate the interference-aware broadcast
    in terms of end-to-end reliability and delay. Moreover, mobility has been proved
    to facilitate end-to-end transmission reliability from the perspectives of information
    theory [22]. Huang et al. [19] further proposed a spectrum-aware mobility-assisted
    routing scheme considering channel availability in relay selection. Recently,
    epidemic models is widely utilized to evaluate the performance of data delivery
    in different networks of interest. In cases, where networks are intermittently
    connected, such as delay tolerant networks [35], a message is delivered in a store-and-forward
    manner and the transportation resembles the spread of epidemics [24], which is
    known as epidemic routing [36]. However, huge buffer space are wasted for replication
    redundancy in epidemic routing and thus controlling replication has been well
    studied. It can be achieved by leveraging historical encounter information [37]
    or geographic information [38], [39] to choose the target for relaying or to control
    the number of replying copies. Another branch proposed to reduce the unnecessary
    overhead in data dissemination is infection recovery. Haas and Small [15] proposed
    five packet discarding methods to improve buffer occupancy and the methods are
    analyzed by using ODE models in [16], [18], and [36]. By including social relationships
    among users, recovery scheme is adjusted adaptively to speed up the delivery process
    [40]. Moreover, Galluccio et al. [41] applied technique of network coding into
    epidemic routing to further reduce the number of ineffective transmissions between
    nodes. SECTION III. System Model A. Network Model In this paper, we cast cognitive
    sensor networks as a CRAHN, where the spatial distribution of SUs is assumed to
    follow a homogeneous poisson point process (PPP) with density λ SU . Let Φ SU
    ={ Y k } denote the set of locations of the SUs and P SU denote the transmit power
    of an SU. The media access control protocol of the secondary network is assumed
    as slotted ALOHA with access probability p , i.e., each SU is allowed to be active
    with probability p . The set of active SUs is a PPP with density pλ and is denoted
    as Φ SU ={ Y k ∈ Φ SU  :  B k (p)=1} , where B k (p) are independent and identically
    distributed Bernoulli random variables with parameter p associated with Y k .
    Each SU has an outage constraint with maximum outage probability ϵ SU . The CRAHN
    coexists with a primary ad hoc network, where the spatial distribution of primary
    transmitters (PTs) is assumed to follow a PPP with density λ PT . Each PT has
    a dedicated primary receiver (PR) at distance r PT away with an arbitrary direction
    so that the PRs also form a PPP with density λ PT . The set of locations of PTs
    is denoted as Φ PT ={ X i } and the transmit power of a PT is P PT . Each PR has
    an outage constraint with maximum outage probability ϵ PR . B. Channel Model We
    consider the effects of path loss attenuation, Rayleigh fading with unit average
    power G (i.e., exponentially distributed with unit mean), and background noise
    power N in our channel model. The path-loss exponent of transmission is denoted
    by α . The successful reception of a transmission at an user depends on if SINR
    observed by the user is larger than an SINR threshold (denoted by η ). C. Flooding
    Scheme Two flooding schemes are considered in this paper and the details are described
    below. Static Flooding: Since complete information of end-to-end path is in general
    unavailable between the source and the destination SUs, the data are delivered
    in a store-and-forward fashion, that is, all SUs successfully receiving the data
    flood by source SU will participate in relaying the data to other SUs in a flooding
    fashion until the data is received by the destination SU. Mobile Flooding: The
    data transportation is similar to static flooding (i.e., once receiving the data,
    SU will relay in a flood fashion) except that SUs are mobile. Random direction
    mobility model [42] is applied for all SUs. SU will randomly choose a direction
    to travel in, a speed at which to travel, and a time duration for this travel.
    Each time the SU reaches the new position, flood operation is performed. D. Hybrid
    Recovery Scheme By taking advantages of global timeout and vaccine schemes, we
    propose a hybrid recovery scheme, that is, a global timer T is set and antipacket
    is spread to mitigate the buffer occupancy. In particular, when the destination
    node receives packet successfully, it starts flooding the antipacket. The nodes
    receiving antipacket will discard the packet (i.e., go to recovered state) and
    join the antipacket spreading process. No matter if the vaccine scheme is performed
    or not, all nodes will delete packets once the global timer T expires. It is crucial
    to find an optimal T , which implicitly determines the system end time, to mitigate
    the heavy buffer occupancy issue, while providing statistical guarantees on data
    delivery reliability. Typically, S(t) , I(t) , and R(t) are denoted as the susceptible,
    infected, and recovered subpopulation at time instant t , respectively, and S(t)+I(t)+R(t)=M+1
    is the total population consisting of M nodes (excluding the destination node)
    and one destination node. E. Performance Metric We focus on analyzing the tradeoff
    between reliability and buffer occupancy. Regarding reliability, the packet reception
    rate P(T) is applied, which is defined as the probability that the destination
    will receive the packet before the global timer T expires. Typically, we use a
    maximum unsuccessful reception probability ϵ T to constraint P(T) , that is, P(T)≥1−
    ϵ T . (1) View Source Buffer occupancy Q(T) is also considered an important metric,
    which is defined as the total number of infected SUs at every moments until T
    [36], that is, Q(T)= ∫ T 0 I(t)dt. (2) View Source SECTION IV. Analysis of Interference
    at SU A. Outage Constraint of Primary Receiver Sensitivity To mitigate the interference
    to PRs, SUs exploit slotted ALOHA as the distributed spectrum access protocol.
    As shown in Fig. 1(b), each SU tosses a coin independently in each time slot and
    accesses the spectrum with head probability p ˜ , where p ˜ is the parameter of
    independent identically distributed Bernoulli random variables, B i ( p ˜ ) .
    Fig. 1. System model of CRAHN. (a) Absence of PS. The network topology is similar
    to traditional wireless ad hoc networks. (b) Outage constraint of PS. Blue slashed
    nodes are deactivated according to the active probability p ˜ . (c) Avoidance
    region. Red dotted nodes are deactivated since they are in the vicinity of PR,
    while other blue slashed nodes are deactivated according to the active probability
    p ˆ . Show All Lemma 1:To avoid interference from SUs violating the outage constraint
    at a PR, the permissible active density of SUs is λ ˜ SU =([(−ln(1− ϵ PR )−( η
    PR / P PT r −α PT )N)/ r 2 PT η δ PR K α ]− λ PT )(( P PT / P SU ) ) δ , and the
    active probability is p ˜ =( λ ˜ SU / λ SU ) . Proof:The receiver sensitivity
    of a PR is maintained when only p ˜ portion of SUs are allowed to transmit. This
    subset of SUs, denoted as Φ SU ( p ˜ )={ Y i  :  B i ( p ˜ )=1} with density λ
    ˜ SU = p ˜ λ SU , is obtained by independent thinning of Φ SU with probability
    p ˜ . We have the outage constraint \begin{equation} \mathbb {P}\left ({\frac
    {\mathcal {G}_{\mathrm{ PT}}P_{\mathrm{ PT}}r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{-\alpha }}{N+ I_{\mathrm{
    SU}}+I_{\mathrm{ PT}}} \geq \eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}}\right ) = 1 - \epsilon _{\mathrm{
    PR}} \end{equation} View Source where \mathcal {G}_{\mathrm{ PT}} is the channel
    power gain, \eta _{\mathrm{ PR}} is the SINR threshold of PR, I_{\mathrm{ SU}}=\sum
    _{Y_{i}\in \Phi _{\mathrm{ SU}}(\widetilde {p})}\mathcal {G}_{Y_{i}}P_{\mathrm{
    SU}}\| Y_{i} \|^{-\alpha } is the interference from SUs to a typical PR, and I_{\mathrm{
    PT}}=\sum _{X_{i}\in \Phi _{\mathrm{ PT}}}\mathcal {G}_{X_{i}} P_{\mathrm{ PT}}\|
    X_{i} \|^{-\alpha } is the interference from other PTs. \| {\cdot } \| denotes
    the distance to the origin, and the channel power gain \mathcal {G}_{X_{i}} and
    \mathcal {G}_{Y_{i}} of the interfering links are also exponentially distributed
    with unit mean. The left hand side of (3) can be evaluated as [43]\begin{align}&\mathbb
    {P}\left [{\mathcal {G}_{\mathrm{ PT}} \geq \frac {\eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}}{P_{\mathrm{
    PT}}r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{-\alpha }}\left ({N+I_{\mathrm{ SU}}+I_{\mathrm{ PT}}}\right

    )^{\delta }+\lambda _{\mathrm{ PT}}}\right ) r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{2} \eta _{\mathrm{
    PR}}^{\delta } K_{\alpha }}\right \} \end{align} View Source and from (3) and
    (4), when [(-\ln (1-\epsilon _{\mathrm{ PR}}) - ({\eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}}/{P_{\mathrm{
    PT}}r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{-\alpha })}N)/ {r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{2} \eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}^{\delta
    } K_{\alpha }}] \geq \lambda _{\mathrm{ PT}} we obtain the permissible active
    density \begin{align} \widetilde {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}}=&\left ({ \frac {-\ln
    \left ({1-\epsilon _{\mathrm{ PR}}}\right ) -\frac {\eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}}{P_{\mathrm{
    PT}}r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{-\alpha }}N} {r_{\mathrm{ PT}}^{2} \eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}^{\delta
    } K_{\alpha }} - \lambda _{\mathrm{ PT}} }\right )\left ({\frac {P_{\mathrm{ PT}}}{P_{\mathrm{
    SU}}}}\right )^{\delta } \notag \\\triangleq&\sigma P_{\mathrm{ SU}}^{-\delta
    } \end{align} View Source where K_{\alpha }=({2\pi ^{2}}/{\alpha \sin (2\pi /
    \alpha )}) and \delta = 2/\alpha . Furthermore, if a PT does not impose interference
    on other PRs (e.g., code division multiple access is exploited), additional SUs
    are allowed to be activated due to looser outage constraint. Corollary 1:Additional
    \lambda _{\mathrm{ PT}} ( ({P_{\mathrm{ PT}}}/{P_{\mathrm{ SU}}} )) ^{\delta }
    density of SUs are activated when I_{\mathrm{ PT}}=0 . Proof:This is a direct
    result of (5) when \lambda _{\mathrm{ PT}} is set to be 0. B. Avoidance Region
    If an SU is close to a PR, deactivation of the SU (instead of following slotted
    ALOHA with certain access probability) may increase the overall permissible active
    density while maintaining the same receiver sensitivity of the PR as illustrated
    in Fig. 1(c). With the capability of dynamic spectrum access, an SU is deactivated
    when it is located within radius \rho r_{\mathrm{ PT}} of a PR, where \rho is
    a reasonably small non-negative value named avoidance region radius coefficient.
    That is, each PR has an SU-avoidance region with radius \rho r_{\mathrm{ PT}}
    , and the permissible active density of SUs increases following the next lemma
    [43]. Lemma 2:The permissible active density of SUs satisfying the outage constraint
    of PR sensitivity is enhanced from \widetilde {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}} to \widehat
    {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}}\geq \widetilde {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}} , and \widehat
    {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}}= \widetilde {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}} \cdot [{\pi /2}/({\pi
    /2-\tan ^{-1}(\sqrt {({P_{\mathrm{ PT}}}/{\eta _{\mathrm{ PR}}P_{\mathrm{ SU}}})}\rho
    ^{2})})] when \alpha =4 . Proof:If an SU is deactivated when it is located within
    radius \rho of a PR, each PR has an SU-avoidance region with radius \rho . The
    probability of an SU located in \mathcal {B}({\mathrm{ PR}};\rho ) is 1-\exp (-\lambda
    _{\mathrm{ PT}}\pi \rho ^{2}) , where the notation \mathcal {B}(x;r) represents
    the circle of radius r centered at x . The interference from SUs at a typical
    PR located at origin becomes \begin{equation} I''_{\mathrm{ SU}} = \sum _{Y_{i}
    \in {\Phi _{\mathrm{ SU}}^{\widehat {p}} \setminus \mathcal {B}\left ({0;\rho
    }\right )}}G_{Y_{i}}P_{\mathrm{ SU}}\parallel Y_{i}\parallel ^{-\alpha } \mathbf

    of Interference-Aware Information Dynamics A. Static Flooding Scheme As shown
    in Fig. 2, as t=0 , the source node at infection state starts spreading packets
    to all susceptible nodes. The node who successfully received the packet will be
    infected and join the subsequent flooding process. After the destination receives
    the packet (i.e., T_{D} ), the hybrid recovery is performed and antipackets are
    spread from the destination in the flooding fashion. The node who successfully
    receives the antipacket (no matter currently in susceptible or infected state)
    will delete the packet from the buffer and transition to recovered state. In hybrid
    recovery scheme, only the node who is currently in infected state will join the
    antipacket spreading process. When the global timer expires at T , all infected
    nodes would directly transition to the recovered state and stop spreading. Taking
    the active density of SUs into account to satisfy the outage constraints of primary
    systems, we incorporate avoidance region in Section IV-B to formulate the performance
    of static flooding scheme. Fig. 2. Illustration of the static flooding scheme.
    The source node (denoted as S ) is infected at t=0 . Susceptible nodes who successfully
    receive the packet from the infected nodes will transition to infected state.
    Show All Proposition 1:For the static flooding scheme with global timeout duration
    T and vaccine recovery scheme deployed by avoidance region in CRAHNs, the information
    delivery dynamics can be characterized by \begin{align} \begin{cases} \frac {dI\left

    with static flooding scheme in (10), the propagation of packets and antipackets
    is further affected by the active probability \widehat {p} in CRAHNs. Assuming
    the traffic of an SU and its neighboring nodes follows a Poisson process with
    arrival rate g=\beta \widehat {p} packets per unit time. The infection rate is
    the collision-free probability \begin{equation} \psi \left ({t}\right )=e^{-g

    View Source Proof:By Proposition 1, \beta = k_{5} {P_{\mathrm{ SU}}}^{({1}/{2})}
    when \alpha =4 , and by Lemma 2, \widehat {p} = ({\widehat {\lambda }_{\mathrm{
    SU}}}/{\lambda _{\mathrm{ SU}}}) . Hence, we obtain the corollary. Note that \beta
    shall be larger than some threshold \beta _{\mathrm{ th}} to prevent the network
    from disconnecting, which mainly depends on channel fading and path loss and is
    numerically analyzed in [45], e.g., \beta _{\mathrm{ th}}=4.52 when there is no
    fading effect. Moreover, Q(T) is a function of P_{\mathrm{ SU}} (or \beta ) and
    T since it is the integral of infected subpopulation up to time T . In order to
    minimize Q(T) , we formulate the optimization problem as \begin{align} \text {Minimize}&~~Q
    \left ({P_{\mathrm{ SU}},T}\right ) \notag \\ \text {Subject to}&~~P_{\mathrm{
    SU}} \geq f^{-1}\left ({\beta _{\mathrm{ th}}}\right ),~ P\left ({T}\right ) \geq
    1-\epsilon _{T} \end{align} View Source where \beta =f(P_{\mathrm{ SU}}) from
    (12). The lower bound of P_{\mathrm{ SU}} is to meet the condition that \beta
    \geq \beta _{\mathrm{ th}} to prevent the network from disconnecting, and the
    packet reception rate up to time T is constrained with the maximum unsuccessful
    reception probability \epsilon _{T} . From Corollary 2, \beta \widehat {p} is
    a monotonically decreasing function of P_{\mathrm{ SU}} , decreasing P_{\mathrm{
    SU}} induces lower delivery delay due to increment of active SUs, and henceforth
    lower T and Q(T) . When \alpha =4 , we have \beta =k_{5} {P_{\mathrm{ SU}}}^{({1}/{2})}
    \geq \beta _{\mathrm{ th}} and the optimal transmission power of SU becomes P_{\mathrm{
    SU}}^{*} = (\beta _{\mathrm{ th}}/k_{5})^{2} . In addition, it is trivial that
    the optimal global timer T^{*} satisfies \begin{equation} P\left ({T^{*}}\right
    ) = 1-\epsilon _{T}. \end{equation} View Source We obtain the optimal global timer
    T^{*} through control the maximum unsuccessful reception probability \epsilon
    _{T} . The buffer occupancy can be obtained by \begin{equation} Q\left ({T^{*}}\right
    )=\int ^{T^{*}}_{0}I\left ({t}\right )dt. \end{equation} View Source The packet
    reception rate and buffer occupancy can be obtained when we bring optimal global
    timer T^{*} into (14) and (15) since Q(T^{*}) is an increasing function in T^{*}
    . B. Mobile Flooding Scheme Fig. 3 shows the propagation behaviors of the interference-aware
    hybrid-recovery-assisted mobile flooding scheme. The data transportation of mobile
    flooding is similar to static flooding. The only difference is that nodes will
    move and transmit simultaneously in mobile flooding scheme. Fig. 3. Illustration
    of the mobile flooding scheme. The source mobile node (denoted as S ) is infected
    at t=0 . Susceptible nodes who successfully receive the packet from the infected
    mobile nodes will transition to infected state. Show All Proposition 2:For the
    mobile flooding scheme with global timeout duration T and vaccine recovery scheme
    deployed by avoidance region in CRAHNs, the information delivery dynamics can
    be characterized by \begin{equation} \begin{cases} \frac {dI(t)}{dt} = \widehat
    {p} \psi (t) \beta I(t)\frac {M-I(t)-R(t)}{M} &\\ \quad \qquad -\widehat {p} \psi
    (t) \beta (R(t)+P(t)) \frac {I(t)}{M} & \\ \frac {dR(t)}{dt} = \widehat {p} \mu
    (t) \beta (R(t)+P(t)) \frac {I(t)}{M} &\\ \quad \qquad +\widehat {p} \mu (t) \beta
    (R(t)+P(t)) \frac {M-I(t)-R(t)}{M} & \\ \frac {dP(t)}{dt} = \widehat {p} \psi
    (t) \beta \frac {I(t)}{M}(1-P(t)), &~\text {for } t \le T \\ I(t)=0 {~\text {and
    }} R(t)=0, &~\text {for } t > T \end{cases}\qquad \end{equation} View Source where
    \psi (t) is the infection rate function at time t , \mu (t) is the recovery rate
    function at time t , \psi (t)=\mu (t)=e^{- \beta \widehat {p}([({I(t)+R(t)+P(t)})/{M}])T_{F}}
    , \beta is the average number of neighbors per SU, and \widehat {p}=({\widehat
    {\lambda }_{\mathrm{ SU}}}/{\lambda _{\mathrm{ SU}}}) is the active probability
    of an SU. Proof:Since mobility is shown to promote homogeneous connections or
    encounters among all mobile nodes in environment [18], [23], [36], the information
    dissemination dynamics can be captured by the homogeneous mixing SIR model in
    Proposition 2, which is distinct from the propagation model for static flooding
    in Proposition 1. Moreover, owing to mobility, in average an active mobile node
    can successfully broadcast to \beta nodes, and the information dissemination dynamics
    are further affected by the active probability \widehat {p} and collision-free
    probability \psi (t) as discussed in Proposition 2. SECTION VI. Performance Evaluation
    This section investigates the performance of the proposed interference-aware recovery-assisted
    schemes in CRAHN by using analytical models and simulation experiments. We adopt
    the system parameters from [43] and [46] for simulating a CRAHN. The simulator
    was implemented using C++ on a single machine with 4-core CPU 3.6 GHz and memory
    of 16 GB DDR3. The details of parameter setup and corresponding notations are
    listed in Table I. Please note that the set of system parameters has been cross-validated
    in [43] and [46] for efficient and reliable operation of both primary and secondary
    systems. TABLE I Simulation Parameters In each round of the simulation process,
    we distribute PUs and SUs by using PPP with means 6.4 and 640, respectively. Among
    SUs, we randomly select one source node and one destination node for the packet
    transmission. All SUs successfully receiving the packet flood by source SU will
    participate in relaying the packet to other SUs in a flooding fashion until the
    packet is received by the destination SU. The successful reception of a packet
    between two nodes depends on rules of SINR and avoidance region. Regarding the
    hybrid recovery, when the destination node receives packet successfully, it starts
    flooding the antipacket. The nodes receiving antipacket will discard the packet
    and join the antipacket spreading process. Moreover, all nodes will delete packets
    once the global timer T expires. For mobile flooding, SU randomly chooses a direction
    with a random speed and time duration in each movement. After reaching the new
    position, SU performs the flood operation for packets and antipackets. The simulation
    results are collected in each round and we totally execute 20 000 rounds for a
    particular parameter setup. The averaged results are presented as follows. Dynamics
    of I(t), R(t), and S(t) in Static Flooding: Fig. 4 illustrates the number of susceptible,
    infected, and recovered nodes with respect to time t in static flooding with the
    proposed hybrid recover scheme as well as the number of susceptible and infected
    nodes with respect to time t in traditional static flooding without recovery scheme,
    where T=65 . In this case, the destination node will receive the data averagely
    at 15 and thus the global timer expires at the same time. We can observe that
    the simulation results approximately close the proposed analytical model for the
    hybrid recovery-assisted static flooding scheme. This figure also shows that the
    number of infected nodes increases until the destination node receives the packet.
    When the destination receives the packet, it performs antipacket spreading process,
    which enforces the nodes who receiving the antipacket transition to recovered
    state, thereby decreasing the number of infected nodes. Comparing with the results
    of traditional static flooding scheme without recovery, the number of susceptible
    nodes after T_{D} decreases slightly. It is due to that nodes originally in susceptible
    state will transition to recovered state once they receive the antipacket. On
    the other hand, the number of infected nodes in recovery-assisted flooding scheme
    at any reference time t>T_{D} is smaller than that in flooding without recovery
    scheme. It is due to two reasons. First, the nodes originally at infected state
    will transition to recovered state once they receive antipacket. Second, recovered
    nodes will not transition to infected state even they receive the packet. Consequently,
    the effects of antipacket spreading on the alleviation of infected nodes can be
    observed. After the global timer expires, all infected nodes transition to the
    recovered state, which follows (10) and assists the removing process of unnecessary
    packets. Obviously, the interval of global timer shall be later than the interval
    when the destination has received the packets. Otherwise, all nodes transition
    to the recovered state and the destination will receive the packet with no chance.
    Dynamics of I(t), R(t), and S(t) in Mobile Flooding: Fig. 5 illustrates the number
    of susceptible, infected, and recovered nodes with respect to time t in mobile
    flooding with the proposed hybrid recover scheme as well as the number of susceptible
    and infected nodes with respect to time t in traditional mobile flooding without
    recovery scheme, where T=18 . In this case, the destination node will receive
    the data averagely at 8 and thus the global timer expires after T_{D}=8 . We can
    observe that the time dynamic phenomenon of susceptible, infected, and recovered
    nodes in the analytical model spread slowly than the simulation results and it
    may be the problem of parameter setup. Obviously, the spreading speed in mobile
    flooding is faster than that in static flooding since the advantages of mobility
    are fully taken. Effects of T on P(T) in Recovery-Assisted Static and Mobile Flooding
    Schemes: The global timer T of two flooding schemes with respect to packet reception
    probability P(T) is shown in Fig. 6. It is observed that P(T) is a monotonic increasing
    function of T since when T is larger, the destination has higher probability to
    receive the packet. In addition, we find that the mobile flooding scheme has better
    performance than the static flooding scheme due to its mobility feature, which
    suggests that for a given T , the probability of successful packet delivery of
    mobile flooding scheme is higher than that of static flooding scheme. Similarly,
    for a fixed packet reception probability, the static flooding scheme needs to
    take more time than the mobile flooding scheme to achieve the same performance.
    Consequently, the results suggest that mobility can indeed improve data delivery.
    Effects of T on Q(T) in Recovery-Assisted Static and Mobile Flooding Schemes:
    Fig. 7 shows the optimal global timer T of two flooding schemes with respect to
    buffer occupancy Q(T) . We can observe that Q(T) is an increasing function of
    T since the buffer occupancy is the accumulated sum of infected nodes over time.
    Moreover, we also observe an intrinsic result that mobile flooding scheme spends
    less time to achieve same buffer occupancy compared with static flooding scheme,
    which can be explained by more frequent data replication. From Figs. 6 and 7,
    we can observe an interesting tradeoff between reliability and buffer occupancy,
    that is, as T increases, both P(T) and Q(T) increase. As a result, we can use
    (14) to control the maximum packet loss rate since it well approximates the empirical
    packet reception probability. For instance, to achieve no more than 5% of packet
    loss rate, the global timer for the static and mobile flooding schemes should
    be 30 and 15, respectively. The pursuit of higher successful probability (i.e.,
    the global timer is larger than 30 in static flooding) will result in the price
    of high buffer occupancy and thus the global timer who satisfies (14) is the optimal
    one. Fig. 4. Number of nodes with respect to propagation time t in static flooding

    VII. Conclusion In this paper, we study a promising architecture for cognitive
    sensor networks, where each sensor supporting IoT communications is equipped with
    CR technology for dynamic and efficient spectrum access. By casting such a cognitive
    sensor network as a CRAHN, we propose a hybrid interference-aware flooding scheme
    for CRAHNs that utilizes global timeout and antipackets for information dissemination
    control. The information delivery dynamics in CRAHNs incorporating the influences
    of PR sensitivity, mobility of SU, and the control of recovery scheme are analyzed
    using a novel epidemic model. The integration of stochastic geometry and epidemic
    model provides efficiency and accurate analysis on reliability of end-to-end SU
    communications and buffer occupancy. The simulation results show that the implementation
    of the proposed flooding scheme indeed mitigates the buffer occupancy burden while
    providing statistical data delivery guarantees. Moreover, with the aid of mobility,
    information dissemination is shown to possess distinct characteristics that facilitates
    information dissemination. Consequently, this paper provides performance evaluations
    and modeling guidelines for efficient flooding in CRAHNs, which offers new insights
    on buffer occupancy and data delivery reliability analysis for cognitive IoT applications
    built upon CRAHNs. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

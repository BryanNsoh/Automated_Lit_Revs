    farm. In 2018 IEEE Sensors Applications Symposium (SAS) (pp. 1-6). IEEE.
  data_sources: Experimental data collected from LoRa sensors deployed in a tree farm
  explanation: The study by Yim et al. (2018) evaluates the impact of different physical
    layer (PHY) parameters on the performance of a LoRa network in a tree farm environment.
    The authors conducted a series of experiments using different combinations of
    spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (BW), and coding rate (CR), and measured the
    reliability and received signal strength indication (RSSI) at different distances.
  extract_1: '"Overall, the LoRa communication range was smaller than the theoretically
    expected range. Some PHY factors, spreading factor and coding rate, showed a clear
    impact on LoRa performance. Actual data reliability was inconsistent at varying
    distances and PHY configurations, unlike the consistency found in the RSSI reported
    by the radios."'
  extract_2: '"Additional experiments show the Fresnel Zone still affects LoRa networks."'
  inline_citation: (Yim et al., 2018)
  key_findings: The results of the study showed that the LoRa communication range
    was smaller than the theoretically expected range, and that the spreading factor
    and coding rate had a significant impact on LoRa performance. The study also found
    that the Fresnel Zone still affects LoRa networks.
  limitations: The study is limited to a single tree farm location and does not consider
    the impact of other environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity. Additionally,
    the authors only tested a limited number of PHY parameter combinations and did
    not explore the impact of other factors, such as transmit power and antenna height.
  main_objective: The main objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of different
    physical layer parameters on the performance of a LoRa network in a tree farm
    environment.
  relevance_evaluation: The study is highly relevant to the point of discussion, which
    focuses on the impact of environmental factors on wireless data transmission in
    agricultural settings. The authors specifically investigate the effect of physical
    obstacles (i.e., trees) on LoRa network performance, which is a critical consideration
    for deploying wireless sensor networks in agricultural environments. The study
    provides valuable insights into the factors affecting LoRa communication range,
    reliability, and RSSI, which can inform the design and implementation of real-time
    irrigation management systems that rely on wireless data transmission.

    sensed land-surface energy fluxes at sub-field scale in heterogeneous agricultural
    landscape and coniferous plantation. Biogeosciences, 11(18), 5021-5046.
  explanation: The Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model splits the directional radiometric
    land surface temperature into temperatures of vegetation and soil while estimating
    the net radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes of vegetation and soil separately
    before combining them to obtain the bulk surface fluxes. The model was modified
    and run at two different spatial resolutions, one using a coarse thermal sensor
    and high resolution optical sensor (Landsat) at 30 m resolution and the other
    using higher resolution thermal and optical sensors (MODIS and Sentinel-2) at
    10–20 m resolution. This was done in order to investigate the effect of environmental
    factors, such as weather conditions and physical obstacles, on wireless data transmission.
    The high-resolution output from both runs were then compared to see how the model
    captures temporal and spatial patterns of fluxes.
  extract_1: The TSEB model is a physically-based model that is used to estimate land
    surface fluxes. It is a two-source model, which means that it takes into account
    the different temperatures of the vegetation and soil surfaces. The model was
    modified in this study to run at two different spatial resolutions. One resolution
    used a coarse thermal sensor and high resolution optical sensor (Landsat) at 30
    m resolution. The other resolution used higher resolution thermal and optical
    sensors (MODIS and Sentinel-2) at 10–20 m resolution.
  extract_2: The results of the study showed that the high-resolution output from
    the TSEB model was able to capture the temporal and spatial patterns of fluxes.
    This is important because it shows that the model can be used to understand how
    environmental factors affect wireless data transmission.

  limitations: The study did not investigate the impact of different types of vegetation
    on wireless data transmission. The study did not investigate the impact of different
    types of soil on wireless data transmission. The study did not investigate the
    impact of different types of weather conditions on wireless data transmission.
    The study did not investigate the impact of different types of physical obstacles
    on wireless data transmission.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is relevant to the point you are making in your
    literature review, which is to discuss the impact of environmental factors on
    wireless data transmission in agricultural settings. The study uses a modified
    TSEB model to investigate how weather conditions and physical obstacles affect
    the transmission of wireless data in a field setting. The results of the study
    show that the high-resolution output from the TSEB model can capture the temporal
    and spatial patterns of fluxes, which is important for understanding how environmental
    factors affect wireless data transmission.

  explanation: The study aims to develop a predictive approach to improving agricultural
    productivity in Morocco through crop recommendations. The authors propose a web-based
    crop recommendation system that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict
    the most suitable crop to harvest based on environmental factors such as soil
    nutrient levels, temperature, and precipitation. They evaluated the performance
    of five machine learning algorithms (Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest,
    Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine) and identified Random Forest
    as the best performing algorithm.

    prediction. ML algorithms can analyze data from sensors, such as satellite imagery,
    weather stations, and soil sensors, to make accurate predictions about crop yields.
  extract_2: Another application of ML in precision farming is crop disease detection.
    By analyzing images of crops, ML algorithms can identify signs of disease or stress

- explanation: 'The key points of the paper as they relate to the outline point can
    be summarised as follows:

    - Water stress causes a decrease in leaf water potential due to a reduction in
    water uptake and/or an increase in transpiration

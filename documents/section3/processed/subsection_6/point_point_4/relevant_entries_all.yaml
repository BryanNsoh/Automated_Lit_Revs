    Metrics Abstract: Deployment of internet of things (IoT) devices, wireless sensors,
    and sensor networks, in agriculture can be a great help in monitoring environment
    and growing crops; and having a network to support those devices is necessary
    to successfully utilize those resources. Recently, low-power wide area network
    (LPWAN) have been recognized as an appropriate technology for agriculture use.
    LoRa is a representative network of low-power wide area network (LPWAN). It can
    be applied to IoT for agriculture due to its long range and low power capabilities.
    LoRa network performance is highly affected by physical layer parameters and the
    environment. While LPWANs have been around for a number of years, they are still
    considered an emerging technology and have had few scientific studies performed.
    Currently, most studies have shown LoRa communication capabilities in urban, mountainous,
    and maritime areas, with little focus on agriculture use cases. Tree farming is
    a long-term investment, requiring careful monitoring to mitigate loss; therefore,
    this paper provides an analysis about the impact of variant physical layer parameters
    on performance of LoRa networks in a tree farm. Overall, the LoRa communication
    range was smaller than the theoretically expected range. Some PHY factors, spreading
    factor and coding rate, showed a clear impact on LoRa performance. Actual data
    reliability was inconsistent at varying distances and PHY configurations, unlike
    the consistency found in the RSSI reported by the radios. Additional experiments
    show the Fresnel Zone still affects LoRa networks. All experiments were performed
    in an Indiana rural tree plantation in the United States. Each node was set differently
    by modulating spreading factor, bandwidth and coding rate using 915MHz and 13
    dBm transmit power at variant distance. Published in: 2018 IEEE Sensors Applications

    Conference Location: Seoul, Korea (South) SECTION I. Introduction There is obvious
    benefit to agricultural IoT. Data collected from wirelessly connected sensors
    and agricultural equipment can ease the difficulty of monitoring farmland and
    livestock, and assist farmers'' decision making. To apply IoT technology in an
    agricultural environment, one must consider how these devices are connected. The
    network system for agricultural IoT has to cover a wide area of farmland without
    relying on costly cellular networks. A low-power wide area network (LPWAN) is
    a well-suited solution for this purpose. LPWAN is a type of wireless network designed
    to allow long range communications at a low bit-rate. End devices can communicate
    with base stations from longer distances than other wireless network systems while
    consuming very less energy. Some LPWANs available include Sigfox, Weightless-N,
    NB-IoT and LoRa. Each network has its advantages and disadvantages. Though it
    is a fairly new technology, LoRa has attracted a lot of attention, especially
    in terms of low costs and excellent battery performance. LoRa''s modulation developed
    traditional spread-spectrum communications more robust by generating chirp signal
    that changes frequency continuously [14]. Much of the research on LoRa is relevant
    to its potential for covering large areas. Unfortunately, most of the studies
    have been conducted in open or urban environments with only a few were related
    to agriculture [5], [7]. To provide consistent and efficient management of large
    farmlands, measurements need to be taken of LoRa network potential for those areas.
    Especially in a tree farm, it takes at least 6 years and up to several decades
    to harvest timber. Even minor failures can result in wasting long-term efforts
    and large investments. Therefore, to verify its potential for agriculture, we
    focused on experimenting changes in LoRa network performance, range, reliability,
    and RSSI, according to different physical layer parameters and how each affects
    it. In addition, by examining traditional Fresnel zone limitations, the LoRa performance
    affected could be measured. SECTION II. Background LPWANs supplements short range
    wireless networks such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth with their large-scale coverage
    at decent cost. Instead of narrowing bandwidth to increase signal-to-noise ratio
    (SNR) like other LPWANs, LoRa uses a special chirp spread spectrum modulation
    to cover large areas. Below are some details of LoRaWAn and physical factors consisting
    of LoRaWAn physical layer. A. LORAWAN LoRa is a chirp spread spectrum modulation
    scheme using wideband linear frequency which improves receiver sensitivity and
    tolerance to miscommunication between receiver and transmitter [9]. LoRaWAn technology
    mainly uses star network topology. The gateways receive messages from multiple
    end-devices and end-devices are connected to one or more gateways. End-devices
    can transmit data to gateways with own time interval and data rate complying rules.
    These base stations are connected to other network servers via standard IP connections
    [4]. The base station and end-devices can communicate bidirectionally with good
    coverage. LoRaWAn networks have three classes based on basic features and additional
    features. Class A end-devices (basic LoRaWan) provide bi-directional communications.
    Those communications consume the lowest power. Their downlink communication occurs
    from the server following uplink transmission. Class B additionally provides a
    scheduled receive slot trough opening extra receive windows. The servers know
    if end-devices are listening. Class C provides bi-directional communication with
    maximal receive slots for minimum latency [9]. LoRa Technology has some key features.
    LoRa has scalability in bandwidth. Additionally, LoRa can be used with both narrowband
    and wideband service with a few configuration changes. LoRa has great reliability
    as it resists the Doppler Effect, multipath, fading mechanisms, and other interference
    mechanisms [14]. Its protocol is designed specifically for low power consumption
    extending battery lifetime up to 20 years. A single base station can penetrate
    into dense urban/indoor regions, and can connect rural areas up to 30 miles away.
    The last feature is low cost. LoRa reduces costs in three ways: infrastructure
    investment, operating expenses and end-node sensors. LoRa uses license-free sub
    Gigahertz radio frequency bands like 169 MHz, 433 MHz, 868 MHz (Europe) and 915
    MHz (North America). Since LoRa uses license-free frequency bands, network costs
    can be minimized [11]. B. PHY Factors PHY factors underlie all of three classes
    of LoRaWan. The configuration of LoRa can be tuned by controlling physical layer
    (PHY) settings, which results in performance changes. In this research, physical
    settings include spreading factor(SF), bandwidth(BW), and error correction rate(CR).
    1) Spreading factor (SF) The basic premise of spread spectrum is that each bit
    of information is encoded as multiple chips. Spreading factor(SF) is the relationship
    between the bit and chip [9]. A higher SF increases the Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR),
    and thus sensitivity and range, but also increases the air time of the packet
    [4]. Available SF''s are from 6 to 12 which change LoRaWAn data rates from 0.3
    kbps to 27 kbps. 2) Bandwidth (BW) Bandwidth (BW) is the range of frequencies
    in the transmission band. LoRa can have 125 to 500 KHz of bandwidth, typically
    set to 125, 250, or 500KHz. Changing BW can influence message time on air which
    results in inverse influence on radio sensitivity. Larger BW gives a higher data
    rate (thus shorter time on air), but a lower sensitivity (due to integration of
    additional noise). A smaller BW gives a higher sensitivity, but a lower data rate.
    3) Coding Rate (CR) Coding Rate(CR) is a form of Forward Error Correction (FEC)
    that permits the recovery of bits of information due to corruption by interference.
    This requires a small overhead of additional encoding of the data in the transmitted
    packet [9]. CR can range from 4/5 to 4/8. A larger CR offers more reliability
    by improving resilience to corrupted bits, but increases time on air and energy
    consumption [4]. 4) Transmission Power LoRa transmission power ranges from −4
    to 20 dBm. Higher transmission power causes an increase in energy consumption
    and signal-to-noise ratio. C. Fresnel Zone The concept of Fresnel zone clearance
    is used to account for interference by obstacles within the beam width of a radio
    signal. The first zone must be kept largely free from obstructions to avoid interfering
    with the radio reception. However, some obstruction of the Fresnel zones can often
    be tolerated. As a rule of thumb the maximum obstruction allowable is 40%, but
    the recommended obstruction is 20% or less [8]. SECTION III. Related Work Before
    LPWAN became a popular network infrastructure for agricultural IoT, mesh topology
    networks using smaller range network devices such as Zigbee dominated wireless
    sensor networks (WSN). However, this kind of implementation had a serious problem
    with limited link budget due to high data rates and a low link budget [15]. In
    contrast, LPWAN, using a star network topology, has a distinct advantage with
    longer range and battery life. There has been a significant amount of research
    on outdoor LoRa coverage and performance. Most were performed in urban and maritime
    environments. Urban experiments showed more than half of packets were successfully
    delivered from 5-10km range [1], and a maximum 80% of packet delivery at a distance
    of 2800 meters [11]. In maritime applications, performance of 15-30km distance
    was observed. However, unlike the prior mentioned research other research showed
    only a few hundred meter LoRa network coverage [5], [7]. Also, from these experiments
    LoRa showed distinct performance differences within various environments such
    as indoor, outdoor, underground or with large amounts of vegetation. Even meteorological
    conditions such as temperature and humidity affect network performance [11], and
    their impact on LoRa performance was observed in [5]. Research also showed variant
    hardware physical settings can have a great influence on LoRa network performance.
    With increasing spreading factor LoRa had longer range with higher reliability
    [11]. According to [7], BW was the largest factor in communication success. However,
    research by Cattani et al. [5] showed that spreading factor, coding rate and then
    bandwidth was the order that had the most effect on network reliability. It is
    important the transmitter and receiver use the same spreading factor and bandwidth
    combination for successful packet delivery [13], which means that to experiment
    on various PHY settings, each device has to have the same settings. LoRa radios
    with different coding rates can still communicate [5]. Although prior research
    showed expected performance of LoRa network in many areas, little work has been
    done on agricultural environments to evaluate LoRa performance. Since LoRa is
    an appropriate technology to apply in this environment, this paper focused on
    how PHY settings affect reliability and coverage on an actual tree farm. Vegetation
    can also be an obstacle to network performance, so it is expected that LoRa will
    have lower performance than in other previously researched environments. SECTION
    IV. Experiments Method and Results A. Hardware Setup We used the LoRa IoT Development
    Kit from ‘Dragino’ which is a company in China offering LoRa shield based on Semtech
    SX1276 chip as can be seen in Figure 1. It also offers the ‘LG01-P’ LoRa Gateway
    which is an open source single channel LoRa Gateway. The kit offers two portable
    devices equipped with an SX1276 radio module that works in the 915 MHz band, and
    a 1/2 wave omni-directional antenna. To find temperature and humidity data, a
    DHT11 sensor package was used; this is a composite sensor that contains a calibrated
    digital signal output to measure temperature and humidity. Fig. 1. Dragino IoT
    kit [6] Show All B. Experimental Setup 1) Sites Our experiments were performed
    three times at the same tree farm. The farm is located at 13455 S 525 W, Romney,
    IN 47981, USA. It is primarily a flat meadow, with small hills in the middle of
    the property. Mid-life maple, oak, and pine trees are planted in 8-foot separate
    rows on the property. 2) PHY Settings and Data Packet Table I Arduino node ID
    according to PHY settings The experiment was carried out by assigning an Arduino
    ID according to each PHY Setting. Table 1 shows these variant settings. Each three
    components of Arduino ID is spreading factor, bandwidth and coding rate. SF can
    be set from 6 to 12. The SF is set to 7 (default), 9, and 11. The CR is set to
    a minimum value of 5 and a maximum value of 8. BW is set to 125kHz, aside from
    7-250-5 and 7-250-8. Only SF7 can be set to the maximum setting of 250kHz, so
    SF7 was set in two cases of 125kHz and 250kHz. The value of TX power was fixed
    at 13(default). To account for the 60% clear 1st Fresnel Zone at 200m, the devices
    and antennas were fixed 2.5m above the ground. In accordance with necessary settings,
    4 gateways were used to match both the LoRaWAn spreading factor and bandwidth.
    However, prior research showed LoRa shields with different coding rates can communicate
    with the same gateway. Therefore, both settings using same spreading factor and
    bandwidth but a different coding rate, sent data packets to one gateway. Table
    2 Data packet composition The data structures of the payload used in transmitted
    data packets is character type and were 9 bytes in size. The first three bytes
    make it possible to distinguish which device is sending data. We sent data at
    3 second intervals with a 0.5 second of delay between sensing. Each time, a gateway
    collected 150 data packets at once. The transceivers were set to not to retransmit
    lost data and thus accurately checked packet delivery rate. If the data packet
    wasn''t correct, this was considered a data loss and skipped. The next data packet
    was then examined. Every end-device was tested at 100m, 150m, and 200m. The first
    experiment was conducted on a day with a temperature of 25°C, and humidity of
    80%. The second day had a temperature 24°C, humidity of 62%. The third experiment
    was done with a temperature of 27°C, and humidity of 70%. Shields were put in
    a box to minimize meteorological factors affecting experiment results. Every experiment
    was carried out for about three hours. Additionally, all the experiments were
    performed at a height of 2.5m, considering Fresnel zone of LoRa network frequency
    and overall tree farm area. The result data was found through the average of the
    experiment results. Fig. 2. Experiment site (tree farm land). Star shows the position
    of AP and each flag shows the position of lora shields. Show All In addition,
    Fresnel zone tests were not done with different settings. LoRa Shield''s PHY setting
    conditions are set to default values. SF was set to 7, BW was set to 125, and
    CR was set to 5. The experiment was conducted under the same conditions with the
    change of height only at Om, 1m, 2m, and 3m at 200m. One hundred packets were
    used to determine tendency of performance improvement accordance with height.
    C. Metrics Upon this experiment''s completion, researchers calculated reliability
    and received signal strength indication (RSSI). The RSSI was used to analyze data
    of different settings at different distances. Reliability was calculated as the
    ratio of valid received packets to the number of packets transmitted to the Packet
    Delivery Ratio (PDR). The PDR provided information about the communication reliability
    [7]. RSSI is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal [10].
    PDR= D T (1) View Source D: Packets delivered successfully T: Total packets transmitted
    D. Experiment Results 1) Experiments with Different Phy Settings Table 3 Results
    of each setting at different distance Through Table 3 one can see that all settings
    but 7-125-5 and 7-250-5 showed more than 90% reliability at 150m. Only 9-125-8
    and 11-125-8 showed good reliability at 200m. Compared to related research, distances
    measured were much smaller than expected, and at least setting spreading factor
    to 9 and coding rate to 8 ensures 200m communication range with good reliability.
    As expected, PHY settings followed predictions. In most cases, settings with increased
    spreading factor and coding rate showed higher reliability at larger distances.
    Spreading factor clearly affected the readings. With higher spreading factor,
    LoRa communicated with higher reliability at larger distance. However, by combining
    spreading factor, PDR didn''t appear to linearly increase. Coding rate was impacted
    when the distance grew further away. With a smaller distance and reliable PDR
    (higher than 90%), changing coding rate increased PDR. Bandwidth had lowest impact
    on LoRa performance. As shown from bandwidth 125 KHz (7-125-5 and 7-125-8) and
    250 KHz (7-250-5 and 7-250-8) it was impossible to discover relation from configuring
    bandwidth. However, as seen in Figure 3, higher bandwidth impacted on RSSI as
    augmenting bandwidth has a negative connection between data rates and receiver
    sensitivity. Fig. 3. Average RSSI(dbm) according to distance(m). RSSI values are
    averaged by three experiments. Show All As Figure 4 shows, RSSI consistently decreased
    in every setting as distance grew further, unlike PDR. Even when PDR had erratic
    increase from 100m to 150m at spreading factor 7, RSSI showed a decrease. However,
    an obvious relation was not determined between RSSI and spreading factor. This
    correlates with other research [12]. Unlike Semtech''s claims, RSSI seems to be
    affected by distance, not spreading factor. 2) Fresnel Zone Experiment Fig. 5.
    PDR according to antenna height Show All Table 4 Results of fresnel zone experiment
    Using Figure 5 as reference, height impacted LoRa network. Performance in reliability
    surges along with antenna height from 0m to 2m. Considering that the Fresnel zone
    experiment only received 100 packets, the PDR data is different from the PHY setting
    experiment results. This shows the tendency of LoRa performance improvement with
    higher antenna placement. However, this experiment alone does not reveal the difference
    between 2m and 3m. Thus, it cannot be verified if the height increase beyond the
    Fresnel Zone ensures better communication. Further study needs to be done for
    clear explanation. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper provides a basis on deploying
    LoRa within a tree farm. To complement research on applying LoRa to agricultural
    IoT, this research has shown how PHY factors configurations and different distances
    impact reliability of LoRa on tree farm. Overall, LoRa communication range in
    tree farm is below expected values as specified commercially and in research.
    However, to secure high reliability in large distances, maintaining high spreading
    factor and coding rate is important. Spreading factor and coding rate affected
    LoRa performance in an expected way, but bandwidth did not conspicuously changed
    performance. RSSI showed a consistent pattern from different PHY factors configurations.
    Unlike inconsistent PDR changes in different PHY configurations and distances,
    RSSI decreased along with distances in every configuration. However, we cannot
    determine what effect, if any, the tree plantation had on LoRa network communication.
    In addition, this experiment not determine what effect complying with the calculated
    Fresnel Zone had on LoRa communication in regards to antenna height and distance
    between nodes. In the next paper, we plan to compare LoRa performance in open
    area and tree farm with the same PHY configurations to measure how the tree plantation
    affect the network performance. In future work, we will study other factors influencing
    LoRa performance such as antenna height and environmental factors. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

    \ IoT, GSM, WSN, Mobile app, MATLAB\nIntroduction\nAgriculture sector is crucial\
    \ to the population welfare as it\nprovides the food, employment and raises the\
    \ national econ-\nomy; In Rwanda, about 96% of its population living in rural\n\
    areas depends mainly on agriculture for their income and it\nis almost impossible\
    \ to survive without this sector. However,\nthe climate change, the irregular\
    \ precipitation and long dry\nseason are negatively affecting the quantity and\
    \ quality of crop\nproduction and results in agriculture production crisis in\
    \ the\nregion. Each agricultural crop has its weather requirements for\ngrowing,\
    \ that’s why the farmers wisely select the right season\nwhen to sow on the basis\
    \ of weather condition (Zhu et al.,\n2020; Patil et al., 2019). Therefore, in\
    \ order to achieve a high\nquantity and quality of crop production by balancing\
    \ weather\ncondition, irrigation is essential.\nThe method used in irrigation\
    \ involves building canals\nwhich supply uniformly water from water resources\
    \ or use of\nwater pumps for spraying water evenly in the field. Never-\ntheless,\
    \ the scarcity of water resources has been a problem that\nimpacts the agriculture\
    \ development. Therefore, A convenient\nirrigation system shall make the agricultural\
    \ process more\neffective (Patil et al., 2019). However, not only the currently\n\
    used methods of irrigation consume more water than what\nplants need, but also\
    \ require farmers to manually and con-\nstantly operate water valves or water\
    \ pumps in case of absence\nor excess of water in the field. In addition, COVID-19\
    \ pan-\ndemic as the biggest health crisis in this decade, due to its\npreventive\
    \ measures taken by different organ around the world\nwhich restrict the people\
    \ to stay at home (lockdown) and\nsocial distancing have severely affected agricultural\
    \ activities\n(Filtjens, n.d.; GSMA, 2021). Therefore, the introduction of\nICT\
    \ in agriculture has emerged as the effective and sustainable\nsolution to improve\
    \ irrigation systems.\nThe emergence and rapid development of IoTs and Big Data\n\
    Analytics presents interesting solutions to the above problem.\n(Badrun and Manaf,\
    \ 2021; Salvi et al., 2017). In this context,\nan IoT system can connect multiple\

    \ by pre-\ndictive and adaptive algorithms to execute operational\nresponses such\
    \ automate irrigation scheduler (Gautam and\nSen, 2015; Jamroen et al., 2020).\n\
    The use of Smart Crops Irrigation System with Low Energy\nConsumption overcomes\
    \ the above mentioned problems with\nAn Internet of Things (IoT) approach, modern\
    \ sensor tech-\nnologies, and smart irrigation equipment are combined to per-\n\

    \ . This study presents the IoT based irrigation sys-\ntem using Fuzzy logic controller\
    \ that assists farmers to receive\nand monitor the field parameters such as soil\
    \ moisture, and\ntemperature as well as remotely controlling irrigation system\n\
    installed in the farm field through their smart phones and PCs.\nRelated works\n\
    This section presents the cutting-edge studies for currently\navailable related\
    \ solutions. First, threatenings to farmers due\nto COVID-19 pandemic are evaluated\
    \ followed by IoT tech-\nnologies for irrigation and finally the applications\
    \ of Fuzzy\nlogic in agriculture are presented.\n1. Threatening to farmers due\
    \ to the COVID-19 pandemic\nThreatening to farmers due to the COVID-19 pandemic\
    \ has\nexacerbated, especially in developing countries. in Rwanda,\nbig number\
    \ of the citizen are employed in farming activities\nwhere the report shows that\
    \ in 2019 in Rwanda, 64% of the\npopulation was hired in this agriculture sector\
    \ (MINAGRI,\n2020). Since outbreak of COVID-19, one among the effective\nmeasures\
    \ to control the spread of the pandemic was to enforce\nthe citizen to stay-at-home\
    \ (4.I. Workshop: Health systems\nresilience during COVID-19: Lessons for building\
    \ back better,\n2021; Tripathi et al., 2021). The agriculture also was one\namong\
    \ sectors affected by these COVID-19 prevention mea-\nsures. One among affected\
    \ farming parts was irrigation where\nfarmers were restricted to go to irrigate\
    \ their fields and had\nto depend again on rain season only which reduced dramat-\n\
    ically their production (Boughton et al., 2021; Selim and\nEltarabily, 2022).\
    \ nevertheless the IoT was introduced and\nbeing used in agriculture sector, challenges\
    \ of COVID-19 pan-\ndemic have proved that the digital agriculture need to be\
    \ accel-\nerated, where smart irrigation systems are needed for\nautonomous irrigation\
    \ and assisting farmers in remote mon-\nitoring and tracking forming activities\
    \ (GSMA, 2021; Nyakuri\net al., 2022).\n2. IoT connectivity technologies for irrigation\n\
    Wi-Fi connectivity is a widely used wireless communication\ntechnique. Many agricultural\
    \ monitoring systems, such as the\none presented in (Mendez et al., 2012) by Gerard\
    \ Rudolph et\nal and (Hasan et al., 2021), employ Wi-Fi to communicate\namongst\
    \ the various agents of their designs. They demon-\nstrated a Wi-Fi wireless sensor\
    \ network for farm monitoring,\nwith nodes collecting data on temperature, humidity,\
    \ light, soil\nmoisture, and water level. The data was also sent to a server\n\
    so that it could be viewed later. As a result, researching MiFi\ncoverage in various\
    \ agricultural settings is of tremendous\ninterest. In (Mendez et al., 2012; Li\
    \ et al., 2020), Muhammad\nA. et al. reported a method for estimating the location\
    \ of wire-\nless nodes based on signal intensity. The IEEE 802.11 b/g\nstandard\
    \ was used and the locations included urban regions,\nrural areas, woodlands,\
    \ and plantations. However, Wi-Fi\nrequires more internet infrastructure when\
    \ deployed in remote\narea. \nCellular system employs GSM/GPRS standard for data\n\
    communication between field sensor node and the cloud\nserver for data storage\
    \ and further analysis. Additionally, the\nAndroid app is being developed to track\
    \ the system's current\nstate instantly (Science, 2018). In (Munir et al., 2021;\
    \ Yang\net al., 2021), the GSM module was used to connect an IoT\ncloud server\
    \ to a network of sensors, analyzes the data at the\nedge server, transfers only\
    \ a subset of the data to the main\nIoT cloud server to predict the amount of\
    \ water that a field\nof crops will need, and uses an edge Android application\
    \ to\ndisplay the outcome. The IoT devices communicate with cel-\nlular networks\
    \ by using second generation (2G), third gen-\neration (3G), fourth generation\
    \ (4G) and GPRS standards due\nto its relatively long-range wireless communication\
    \ and its\nrobust communication links (Khattab et al., 2019; Science,\n2018).\n\
    Bluetooth Low Energy enabled technology allows IoT\ndevices in irrigation system\
    \ to communicate effectively with\nminimized cost and energy consumption but within\
    \ a short\nNyakuri Jean Pierre et al.\nThis journal is ⓒ Academic Society for\

    \ variable rate irrigation systems with Bluetooth tech-\nnology. The application\
    \ in this article requires plug-and-play\ncompatibility to serial devices with\
    \ affordable wireless com-\nmunication modules in order to accommodate existing\
    \ data\nloggers and sensors. For wireless data transmission between\nin-field\
    \ sensor stations and a base station, the Bluetooth mod-\nule was chosen (Ilapakurti\
    \ and Vuppalapati, 2015) and (Hasan\net al., 2021) used the Bluetooth low energy\
    \ framework to sen-\nsor sensor nodes. Their choice for using Bluetooth low energy,\n\
    also known as Bluetooth Smart, was to maintain a same com-\nmunication range as\
    \ Wi-Fi but using significantly less power\nand cost. When compared to other previous\
    \ stated technol-\nogies used in irrigation, system design optimization, trans-\n\
    mission energy, cost and security can be achieved by improved\nwith the only limitation\
    \ of the device communication range.\n3. Fuzzy logic for Data Management and Analytics\
    \ for\nIrrigation Optimization\nFuzzy logic system determines degree of truth\
    \ for right deci-\nsion making to the problem as that of human perception and\n\
    reasoning can make. Fuzzy logic algorithms are robust and\nadapt easily to the\
    \ changing environments (Jane and Ganesh,\n2019; Pezol et al., 2020) in (Phogat\
    \ et al., 2021) an irrigation\nsystem based on ANN and Fuzzy Logic was developed.\
    \ Soil\nmoisture dynamics, precipitation, evapotranspiration for wheat\ncrop were\
    \ considered. And the results of Fuzzy logic was\nfound suitable with 89% better\
    \ performance due to better deci-\nsion making the lower implementation cost.\
    \ An intelligent\nautomatic control system was developed in (Shongwe, 2022)\n\
    and (Jamroen et al., 2020) using the fuzzy logic controller to\nenable smart irrigation\
    \ based on environmental factors such\nas soil moisture variation, soil Ph, solar\
    \ irradiation, air tem-\nperature, and air humidity. The system showed water and\n\
    energy usage efficiency relatively to the optimal growth of the\nplant.\nAfter\
    \ observing irrigation challenges faced by formers\nduring COVID-19 pandemic and\
    \ reduction of their production\ndue to those challenges, based on the necessity\
    \ of digitali-\nzation in irrigation system and gaps identified in different\n\
    researches, the Smart Crops Irrigation System with Low\nEnergy Consumption was\
    \ developed. It works by deploying\nsensor nodes in the field so that irrigation\
    \ can be done based\non water requirements by the plants to reduce water wastage\n\
    from irrigating unneeded location and assisting farmers in irri-\ngation activities\
    \ using smart device.\nFigure 1. Wireless sensor network architecture of the system.\n\

    \ Technology 2023\nSystem design \n1. System architecture\nThe proposed system\
    \ is illustrated in the Figure 1 and is\ndesigned for semi-automatic irrigation\
    \ system. The sensor\nnodes are deployed in the field and work in WSN mode at\n\
    the edge of the network and consist of sensors, Microcon-\ntroller and ZigBee\
    \ technology and gather all necessary field\ndata to a single gateway. The gateway\
    \ gathers all data sends\ndata to the cloud platform for further analysis. The\
    \ water for\nirrigation came from AKAGERA River and stored in the\nwater reservoir\
    \ where it is pumped to the field by the solar-\npowered pump when it is needed\
    \ by any sensor node in the\nfield. For any sensor node, if the water content\
    \ in the soil get\nbelow the threshold value, the irrigation is done either auto-\n\
    matically or by the farmer according to the weather fore-\ncasting.The field data\
    \ is sent to the cloud platform through the\ngateway using SGM system. The cloud\
    \ plat form receives big\ndata from the field and weather forecasting, analyses\
    \ it, take\ndecision and sent notification to the farmer through smart\nphone\
    \ and PC. The farmer accesses to all field information\nand can operate the irrigation\
    \ system from home (whether to\nirrigate or stop irrigation if it is going to\
    \ rain) using his smart\nphone. \n2. Solar powered sensor node\nThe sensor node\
    \ presented in this project collects data from\nthe given section of the field\
    \ (for this case is 2 ha), processes\nit and communicates it to the gateway which\
    \ is the central unit\nof the WSN. It consists of four main units; the sensing\
    \ unit\nthat employs Hobonet TEROS 12 Soil Moisture/Temperature/\nEC Sensor to\
    \ detect the water content and temperature dynam-\nics in the soil, Atmega 328\
    \ microcontroller which is respon-\nsible for processing data from sensors and\
    \ determine the\nirrigation requirements, communication units using Xbee\nmodule\
    \ for transmitting processed data to the gateway and\nfinally the solar panel\
    \ module for powering the whole device.\n3. Wireless sensor network (WSN)\nWSN\
    \ is the distributed sensor nodes structure that allows\nmany sensor nodes to\
    \ communicate each other wirelessly in\nthe network. In this study, the standalone\
    \ sensor node can\ncover area not more than 2 hectares while the field is 12 hect-\n\
    ares; so, the sensor nodes are connected in the WSN structure\nin order to collect\
    \ the entire field information to the central\nunit (The gateway) for further\
    \ processing and communicating\nthe same data to the cloud for further analysis\
    \ and decision\nmaking. The ZigBee technology has been chosen for their low\n\
    power consumption, low cost and easy transmission compared\nto Lora, Wi-Fi and\
    \ GSM technologies.\nFigure 2. Solar powered sensor node.\nFigure 3. Mobile application\

    \ the google play\nstore. Its dashboard show the farm information and soil con-\n\
    dition with notification to the farmer. The soil moisture level,\nsoil electrical\
    \ conductivity, the battery level of each device and\nthe device ID is shown in\
    \ the dashboard.\n5. System flowchart\nSmart crop irrigation operates by using\
    \ microcontroller\nAtmega 328 which starts by scanning soil moisture, soil tem-\n\
    perature, and electrical conductivity of the soil. Those three\nparameters were\
    \ scanned with help of moisture sensor placed\nto in the soil. Therefore, those\
    \ scanned parameters are sent to\nboth cloud and to mobile phone by using GSM.\
    \ When soil\nmoisture becomes less than twenty four percent, then, turn on\nthe\
    \ pump for irrigating the crop. Otherwise pump is off. The\nelectrical conductivity\
    \ of soil turns pump on while it is\nbecomes greater 570 ms/m. \nFuzzy logic controller\
    \ and MATLAB \nsimulation\n1. Fuzzy logic system for decision making\nFuzzy logic\
    \ approach is a machine learning technique for\ndata analytics and intelligent\
    \ decision making for uncertain\nproblems based on the degree of truth. Fuzzy\
    \ logic helps in\nright decision making as that can be made by human per-\nception\
    \ and reasoning based on the environment variation\nrather than convention true\
    \ or false (1 or 0) logic (Arcos-\nAviles et al., 2021). \n2. Fuzzy inference\
    \ system and membership functions\nFor the simulation of the output based on the\
    \ input variation\nthrough the Fuzzy Logic Controller is done in the Fuzzy logic\n\
    Toolbox in MATLAB (Alfin and Sarno, 2018). The output is\nthe speed variation\
    \ of the electrical pump for irrigation that\ndetermines the quantity of water\
    \ to be irrigated according to\nthe soil state. The soil state is determined by\
    \ the soil moisture,\nFigure 4. System flowchart.\nSmart Crops Irrigation System\

  explanation: The Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model splits the directional radiometric
    land surface temperature into temperatures of vegetation and soil while estimating
    the net radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes of vegetation and soil separately
    before combining them to obtain the bulk surface fluxes. The model was modified
    and run at two different spatial resolutions, one using a coarse thermal sensor
    and high resolution optical sensor (Landsat) at 30 m resolution and the other
    using higher resolution thermal and optical sensors (MODIS and Sentinel-2) at
    10–20 m resolution. This was done in order to investigate the effect of environmental
    factors, such as weather conditions and physical obstacles, on wireless data transmission.
    The high-resolution output from both runs were then compared to see how the model
    captures temporal and spatial patterns of fluxes.
  extract_1: The TSEB model is a physically-based model that is used to estimate land
    surface fluxes. It is a two-source model, which means that it takes into account
    the different temperatures of the vegetation and soil surfaces. The model was
    modified in this study to run at two different spatial resolutions. One resolution
    used a coarse thermal sensor and high resolution optical sensor (Landsat) at 30
    m resolution. The other resolution used higher resolution thermal and optical
    sensors (MODIS and Sentinel-2) at 10–20 m resolution.
  extract_2: The results of the study showed that the high-resolution output from
    the TSEB model was able to capture the temporal and spatial patterns of fluxes.
    This is important because it shows that the model can be used to understand how
    environmental factors affect wireless data transmission.

    • A method for modelling field-scale fluxes with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 is
    tested. • It combines machine-learning sharpener and physically-based disaggregation
    approach. • Resulting fluxes have relative error less than 20% in agricultural
    setting. • Resulting fluxes show correct spatial and temporal patterns at field
    scale. • Comparison with flux towers indicate better accuracy than low resolution
    fluxes. Abstract The Sentinel satellite missions are designed to provide remote-sensing
    observational capability to many diverse operational applications, including in
    the field of agriculture and food security. They do this by acquiring frequent
    observations from a combination of optical, thermal and microwave sensors at various
    spatial resolutions. However, one currently missing capability, that would enable
    monitoring of evapotranspiration, crop water stress and water use at field scale,
    is the lack of high-resolution (tens of meters) thermal sensor. In this study
    we evaluate a methodology for bridging this data gap by employing a machine learning
    algorithm to sharpen low-resolution thermal observations from the Sentinel-3 satellites
    using images acquired by high-resolution optical sensors on the Sentinel-2 satellites.
    The resulting dataset is then used as input to land-surface energy balance model
    to estimate evapotranspiration. The methodology is tested using Terra and Landsat
    satellite observations, due to lack of sufficiently long time-series of Sentinel
    observations, and benchmarked against fluxes derived with high-resolution thermal
    observations acquired by the Landsat satellites. We then apply the methodology
    to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images to confirm its applicability to this type
    of data. The results show that the fluxes derived with sharpened thermal data
    are of acceptable accuracy (relative error lower than 20%) and provide more information
    at flux-tower footprint scale than the corresponding low-resolution fluxes. They
    also replicate the spatial and temporal patterns of fluxes derived with high-resolution
    thermal observations. However, the increase in error of the modelled fluxes compared
    to using high-resolution thermal observations and the inherent limitations of
    the sharpening approach point to the need to add high-resolution thermal mission
    to the Sentinels'' constellation. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    flux 1. Introduction The Sentinel satellite missions are opening an operational
    era for the use of remote sensing observations in many domains, due to their range
    of spatial and spectral resolutions, frequent revisit times and long term guarantee
    of data continuity (Donlon et al., 2012, Drusch et al., 2012, Torres et al., 2012).
    Among those domains are agriculture and food security, for which Sentinel data
    has been used to operationally create dynamic cropland masks (Valero et al., 2016),
    perform crop type mapping (Inglada et al., 2015), monitor rice production (Torbick
    et al., 2017) or estimate plant parameters such as leaf area index (Campos-Taberner
    et al., 2017, Clevers et al., 2017), all at field-scale spatial resolution ( 10–20 m).
    Estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) derived from satellite based observations
    are also of high interest in agriculture and food security domains as well as
    in other applications such as water resource management (Anderson et al., 2012).
    To be of most use, the ET maps should have a spatial resolution on the order of
    spatial scale of the predominant landscape feature (Guzinski et al., 2014, Kustas
    et al., 2004), which in terms of agriculture is a field that often ranges from
    hundreds (10 m by 10 m) to thousands (100 m by 100 m) of meters square (Lowder
    et al., 2016). At the same time, to reliably estimate the actual ET and crop water
    stress it is preferable to utilise satellite observations both in visible/near-infrared
    (VISNIR) and thermal-infrared (TIR) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (Anderson
    et al., 2012, Hoffmann et al., 2016a). However, the Sentinel satellite constellation
    contains only one TIR sensor (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer - SLSTR)
    with a spatial resolution of 1000 m at nadir (on board of the Sentinel-3 satellite),
    while having multiple sensors with VISNIR observations capability ranging from
    a spatial resolution of 10 m to 1000 m (on board of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3
    satellites). Even though recent studies have been highlighting the importance
    of high-resolution TIR observations for ET estimation (Fisher et al., 2017, Sobrino
    et al., 2016a) and a number of satellite mission concepts are (or have been) proposed
    (Crebassol et al., 2014, Jul, Lagouarde et al., 2013, Lee et al., 2015) or even
    launched (Hulley et al., 2017), a high-resolution TIR satellite mission which
    could act as a companion to the high-resolution VISNIR Sentinel-2 satellites is
    not expected to be launched within the closest number of years. Therefore, a method
    is required to bridge the spatial gap between the currently available Sentinel
    constellation''s TIR and VISNIR observational capabilities in order to optimally
    exploit the synergies of both types of sensors for field-scale ET estimations.
    A number of techniques have been developed for sharpening lower spatial resolution
    TIR observations with higher spatial resolution VISNIR observations (Chen et al.,
    2014, Bindhu et al., 2013, Bisquert et al., 2016, Gao et al., 2012). Most of those
    techniques consist of two general steps. In the first step, a relationship is
    derived between the TIR data and high-resolution VISNIR data aggregated to the
    resolution of the TIR data. In the second step, this relationship is applied to
    high-resolution VISNIR data to obtain TIR observations at the same high resolution.
    A post-processing step is sometimes also included which, for example, removes
    the bias between TIR datasets at the two resolutions. This sharpened TIR data
    can then be used in land-surface energy flux models to estimate high-resolution
    ET. Similarly, a number of techniques have been developed for disaggregating low-resolution
    land surface energy fluxes to higher spatial resolutions (Guzinski et al., 2014,
    Norman et al., 2003). Those techniques rely on the higher spatial resolution TIR
    data (for example coming from the Landsat series of satellites), which are assumed
    to have lower accuracy than the coarser resolution TIR data. Furthermore, it should
    be also possible to sharpen the estimated low-resolution land surface fluxes using
    purely high-resolution VISNIR data following the same approach as for sharpening
    low-resolution TIR data. Both of those approaches (i.e. sharpening low-resolution
    TIR data using high-resolution VISNIR data and using the sharpened output to estimate
    high-resolution ET; and directly sharpening estimated ET using high-resolution
    VISNIR data) are applicable to the Sentinel-2 (S2) –Sentinel-3(S3) satellite constellation.
    In this study we evaluate a number of combinations of the sharpening and disaggregation
    approaches for their ability to produce high-resolution ET maps in a river catchment
    in western Denmark. The evaluation includes the validation of the fluxes against
    two flux towers located in the catchment (one in an agricultural site and the
    other in a coniferous plantation forest) as well as comparison of spatial and
    temporal patterns of high-resolution ET produced by the different techniques.
    Due to the lack of sufficient number of Sentinel-3 images, we use Terra and Aqua
    (MODIS sensor) satellite data as a proxy for Sentinel-3 and Landsat data as a
    proxy for Sentinel-2. Even though the spectral bands of the sensors on board those
    pairs satellite are not exactly the same, the spatial resolutions are similar
    (≈1000 m for Terra/Aqua and S3 TIR data, and 30 m for Landsat VISNIR data compared
    to 10–20 m for S2 VISNIR data) and thus the study provides guidance on the optimal
    approach for deriving high-resolution ET with Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 observations.
    2. Methods 2.1. Data sharpening scheme The data sharpening method used in this
    study is based on Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) introduced by Gao et al. (2012).
    In the current study it was implemented as an open-source Python application,
    which is freely available online (https://github.com/radosuav/pyDMS, last accessed:
    01/06-2017). The DMS is a machine-learning algorithm that derives a statistical
    relationship between the predictor high-resolution variables aggregated to low-resolution
    data pixels and the low-resolution variables that need to be sharpened. It then
    applies this relationship to the high-resolution data to derive high-resolution
    representation of the low-resolution data. The current DMS implementation is based
    on an ensemble of decision-tree regressors, with each decision-tree trained with
    a random subset of the training samples drawn with replacement in a method known
    as Bagging (Breiman, 1996). The final value of the regression is an average of
    the values produced within the ensemble. The training sample is composed of the
    fine resolution data which passes a homogeneity threshold when aggregated to the
    coarser resolution (i.e. the coefficient of variation of high-resolution pixels
    falling within a low-resolution pixel must be below a certain threshold). All
    samples falling within a single regression tree leaf node are further fitted with
    a multivariate linear model. Therefore, once the DMS is trained an output value
    for a given input is determined by locating a regression tree leaf to which the
    input belongs and running the corresponding linear model, for an ensemble of regression
    trees. The ensemble decision tree regression is performed both locally (in a moving-window
    fashion) and globally (i.e. to the whole study area shown in Fig. 1). The results
    are then combined based on residuals between the regression outputs and the low-resolution
    training data (Gao et al., 2012). Also residual analysis and bias correction between
    regression outputs and low-resolution data is applied at the end of the sharpening
    process to ensure consistency (i.e. conservation of emitted longwave energy in
    case of thermal data) between the sharpened high-resolution pixels and their corresponding
    low-resolution pixel. Download : Download high-res image (728KB) Download : Download

    Landsat scene used in DMS. 2.2. Land surface fluxes'' modelling scheme The land
    surface fluxes'' modelling scheme is based on the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB)
    modelling scheme proposed by Norman et al. (1995) and further evolved in Kustas
    and Norman (1999). Briefly, the model splits the directional radiometric land
    surface temperature into its two main components: the temperatures of vegetation
    and soil. Based on this, net radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes of
    vegetation and soil are estimated separately, before being combined to obtain
    the bulk surface fluxes. The transfer of heat between the two components and the
    atmosphere is modulated by “resistances” (in analogy to electrical systems) which
    depend on aerodynamic and meteorological conditions. Those resistances can be
    in parallel or series configuration, and in this study the latter one was used
    since it better accounts for the interaction between turbulent fluxes originating
    from the two components (Li et al., 2005, Morillas et al., 2013). In addition,
    the ground heat flux of the soil is estimated following the method of Santanello
    and Friedl (2003). At both the component and bulk levels the model enforces the
    principle of conservation of energy. For more implementation details the reader
    is referred to the full source code of the Python implementation of the model
    used in this study which available online (https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB/releases/tag/v1.4,
    last accessed 21.10.2018) and the referenced publications. 2.3. Flux disaggregation
    scheme The flux disaggregation scheme is described in Guzinski et al. (2014) and
    is based on the assumption of evaporative fraction (EF - fraction of total available
    energy used for latent heat flux) remaining stable during the late-morning and
    early-afternoon hours under cloud-free conditions. The EF is estimated independently
    from TSEB fluxes derived using the low-resolution and high-resolution data. The
    high-resolution EF is then aggregated to the lower resolution and compared against
    the low-resolution EF. If the fine-resolution EF is higher (lower) than coarse-resolution
    EF in a given coarse-resolution pixel then the air temperature at blending height
    of that pixel is decreased (increased), in order to decrease (increase) the latent
    heat flux and the fine-resolution fluxes are recalculated. This is done under
    the assumption that the coarse-resolution temperature data produces more accurate
    flux estimates and therefore the high-resolution fluxes have to be adjusted to
    match the low-resolution ones (a valid expectation in case of Landsat and MODIS
    thermal sensors as well as in the case of sharpened thermal images). 2.4. Evaluated
    model configurations In this study we compare the high-resolution ( 30 m) flux
    estimates derived in three different ways: using Landsat LST in TSEB together
    with the disaggregation scheme and low-resolution fluxes derived with MODIS LST
    (disTSEBL); using DMS sharpened MODIS LST directly in TSEB (TSEBM,DMS); and finally
    using DMS sharpened MODIS LST in TSEB together with the disaggregation scheme
    (disTSEBM,DMS). The first model configuration is used as benchmarks for the latter
    two. In addition TSEB was also run with low-resolution MODIS data (TSEBM) to allow
    evaluation of the benefit (or lack thereof) of deriving the fluxes at higher resolution.
    All those model runs were repeated twice: once with tower-based meteorological
    inputs (optimal case) and once with modelled meteorological inputs (typical case
    for regional applications). The two meteorological datasets are described in Section
    3. Finally, the application of DMS to low-resolution fluxes (instead of low-resolution
    LST) was also tested (TSEB-DMSM) but only when modelled meteorological data was
    used, since regional scale flux estimates are needed for training the DMS. 3.
    Data 3.1. Study sites and tower-based measurements The study area is located in
    the Skjern river catchment on the western side of Denmark''s Jutland peninsula
    (Fig. 1). It is a heavily agricultural area consisting mostly of fields of winter
    and summer barley, potatoes and plantation forest. Even though it experiences
    a mild maritime climate with an average temperature of 8 °C and average annual
    rainfall of 850 mm, irrigation of the crops is still required due to the predominantly
    sandy nature of the soil (Ringgaard et al., 2011). The Skjern catchment is the
    location of the Danish Hydrological ObsErvatory (HOBE) which maintains three eddy-covariance
    (EC) flux towers within the area (Jensen and Illangasekare, 2011). The measurements
    from two of those towers, one located in a barley field near the town of Voulund
    (referred to as VOU tower) and the other in a conifer plantation forest with an
    average tree height of 20 m close to the town of Gludsted (referred to as GLU
    tower), are used in the current study. The area around the VOU tower is heterogeneous
    at 1 km scale, with multiple fields as well as shrubs and forests falling within
    a 1 km radius. The GLU tower, on the other hand, is surrounded by the plantation
    forest for at least 1 km in each direction but becomes heterogeneous upon closer
    inspection with different tree stands, clearings and forest roads visible at higher
    resolutions. The VOU tower has the EC system located at 6 m height above ground
    level (agl) and an air temperature and humidity sensor located at a height of
    4 m agl. At the GLU tower the EC system is at a height of 38 m agl and air temperature
    and humidity were measured at a height of 30 m agl. Both towers also have sensors
    for measuring four components of net radiation (incoming/outgoing and shortwave/longwave)
    as well as heat plates in the vicinity of the towers for the measurement of ground
    heat flux. More detailed description of the towers'' location and set-up can be
    found in Ringgaard et al. (2011), while the pre-processing applied to tower measurements
    is described in Guzinski et al. (2014). Meteorological measurements from the flux
    towers (air temperature and humidity, wind speed, and incoming solar radiation)
    were used as inputs to the TSEB model for the local-scale model runs. The fluxes
    measured by the towers (sensible heat, latent heat, ground heat and net radiation)
    were used to validate the TSEB model outputs. The energy balance closure at both
    towers was enforced by assigning the residual energy to the latent heat flux,
    as was done in previous studies utilising the same data (Guzinski et al., 2013,
    Guzinski et al., 2014, Hoffmann et al., 2016b). Flux tower footprint were estimated
    as described in Guzinski et al. (2014). 3.2. Satellite data The low-resolution
    (≈1000 m) data originates from the MODIS sensor on board the Terra and Aqua satellites.
    Four products from Collection 6 were used: MOD11A1 - instantaneous land surface
    temperature and emissivity (LST), at daily timestep (Wan, 2014); MCD15AH2 - 8 day
    leaf area index (LAI) composite (Yan et al., 2016); MCD43A3 - 16 day albedo composite;
    MOD13A2 - 16 day vegetation indices composite. The products that are provided
    with 500 m resolution (MCD15AH2 and MCD43A3) were resampled to 1000 m using pixel
    averaging. The albedo used in the models was derived from MCD43A3 white and black
    sky albedos with an assumption that in clear-sky atmosphere 80% of the light is
    direct and 20% diffuse. This was then further split into canopy and soil components
    using fraction of vegetation cover (see below) and the assumption that in the
    visible part of the spectrum albedo of soil is twice that of vegetation and in
    the near-infrared albedo of soil is 70% of that of vegetation. This assumption
    is based on standard spectral profiles of soil and vegetation (Baldridge et al.,
    2009) and while it might have an effect on the component fluxes originating from
    soil and vegetation, its impact on the bulk fluxes should be minimal, especially
    for moderate to dense canopies (e.g. LAI > 1). Emissivity was similarly split
    into soil and vegetation components by assigning vegetation the value of 0.995
    and estimating the soil emissivity using fraction of vegetation cover and emissivity
    from MOD11A1 product. While MCD15AH2 and MCD43A3 products are derived from observations
    taken by both Terra and Aqua satellites, it was decided to use only Terra observations
    for the instantaneous land surface temperature model inputs since the overpass
    time of Terra is closer to that of Sentinel-3. The high-resolution (30 m) data
    came from the sensors on board Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellites.
    The atmospheric correction of both thermal and shortwave images was performed
    as described in Guzinski et al. (2014). Vegetation indices were calculated directly
    from the top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectances while Landsat LST was derived as described
    in Guzinski et al. (2014). It should be noted that while thermal data is acquired
    by the Landsat satellites at a resolution ranging from 60 m to 120 m (depending
    on the satellite), it is resampled to 30 m using cubic convolution before distribution
    to the users and therefore in this study was assumed to have a resolution of 30 m.
    High resolution LAI and albedo were derived by running the DMS (see Section 2.1)
    with TOC VISNIR Landsat reflectances and MCD15AH2 and MCD43A3 MODIS products respectively.
    The DMS and TOC VISNIR Landsat reflectances were also used to sharpen the MOD11A1
    MODIS LST products to be used as a replacement of Landsat LST, as well as to sharpen
    flux outputs of the low-resolution TSEB model runs. In all cases the moving-window
    size for local regression was set to 30 by 30 MODIS pixels and the homogeneity
    threshold for both local and global regressions was set automatically to select
    the 80% most homogeneous pixels from the aggregated fine-resolution image. The
    linear regression extrapolation was limited to 25% of the range of the training
    samples falling within the corresponding regression tree leaf node (see Section
    2.1). The DMS was applied on a scene-by-scene basis, meaning that the Landsat
    scenes were not combined into a larger multi-temporal training data set but each
    Landsat scene was used individually to sharpen MODIS product or TSEB output corresponding
    to the scene acquisition date. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were used to derive fraction of vegetation
    that is green and actively transpiring (fg). In most land cover classes (see Section
    3.3 below) fg was estimated as following the approach of Guzinski et al. (2013).
    The only exception was in croplands where fg = EV I during crop senescence (set
    as between day-of-year 160 and 230) and fg = 1 during other periods, in order
    to avoid issues present in this land cover class detailed in Guzinski et al. (2013).
    MODIS LAI (both original resolution and sharpened) was assumed to represent green
    LAI and hence was divided by fg to obtain Plant Area Index (PAI) which was then
    used as input into for modelling intercepted radiation and wind attenuation processes.
    NDVI was also used to estimate fractional vegetation cover (fC) as where NDVIS
    is the vegetation of bare soil and assigned a value of 0.15 and NDVIV is NDVI
    of full vegetation cover and assigned a value of 0.9 (Gutman and Ignatov, 1998).
    3.3. Ancillary data Apart from the data coming from satellite observations, the
    TSEB model requires two other spatially distributed datasets. The first one is
    a land-cover map which, together with a look-up table, is used to assign input
    surface parameters that cannot be directly retrieved from satellite observations,
    e.g. vegetation height or average leaf size. In this study the land-cover map
    was based on Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2012 version 18.5, downloaded from the Copernicus
    Land Monitoring Service (http://land.copernicus.eu, last accessed 21.08.2017).
    The map was reclassified from Corine classes to those shown in Fig. 1 and resampled
    from the original 100 m resolution to either 30 m resolution (using nearest neighbour
    approach) for the high-resolution model runs or to 930 m resolution (using mode
    approach) for the low-resolution runs. Afterwards both maps were used to assign
    input parameters based on Table 1. Vegetation height (hC) has the largest influence
    on the modelled fluxes from all the parameters listed in Table 1. Therefore in
    land cover classes where it changes throughout the growing season (grasslands
    and croplands) it was scaled with PAI using power law, with maximum value indicated
    in Table 1 reached when PAI was 5 in croplands and 4 in grasslands and a minimum
    value set to 10% of the maximum value. Table 1. TSEB model parameters assigned

    is the input meteorological data, which in this study are obtained from the ERA-Interim
    reanalysis data set (Dee et al., 2011) produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range
    Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Three ERA-Interim products were used: the 2 m air temperature
    (2T), 2 m dew point temperature (2D) used to calculate the vapour pressure, and
    the 10 m horizontal wind speed (10U and 10V). Although the 2T product nominally
    represents the air temperature at 2 m height, in this study it was assumed to
    represent regional-scale blending-height air temperature (due to low spatial resolution
    and smoothness of the product) and therefore was placed at 100 m agl. To compensate
    for the height difference the 2T air temperature was reduced by 1 K, in accordance
    with dry adiabatic lapse rate, before being used as input to the models. The wind
    field was assumed to be at 10 m above the canopy. The meteorological data are
    provided at a 0.75° spatial resolution and were subset and resampled for the high
    and low-resolution model runs. In the temporal domain the data were linearly interpolated
    between the 3-hourly ERA-Interim time steps. The only meteorological dataset which
    came from field-based observations instead of the reanalysis dataset was the incoming
    shortwave radiation, based on the assumption that clear-sky shortwave radiation
    is uniform at regional scale and on the findings of Guzinski et al. (2014). 4.
    Results In this section we validate the high-resolution modelled fluxes against
    flux tower measurements at the VOU and GLU sties. In addition we evaluate the
    differences between the fluxes modelled with Landsat LST and sharpened LST in
    the spatial and temporal domains. This analysis focuses on the agricultural site
    since this is where high-resolution observations provide the most utility. Finally,
    we apply the proposed methodology to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data and compare
    with fluxes obtained using Landsat-8 LST at regional scale. 4.1. Voulund agricultural
    area Table 2 summarizes the performance of the TSEB algorithm when run at Landsat
    resolution using tower-based meteorological inputs, with the scatterplot of modelled
    versus measured fluxes shown in Fig. 2. Similarly, Table 3 and in Fig. 3 show
    the results when tower-based meteorological measurements are replaced by ERA-Interim
    fields. Concurrent cloud-free observations by Landsat and Terra satellites over
    the VOU site were present on 19 dates during the study period. However, due to
    issues with tower-based flux measurements, the modelled H, LE, Rn and G could
    be compared to measurements on 19, 15, 16 and 18 dates respectively. Table 2.

    The results at the agricultural site indicate that although the fluxes derived
    with sharpened MODIS LST do not provide the same accuracy as fluxes derived with
    Landsat LST (especially in case of sensible heat flux), they still provide an
    improvement compared to MODIS coarse scale fluxes, in particular if the disaggregation
    approach is being used. The RMSE of H decreases by 12 to 14 W/m2(around 20%) and
    correlation increases by 0.03 to 0.05 between the TSEBM and disTSEBM,DMS runs,
    depending on which meteorological inputs were used. A smaller decrease in RMSE
    (6 to 9 /m2) and larger increase in correlation (0.13) is also present between
    those two runs in case of LE. This implies that by sharpening the coarse LST with
    finer resolution optical data it is possible, to a certain degree, to separate
    the fluxes originating from within the flux tower footprint from the fluxes falling
    outside of it. Sharpened coarse-resolution modelled fluxes (configuration TSEB-DMSM)
    are also closer to the tower measurements compared to the original resolution
    coarse fluxes but the improvements are not as large as when sharpened model inputs
    are used. The ground heat flux modelled at high spatial resolution has lower correlation
    compared to the low resolution G, regardless of the model configuration used.
    This might indicate inaccurate estimation of net radiation of the soil at higher
    spatial resolution but due to the small magnitude of G it should not significantly
    impact the other fluxes. It is also worth noting that at the VOU site there is
    an increase in modelled H error when switching from Landsat LST to sharpened LST,
    while there is a slight decrease in error when switching from tower-based meteorological
    inputs to ERA-Interim dataset. For example, the decrease in RMSE of H for the
    disTSEBM,DMS runs driven by the two types of meteorological inputs is 3 W/m2(correlation
    decreases from 0.76 to 0.73) while the increase in RMSE between disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS
    is 15 to 18 W/m2(correlation decreases by 0.16). In case of latent heat flux the
    situation is somewhat different, with RMSE increasing by 16 W/m2 and correlation
    decreasing by 0.14 when tower-based data is replaced by ERA-Interim for the disTSEBL
    run, while the RMSE of LE increases by 2 W/m2 between the disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS
    runs when using tower-based dataset and decreases by 3 W/m2 when using ERA-Interim
    datasets. 4.2. Gludset plantation forest The statistical evaluation of modelled
    fluxes at the GLU site is shown in Table 4 and Fig. 4 for runs in which tower-based

    2.4. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the
    reader is referred to the web version of this article.) At the GLU site there
    is a strong and consistent underestimation of Rn (bias ranging from −24 W/m2 to
    −51 W/m2) despite very strong correlation (r always above 0.97) for all model
    runs. Based on this high correlation, the underestimation can probably be attributed
    to consistent overestimation in the parameterization of reflectance (albedo) and/or
    transmittance of the short-wave radiation by canopy or soil. This bias seems to
    mostly transfer to the estimates of H in case of tower-based meteorological inputs
    and estimates of LE in case of ERA-Interim inputs. In addition the estimation
    of G has very low correlation, but due to low G values under the forest canopy
    that should not have a significant impact on the accuracy of other modelled fluxes.
    At the forest site, the RMSE of H and LE from the TSEBM run is lower than that
    of disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS runs with both types of meteorological inputs, with
    the exception of high-resolution H estimated with ERA-Interim dataset which has
    lower error than the low-resolution H. This could be because the forest site is
    homogeneous at low spatial resolution while becoming heterogeneous at higher resolutions,
    which is directly opposite of the agricultural site. In addition, forest canopy
    is more complex than that of crops, with possibility of within-canopy heat storage
    or different wind attenuation compared to a vertically homogeneous canopy (Massman
    et al., 2017). Those factors could be more influential when modelled at higher
    spatial resolutions. This, together with large shifts in bias between H and LE
    when using the two types of meteorological inputs, make it hard to come to any
    firm conclusions with respect to the applicability of the sharpened LST in forested
    land covers. However, similarly to the situation at VOU, disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS
    provide the most accurate high-resolution flux estimates. 4.3. Spatial pattern
    comparison In the above sections the fluxes modelled by different configurations
    of model inputs and approaches were evaluated against measurements from two flux
    towers. Even though tower footprints were taken into account, those evaluations
    can be essentially considered to be performed at a single point. However, it is
    also important to evaluate how similar or different are the fluxes produced by
    the different model runs in a spatial context. In particular, we focus on fluxes
    produced by the disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS model runs driven by tower-based meteorological
    observations (see Table 2 and Fig. 2) in the area surrounding the VOU flux tower.
    Since disTSEBL uses LST derived from actual thermal observation it is considered
    as the reference dataset. disTSEBL models fluxes at the time of Landsat overpass
    while disTSEBM,DMS at the time of MODIS overpass and therefore a direct comparison
    of the fluxes is not possible. Instead evaporative fraction is used, under the
    assumption that it remains constant during the morning hours in cloud free conditions.
    Fig. 6 shows a visual comparison of EF on three selected dates, while Fig. 7 shows
    the scatterplot of disTSEBL versus disTSEBM,DMS EF on the same dates but only
    from pixels which were classified as belonging to cropland land cover class. The
    three dates were chosen such that on the first date (beginning of the growing
    season) the EF at VOU is high, in the second it is intermediate and in the third
    it is low (end of the growing season). Fig. 6 shows that in general the EF modelled
    with sharpened LST is able to capture the spatial patterns of the reference dataset,
    although with somewhat reduced range. This reduced range is evident at the beginning
    of the season (Figs. 6 top row and 7a) when the contrast of reflectance between
    the different fields is quite low due to limited amount of green crops present
    on the fields. In that case the higher values of LST (lower EF) are not well captured
    by the LST sharpening process. Similarly, in the middle of the season (Figs. 6
    middle row and 7b), the contrast of reflectance between the different fields is
    also low (due to most fields being covered with green crops) and high EF values
    are not well represented. On the other hand, when the contrast in the reflectance
    between the fields is high (Figs. 6 bottom row and 7c) the variability of EF is
    very well captured by the sharpened LST. Therefore, one possible limitation of
    the sharpening method is that it might require contrasting surfaces at different
    vegetation densities. Download : Download high-res image (870KB) Download : Download

    with disaggregation (x-axis, disTSEBL) was plotted against EF modelled using sharpened
    MODIS LST and TSEB with disaggregation (y-axis, disTSEBM,DMS). The plot includes
    all pixels from the area shown in Fig. 6 which fall into cropland landcover class.
    Another contributing factor could be that the first two scenes were acquired by
    Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor on Landsat 5, while the last scene was acquired by
    Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on Landsat 7. This has two consequences:
    firstly ETM+ has increased radiometric sensitivity, accuracy and dynamic range
    over TM (Barsi et al., 2007); and secondly due to orbit of Landsat 5 only two
    thirds of the catchment area shown in Fig. 1 are captured during an overpass which
    leads to less training points for the DMS. Both of those issues should be resolved
    when using Sentinel-2 optical observations to sharpen Sentinel-3 TIR data, hopefully
    leading to wider range of modelled ET: firstly Sentinel-2 optical sensor has 12
    bit radiometric resolution (compared to 8 bit resolution for Landsat 5 and Landsat
    7) and low radiometric noise; and secondly Sentinel-2 has wider swath width than
    Landsat satellites (Kääb et al., 2016). One other difference observable between
    the EF derived by disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS is the sharpness of the latter (Fig.
    6). This is due to the Landsat LST being resampled to 30 m from the acquisition
    resolution of between 60 m and 120 m (depending on the Landsat satellite), while
    the MODIS LST is sharpened using the Landsat reflectance observations which are
    acquired at 30 m resolution. When sharpening Sentinel-3 TIR data with Sentinel-2
    optical data an even sharper (20 m resolution) image should be obtained. 4.4.
    Temporal pattern comparison One of the main reasons for obtaining high-resolution
    estimates of land surface energy fluxes is to be able to follow the temporal evolution
    of agricultural water use and plant water stress at field scale. Therefore, it
    is important to evaluate how accurately the fluxes estimated with sharpened LST
    can follow that temporal evolution. Similarly to Section 4.3 we use EF for this
    evaluation and consider the fluxes derived with Landsat LST as the reference dataset.
    For both types of LST inputs the TSEB model was driven by tower-based meteorological
    observations and the disaggregation approach was used. Fig. 8 shows the temporal
    evolution of EF for two agricultural fields throughout the study period. The relative
    location and size of the two fields (labelled (a) and (b)) are shown in the left
    panel of Fig. 9. It can be seen that both fields are much smaller than the spatial
    resolution of MODIS and SLSTR thermal observations (around 1 km) and that the
    distance between them is on the order of one low-resolution LST pixel. It can
    also be seen in Fig. 9 that the two fields do not always follow the same cultivation
    calendar. Despite this, EF modelled with sharpened LST is able to follow quite
    closely the temporal pattern of the reference EF, with r of 0.87 and Root Mean
    Square Difference (RMSD) of 0.08 for field (a) and r of 0.83 and RMSD of 0.09

    of the sharpened LST approach become evident. Fig. 9 shows that while in the 2013

    visible only in the image from 21.07.2013), field (b) was sown with winter crop
    the previous season and so was covered with green vegetation from May through
    June and then being already harvested for the image on July. The EF shown on the
    right end of Fig. 8 reflects this temporal sequence in case of model runs using
    Landsat LST (disTSEBL - red crosses) but not necessarily when using sharpened
    LST (disTSEBM,DMS - green x’es). In field (a) disTSEBL EF starts around 0.6 at
    the beginning of May 2013 then drops to 0.4 and gradually increases to 0.5 as
    the vegetation grows, while in field (b) it remains around 0.6 throughout May
    and June 2013 as the green vegetation matures and drops to around 0.4 at the end
    of July when the field does not contain photosynthetic vegetation anymore. disTSEBM,DMS
    EF follows the reference EF quite closely in field (a), with the exception of
    the estimate at end of May 2013 when it is overestimated, but in field (b) drops
    to 0.4 at the end of May and remains constant during the following two modelled
    dates. Especially in field (b) the behaviour of disTSEBL EF appears more realistic,
    which might indicate that the sharpened LST is not able to fully capture the dynamics
    of this field. 4.5. Comparison of fluxes derived with sharpened Sentinel-3 LST
    and Landsat LST at regional scale The suitability of applying the proposed methodology
    for deriving high-resolution fluxes with Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 images was
    also evaluated. The scenes were acquired on the morning of 17th of May 2017 and
    cover an agricultural area in the Po Valley in northern Italy. A Landsat-8 (L8)
    image was acquired over the area on the same morning, allowing for comparison
    of high-resolution fluxes estimated using S3 LST sharpened with S2 optical data
    against fluxes estimated using L8 LST in a region of interest (ROI) of 83 km by
    40 km (Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (880KB) Download : Download

    Land surface energy fluxes were first derived at the Sentinel-3 resolution using
    the TSEB model and then at the Sentinel-2 resolution using the TSEB model and
    the disaggregation approach. The S3 LST was obtained following the split-window
    approach proposed by Sobrino et al. (2016b). For high-resolution application the
    LST was sharpened to 20 m using the DMS approach and all 12 S2 bands, atmospherically
    corrected using Sen2Cor tool (Louis et al., 2016) and (in case of bands with different
    spatial resolution) resampled to 20 m. LAI was retrieved from the atmospherically
    corrected Sentinel-2 reflectances using the biophysical processor available in
    the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software and resampled to S3 resolution
    for the low-resolution run. Due to the lack of established S2 or S3 albedo product
    or algorithm, the albedo data was taken from a MODIS MCD43A3 product and resampled
    for the S3 resolution run or sharpened with DMS for the S2 resolution run. The
    meteorological inputs were taken from the ECMWF analysis data which is included
    in the Sentinel-3 SLSTR data file, with the exception of incoming shortwave radiation
    which was estimated using the approach of Weiss and Norman (1985). The landcover-based
    parameters were set according to reclassified Corine map, as described in Section
    3.3. To derive the reference high-resolution fluxes the same inputs were used
    except DMS-sharpened S3 LST was replaced with L8 LST. Maps of latent heat flux
    derived using Sentinel-3 LST, DMS-sharpened Sentinel-3 LST and Landsat-8 LST of
    three zoomed-in subsets of the ROI are shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen that at
    the original S3 resolution it is not possible to distinguish fluxes coming from
    individual fields or natural landscape features (e.g. riparian zones). However,
    at the S2 resolution those features become quite apparent both when using sharpened
    S3 LST and L8 LST. The spatial patterns shown in the two high-resolution latent
    heat flux maps are quite similar, although the fluxes estimated using L8 LST show
    larger dynamic range. Download : Download high-res image (887KB) Download : Download

    evaporative fraction for all the agricultural pixels within the ROI (over 7 million
    points) are shown in Fig. 12. The plot and statistics for latent heat flux confirm
    the findings described above: the correlation between LE modelled with the two
    types of LST is high (0.89) and using DMS sharpened S3 LST leads to underestimation
    of high-value fluxes and overestimation of low-value fluxes. The correlation between
    the sensible heat fluxes is significantly lower (0.67) which leads to the correlation
    between EF estimates to lie between the two values (0.79). It is not immediately
    clear why the correlation of H is so much lower than that of the other fluxes
    (correlations of G and Rn are 0.99 and 0.90 respectively). However, the response
    of the TSEB model to the changes in input LST is non-linear and this contributes
    to the different correlations of the different fluxes. Download : Download high-res

    5. Discussion 5.1. Potential for applicability in operational setting High resolution
    estimates of evapotranspiration have many operational uses, in particular in the
    domains of agriculture and water resources management (Anderson et al., 2012).
    For example, they allow for field-scale water accounting or precision irrigation.
    In Section 4 we have shown that by using 1 km LST sharpened to 30 m it is possible
    to obtain instantaneous ET estimates at field scale with a relative RMSE of 15%
    (when using local meteorological observations) to 19% (when using reanalysis meteorological
    fields). The bias of the modelled ET is significantly smaller and those errors
    should reduce when instantaneous outputs are averaged to daily, weekly or monthly
    values. This level of accuracy is similar to what is achieved with field measurements
    and therefore the estimates can be considered as reliable for water accounting
    (Karimi et al., 2015). It was also demonstrated that fluxes derived using sharpened
    low-resolution (Terra or Sentinel-3) LST capture the spatial patterns of fluxes
    derived using high-resolution (Landsat) LST well but with a narrower dynamic range
    if the optimal conditions for sharpening are not met. The temporal patterns shown
    by the two types of modelled fluxes are also similar. This confirms the applicability
    of the proposed method to be used with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images to obtain
    high-resolution evapotranspiration estimates. At both sites the fluxes derived
    from sharpening the low-resolution estimates (TSEB-DMSM) were not as accurate
    as the fluxes derived with sharpened LST (disTSEBM,DMS), with the exception of
    LE at the agricultural site where the RMSE of the two runs was the same. This
    indicates that it is preferable to sharpen the low-resolution data (in case of
    this study LAI, LST and albedo) and use them as inputs to the TSEB model, rather
    than sharpening the TSEB model outputs using DMS to achieve higher spatial resolution
    flux estimates. In case of applications utilising S2 data, LAI (and possibly albedo)
    can be derived directly at fine resolution (see Section 4.5) thus improving the
    high-resolution model parametrization. Furthermore, sharpening the fluxes directly
    may cause a lack of energy closure at fine scale that needs to be taken into account.
    In the current study reanalysis meteorological dataset (ERA-Interim) was used.
    These data are usually released with up to 3 months delay, which is fine in case
    of end-of-season water accounting but not suitable for irrigation advice. In that
    case another meteorological dataset, e.g. ECMWF forecast products (Andersson,
    2015) would have to be used. This could have a significant impact on the modelled
    flux accuracy, especially if the forecast air temperature or wind speed are not
    well captured and this should be evaluated in future studies. In case of regional
    or local applications, it is possible to use near-real-time observations from
    ground stations and thus avoid this issue. 5.2. Limitations of the proposed approach
    The approach to sharpen low-resolution LST with high-resolution optical data is
    based on the assumption that there exists a statistical relation between the two
    dataset. The sharpening methodology used in this study (see Section 2.1) permits
    this relation to be non-linear and even very complex but it still must exist.
    While there is no general, globally transferable relation between TIR and optical
    data, it is possible to derive it when the two datasets are limited in space and
    time. This study shows that in such localised cases it is possible to use the
    sharpened LST to derive the land surface fluxes at high spatial resolution with
    acceptable accuracy. However, even then the range of high-resolution fluxes will
    not be as large as it would be if high-resolution LST observations were used,
    due to the aggregating effect present in the low-resolution observations. Another
    inherent limitation of estimating ET using DMS sharpened LST is the underlying
    assumption that the TIR and optical datasets contain the same or related information
    about the modelled physical phenomena. In practice they might contain complementary
    information. For example, crop water stress can be observed in the TIR domain
    some weeks before it becomes visible in the optical domain but both types of observations
    are required to map the water stress in different stages of the crop phenological
    cycle (Hoffmann et al., 2016a). On the other hand, Sentinel-2 bands in the shortwave
    infrared (SWIR) part of the electromagnetic spectrum do contain information about
    vegetation water content (Ceccato et al., 2001) and (under certain assumptions)
    about soil water content (Sadeghi et al., 2017). Therefore, more research is required
    to determine whether the DMS sharpened LST is suitable for applications such as
    early detection of vegetation water stress and precision irrigation, in which
    crops are subject to certain stress without provoking a decrease in yield/biomass.
    In other applications, such as in regional field-scale water use mapping (e.g.
    Senay et al. (2016)) the use of sharpened LST as input to ET models should produce
    acceptable results. The above mentioned limitations, together with results presented
    in Section 4, point to the need for direct high-resolution TIR observations to
    complement the existing capabilities of the Sentinel satellite constellation.
    While the methodology proposed in this study is valuable for filling in the currently
    present data gap, it does so with a reduced accuracy compared to what would be
    possible with a high-resolution TIR sensor and might not be suitable for all TIR-based
    applications. Further research into different types of sharpening procedures and
    ET models will probably improve on the results presented in this study but it
    is highly unlikely that the need for high-resolution evapotranspiration estimations
    will ever be fully met without a dedicated high-resolution TIR sensor. 6. Conclusion
    The Sentinel constellation of satellites provides a suit of observational capabilities
    for operational use in agricultural applications. However, one currently missing
    feature is high-resolution TIR sensor which could be used to (among other applications)
    estimate evapotranspiration and water use at field scale. This study evaluates
    a method to fill this data gap by sharpening low-resolution TIR observations from
    Sentinel-3 satellites using high-resolution optical observations from Sentinel-2
    satellites. The evaluation is performed at two study sites, both located in a
    temperate climatic zone: an agricultural site with field sizes smaller than low-resolution
    pixel size and plantation forest site larger than low-resolution pixel size. Due
    to lack of long enough timeseries of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations and
    due to the need for high-resolution TIR data to use for benchmarking, the method
    was evaluated using MODIS and Landsat observations and later applied to Sentinel-3
    and Sentinel-2 images to confirm its applicability to this type of data. The results
    at the agricultural site indicate that although the fluxes derived using sharpened
    LST are not as accurate as those derived using high-resolution LST, they are still
    an improvement compared to low-resolution fluxes. For most accurate results the
    fluxes derived using sharpened LST should be refined with a disaggregation scheme
    which utilises low-resolution fluxes. Sharpening the low-resolution fluxes directly
    did not produce as good results. The fluxes derived with sharpened LST are able
    to satisfactorily capture the spatial patterns of different evapotranspiration
    rates of the different small-sized fields (although with reduced range), especially
    when high contrast is present within the scene. The temporal evolution of evaporative
    fraction throughout multiple growing seasons is also generally well represented
    when using sharpened LST even though certain critical events are missed. At the
    forest site the utility of sharpened LST is harder to evaluate due to the nature
    of the site (homogeneous at coarse scale but heterogeneous at fine scale) and
    the difficulties in modelling ET in forest ecosystems. Follow on studies are planned,
    which will utilise purely Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations and which will
    be conducted in irrigated croplands located in semi-arid and Mediterranean climates,
    where high LST contrast should be present at both low and high spatial resolutions
    and where water conservation issues are most critical. In addition, different
    LST sharpening techniques and ET modelling schemes will be tested. This study
    demonstrates that although modern data fusion techniques can be employed to partially
    compensate for the current lack of high-resolution TIR observations from Sentinel
    satellites, they cannot fully cover this data gap. Therefore, Sentinel constellation
    should be complemented with TIR observations at high spatial (and temporal) resolution
    to optimally exploit the existing capabilities in agricultural applications. Software

    \ is a crucial sector in Morocco, accounting for a \nsignificant portion of the\
    \ country's GDP and employing a large \npercentage of the population. However,\
    \ the sector faces several \nchallenges, including water scarcity, unpredictable\
    \ weather \npatterns, and a lack of access to information and resources [1]. \n\
    Recently, an increasing interest has been observed for \ndeveloping crop recommendation\
    \ systems to address these \nchallenges and improve agricultural productivity\
    \ in the country \n[2]. \nCrop recommendation systems use predictive techniques\
    \ to \nsuggest the most suitable crops for a given location and set of \nconditions.\
    \ These systems rely on data from various sources, \nsuch as satellite imagery,\
    \ weather forecasts, soil analyses, and \nhistorical crop yields, to make accurate\
    \ predictions [3]. By \nproviding farmers with personalized recommendations, crop\
    \ \nrecommendation systems can help them make informed \ndecisions about crop\
    \ selection and improve their yields and \nprofits [4]. \nThe objective of this\
    \ paper is to present a predictive \napproach to improving agricultural productivity\
    \ in Morocco \nthrough crop recommendations. Specifically, we will develop a \n\
    crop \nrecommendation \nsystem \nthat \nutilizes \nprediction \ntechniques to\
    \ suggest the most suitable crops for a given \nlocation and set of conditions.\
    \ \nIn order to achieve this objective, we will initially examine \nthe current\
    \ body of literature related to crop recommendation \nsystems as well as the difficulties\
    \ encountered by the \nagricultural sector in Morocco. After this, we will outline\
    \ the \napproach we employed to construct our system, which \nincluding the dataset,\
    \ prediction techniques, and evaluation \nmetrics. Following this, we will detail\
    \ the outcomes of our \nstudy, including the precision of our forecasts and the\
    \ efficacy \nof our crop recommendation system. Lastly, we will analyze \nthe\
    \ implications of our research on enhancing agricultural \nproductivity in Morocco\
    \ and suggest potential avenues for \nfuture research. \nThe structure of the\
    \ paper is as follows. Firstly, an \nintroduction is provided, followed by a succinct\
    \ AI in precision \nagriculture summary, focusing primarily on Machine Learning\
    \ \n(ML) as a component of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The paper \nalso includes\
    \ a concise literature review that highlights recent \ndevelopments in the field.\
    \ The research methodology is then \npresented, which involves an experimental\
    \ evaluation of our \nresearch using various ML algorithms such as Decision Tree,\
    \ \nNaïve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and \nSupport Vector Machine.\
    \ A discussion comes after this section. \nFinally, the key findings of the study\
    \ are summed up as a \nconclusion of this paper. \nII. \nPRECISION FARMING OVERVIEW\
    \ \nPrecision farming is an agricultural management approach \nthat uses technology\
    \ to optimize crop yields and reduce waste. \nIts objective is to provide farmers\
    \ with real-time data and \ninformation on their farms and livestock, in order\
    \ to take \naccurate actions that can result in maximized crop yields and \nlimited\
    \ losses. \nAI helps in analyzing data from various sources and \nmaking informed\
    \ decisions about crop management [5]. ML, a \nsubfield of AI, has proven to be\
    \ particularly useful in precision \nfarming due to its ability to automatically\
    \ learn patterns from \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 14, No. 3, 2023 \n200 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \nlarge datasets and make predictions based on those patterns [6]. \nFig. 1\
    \ presents the key component of precision farming. \nPrecision farming involves\
    \ the use of a range of IoT \nsensors that gather various indicators associated\
    \ with farming \n[7]. These indicators can include various environmental \nparameters\
    \ such as soil moisture, nutrient levels, pH, \ntemperature, humidity, light,\
    \ and weather conditions. Other \nindicators may also relate to livestock, such\
    \ as veterinary well-\nbeing, feed intake, and weight gain. These indicators can\
    \ be \nused to optimize various aspects of crop and livestock \nmanagement, \n\
    including \nirrigation, \nfertilization, \ndisease \nprevention, and pest control\
    \ [8]. \nThe data collected by these sensors is transmitted to the \ntechnical\
    \ staff. Various data analytic methods are then applied \nto interpret and derive\
    \ useful insights from the collected data. \nThe resulting information is exploited\
    \ to take accurate and \ntimely actions. To provide a better understanding, Fig.\
    \ 2 \nillustrates the various stages involved, including the automated \ncollection\
    \ of data and the processing operations by agribots \naccording to the insights\
    \ derived from the processed data. \nOne area where ML has been applied in precision\
    \ farming \nis crop yield prediction. ML algorithms can analyze data from \nsensors,\
    \ such as satellite imagery, weather stations, and soil \nsensors, to make accurate\
    \ predictions about crop yields [9]. For \nexample, a study [10] used ML to predict\
    \ winter wheat yields \nin China based on satellite imagery and weather data.\
    \  \nAnother application of ML in precision farming is crop \ndisease detection.\
    \ By analyzing images of crops, ML \nalgorithms can identify signs of disease\
    \ or stress and alert \nfarmers to take action [11]. For example, a study [12]\
    \ used ML \nto identify cassava disease in Tanzania based on images \ncaptured\
    \ by drones. The authors found that their ML model \nwas able to accurately identify\
    \ diseased plants, even in cases \nwhere the symptoms were not visible to the\
    \ human eye. \n \nFig. 1. Core components of precision agriculture. \n \nFig.\
    \ 2. Overview of the general process involved in precision agriculture. \nML can\
    \ also be used to optimize crop management \ndecisions, such as irrigation and\
    \ fertilization. By analyzing data \non soil moisture, nutrient levels, and weather\
    \ patterns, ML \nalgorithms can suggest the optimal amount of water to apply to\
    \ \na crop [13]. For example, a study by [14] demonstrates that the \nintegration\
    \ of active canopy sensing and machine learning \nimproves the prediction accuracy\
    \ of the corn nitrogen nutrition \nindex by accounting for genetic, environmental,\
    \ and \nmanagement factors. \nIn conclusion, ML has significant potential in precision\
    \ \nfarming due to its ability to analyze large datasets and make \naccurate predictions.\
    \ By applying ML to tasks such as crop \nyield prediction, disease detection,\
    \ and crop management \noptimization, farmers can improve their yields and reduce\
    \ \nwaste. \nIII. \nLITERATURE REVIEW \nNowadays, as ML has been increasingly\
    \ employed in \nprecision agriculture, numerous studies have been conducted \n\
    across various areas of farming. Therefore, to provide a clearer \npicture and\
    \ distinguish this work from others, we present a \nsummary of recent research\

    \ for real solutions that \ncan be implemented in the field at low cost and can\
    \ help \nfarmers and decision-makers optimize their resources and \nmaximize profits.\
    \ \nIt is interesting to note that few studies have focused on this \nissue in\
    \ recent years, with most studies providing only \ntheoretical overviews and practical\
    \ implementations. The \nchallenge is to find a way to make these solutions available\
    \ for \nall, and make them more visible to a larger audience, such as \nfarmers.\
    \ Our study provides a step-by-step explanation of how \nto address these problems\
    \ and offers examples of how to make \nthese technologies available for free.\
    \ \nIV. \nMETHODS AND RESULTS \nA. System Conception \nTo design our crop recommendation\
    \ system, we initiated \nthe first step by preparing a crop recommendation dataset.\
    \ We \nused Moroccan climate, fertilizer and precipitations data [30] \nthen preprocessed\
    \ it in order to make extensive explorations. \nWe worked with a dataset consisting\
    \ of 1800 entries and eight \nvariables. Next, we conducted an exploration of\
    \ the data to \nunderstand its nature. Finally, we used ML techniques counting\
    \ \nNB, DT, RF, SVM, and LR to extract the best features and \nbuild our ML models.\
    \ \nFig. 3 provides a detailed illustration of the steps taken in \ndesigning\
    \ \nthe \narchitecture \nand \ndeveloping \nthe \ncrop \nrecommendation system.\
    \ \nAfter completing the models building step, we proceeded to \nevaluate their\
    \ performance. Once the evaluation was complete, \nwe then moved on to deploy\
    \ the model with highest \nperformance as a web application, which forms a basis\
    \ of our \ncrop recommendation system. \nAfter completing the evaluation, the\
    \ next step was to \ndeploy the best selected model as a web application, which\
    \ \nserves as the foundation for our crop recommendation system. \n \n(a) Steps\
    \ of predictive model. \n \n(b) Steps of recommendation system building. \nFig.\
    \ 3. Design process of the crop recommendation system. \nB. Dataset Preparation\
    \ and Feature Selection \nThe crop recommendation dataset we selected comprised\
    \ \nseveral features, including content in soil of Phosphorus (P), \nPotassium\
    \ (K) and Nitrogen (N), as well as soil pH value and \nmoisture, precipitations,\
    \ temperature and plant variety. The \ndata collection consisted of 1800 entries,\
    \ and an overview of \nthe dataset statistics is presented in Table II. \nIn terms\
    \ of the relationship between the input parameters \nand target, we observed that\
    \ certain parameters, such as \nPotassium, phosphorus and Nitrogen exhibit strong\
    \ correlations \nof 0.6. This is a promising sign prior to the commencement of\
    \ \nthe prediction. There were also some phew negative correlation \nvalues between\
    \ the indicators. This shows that the dataset is \nrich in information. \nFrom\
    \ a biological perspective, the P K N levels play a vital \nrole as important\
    \ macro-nutrients that support plant growth. \nPotassium, is responsible for the\
    \ plant’s natural functioning, \nwhile phosphorus aids in the maturation of fruits.\
    \ Nitrogen \ncontributes mainly to the growth of leaves. \nFertilizer containing\
    \ elements such as P K N and can be \ntailored to different crops based on their\
    \ concentrations. These \nnutrients are essential for the growth and productivity\
    \ of crops, \nand using fertilizer can make up for any deficiencies in the soil.\
    \ \nBy understanding the PKN ratios required for optimal plant \ndevelopment,\
    \ farmers can manage fertilization and achieve \nbetter yields [31]. \nOther parameters\
    \ in our data, including temperature, soil \nmoisture and pH, and precipitations\
    \ play important roles in \ncrop selection. The pH value affects the existence\
    \ of vital \nsubstances, while precipitations level is crucial in plant \nsurvival.\
    \ Air temperature impacts photosynthesis, and soil \nmoisture is essential for\
    \ growth, but too much or too little can \nbe detrimental. Our dataset includes\
    \ several crop categories, \nsuch as apples, dates, corn, grape, pepper, orange,\
    \ peach, \npotatoes, onions, tomatoes, olives, and watermelon, that can be \n\
    predicted based on these features. The prediction of these crops \nyields is dependent\
    \ on the parameters mentioned. \n \n \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\

    \ we utilized the \nPython programming language. The data preprocessing stage\
    \ \ninvolved importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy, \nPandas, Scikit-learn,\
    \ and Matplotlib. \nTo train and test the models, we split the dataset into \n\
    training and testing datasets, with a ratio of 70:30. We then \nemployed five\
    \ ML models (DT, NB, LR, RF, and SVM). \nTo evaluate the accuracy of the models,\
    \ we used precision, \nrecall, F1 and accuracy metrics, which were calculated\
    \ using \nthe following formulas: \n           \n  \n      \n \n(1) \n       \
    \ \n  \n       \n \n(2) \n          \n     \n            \n(3) \n            \
    \  \n                \n                 (4) \nWhere    (true positive) is the\
    \ number of correctly \npredicted positive values,    (false positive) is the\
    \ number of \nfalsely predicted positive values,    (true negative) is the \n\
    number of correctly predicted negative values, and    (false \nnegative) is the\
    \ number of falsely predicted negative values. \nAdditionally, we used k-fold\
    \ cross-validation scores to \nevaluate the effectiveness of the different algorithms\
    \ used in \nthe predictive analysis, which provided a more robust \nassessment\
    \ of the models' performance [32]. \nThese scores helped us evaluate the effectiveness\
    \ of the \ndifferent algorithms used in the predictive analysis. \nV. \nRESULTS\
    \ AND DISCUSSION \nA. Results of Prediction \nThis section presents a discussion\
    \ of the experimental \nresults obtained for the performance of the ML algorithms\
    \ used \nin our study. Table III provides a detailed summary of the \nprecision,\
    \ recall, accuracy, and k-fold cross-validation score \nresults. \nBased on our\
    \ results, the ML algorithms employed in our \nstudy exhibit varying levels of\
    \ predictive capabilities in \ndetermining profitable crop based on inputs. Our\
    \ analysis \nshows that RF has the highest performance in terms of \naccuracy,\
    \ with a score of 97.18%. In comparison, other \nalgorithms such as NB (96.36%),\
    \ LR (95.62%), SVM \n(87.38%), and DT (86.64%) have lower accuracy scores. \n\
    Fig. 4 illustrates a comparison of the accuracy for all ML \nmodels adopted in\
    \ our analysis. \nThe precision value assesses the ratio of accurate positive\
    \ \nlabel predictions, indicates that NB and RF exhibit excellent \nperformance.\
    \ Conversely, DT has the lowest performance in \nthis category. Regarding recall\
    \ value, which assesses the ability \nof the ML models to correctly predict actual\
    \ positives, RF once \nagain outperforms the other models, while SVM and DT have\
    \ \nthe lowest scores. \nRegarding the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of\
    \ \nprecision and recall, RF attains the highest score of 97%, \nfollowed by NB\
    \ at 96%, LR at 96%, SVM at 87%, and DT at \n83%. \nTo estimate the overall performance\
    \ of the models, we used \nK-fold cross-validation with a value of K=10. The results\
    \ \nindicate that RF has the highest 10-fold cross-validation vale, \nwhile DT\
    \ has the lowest performance. Although accuracy \nalone is not a reliable performance\
    \ metric, considering other \nevaluation measures, it is apparent that RF surpasses\
    \ the used \nML techniques in forecasting the most appropriate crop. \nTABLE III.\

    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nB. Crop Recommendation Solution \nIn our opinion, the\
    \ market for precision agriculture \nsolutions that are available at no cost and\
    \ released under an \nopen-source license is continuing to evolve, and considerable\
    \ \nprogress is needed for these solutions to compete with closed-\nsource solutions.\
    \ However, the involvement of a network of IT \nspecialists and interested parties,\
    \ including farmers, has aided \nexpansion of open-source alternatives. These\
    \ communities can \naddress any issues or doubts related to technology integration\
    \ \nwith ease [33-35]. Bearing this in mind, our main objective \nwas to propose\
    \ and design a crop recommendation system. \nRelying on the performance metrics\
    \ mentioned earlier, RF \ndemonstrated superior performance in comparison to the\
    \ other \nML models we used. Therefore, we plan to employ RF to \npredict the\
    \ optimal crop based on the user's input parameters, \nsuch as P K N, soil moisture\
    \ and pH, temperature, and \nprecipitations. After selecting the best-performing\
    \ model, we \nserialized/saved it Python’s built-in persistence model, namely\
    \ \npickle, for developing of the crop recommendation system. The \nvarious steps\
    \ involved in designing and deploying the crop \nrecommendation system are outlined\
    \ in Fig. 5. \n \nFig. 5. Stages included in creating and launching the crop suggestion\
    \ \nplatform. \nTo create the system, we utilized Flask as a Python micro \nframework\
    \ used in applications development, which enables \nprogrammers to conveniently\
    \ build Application Programming \nInterfaces (APIs) in Python language. To create\
    \ interactive web \npages for users, we used HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)\
    \ \nand designed them using CSS. After that, we implemented the \nplatform Flask\
    \ micro web framework. Fig. 6 depicts the fully \nfunctional recommendation platform\
    \ hosted locally. \nThe working system along with the development \nenvironment\
    \ are available on an uploaded directory online \n[36]. It consists of all code\
    \ files used for the training and \nprediction, as well as the app code of the\
    \ recommendation \nsystem and the frontend source code. \nIn Fig. 6(a), the collected\
    \ field data is entered manually at \nthe Front end. \nIn Fig. 6(b), the Result\
    \ is displayed after processing the \ngiven data through the trained M.L Model.\
    \ \n \n(a) Implemented crop recommendation system. \n \n(b) Implemented crop recommendation\
    \ system. \nFig. 6. Implemented crop recommendation system. \nVI. \nDISCUSSION\
    \ \nAfter evaluating the performance results of the ML model \ntraining, we found\
    \ that RF has the best performance among all \nthe models. Despite the small training\
    \ dataset of only 1800 \nentries, RF still outperforms other models in terms of\
    \ recall, \nprecision, and other performance criteria, apart from accuracy. \n\
    Therefore, we chose RF as the ML technique to use in building \nthe recommendation\
    \ system. \nOnce the required inputs are submitted, the platform \nverifies for\
    \ missing values and if the entries fall within \nacceptable thresholds before\
    \ proceeding. The system then \npredicts the most appropriate crop to plant based\
    \ on the input \nparameters. This enables farmers to make informed decisions \n\
    for higher returns on investment and reduced wastage. This \nenables farmers to\
    \ opt for knowledgeable choices that lead to \nincreased profits and reduced waste.\
    \ \nDuring the development of our crop recommendation \nsystem, we postulated\
    \ that users would utilize pre-existing \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 14, No. 3, 2023 \n204 | P a g e  \n\
    www.ijacsa.thesai.org \nmeteorological data and the abundant IoT farming tools\
    \ that \nare already deployed to obtain necessary information for \nsubmitting\
    \ parameters to our platform. Since our platform is \nweb-based, it is accessible\
    \ from anywhere and from any \ndevice, providing a high level of convenience for\
    \ the users. \nHowever, we acknowledge that the dataset we used for \ndeveloping\
    \ the system is constituted of Moroccan data, and \ncrop growth can vary based\
    \ on the context and circumstances \nof different territories. To provide our\
    \ system to farmers \nglobally, more data from various geographic locations may\
    \ be \nrequired. As our system continues to develop, it can have the \ncapability\
    \ to compile information from various geographical \nterritories, allowing users\
    \ to enter their position along with the \nrelevant data to predict suitable crops\
    \ for planting. This paper \ndisplays the potential of using ML to design smart\
    \ techniques \nat the service of agriculture, and it may set the stage for \n\
    emerging \nstudies to develop predictive platforms \nin \nconjunction with robotic\
    \ technology. \nInvesting in farming is critical for any economy, and \nselecting\
    \ profitable crops is an important task that can \nguarantee the best production.\
    \ Our proposed solution aims to \nhelp farmers select the best crop for their\
    \ land and \nenvironmental context. With further improvements, like \nintegrating\
    \ IoT in automated data collection and using more \nparameters and key indicators\
    \ from different locations, we can \noffer this technology to more farmers, especially\
    \ those who \nwant to implement technology-driven precision farming. \nWhile many\
    \ organizations and startups are designing \nprecision farming solutions, most\
    \ of them are subscription-\nbased with high prices, free and open-source alternatives\
    \ can \nbe accessible for farmers to. It is crucial for farmers to be \nknowledgeable\
    \ about these alternatives that can enable them to \nutilize technology at no\
    \ cost, instead of making significant \nupfront investments. \nVII. CONCLUSION\
    \ AND PERSPECTIVES \nAgriculture is a vital industry that feeds billions of people\
    \ \nworldwide, and the use of technology has transformed \ntraditional farming\
    \ practices, resulting in improved yields and a \nhigher quality harvest while\
    \ reducing manual labor. Precision \nfarming, powered by AI, is becoming increasingly\
    \ popular due \nto its ability to collect field data and to assist farmers in\
    \ taking \ninformed actions to manage their cultivated lands. \nThis study presents\
    \ a web-based ML-driven crop \nrecommendation system to assist users choose the\
    \ most \nsuitable crops to plant based on local environmental conditions. \nAlthough\
    \ there are many commercial solutions available, \nalternatives also exist at\
    \ freely and at no coast. \nThe study demonstrates the combination of ML and \n\
    precision agriculture and outlines the architecture of a web-\nbased platform.\
    \ The platform could be improved by adding \nreal-time monitoring capabilities\
    \ by interfacing with existing \ndata aggregation platforms from sensors and IoT.\
    \ This would \nresult in a more accurate and suitable prediction framework, \n\
    making precision farming more accessible to farmers \nworldwide, ultimately helping\
    \ to address the challenges of \nfeeding the global population. \nREFERENCES \n\

    \ advanced remote sensing systems, more accurate retrievals of crop water\nstatus\
    \ are being made at the individual crop level to aid in precision irrigation.\
    \ This paper summarises\nthe use of remote sensing for the estimation of water\
    \ status in horticultural crops. The remote\nmeasurements of the water potential,\
    \ soil moisture, evapotranspiration, canopy 3D structure, and\nvigour for water\
    \ status estimation are presented in this comprehensive review. These parameters\n\
    directly or indirectly provide estimates of crop water status, which is critically\
    \ important for irrigation\nmanagement in farms. The review is organised into\
    \ four main sections: (i) remote sensing platforms;\n(ii) the remote sensor suite;\
    \ (iii) techniques adopted for horticultural applications and indicators of\n\
    water status; and, (iv) case studies of the use of remote sensing in horticultural\
    \ crops. Finally, the\nauthors’ view is presented with regard to future prospects\
    \ and research gaps in the estimation of the\ncrop water status for precision\
    \ irrigation.\nKeywords: UAS; UAV; drone; unmanned; satellite; water stress; irrigation;\
    \ vegetation index\n1. Introduction\nUnderstanding the water status of crops is\
    \ important for optimal management and application\nof water to accommodate for\
    \ inter and intra-ﬁeld variability to achieve a speciﬁc target, such as\nmaximum\
    \ water use eﬃciency, yield, quality, or proﬁtability [1,2]. The importance of\
    \ optimal water\nmanagement in agriculture in semi-arid or arid regions has become\
    \ increasingly important in light\nof recent water scarcities through reduced\
    \ allocations, as well as increased demand due to greater\nareas under production\
    \ [3,4]. Climate change is expected to further intensify the situation due to\n\
    the increased frequency of heatwaves and drought episodes [5]. Climate change\
    \ coupled with the\nnecessity to increase food production due to an increase in\
    \ global population has placed pressure on\nhorticultural sector to improve eﬃciencies\
    \ in resources use, e.g., water, for sustainable farming [6–10].\nHorticultural\
    \ crops will have to produce more ‘crop-per-drop’ in the face of limited water\
    \ resources.\nInformed management of water resources whilst maintaining or increasing\
    \ crop quality and yield are\nthe primary goals of irrigation scheduling in horticulture.\
    \ These goals can be achieved by improving\nour understanding of the water status\
    \ of the crops at key phenological stages of development.\nTraditional decision-making\
    \ for irrigation of horticultural crops includes using information from\na combination\
    \ of sources such as historical regimes, soil moisture measurements, visual assessments\
    \ of\nsoil and/or crop, weather data including evapotranspiration (ET), and measurements\
    \ of crop water\nstatus using direct-, proximal- or remote-sensing techniques\
    \ [11–13]. Some growers undertake routine\nground-based measurements, e.g., pressure\
    \ chamber, for estimation of crop water status to make\ndecisions on irrigation\
    \ [14–16]. These ground-based measurements are robust; however, destructive,\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140; doi:10.3390/agronomy10010140\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n2 of 35\ncumbersome, and expensive to acquire a reasonable\
    \ amount of data [14,16–18]. Consequently, the\nmeasured leaf is assumed to represent\
    \ the average population of leaves of the individual crop, and\na few crops are\
    \ assumed to represent the average population of the entire irrigation block.\
    \ As a\nresult, over- or under-watering can occur, which can lower yield and fruit\
    \ quality [19–22]. This is\nespecially evident for non-homogenous blocks where\
    \ spatial variability of soil and water status is\nexpected [23–25].\nTo address\
    \ some of the limitations of ground-based measurements, remote measurement\ntechniques\
    \ were introduced with capabilities to measure at higher spatial resolution, larger\
    \ area, and\non a regular basis [26–29]. Remote sensing, in particular, unmanned\
    \ aircraft systems (UAS), presents a\nﬂexible platform to deploy on-demand sensors\
    \ as a tool to eﬃciently and non-destructively measure\ncrop water status [30].\
    \ Using thermal and spectral signatures, remote sensing techniques can be used\n\
    to characterise a crop’s water status. Knowledge of crop water status allows growers\
    \ to more eﬃciently\nschedule irrigation (i.e., when and how much water to apply).\
    \ In this regard, UAS platforms provide a\nconvenient methodology to monitor the\
    \ water status across a farm, both spatially and temporally at\nthe canopy level\
    \ [31–33]. The spectral, spatial, and temporal ﬂexibility oﬀered by UAS-based\
    \ remote\nsensing may in future assist growers in irrigation decision-making [34,35].\n\
    This review provides an overview of the application of remote sensing to understand\
    \ the\ncrop’s water status (e.g., leaf/stem water potential, leaf/canopy conductance),\
    \ soil moisture, ET, and\nphysiological attributes, all of which can contribute\
    \ to understanding the crop’s water status to\nimplement precision irrigation.\
    \ Although the key focus of this review is UAS-based remote sensing,\na comparison\
    \ has been undertaken with other remote sensing platforms, such as earth observation\n\
    satellites, which are being increasingly used to acquire similar information.\
    \ In the following sections,\nwe provide an overview of the most common remote\
    \ sensing platforms in horticulture, various sensors\nused for remote sensing,\
    \ and several predictive indices of crop water status. Two case studies of remote\n\
    sensing in horticultural crops, grapevine and almond, are then presented followed\
    \ by an overview of\nthe current research gaps and future prospects.\n2. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms\nGround-based direct or proximal sensors acquire instantaneous\
    \ water status measurement from\na spatial location. For decision-making purposes,\
    \ the data is generally collected from multiple\nlocations across a ﬁeld, which\
    \ allows geospatial interpolation, such as kriging, to be applied [36–38].\nThis\
    \ scale of data collection is, however, cumbersome, ineﬃcient, and error-prone,\
    \ especially for water\nstatus measurements of large areas [17]. Monitoring and\
    \ observing farms at a larger spatial scale\nprompted the launch of several earth\
    \ observation satellite systems that typically operate at an altitude\nof 180–2000\
    \ km [39]. Manned high-altitude aircraft (operating within few km) and, more recently,\
    \ UAS\n(operating under 120 m) ﬁlled the spatial gap between high-resolution ground\
    \ measurements and\nrelatively low-resolution satellite measurements [40,41].\
    \ In the context of water status estimation for\nhorticultural crops, all the\
    \ aforementioned remote sensing platforms are utilised depending on the\nuser\
    \ requirements [23,42,43]. Each remote sensing platform has its own advantage\
    \ and shortcomings.\nThe decision to obtain remote sensing crop water status data\
    \ from one or more of these platforms will\ndepend on the spatial and temporal\
    \ resolution desired. Satellite and manned aircraft can be useful\nfor regional-scale\
    \ characterisation, whereas UAS can be more useful to map the intra-ﬁeld variability.\n\
    Vehicle-based ground systems also possess similar measurement capabilities, like\
    \ remote sensing,\nhowever, at a smaller scale [44,45]. These systems can move\
    \ within the horticultural rows obtaining\nwater status measurements of adjacent\
    \ plants while the vehicle is moving, enabling them to cover a\nrelatively larger\
    \ area as compared to ground-based direct measurements [46–48].\n2.1. Satellite\
    \ Systems\nThe use of satellite systems for remote sensing started with the launch\
    \ of Landsat-1 in 1972 [39,49].\nThe subsequent launch of SPOT-1 in 1986 and Ikonos\
    \ in 1999 opened the era of commercial satellite\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n3 of\
    \ 35\nsystems that resulted in rapid improvement in imaging performance, including\
    \ spatial and spectral\nresolution [50]. Continued launch of satellites from the\
    \ same families, with newer sensor models\nand improved capability, resulted in\
    \ the formation of satellite constellations (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel,\nSPOT, RapidEye,\
    \ GeoEye/WorldView families). The satellite constellation substantially improved\
    \ the\nrevisit cycle of the satellite system [51]. Recently, the miniature form\
    \ of the satellite termed Nanosat or\nCubesat has been developed, which can be\
    \ deployed on the same orbit in a large number (20s–100s),\nenabling frequent\
    \ and high-resolution data acquisition (e.g., Dove satellite from Planet Labs)\
    \ [52].\nThe earth observation satellite system, such as Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS,\
    \ RapidEye, and GeoEye,\nhave been used to study horticultural crops (Table 1).\
    \ These satellite system oﬀer camera systems\nwith spectral bands readily available\
    \ in visible, near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and\nthermal infrared\
    \ (TIR). The measurement in these bands provides opportunities to study a crop’s\
    \ water\nstatus indirectly via, for example, calculation of the normalised diﬀerence\
    \ vegetation index (NDVI),\ncrop water stress index (CWSI), and ET [8–10] at the\
    \ ﬁeld- and regional-scales.\nTable 1. Some satellite systems that have been used\
    \ to study the water status of horticultural crops.\nSatellites\nBand Numbers:\

    \ of bands; V = visible, NIR = near infrared, SWIR = short-wave\ninfrared, TIR\
    \ = thermal infrared, Pan = panchromatic, C = coastal, Ci = cirrus, RE = red edge,\
    \ WV = water vapour.\nThe reﬂected/emitted electromagnetic energy from the crop\
    \ reaching the sensor is recorded at a\nspeciﬁc wavelength. The width of the observed\
    \ wavelength expressed in full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) is called spectral\
    \ resolution. The number of observed bands and the spectral resolution\nindicates\
    \ the ability of the satellite to resolve spectral features on the earth’s surface.\
    \ Commonly used\nearth observation satellite systems possess between four and\
    \ 15 bands with approximately 20–200 nm\nFWHM spectral resolution. The bands are\
    \ generally designated for the visible and NIR region with\nextended capabilities\
    \ in SWIR, TIR, as well as red edge region (Table 1). The most widely used band\n\
    combinations to study the water status of vegetation are the visible, NIR and\
    \ TIR bands [23,25,53,54].\nWith the plethora of satellite systems currently available,\
    \ user requirements on band combination\nmay be achieved by using multiple satellites.\
    \ However, acquiring an extra or a narrower band to the\nexisting capabilities\
    \ is not possible.\nThe ground distance covered per pixel of the satellite image\
    \ is called the spatial resolution,\nwhereby, a higher spatial resolution indicates\
    \ a smaller ground distance. Existing satellite systems,\ndue to their lower spatial\
    \ resolution and large coverage, are suited to study larger regions [55]. For\
    \ a\nsmaller observation area, such as a farm block, an irrigation zone, a single\
    \ row of the horticultural crop,\nor a single canopy, this spatial resolution\
    \ is considered sub-optimal. Often, a pixel of the satellite image\ncomprises\
    \ of multiple rows and multiple canopies of horticultural crops [42,56]. Thus,\
    \ the spectral\nresponse on a single pixel of the satellite image includes a mixed\
    \ spectral signal from the canopy,\ninter-row vegetation and/or bare soil. The\
    \ mixed-pixel is particularly unavoidable in horticultural\ncrops with large inter-row\
    \ surfaces, introducing errors in satellite-based estimations [42,56]. Improving\n\
    the spatial resolution from freely available Landsat/Sentinel satellites (spatial\
    \ resolution 10–15 m) to\nsuch as WorldView-3 (spatial resolution 0.3 m), does\
    \ not necessarily resolve single canopies of many\nhorticultural crops.\nCurrent\
    \ satellite systems generally oﬀer a temporal resolution of about 1–2 weeks this\
    \ resolution\ncorresponds to the satellite’s revisit interval (Table 1). For example,\
    \ freely available Landsat-8 and\nSentinel-2 oﬀer revisit cycles of 16 and 5 days,\
    \ respectively. Although the MODIS sensor on NASA’s\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n\
    4 of 35\nTerra and Aqua satellites oﬀer a greater temporal resolution (1–2 days),\
    \ its spatial resolution is relatively\ncoarse (250 m–1 km) to be valuable for\
    \ horticulture [25]. The revisit cycle of satellites does not alone\nrepresent\
    \ the timeframe on which the data can be interpreted. For instance, post-data\
    \ acquisition,\nthere are often delays in data transfer to the ground station,\
    \ handling, and delivery to the end user.\nThe end user then needs to process\
    \ the data before making an interpretation. Such processing can\nbe a combination\
    \ of atmospheric, radiometric, and geometric corrections, where applicable [57,58].\n\
    Furthermore, as the agricultural applications of the satellite imagery are illumination\
    \ sensitive and\nweather dependent, conditions have to be optimal on the satellite\
    \ revisit day to avoid data corruption\ndue to, for example, cloud cover [23,53].\
    \ Cloud corrupted data (~55% of the land area is covered by\ncloud at any one\
    \ time [59]) will require users to wait for the next revisit to attempt the data\
    \ acquisition.\nTime-series image fusion techniques, such as the spatial and temporal\
    \ adaptive reﬂectance fusion\nmodel, can improve the spatial and temporal resolution\
    \ of the satellite data [60,61]. These fusion\ntechniques blend the frequent (however\
    \ low-resolution) with higher-resolution (but infrequent) satellite\ndata [62,63].\
    \ The result combines the best aspects of multiple satellite systems to produce\
    \ frequent and\nhigher-resolution data, which can be useful for timely monitoring\
    \ of water status.\nThe clear advantage of the satellite system is the ability\
    \ to capture data at a large scale and at an\naﬀordable cost (e.g., the user can\
    \ download Landsat and Sentinel data for free). The compromise with\nthe satellite\
    \ data is in spatial resolution, as well as the relatively long revisit cycle\
    \ (in the order of days\nto weeks), making the data less than ideal for speciﬁc\
    \ applications, e.g., irrigation scheduling.\n2.2. Manned Aircraft System\nOperating\
    \ within few kilometres above ground level, manned aircraft have been used to\
    \ remotely\nacquire agricultural data at higher spatial detail (compared to the\
    \ satellites) and over a larger region\n(compared to UAS) [42,64]. Light ﬁxed-wing\
    \ aircraft and helicopters are the commonly used manned\naircraft employed in\
    \ agricultural remote sensing. The ﬁxed-wing aircraft generally ﬂies higher and\n\
    faster, enabling the coverage of a larger area, whereas the helicopters are traditionally\
    \ ﬂown lower\nand slower, enabling a spatially detailed observation. A signiﬁcant\
    \ advantage of the manned aircraft,\ncompared to UAS, lies in their ability to\
    \ carry heavier high-grade sensors, such as AVIRIS, HyPlant,\nHySpex SWIR-384,\
    \ Specim AisaFENIX, and Riegl LMS Q240i-60 [65–67]. The use of manned aircraft\
    \ is,\nhowever, limited by high operational complexity, safety regulations, scheduling\
    \ inﬂexibility, costs, and\nproduct turnaround time. As a result, these platforms\
    \ are barely used as compared to the recent surge\nin the use of UAS, speciﬁcally\
    \ for horticultural crops [68–70].\nIn horticulture, manned aircraft was used\
    \ to characterise olive and peach canopy temperature\nand water stress using speciﬁc\
    \ thermal bands (10.069 µm and 12.347 µm) of a wideband (0.43–12.5 µm)\nairborne\
    \ hyperspectral camera system [71,72]. This work found moderate correlations (R2\
    \ = 0.45–0.57)\nof ground vs. aerial olive canopy temperature measurements [72],\
    \ and high correlations (R2 = 0.94)\nof canopy temperature vs. peach fruit size\
    \ (diameter) [71]. The advantage of manned aircraft for\nremote sensing of a large\
    \ region was highlighted in recent work that characterised regional-scale\ngrapevine\
    \ (Vitis vinifera L.) water stress responses of two cultivars, Shiraz and Cabernet\
    \ Sauvignon, in\nAustralia [64]. Airborne thermal imaging was able to discriminate\
    \ between the two cultivars based on\ntheir water status responses to soil moisture\
    \ availability (Figure 1).\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n5 of 35\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 140 \n5 of 35 \n \n \nFigure 1. Water status of Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon\
    \ under similar soil moisture as captured from \nmanned aircraft [64]. \n2.3.\
    \ Unmanned Aircraft Systems \nBoth the fixed-wing and the rotary-wing variant\
    \ of UASs are used in agricultural remote \nsensing. Each variant has its advantages\
    \ and shortcomings vis-à-vis sensor payload, flexibility, and \ncoverage. In this\
    \ regard, the literature provides a list of state-of-the-art UAS [73], their categorisation\
    \ \n[74], and overview of structural characteristics, as well as flight parameters\
    \ [75], in the context of \nagricultural use. Depending on the number of rotors,\
    \ a rotary-wing UAS can be a helicopter, a \nquadcopter, a hexacopter, or an octocopter,\
    \ among others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can \nfly with a higher degree\
    \ of freedom [76], while fixed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward at a \ncertain\
    \ speed to maintain thrust. As a result, rotary-wing UAS provides flexibility\
    \ and specific \ncapabilities, such as hovering, vertical take-off and landing,\
    \ vertical (up and down) motions, or return \nto the previous location. On the\
    \ contrary, fixed-wing UAS fly faster, carry heavier payloads, and have \ngreater\
    \ flying time enabling coverage of larger areas in a single flight [77]. Recently\
    \ developed fixed-\nwing UAS with vertical take-off and landing capabilities,\

    \ variant of UASs are used in agricultural remote sensing.\nEach variant has its\
    \ advantages and shortcomings vis-à-vis sensor payload, ﬂexibility, and coverage.\n\
    In this regard, the literature provides a list of state-of-the-art UAS [73], their\
    \ categorisation [74], and\noverview of structural characteristics, as well as\
    \ ﬂight parameters [75], in the context of agricultural use.\nDepending on the\
    \ number of rotors, a rotary-wing UAS can be a helicopter, a quadcopter, a hexacopter,\n\
    or an octocopter, among others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can ﬂy with\
    \ a higher degree of\nfreedom [76], while ﬁxed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward\
    \ at a certain speed to maintain thrust.\nAs a result, rotary-wing UAS provides\
    \ ﬂexibility and speciﬁc capabilities, such as hovering, vertical\ntake-oﬀ and\
    \ landing, vertical (up and down) motions, or return to the previous location.\
    \ On the contrary,\nﬁxed-wing UAS ﬂy faster, carry heavier payloads, and have\
    \ greater ﬂying time enabling coverage of\nlarger areas in a single ﬂight [77].\
    \ Recently developed ﬁxed-wing UAS with vertical take-oﬀ and landing\ncapabilities,\

    the pros of both ﬁxed-wing and rotary-wing, making them a promising platform for\

    Both the fixed-wing and the rotary-wing variant of UASs are used in agricultural\
    \ remote \nsensing. Each variant has its advantages and shortcomings vis-à-vis\
    \ sensor payload, flexibility, and \ncoverage. In this regard, the literature\

    \ overview of structural characteristics, as well as flight parameters [75], in\
    \ the context of \nagricultural use. Depending on the number of rotors, a rotary-wing\
    \ UAS can be a helicopter, a \nquadcopter, a hexacopter, or an octocopter, among\
    \ others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can \nfly with a higher degree of\
    \ freedom [76], while fixed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward at a \ncertain\
    \ speed to maintain thrust. As a result, rotary-wing UAS provides flexibility\
    \ and specific \ncapabilities, such as hovering, vertical take-off and landing,\
    \ vertical (up and down) motions, or return \nto the previous location. On the\
    \ contrary, fixed-wing UAS fly faster, carry heavier payloads, and have \ngreater\
    \ flying time enabling coverage of larger areas in a single flight [77]. Recently\
    \ developed fixed-\nwing UAS with vertical take-off and landing capabilities,\

    \ precipitation, high winds, and temperatures. By easily altering the flying \n\
    altitude, the UAS provides higher flexibility to observe a larger area with lower\
    \ spatial resolution or \nsmaller area with much greater detail [103]. Temporally,\
    \ the UAS can be scheduled at a user-defined \ntime at short notice, thus accommodating\
    \ applications that are time-sensitive, such as capturing vital \nphenological\

    \ sensors and \ninterchangeability between sensor payloads; thus, any desired\
    \ combination of sensors and spectral \nbands can be incorporated to target specific\
    \ features. \nUAS-acquired image data requires post-processing before it can be\
    \ incorporated into the grower \ndecision-making process. Mosaicking of UAS images\
    \ currently has a turnaround time of \napproximately one day to one week, subject\
    \ to the size of the dataset, computational power, and \nspectral/spatial quality\
    \ of the product [104,105]. Spectral quality of the data is of optimal importance,\
    \ \nwhereas the spatial quality can be of less importance, such as for well-established\
    \ horticultural crops. \nHigher spectral quality demands calibration of the spectral\
    \ sensors and correction of atmospheric \neffects. Following post-processing of\
    \ aerial images, the UAS-based spectral data have shown to be \nhighly correlated\
    \ with ground-based data [82,102,106]. \nThe most common UAS-based sensor types\
    \ to study the crop water status are the thermal, \nmultispectral and RGB, while\
    \ hyperspectral and LiDAR (Light detection and ranging) sensors are \nused less\
    \ often [23,79,107]. Spectral sensors provide the capability to capture broader\
    \ physiological \nproperties of the crop, such as greenness (related to leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content and health) and biomass, \nthat generally correlate with crop water\
    \ status [82,108]. Narrower band spectral sensors provide \ndirect insight into\
    \ specific biophysical and biochemical properties of crops, such as via photochemical\
    \ \nreflectance index (PRI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF),\
    \ which reflects a plant’s \nphotosynthetic efficiency [109,110]. Thermal-based\
    \ sensors capture the temperature of the crop’s \nsurface, which indicates the\

    \ and\ninterchangeability between sensor payloads; thus, any desired combination\

    UAS-acquired image data requires post-processing before it can be incorporated\
    \ into the grower\ndecision-making process. Mosaicking of UAS images currently\
    \ has a turnaround time of approximately\none day to one week, subject to the\
    \ size of the dataset, computational power, and spectral/spatial\nquality of the\
    \ product [104,105]. Spectral quality of the data is of optimal importance, whereas\
    \ the\nspatial quality can be of less importance, such as for well-established\
    \ horticultural crops. Higher\nspectral quality demands calibration of the spectral\
    \ sensors and correction of atmospheric eﬀects.\nFollowing post-processing of\
    \ aerial images, the UAS-based spectral data have shown to be highly\ncorrelated\
    \ with ground-based data [82,102,106].\nThe most common UAS-based sensor types\

    \ reﬂects a plant’s\nphotosynthetic eﬃciency [109,110]. Thermal-based sensors\
    \ capture the temperature of the crop’s\nsurface, which indicates the plant’s\

    \ can be used to quantify 3D metrics, such as the plant size and shape, via 3D\
    \ pointclouds\nwith suﬃcient accuracy for canopy level assessment [111–118].\n\
    3. Remote Sensor Types\n3.1. Digital Camera\nA digital camera typically incorporates\
    \ an RGB, modiﬁed RGB, and a monochrome digital camera.\nThe lens quality of the\
    \ camera determines the sharpness of the image, while the resolution of the\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n7 of 35\ncamera determines its spatial resolution and\
    \ details within an image. The RGB camera uses broad\nspectral bandwidth within\
    \ the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received at the\n\
    visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to retrieve\
    \ dimensional properties\nof the crop, terrain conﬁguration, macrostructure of\
    \ the ﬁeld, and the spatial information. Based on\nthe dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the resource need\n\
    practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\
    \ more quickly use available\nwater resources, resulting in crop water stress\
    \ at a later stage of the season if irrigation is not suﬃcient.\nThe evolution\
    \ of canopy structure within and between seasons can be useful to understand the\
    \ spatial\nvariability within the ﬁeld and corresponding water requirements. The\
    \ macro-structure of horticultural\ncrops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the fraction of ground cover, and missing\nplants, can be identiﬁed\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the allocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\n\
    conﬁguration in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM) generated from a digital\
    \ camera can also\nenable understanding of the water status in relation to the\
    \ aspect and slope conﬁguration of the terrain.\n3.2. Multispectral Camera\nA\
    \ multispectral camera oﬀers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum.\nMost common airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which include\
    \ rededge and NIR\nbands in addition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g., Figure\
    \ 3a,c). Conﬁgurable ﬁlter placement of\nthe spectral band is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops [102]. Spectrally, the airborne multispectral camera has been reported\
    \ to perform\nwith consistency, producing reliable measurements following radiometric\
    \ calibration and atmospheric\ncorrection [123–125].\nTheir spatial resolution\
    \ has been found to be suﬃcient for horticultural\napplications enabling canopy\
    \ level observation of the spectral response. For this reason, as well as\nrelatively\
    \ low cost, multispectral cameras are used more frequently in horticulture applications.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n7 of 35 \n \nof the camera determines its spatial resolution\
    \ and details within an image. The RGB camera uses \nbroad spectral bandwidth\
    \ within the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received \n\
    at the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to\
    \ retrieve dimensional \nproperties of the crop, terrain configuration, macrostructure\
    \ of the field, and the spatial information. \nBased on the dimensional properties,\
    \ such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the \nresource need\
    \ practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to\
    \ more \nquickly use available water resources, resulting in crop water stress\
    \ at a later stage of the season if \nirrigation is not sufficient. The evolution\
    \ of canopy structure within and between seasons can be \nuseful to understand\
    \ the spatial variability within the field and corresponding water requirements.\
    \ \nThe macro-structure of horticultural crops, such as row height, width, spacing,\
    \ crop count, the \nfraction of ground cover, and missing plants, can be identified\
    \ remotely, which can aid in the \nallocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain\
    \ configuration in the form of a digital elevation model \n(DEM) generated from\
    \ a digital camera can also enable understanding of the water status in relation\
    \ \nto the aspect and slope configuration of the terrain. \n3.2. Multispectral\
    \ Camera \nA multispectral camera offers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum. Most \ncommon airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which\
    \ include rededge and NIR bands in \naddition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g.,\
    \ Figure 3a,c). Configurable filter placement of the spectral \nband is also available,\
    \ which can potentially target certain physiological responses of horticultural\

    \ by vegetation spectral index called NDVI (Table 2, Equation (3)). Once the vegetation\n\
    starts to experience stress (biotic and abiotic), its reﬂectance in the NIR region\
    \ is reduced, while the\nreﬂectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress\
    \ is reﬂected in the vegetation proﬁle and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n8 of 35\n\
    easily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this reason, NDVI has shown correlations\
    \ with a wide\narray of crops response including vigour, chlorophyll content,\
    \ leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress,\nand occasionally yield [34,82–84,127].\n\
    The rededge band covers the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between the\
    \ red and NIR\nbands where reﬂectance increases drastically. Studies have suggested\
    \ that the sharp transition between\nthe red absorbance and NIR reﬂection is able\
    \ to provide additional information about vegetation and\nits hydric characteristics\
    \ [128]. Using the normalised diﬀerence red edge (NDRE) index, the rededge\nband\
    \ was found to be useful in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration\
    \ map [127]. Given the\nsensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications,\
    \ such as crops drought stress [107]. With regard to\nthe water use eﬃciency,\
    \ a combination of vegetation indices (VIs) along with structural physiological\n\
    indices were found to be useful to study water stress in horticultural crops [34,82,129].\n\
    3.3. Hyperspectral\nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled\
    \ at a narrower wavelength intervals\nspanning from visible to NIR spectrum at\
    \ a high to ultra-high spectral resolution (Figure 3d). Scanning\nat contiguous\
    \ narrow-band wavelengths, a hyperspectral sensor produces a three dimensional\
    \ (two\nspatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral\
    \ data cube. The hyperspectral\ndata cube is a hyperspectral image where each\
    \ pixel contain spatial information, as well as the entire\nspectral reﬂectance\
    \ curve [130]. Based on the operating principle and output data cube, hyperspectral\n\
    sensors for remote sensing can include a point spectrometer (aka spectroradiometer),\
    \ whiskbroom\nscanner, pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131].\
    \ A point spectrometer, samples\nwithin its ﬁeld of view solid angle to produce\
    \ an ultra-high spectral resolution spectral data of a\npoint [130,132]. A whiskbroom\
    \ scanner deploys a single detector onboard to scan one single pixel at a\ntime.\
    \ As the scanner rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of the data\
    \ cube, and as the\nplatform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a\
    \ hyperspectral image [133]. A pushbroom\nscanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous\
    \ detectors arranged in the perpendicular direction of\ntravel and scans the entire\
    \ row of pixels at a time. As the platform moves forward, the successive\nrows\
    \ form a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager using diﬀerent\
    \ scanning\ntechniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ [135,136]. The point spectrometer\noﬀers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible\nhyperspectral sensors\
    \ [137,138].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n8 of 35 \n \nstarts to experience stress\
    \ (biotic and abiotic), its reflectance in the NIR region is reduced, while the\
    \ \nreflectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress is reflected in\
    \ the vegetation profile and \neasily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this\
    \ reason, NDVI has shown correlations with a wide \narray of crops response including\
    \ vigour, chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress, \nand\
    \ occasionally yield [34,82–84,127]. \nThe rededge band covers the portion of\
    \ the electromagnetic spectrum between the red and NIR \nbands where reflectance\
    \ increases drastically. Studies have suggested that the sharp transition \nbetween\
    \ the red absorbance and NIR reflection is able to provide additional information\
    \ about \nvegetation and its hydric characteristics [128]. Using the normalised\
    \ difference red edge (NDRE) \nindex, the rededge band was found to be useful\
    \ in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration \nmap [127]. Given the\
    \ sensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications, such as crops drought\
    \ stress \n[107]. With regard to the water use efficiency, a combination of vegetation\
    \ indices (VIs) along with \nstructural physiological indices were found to be\
    \ useful to study water stress in horticultural crops \n[34,82,129]. \n3.3. Hyperspectral\
    \ \nHyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled at a narrower\
    \ wavelength \nintervals spanning from visible to NIR spectrum at a high to ultra-high\
    \ spectral resolution (Figure \n3d). Scanning at contiguous narrow-band wavelengths,\
    \ a hyperspectral sensor produces a three \ndimensional (two spatial dimensions\
    \ and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral data \ncube. The hyperspectral\
    \ data cube is a hyperspectral image where each pixel contain spatial \ninformation,\
    \ as well as the entire spectral reflectance curve [130]. Based on the operating\
    \ principle \nand output data cube, hyperspectral sensors for remote sensing can\
    \ include a point spectrometer (aka \nspectroradiometer), whiskbroom scanner,\
    \ pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131]. A \npoint spectrometer,\
    \ samples within its field of view solid angle to produce an ultra-high spectral\
    \ \nresolution spectral data of a point [130,132]. A whiskbroom scanner deploys\
    \ a single detector onboard \nto scan one single pixel at a time. As the scanner\
    \ rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of \nthe data cube, and as\
    \ the platform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a hyperspectral\
    \ \nimage [133]. A pushbroom scanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous detectors\
    \ arranged in the \nperpendicular direction of travel and scans the entire row\
    \ of pixels at a time. As the platform moves \nforward, the successive rows form\
    \ a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager \nusing different\
    \ scanning techniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene\
    \ \n[135,136]. The point spectrometer offers the highest spectral resolution and\
    \ lowest signal-to-noise \nratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible hyperspectral\
    \ sensors [137,138]. \n \nFigure 4. The data cube structure of different spectral\

    \ high resolution contiguous spectral\nsampling, possesses tremendous potential\
    \ to detect and monitor speciﬁc biotic and abiotic stresses [139].\nNarrowband\
    \ hyperspectral data was used to detect water stress using the measurement of\
    \ ﬂuorescence\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n9 of 35\nand PRI over a citrus orchard\
    \ [110]. PRI was identiﬁed as one of the best predictors of water stress for a\n\
    vineyard in a study that investigated numerous VIs using hyperspectral imaging\
    \ [140]. High-resolution\nthermal imagery obtained from a hyperspectral scanner\
    \ was used to map canopy stomatal conductance\n(gs) and CWSI of olive orchards\
    \ where diﬀerent irrigation treatments were applied [18]. With the\nlarge volume\
    \ of spatial/spectral data extracted from the hyperspectral data cube, machine\
    \ learning\nwill likely be adopted more widely in the horticultural environment\
    \ to model water stress [141].\nSee Reference [54] for a comprehensive review\
    \ of hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing to detect\nplant water status.\n\
    3.4. Thermal\nThermal cameras use microbolometers to read passive thermal signals\
    \ in the spectral range of\napproximately 7–14 µm (Figure 3b). Small UAS are capable\
    \ of carrying a small form-factor thermal\ncamera with uncooled microbolometers,\
    \ which does not use an internal cooling mechanism and,\ntherefore, does not achieve\
    \ the high SNR that can be found in cooled microbolometer-based thermal\ncameras.\
    \ An array of microbolometer detectors in the thermal camera receives a thermal\
    \ radiation\nsignal and stores the signal on the corresponding image pixel as\
    \ raw data number (DN) values.\nThe result is a thermal image where each pixel\
    \ has an associated DN value, which can be converted to\nabsolute temperature.\
    \ A representative list of commercial thermal cameras used on UAS platforms\n\
    and their applications with regard to agricultural remote sensing is found in\
    \ the literature [23,53,73].\nThermal imagery enables the measurement of the foliar\
    \ temperature of plants. The foliar temperature\ndiﬀerence between well-watered\
    \ and water-stressed crops is the primary source of information for\nwater stress\
    \ prediction using a thermal sensor [142]. When mounted on a remote sensing platform,\
    \ the\ncanopy level assessment of crop water status can be performed on a large\
    \ scale.\nThermal cameras are limited by their resolution (e.g., 640 × 512 is\
    \ the maximum resolution of\nUAS compatible thermal cameras in the current market)\
    \ and high price-tag [53]. The small number of\npixels results in low spatial\
    \ resolution limiting either the ability to resolve a single canopy or ability\
    \ to\nﬂy higher and cover a larger area. If ﬂown at a higher altitude, the eﬀective\
    \ spatial resolution may\nbe inadequate for canopy level assessment of some horticultural\
    \ crops. For example, a FLIR Tau2\n640 thermal camera with a 13 mm focal length\
    \ when ﬂown at an altitude of approximately 120 m\nresults in a spatial resolution\
    \ of 15.7 cm. For relatively large horticultural crops, such as grapevine,\nalmond,\
    \ citrus, and avocado, the resolution at a maximum legal ﬂying altitude of 120\
    \ m in Australia\n(for small-sized UAS) oﬀers an adequate spatial resolution to\
    \ observe a single canopy.\nAnother challenge with the use of thermal cameras\
    \ is the temporal drift of the DN values\nwithin successive thermal images, especially\
    \ with uncooled thermal cameras [143]. Due to the lack\nof an internal cooling\
    \ mechanism for the microbolometer detectors, DN values registered by the\nmicrobolometers\
    \ experience temporal drift i.e., the registered DN values for the same temperature\n\
    target will drift temporally. Thus, the thermal image can be unreliable especially\
    \ when the internal\ntemperature of the camera is changing rapidly, such as during\
    \ camera warmup period or during the\nﬂight when a gust of cool wind results in\
    \ cooling of the camera. To overcome this challenge, the user\nmay need to provide\
    \ suﬃcient startup time before operation (preferably 30–60 min) [102,143–145],\n\
    shield the camera to minimize the change in the internal temperature of the camera\
    \ [142], calibrate the\ncamera [146–153], and perform frequent ﬂat-ﬁeld corrections.\n\
    3.5. Multi-Sensor\nTo carry multiple sensors, the total UAS payload needs to be\
    \ considered that includes, in\naddition to the sensors, an inertial measurement\
    \ unit (IMU) and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) for the georeferencing\
    \ purpose [40,154]. Higher accuracy sensors tend to be heavier, and in\na multi-sensor\
    \ scenario, the payload can quickly reach or even exceed the payload limit. This\
    \ has\nlimited contemporary measurements in earlier multirotor UAS requiring separate\
    \ ﬂights for each of\nsensor [126]. The use of ﬁxed-wing UAS has allowed carrying\
    \ higher payloads due to the much larger\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n10 of 35\nthrust-to-weight\
    \ ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155]. Similarly, recent advancement\
    \ in\nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have enabled multirotor (payload\
    \ 5–6 kg readily available) to\nonboard multi-sensors.\nWater status of crops\
    \ is a complex process inﬂuenced by a number of factors including the\nphysiology\
    \ of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and vigour of the crop, and meteorological\n\
    factors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this reason, a multi-sensor platform is used\
    \ to acquire measurements\nof the diﬀerent aspects of the crop for water status\
    \ assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\ncombination of sensors found in the\
    \ literature is the RGB, multispectral (including rededge and NIR\nbands) and\
    \ thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to investigate the water status\
    \ of the crop\nusing various indicators, such as PRI, CWSI, ﬂuorescence, and structural\
    \ properties, with the aim of\nimproving the water use eﬃciency [102,110,158–160].\n\
    4. Techniques of Remote Sensing in Horticulture\n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely\
    \ Sensed Images\nGeoreferencing provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed\
    \ images such that the pixels\nrepresenting crops or regions of interest on the\
    \ images are correctly associated with their position on\nEarth. The georeferencing\
    \ process generally uses surveyed coordinate points on the ground, known\nas ground\
    \ control points (GCPs), to determine and apply scaling and transformation to\
    \ the aerial\nimages [161]. Alternatively, instead of GCPs, the user can georeference\
    \ aerial images by using the\naccurate position of the camera, or by co-registration\
    \ with the existing georeferenced map [105,162].\nIn the case of UAS-based images,\
    \ the capture timing is scheduled to ensure a recommended\nforward overlap (>80%)\
    \ between successive images.\nThe ﬂight path is designed to ensure the\nrecommended\
    \ side overlap (>70%) between images from successive ﬂight strips. Thus, the captured\n\
    series of images are processed using the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technique\
    \ to generate a 3D\npointcloud and orthomosaic [73,130] (see Figure 5). Commonly\
    \ used SfM software to process the\nremote sensing images are Agisoft PhotoScan\
    \ and Pix4D. The commonly retrieved outputs from the\nSfM software for assessment\
    \ of horticulture crops include the orthomosaic, digital surface model\n(DSM),\
    \ DEM, and 3D pointcloud [113,126,163]. This technique of georeferencing can be\
    \ applied to any\nsensor that produces images, e.g., RGB, thermal, or multispectral\
    \ cameras [126,164,165].\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140 \n10 of 35 \n \nsensor [126].\
    \ The use of fixed-wing UAS has allowed carrying higher payloads due to the much\
    \ larger \nthrust-to-weight ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155].\
    \ Similarly, recent advancement in \nUAS technology and lightweight sensors have\
    \ enabled multirotor (payload 5–6 kg readily available) \nto onboard multi-sensors.\
    \ \nWater status of crops is a complex process influenced by a number of factors\
    \ including the \nphysiology of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and\
    \ vigour of the crop, and meteorological \nfactors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this\
    \ reason, a multi-sensor platform is used to acquire measurements \nof the different\
    \ aspects of the crop for water status assessment [34,102,108]. The most common\
    \ \ncombination of sensors found in the literature is the RGB, multispectral (including\

    \ investigate the water status of the crop \nusing various indicators, such as\
    \ PRI, CWSI, fluorescence, and structural properties, with the aim of \nimproving\
    \ the water use efficiency [102,110,158–160]. \n4. Techniques of Remote Sensing\
    \ in Horticulture \n4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely Sensed Images \nGeoreferencing\
    \ provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed images such that the pixels\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n11 of 35\nThe complexity of georeferencing of hyperspectral\
    \ observations depends on the sensor type, i.e.,\nimaging or non-imaging. A non-imaging\
    \ spectroradiometer relies on the use of a GNSS antenna and\nan IMU for georeferencing\
    \ the point observation [130,132,138,168]. An imaging hyperspectral camera,\n\
    generally, in addition to GNSS and IMU measurement, uses the inter-pixel relation\
    \ in SfM to produce a\ngeoreferenced orthomosaic [40,134,135,169,170].\n4.2. Calibration\
    \ and Correction of Remotely Sensed Images\nEnsuring consistency, repeatability,\
    \ and quality of the spectral observation requires stringent\nradiometric, spectral,\
    \ and atmospheric corrections [123,171–177]. Spectral and radiometric calibration\n\
    is performed in the spectral calibration facility in darkroom settings. The sensor’s\
    \ optical properties\nand shift in spectral band position are corrected during\
    \ the spectral calibration process. Radiometric\ncalibration enables conversion\
    \ of the recorded digital values into physical units, such as radiance.\nInﬁeld\
    \ operation of the spectral sensor is inﬂuenced by variations in atmospheric transmittance\n\
    from thin clouds, invisible to the human observer. Changes in atmospheric transmittance\
    \ aﬀect the\nradiance incident on the plant. As a result, the change in acquired\
    \ spectral response by the sensor\nmay not represent the change in plants response\
    \ but the change in incident radiation on the plant.\nThe most common method to\
    \ convert the spectral data to reﬂectance is by generating an empirical line\n\
    relationship between sensor values and spectral targets, such as a Spectralon®\
    \ or calibration targets.\nThe use of downwelling sensors, such as a cosine corrector\
    \ [137], or the use of a ground-based PAR\nsensor enables absolute radiometric\
    \ calibration to generate radiance [130].\nThe calibration of the broad wavelength\
    \ multispectral sensor is generally less stringent than\nthe hyperspectral. Generally,\
    \ multispectral sensors are used to compute normalised indices such\nas NDVI.\
    \ The normalised indices are relatively less inﬂuenced, although signiﬁcant, by\
    \ the change\nin illumination conditions which aﬀect the entire spectrum proportionally\
    \ [29,101]. In this regard,\nradiometric calibration of the multispectral camera\
    \ has used a range of stringent to simpliﬁed, and\nvicarious approaches [123,125,171,173,178–180].\
    \ Some multispectral cameras are equipped with a\ndownwelling light sensor, which\
    \ is aimed at correcting for variations in atmospheric transmittance.\nHowever,\
    \ the performance of such downwelling sensors (without a cosine corrector) on\
    \ multispectral\ncameras have been reported to have directional variation resulting\
    \ in unstable correction, indicating\nthe inability of the sensor to incorporate\
    \ the entire hemisphere of diﬀused light [124,137].\nThe radiometric calibration\
    \ of the thermal images is typically based on the camera’s DN to object\ntemperature\
    \ curve, which provides the relationship between the DN of a pixel and a known\
    \ object\ntemperature, usually of a black body radiator. Measurement accuracy\
    \ and SNR of the camera under\nvarying ambient temperatures can be improved by\
    \ using calibration shutters, which are recently\navailable commercially. Furthermore,\
    \ for low measurement errors (under 1 ◦C), thermal data requires\nconsideration\
    \ to the atmospheric transmittance [18,102]. Flying over a few temperature reference\n\
    targets placed on the ground reduces the temporal drift of the camera [142,143,181].\
    \ Temperature\naccuracy within a few degrees was achieved by ﬂying over the targets\
    \ three times (at the start, middle\nand end of UAS operation) and using three\
    \ separate calibration equations for each overpass [142].\nAdditionally, using\
    \ the redundant information from multiple overlapping images, drift correction\n\
    models have been proposed, which lowered temperature error by 1 ◦C as compared\
    \ to uncorrected\northomosaic [152]. The manufacturer stated accuracies (generally\
    \ ±5 ◦C) can be suﬃcient to access the\nﬁeld variability and to detect “hotspots”\
    \ of water status. However, the aforementioned calibration and\ncorrection of\
    \ the thermal cameras are required for quantitative measurement as a goal [143].\
    \ In this\nregard, current challenges and best practices for the operation of\
    \ thermal cameras onboard a UAS is\nprovided in the literature [143].\n4.3. Canopy\
    \ Data Extraction\nA key challenge in remote sensing of horticultural as compared\
    \ to agricultural crops arises due\nto the proportion of inter-row ground/vegetation\
    \ cover and resulting mixed pixels. The proportion\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n12\
    \ of 35\nof the mixed pixels increases with the decrease in spatial resolution\
    \ of the image. Most of the pixels\ntowards the edge of the canopy contain a blend\
    \ of information originating from the sun-lit canopy,\nshadowed leaves, and inter-row\
    \ bare soil/cover crop. A further challenge can arise for some crops,\nsuch as\
    \ grapevine, due to overlapping of adjacent plants.\nThe canopy data from orthomosaic\
    \ has been extracted using either a pixel-based or an object-based\napproach.\
    \ Earlier studies manually sampled from the centre of crop row which most likely\
    \ eliminated\nthe mixed pixels [182]. In the pixel-based approach, techniques,\
    \ such as applying global threshold\nand masking, have been used. Binary masks,\
    \ such as NDVI, eliminates non-canopy pixels from\nthe sampling [82,84]. Combining\
    \ the NDVI mask with the canopy height mask can exclude the\npixels associated\
    \ with non-vegetation, as well as vegetation that does not meet the height threshold.\n\
    The pixel-based approach, however, can result in inaccurate identiﬁcation of some\
    \ crops due to pixel\nheterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop\
    \ pattern variability.\nIn the object-based approach, using object detection techniques,\
    \ neighbouring pixels with\nhomogenous information, such as spectral, textural,\
    \ structural, and hierarchical features, are grouped\ninto “objects”. These objects\
    \ are used as the basis of object-based image analysis (OBIA) classiﬁcation\n\
    using classiﬁers, such as k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, support vector machine,\
    \ random forest,\nand maximum likelihood [122,183–185]. In the horticultural environment,\
    \ OBIA has been adopted\nto classify and sample from pure canopy pixels [119,122,186].\
    \ Consideration should be provided on\nthe number of features and their suitability\
    \ for a speciﬁc application to reduce the computational\nburden, as well as to\
    \ maintain the accuracies. The generalisation of these algorithms for transferability\n\
    between study sites usually penalises the achievable accuracy. For details in\
    \ object-based approach of\nsegmentation and classiﬁcation, readers are directed\
    \ to literatures [122,183,185,187–189].\nOther techniques found in the literature\
    \ include algorithms, such as ‘Watershed’, which has been\ndemonstrated in palm\
    \ orchards [82,190]. Vine rows and plants have been isolated and classiﬁed using\n\
    image processing techniques, such as clustering and skeletisation [188,191–193].\
    \ Similarly, the gridded\npolygon, available in common GIS software, such as ArcGIS\
    \ and QGIS, can be used in combination\nwith zonal statistics for this purpose.\
    \ When working with the low-resolution images, co-registration\nwith the high-resolution\
    \ images has been proposed, whereby, the high-resolution images enable better\n\
    delineation of the mixed pixels [194]. For this reason, spectral and thermal sensors,\
    \ which are usually\nlow in resolution, are generally employed along with high-resolution\
    \ digital cameras.\n4.4. Indicators of Crop Water Status\nA crop’s biophysical\
    \ and biochemical attributes can be approximated using diﬀerent indices and\n\
    quantitative products. For example, CWSI is used to proxy leaf water potential\
    \ (Ψleaf), stem water\npotential (Ψstem), gs, and net photosynthesis (Pn) [83,100,195].\
    \ With regard to horticultural crops, water\nstatus has been assessed using a\
    \ number of spectral and thermal indices (Table 2).\nTable 2. Commonly used vegetation\

    A plant maintains its temperature by transpiring through the stomata to balance\
    \ the energy\nﬂuxes in and out of the canopy. As the plant experience stress (both\
    \ biotic and abiotic), the rate of\ntranspiration decreases, which results in\
    \ higher canopy temperature (Tc), which can be a proxy to\nunderstand the water\
    \ stress in the plant [207]. In this regard, crop water stress showed a correlation\n\
    with canopy temperature extracted from the thermal image [208], which enables\
    \ mapping the spatial\nvariability in water status [209]. Leaf/canopy temperature\
    \ alone, however, does not provide a complete\ncharacterisation of crop water\
    \ status, for instance, an equally stressed canopy can be 25 ◦C or 35 ◦C,\ndepending\
    \ on the current ambient temperature (Ta). Thus, canopy-to-air temperature diﬀerence\n\
    (Tc − Ta) was proposed, which showed a good correlation with the Ψstem, Ψleaf,\
    \ and gs in horticultural\ncrops [85,99,182].\n4.4.2. Normalised Thermal Indices\n\
    The CWSI, the conductance index (Ig) and the stomatal conductance index (I3) are\
    \ thermal\nindices most commonly used to estimate crop water status and gs [210–212].\
    \ These indices provide\nsimilar information, however, use a diﬀerent range of\
    \ numbers to represent the level of water stress.\nThe CWSI is normalised within\
    \ zero and one, whereas Ig and I3 represent stress using numbers\nbetween zero\
    \ and inﬁnity. CWSI has been adopted most widely in horticultural applications\
    \ to\nassess the water status of crops, such as the grapevines [100,213], almond\
    \ [91,198], citrus [85,110], and\nothers [18,87,99,214]. By normalising between\
    \ the lower and upper limits of (Tc − Ta), the CWSI of the\ncanopy presents quantiﬁable\
    \ relative water stress. The formula for CWSI computation is deﬁned as in\nEquation\
    \ (1) [208,212].\nCWSI =\n(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)LL\n(Tc − Ta)UL − (Tc − Ta)LL\n\
    (1)\nwhere (Tc − Ta)UL and (Tc − Ta)LL represent the upper and lower bound of\
    \ (Tc − Ta) which are found in\nthe water-stressed canopy and well-watered canopy\
    \ transpiring at the full potential (or maximum) rate,\nrespectively. Assuming\
    \ a constant ambient temperature, Equation (1) can be simpliﬁed to Equation (2),\n\
    which is the most widely reported formulation of CWSI with regard to the horticultural\
    \ remote sensing.\nCWSI = (Tc − Twet)\n\x10\nTdry − Twet\n\x11\n(2)\nwhere Twet\
    \ is the temperature of canopy transpiring at the maximum potential, and Tdry\
    \ is the\ntemperature of the non-transpiring canopy. CWSI has been shown to be\
    \ well-correlated with direct\nmeasurements of crop water status in the horticultural\
    \ environment [18,31,32,90,99]. In this regard,\na correlation of CWSI with various\
    \ ground measurements, such as Ψleaf [18,31,197], Ψstem [33,90,194],\nand gs [18,90,100],\
    \ have been established. Diurnal measurements of CWSI compared with Ψleaf showed\n\
    the best correlation at noon [89,197,209].\nCWSI is a normalised index, i.e.,\
    \ relative to a reference temperature range between Twet and Tdry,\nwhich is speciﬁc\
    \ to a region and crop type; thus, CWSI is not a universal quantitative indicator\
    \ of crop\nwater status. For instance, a CWSI of 0.5 for two diﬀerent varieties\
    \ of grapevines at diﬀerent locations\ndoes not conclusively inform that they\
    \ have equal or superior/inferior water status. Furthermore,\nthe degree of correlation\
    \ can change depending on the isohydric/anisohydric response of crop [214]\nwhere\
    \ early/late stomatal closure aﬀects the indicators of water stress [110]. Moreover,\
    \ phenological\nstage aﬀects the relationship between remotely sensed CWSI and\
    \ water stress [197]. Thus, water stress\nin a diﬀerent crop, at a diﬀerent location\
    \ and at a diﬀerent phenological stage, will have a unique\ncorrelation with CWSI\
    \ and, therefore, needs to be established independently.\nThere are multiple methods\
    \ to measure the two reference temperatures, Twet and Tdry, which\ncould result\
    \ in variable CWSI values depending on the method used. The ﬁrst method is to\
    \ measure the\ntwo reference temperatures on the crop of interest. Tdry can be\
    \ estimated by inducing stomatal closure,\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n14 of 35\n\
    which is the leaf temperature approximately 30 min after applying a layer of petroleum\
    \ jelly e.g.,\nVaseline to both sides of a leaf. This eﬀectively blocks stomata\
    \ and, therefore, impedes leaf transpiration.\nTwet can be estimated by measuring\
    \ leaf temperature approximately 30 s after spraying water on the\nleaf, which\
    \ emulates maximum transpiration [23,83]. The advantage of this method is that\
    \ the stress\nlevels are normalised to actual plants response, whereas the necessity\
    \ to repeat the measurement for\nevery test site after each ﬂight can be cumbersome.\
    \ In an alternative (second) approach the range can\nbe established based on meteorological\
    \ data e.g., setting Tdry to 5 ◦C above air temperature and Twet\nmeasured from\
    \ an artiﬁcial surface. This method is also limited to local scale and presents\
    \ a problem\nregarding the choice of material, which ideally needs to have similar\
    \ to leaf emissivity, aerodynamic\nand optical properties [54,87]. The third method\
    \ uses the actual temperature measurement range\nof the remote sensing image [33,97].\
    \ This method is simple to implement, however, works on the\nassumption that the\
    \ ﬁeld contains enough variability to contain a representative Twet and Tdry.\
    \ Fourth,\nthe reference temperatures can be estimated by theoretically solving\
    \ for the leaf surface energy balance\nequations, however, are limited by the\
    \ necessity to compute the canopy aerodynamic resistance [87].\nStandard and robust\
    \ Twet and Tdry measurements are needed to characterize CWSI with accuracy,\n\
    especially for temporal analysis [85,87,211]. The level of uncertainty due to\
    \ the adaptation of diﬀerent\napproaches for Twet and Tdry determination in the\
    \ instantaneous and seasonal measurements of CWSI\nis not known. Nonetheless,\
    \ adopting a consistent approach, CWSI has been shown to be suitable for\nmonitoring\
    \ the water status and making irrigation decisions of horticultural crops [31,85].\n\
    4.4.3. Spectral Indices\nCrops reﬂectance properties convey information about\
    \ the crop, for instance, a healthier crop has\nhigher reﬂectance in the NIR band.\
    \ Most often, the bands are mathematically combined to form VIs,\nwhich provide\
    \ information on the crop’s health, growth stage, biophysical properties, leaf\
    \ biochemistry,\nand water stress [29,215–218]. Using multispectral or hyperspectral\
    \ data, several Vis, such as green\nnormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (GNDVI),\
    \ renormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI),\noptimized soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (OSAVI), transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance\nindex (TCARI),\
    \ and TCARI/OSAVI, amongst others [34,79,82], can be calculated that correlate\
    \ with the\nwater stress of horticultural crops (see Table 2). The most widely\
    \ studied VI in horticulture, in this\nregard, is the NDVI (Equation (3)).\nNDVI\
    \ = Rnir − Rr\nRnir + Rr\n(3)\nwhere Rnir and Rr represent the spectral reﬂectance\
    \ acquired at the NIR and red spectral regions,\nrespectively. In horticulture,\
    \ NDVI has been used as a proxy to estimate the vigour, biomass, and water\nstatus\
    \ of the crop. A vigorous canopy with more leaves regulates more water, therefore\
    \ remaining\ncooler when irrigated [200] and experiencing early water stress when\
    \ unirrigated. With regard to\nirrigation, the broadband normalised spectral indices\
    \ (such as NDVI) are suitable to detect spatial\nvariability and to identify the\
    \ area that is most vulnerable to water stress. However, these indices are\nnot\
    \ expected to change rapidly to reﬂect the instantaneous water status of plants\
    \ that are needed to\nmake decisions on irrigation scheduling.\nThe multispectral\
    \ indices along with complementary information in thermal wavelengths have\nproven\
    \ to be well suited to monitoring vegetation, speciﬁcally in relation to water\
    \ stress [219]. The ratio\nof canopy surface temperature to NDVI, deﬁned as temperature-vegetation\
    \ dryness index (TVDI),\nwas found to be useful for the study of water status\
    \ in horticultural crops. TVDI exploits the fact that\nvegetation with larger\
    \ NDVI will have a lower surface temperature unless the vegetation is under\n\
    stress. As most vegetation normally remains green after an initial bout of water\
    \ stress, the TVDI is\nmore suited than NDVI for early detection of water stress\
    \ as the surface temperature can rise rapidly\neven during initial water stress\
    \ [200].\nSimilarly, narrowband VIs that have been studied in relation to remote\
    \ sensing of water status are\nPRI and chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, which have been\
    \ directly correlated to the crop Ψleaf, gs [110,182,204].\nAgronomy 2020, 10,\
    \ 140\n15 of 35\nSeveral hyperspectral indices to estimate water status have been\
    \ identiﬁed [139]; however, their\napplication in remote sensing of horticultural\
    \ crops is at its infancy. Hyperspectral indices speciﬁc to\nwater absorption\
    \ bands around 900 nm, 1200 nm, 1400 nm, and 1900 nm may be used to detect the\n\
    water status of horticultural crops. The absorption features were found to be\
    \ highly correlated with\nplant water status [139]. Water band index (WBI), as\
    \ deﬁned in Equation (4), has been shown to closely\ntrack the changes in the\
    \ plant water status of various crops [202,203].\nWBI = R970\nR900\n(4)\nOther\
    \ water-related hyperspectral indices with potential application for horticultural\
    \ crops can\nbe found in the literature [139,202,203]. Hyperspectral data possess\
    \ the capability to reﬂect the\ninstantaneous water status of the plant, which\
    \ can be useful for quantitative decision-making on\nirrigation scheduling.\n\
    4.4.4. Soil Moisture\nThe moisture status of the soil provides an indication of\
    \ the available water resource to the crop.\nSoil moisture is traditionally measured\
    \ indirectly using soil moisture sensors placed below the surface\nof the soil.\
    \ A key challenge with using soil moisture sensors are the spatial distribution\
    \ of moisture,\nboth vertically and horizontally, to account for inherent ﬁeld-scale\
    \ variability. For instance, the root\nsystem of some horticultural crops, such\
    \ as grapevine, is capable of accessing water up to 30 m deep,\nwhile customer-grade\
    \ soil moisture probes generally extend to 1.5 m in depth or less. Thus, soil\n\
    moisture probes do not capture all the water available to the crop as they are\
    \ point measures and\nnot necessarily where the roots are located. Moreover, estimation\
    \ of soil moisture across spatial and\ntemporal scales is of interest for various\
    \ agricultural and hydrological studies. Optical, thermal, and\nmicrowave remote\
    \ sensing with their advantages relating to high spatial scale and temporal resolutions\n\
    could potentially be used for soil moisture estimation [220–222]. L-band microwave\
    \ radiometry,\na component of synthetic aperture radar systems, has been shown\
    \ to be a reliable approach to estimate\nsoil moisture via satellite-based remote\
    \ sensing [223], such as using the ESA’s Soil Moisture and\nOcean Salinity (SMOS)\
    \ [224] and NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites [225,226].\n\
    The limitation of the SMOS and SMAP missions, with regard to horticultural application,\
    \ is their\ndepth of retrieval (up to 5 cm) and spatial resolution (in the order\
    \ of tens of kilometre) [227–229].\nAs an airborne application, the volumetric\
    \ soil moisture has been estimated by analysing the SNR of\nthe GNSS interference\
    \ signal [230,231]. With aforementioned capabilities, a combination of satellite\n\
    and airborne remote sensing may, in the future, be a reliable tool to map soil\
    \ moisture across spatial,\ntemporal and depth scales.\n4.4.5. Physiological Attributes\n\
    Using the SfM on remotely-sensed images, 3D canopy structure, terrain conﬁgurations,\
    \ and canopy\nsurface models can be derived [113,114,119,186,232]. By employing\
    \ a delineation algorithm on the 3D\nmodels, the 3D attributes of the crops and\
    \ macrostructure are determined more accurately [120,122,233].\nCrop surface area\
    \ and terrain conﬁguration (e.g., slope and aspect) may help to develop an optimal\n\
    resource management strategy. For example, crops located at a higher elevation\
    \ within an irrigation\nzone may experience a level of water stress due to the\
    \ gravitational ﬂow of irrigated water.\nUsing the structural measurements, such\
    \ as the canopy height, canopy size, the envelope of each\nrow, LAI, and porosity,\
    \ among others, the water demand of the crop may be estimated. Generally,\nlarger\
    \ canopies tend to require more water than smaller canopies with less leaf area\
    \ [116,157]. Using\nthe temporal measurement of the plant’s 3D attributes, the\
    \ vigour can be computed. Monitoring\ncrop vigour over the season and over subsequent\
    \ years can provide an indication of its health and\nperformance, e.g., yield,\
    \ within an irrigation zone. Canopy structure metrics are closely related to\n\
    horticultural tree growth and provide strong indicators of water consumption,\
    \ whereby canopy size\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n16 of 35\ncan be used to determine\
    \ its water requirements [234]. Other 3D attributes, such as the crown perimeter,\n\
    width, height, area, and leaf density, have been shown to enable improved pruning\
    \ of horticultural\nplants [116,119].\nLAI can be estimated using the 3D attributes\
    \ obtained from remote sensing [114,157,201], whereby,\nhigher LAI is equivalent\
    \ to more leaf layers, implying greater total leaf area and, consequently, canopy\n\
    transpiration. Leaf density, LAI, and exposed leaf area of a crop drive its water\
    \ requirement and\nproductivity [235–237]. Knowledge of ﬁeld attributes, such\
    \ as row and plant spacing, may assist in\ninter-row surface energy balance to\
    \ determine the irrigation need of the plant [238]. Combining the\nstructural\
    \ properties with spectral VIs provide an estimation of biomass [239], which can\
    \ serve as\nanother indicator of the plant’s water requirements. Although physiological\
    \ attributes have been used\nto understand plant water status and its spatial\
    \ variability, they have not been directly applied to make\nquantitative decisions\
    \ on irrigation.\n4.4.6. Evapotranspiration\nThe estimation of ET via remote sensing,\
    \ numerical modelling, and empirical methods have been\nextensively studied and\
    \ reviewed in the literature [240–247]. These models are based on either surface\n\
    energy balance (SEB), Penman-Monteith (PM), Maximum entropy production (MEP),\
    \ water balance,\nwater-carbon linkage, or empirical relationships.\nSEB models\
    \ are based on a surface energy budget in which the latent heat ﬂux is estimated\
    \ as a\nresidual of the net radiation, soil heat ﬂux, and sensible heat ﬂux. The\
    \ models are either one-source\n(canopy and soil treated as a single surface for\
    \ the estimation of sensible heat ﬂux) or two-source\n(canopy and soil surfaces\
    \ treated separately). Improvements over the original one-source SEB models\n\
    were in the form of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) algorithm\
    \ [248,249] and\nMapping EvapoTranspiration with high Resolution and Internalized\
    \ Calibration (METRIC) [249,250].\nSEBAL oﬀers a simpliﬁed approach to collect\
    \ ET data at both local and regional scales thereby increasing\nthe spatial scope,\
    \ while METRIC uses the same (SEBAL) technique but auto-calibrates the model using\n\
    hourly ground-based reference ET (ETr) data [251]. As such, these and other (e.g.,\
    \ MEP) models rely\non accurate measurements of surface (e.g., canopy) and air\
    \ temperatures, which can be erroneous\nunder non-ideal conditions, e.g., cloudy\
    \ days. There is also a reliance on ground-based sensors to\ncapture ambient air\
    \ temperatures required by the model.\nAmong the existing methods, FAO’s PM is\
    \ the most widely adopted model to estimate reference\nET (ETref or ET0) [252].\
    \ The PM method uses incident and reﬂected solar radiation, emitted thermal\n\
    radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and vapour pressure to calculate ET0 [253].\
    \ Remote sensing\nprovides a cost-eﬀective method to estimate the ET0 at regional\
    \ to global scales [241] by estimating\nreﬂected solar and emitted thermal radiation.\
    \ One of the advantages of using the PM approach is\nthat it is parametrised using\
    \ micrometeorological data easily obtained from ground-based automatic\nweather\
    \ stations. However, PM suﬀers from the drawback that canopy transpiration is\
    \ not dynamic\nas inﬂuenced by soil moisture availability via stomatal regulation\
    \ [241]. From a practical standpoint,\nPM-derived ET0 estimates are used in conjunction\
    \ with crop factors or crop coeﬃcients (kc), which are\nclosely related to the\
    \ light interception of the canopy [254].\nCrop evapotranspiration (ETc) is deﬁned\
    \ as the product of kc and ET0. In the absence of accurate\nETc measurements,\
    \ kc is an easy and practical means of getting reliable estimates of ETc using\
    \ ET0 [255].\nIn this regard, studies have focused on the use of remote sensing\
    \ to study spatial variability in kc and\nETc [101,256–258]. Thermal and NIR imagery\
    \ can be used to compute kc and ETc as transpiration\nrate is closely related\
    \ to canopy temperature [259–261] and kc has been shown to correlate with\ncanopy\
    \ reﬂectance [101,255]. Various thermal indices, such as CWSI, canopy temperature\
    \ ratio, canopy\ntemperature above non-stressed, and canopy temperature above\
    \ canopy threshold, can be used to\nestimate ETc, where CWSI- based ETc was found\
    \ to be the most accurate [24].\nET at a larger scale is typically estimated based\
    \ on satellite remote sensing. The temporal resolution\nof satellites is, however,\
    \ low and inadequate for horticultural applications, such as irrigation scheduling\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n17 of 35\n(e.g., Landsat has a 16-day revisit cycle).\
    \ In contrast, high temporal resolution satellites are coarse in\nspatial resolution\
    \ for ﬁeld-scale observations [25]. The daily or even instantaneous estimation\
    \ of ETc at\nthe ﬁeld scale is crucial for irrigation scheduling and is expected\
    \ to have great application prospects\nin the future [240,259,262,263]. In this\
    \ regard, the future direction of satellite-based ET estimates\nmay focus on temporal\
    \ downscaling either by extrapolation of instantaneous measurement [264],\ninterpolation\
    \ between two successive observations [201], data fusion of multiple satellites\
    \ [25,260], and\nspatial downscaling using multiple satellites [265–268]. An example\
    \ of early satellite-based remote\nsensing for ET is the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration\
    \ Project (MOD16), which was established in\n1999 to provide daily estimates of\
    \ global terrestrial evapotranspiration using data acquired from a\npair of NASA\
    \ satellites in conjunction with Algorithm Theoretical Based Documents (ATBDs)\
    \ [269].\nThese estimates correlated well with ground-based eddy covariance ﬂux\
    \ tower estimates of ET despite\ndiﬀerences in the uncertainties associated with\
    \ each of these techniques.\nUASs are being increasingly utilised to acquire multi-spectral\
    \ and thermal imagery to compute\nET at an unprecedented spatial resolution [270,271].\
    \ Using high-resolution images, ﬁltering the\nshadowed-pixel is possible, which\
    \ showed signiﬁcant improvement in the estimation of ET in\ngrapevine [101]. Using\
    \ high-resolution thermal and/or multispectral imagery, ET has been derived for\n\
    horticultural crops, such as grapevines [270] and olives [271]. The seasonal monitoring\
    \ of ETc at high\nspatial and temporal resolutions is of high importance for precision\
    \ irrigation of horticultural crops in\nthe future [259].\n5. Case Studies on\
    \ the Use of Remote Sensing for Crop Water Stress Detection\nThe increasing prevalence\
    \ of UAS along with low-cost camera systems has brought about much\ninterest in\
    \ the characterisation of crop water status/stress during the growing season to\
    \ inform orchard\nor farm management decisions, in particular, irrigation scheduling\
    \ [272,273]. Traditional methodologies\nto assess crop water stress are constrained\
    \ by limitations relating to large farm sizes and accompanying\nspatial variability,\
    \ high labour costs to collect data, and access to instrumentation that is both\
    \ inexpensive\nand portable [272]. The beneﬁts of precision agriculture [274],\
    \ including through precision irrigation\npractices [1], result in higher production\
    \ eﬃciencies and economic returns through site-speciﬁc crop\nmanagement [275,276].\
    \ This approach has motivated the use of high-resolution imagery acquired\nfrom\
    \ remote sensing to identify irrigation zones [99,277]. The ﬁrst horticultural\
    \ applications of UAS\nplatforms for crop water status measurement were in orange\
    \ and peach orchards where both thermal\nand multispectral-derived VIs, speciﬁcally\
    \ the PRI, were shown to be well-correlated to crop water\nstatus [102]. Here,\
    \ we explore the use of remote sensing and accompanying image acquisition platforms\n\
    to characterise the spatial and temporal patterns of the water status of two economically\
    \ important\nhorticultural crops, grapevine and almond.\n5.1. Grapevine (Vitis\
    \ spp.)\nThe characterisation of spatial variability in vine water status in a\
    \ vineyard provides valuable\nguidance on irrigation scheduling decisions [82],\
    \ and this spatial variability can be eﬃciently\ncharacterised by the use of remote\
    \ sensing platforms [29]. The ﬁrst use of remote sensing in vineyards\nfor crop\
    \ water stress detection was using manned aircraft ﬂown over an irrigated vineyard\
    \ in Hanwood\n(NSW) Australia where CWSI was mapped at a spatial resolution of\
    \ 10 cm [278]. Subsequently, UAS\nplatforms began to be used in vineyards for\
    \ vine water stress characterisation. Early work in this\ncrop used a fuel-based\
    \ helicopter with a 29 cc engine and equipped with thermal (Thermovision\nA40M)\
    \ and multispectral (Tetracam MCA-6) camera systems [102]. The study observed\
    \ strong (inverse)\nrelationships between (Tc − Ta) and gs. A related study showed\
    \ strong correlations between thermal\nand multispectral VIs, and traditional,\
    \ ground-based measures of water status, such as Ψleaf and\ngs [182]. In this\
    \ study, normalised PRI was shown to have correlation coeﬃcients exceeding 0.8\
    \ versus\nboth Ψleaf and gs, indicating that remotely-sensed VIs can be reliable\
    \ indicators of vine water status.\nThermal indices, such as (Tc − Ta) and CWSI,\
    \ were also well-correlated to Ψleaf and gs at speciﬁc times of\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 140\n18 of 35\nthe day. The use of thermal indices, such as CWSI or Ig,\
    \ requires reference temperatures (Twet, Tdry) or\nnon-water stressed baselines\
    \ (NWSB) [279]. Due to the diﬃculty of obtaining reference temperatures or\nNWSB\
    \ using remote sensing, some authors have used the minimum temperature found from\
    \ all canopy\npixels as Twet [199], and Ta + 5 ◦C as Tdry [213,280]. NWSB is typically\
    \ obtained from well-watered\ncanopies, measuring (Tc − Ta) under a range of vapour\
    \ pressure deﬁcit conditions [279]. Thermal water\nstress indices have also shown\
    \ to be useful to distinguish between water use strategies of diﬀerent\ngrapevine\
    \ cultivars [83,281], which is useful for customising irrigation scheduling based\
    \ on the speciﬁc\nwater needs of a given cultivar. More recently, studies have\
    \ used UAS-based multispectral-based\nVIs to train an artiﬁcial neural network\
    \ (ANN) models to predict spatial patterns of Ψstem [84,282].\nUsing UAS-based\
    \ multispectral data, the authors showed that ANN estimated Ψstem with higher\n\
    accuracy (RMSE lower than 0.15 MPa) as compared to the conventional multispectral\
    \ indices based\nestimation (RMSE over 0.32 MPa).\n5.2. Almond (Prunus Dulcis)\n\
    Almonds are perennial nut trees grown in semi-arid climates and are reliant on\
    \ irrigation\napplications. Their water requirements are relatively high, with\
    \ seasonal ETc exceeding 1000 mm [283].\nThe requirement for prudent irrigation\
    \ management in the face of decreased water availability is\ncritical for maintaining\
    \ tree productivity, yield, and nut quality [284]. Towards this goal, UAS-based\n\
    remote sensing has been used to characterise the spatial patterns of tree water\
    \ status in almond\norchards. A UAS-based thermal camera was used to acquire tree\
    \ the crown temperature data from\na California almond orchard; this temperature\
    \ was used to determine the temperature diﬀerence\nbetween crown and air (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and compared to shaded leaf water potential (Ψsl) [92]. The study\nfound\
    \ a strong negative correlation (R2 = 0.72) between (Tc − Ta) and Ψsl. The same\
    \ authors conducted\na follow on study in Spain on several fruit tree species\
    \ including almond. The negative relationship\n(slope and oﬀset) between (Tc −\
    \ Ta) and Ψstem was observed to vary based on the time of observation;\nmorning\
    \ measurements had weak relationships, whereas afternoon measurements had stronger\n\
    relationships [99]. Their proposed methodology allowed for the spatial characterisation\
    \ of orchard\nwater status on a single-tree basis, demonstrating the utility of\
    \ UAS-based crop water stress data.\nBeyond the characterisation of crop water\
    \ stress for irrigation scheduling, there is an opportunity to\nuse this data\
    \ to quantify the economic impact at a spatial level.\n6. Future Prospective and\
    \ Gaps in the Knowledge\nPrecision irrigation is a promising approach to increase\
    \ farm water use eﬃciency for sustainable\nproduction, including for horticultural\
    \ crops [3,5,9,10,274,285]. It is envisioned that the future of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ will incorporate UAS, manned aircraft, and satellite-based remote sensing platforms\n\
    alongside ground-based proximal sensors coupled with wireless sensor networks.\
    \ The automation\nof UAS technology will continue to develop further to a point\
    \ that even novice users can adopt\nthe technology with ease. It is also expected\
    \ that the data processing pipeline of remote sensing\nimages will become automated\
    \ to be ‘ﬁt for purpose’ for crop water status measurements. The ideal\nsolution\
    \ may lie in the use of satellites (or sometimes manned aircraft) for regional\
    \ estimation and\nplanning [55,260], UAS for seasonal monitoring and zoning [32,100,197,286],\
    \ proximal sensors for\ncontinuous measurement [287], and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to derive decision-ready products [84,282]\nthat can be used for making irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [31,288–295]. Continued technological\ndevelopments in\
    \ this space will enable growers to acquire actionable data with ease, and eventually\n\
    transition towards semi-automated or fully-automated irrigation applications.\n\
    Remote sensing and current irrigation application technologies are limited in\
    \ temporal and\nspatial resolution, respectively. Although UAS technology can\
    \ deliver sub-plant level spatially explicit\ninformation of water status, the\
    \ size of the management block is much coarser, typically over 10 m.\nHence, further\
    \ improvements in variable rate application technologies, e.g., boom sprayers,\
    \ or zoned\ndrip irrigation, are required to fully exploit high-resolution UAS\
    \ measurements. Nonetheless, the\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 140\n19 of 35\nrequired resolution\
    \ of remote sensing should be guided by the underlying spatial variability of\
    \ the crop.\nFor ﬁelds with relatively lower spatial variability, low/medium-resolution\
    \ remote sensing imagery\nmay suﬃce for crop water status assessment [278,296,297].\n\
    Remote sensing provides an indirect estimate of plant water status using the regression-based\n\
    approach through several calculated reﬂectance indices. In comparison, physical\
    \ and mechanistic\nmodels, e.g., radiative transfer models and energy balance\
    \ models, incorporate both direct and indirect\nmeasures of the canopy, therefore\
    \ establishing a basis for diﬀerences in plant water status. Using a\nsimilar\
    \ approach, predictions of crop water status using regression-based remote sensing\
    \ models can\nbe improved by incorporating some direct auxiliary variables.\n\
    Further developments in thermal remote sensing are also expected, speciﬁcally,\
    \ the advent of new\nthermal and hybrid thermal-multispectral water status/stress\
    \ indices that are more sensitive to canopy\ntranspiration. The most widely-adopted\
    \ thermal index, CWSI, is an instantaneous measure that is\nnormalised to local\
    \ weather conditions and inﬂuenced by genotype and phenotype. For example,\nthe\
    \ relationship between CWSI and crop water status is inﬂuenced by environmental\
    \ conditions\n(e.g., high incident radiation and low humidity vs low incident\
    \ radiation and high humidity) and\nphenological stage [197,214,298]. As a result,\
    \ corresponding ground-based measurements are required\nfor each temporal remote\
    \ measurement to determine the correlation with water status. Hence, temporal\n\
    assessments of water status using thermal cameras will require the incorporation\
    \ of meteorological\ndata along with the thermal response using novel indices.\n\
    In the area of satellite remote sensing, we foresee further developments on temporal\
    \ downscaling\nto achieve daily measurements. A higher temporal resolution may\
    \ be achieved by fusion of multiple\nsatellite observations, such as freely available\
    \ Landsat and Sentinel. Further reductions of temporal\nresolution will require\
    \ interpolation between two successive observations. Furthermore, temporal\nmodels\
    \ of water status could be developed to assist the interpolation to eventually\
    \ satisfy the\nrequirements for irrigation scheduling [25,201,263]. The continued\
    \ advancement and greater availability\nof Nanosat/Cubesat may provide an alternate\
    \ method to capture high-resolution data at a higher\na greater temporal resolution,\
    \ which can be suitable to study the water status of horticultural\ncrops [299–301].\n\
    Crop water status is a complex phenomenon, which can be interpreted with respect\
    \ to a\nnumber of variables. These variables can include spectral response, thermal\
    \ response, meteorological\ndata, 3D attributes of the canopy, and macrostructure\
    \ of the block (farm).\nClearly, there is\nan opportunity for a multi-disciplinary\
    \ approach, potentially incorporating artiﬁcial intelligence\ntechniques which\
    \ incorporate the aforementioned variables to provide a robust estimation of crop\n\
    water status [84,141,282,302,303]. Furthermore, with machine learning algorithms,\
    \ hyperspectral\nremote sensing will provide a wealth of data to estimate crop\
    \ water status. A quantitative product,\nsuch as SIF, derived from hyperspectral\
    \ data will have the potential for direct quantiﬁcation of water\nstress [204,205,304].\
    \ In this regard, the upcoming FLEX satellite mission [305,306] and recent advances\n\
    in aerial spectroradiometry [109,132,137,307–310] dedicated for observation of\
    \ SIF may be unique and\npowerful tools for high-value horticultural crops.\n\
    Multi-temporal images represent an excellent resource for seasonal monitoring\
    \ of changes in crop\nwater status. Five to six temporal points of data acquisition\
    \ at critical phenological stages of crop\ndevelopment have been recommended for\
    \ irrigation scheduling [31,32]. However, for semi-arid or arid\nregions, irrigation\
    \ is typically required multiple times per week. Acquisition and post-processing\
    \ of\nremote sensing data for actionable products multiple times a week is currently\
    \ logistically unfeasible.\nThe fusion of UAS-based remote sensing data, continuous\
    \ ground-based proximal or direct sensors,\nincluding weather station data, can\
    \ potentially inform daily estimates of water status at canopy level.\nThis approach\
    \ will require predictive models, such as those based on machine learning algorithms,\
    \ to\nestimate the current and future water status of the crop. Eventually, growers\
    \ would beneﬁt from the\nknowledge of crop water requirements for the determination\
    \ of seasonal irrigation requirements to\nsustainably farm into the future.\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 140\n20 of 35\nOne vision for the future of precision irrigation\
    \ is in automated pipelines to explicitly manage\nirrigation water at the sub-block\
    \ level. This automated pipeline would likely include remote and\nproximal data\
    \ acquisition and processing, prediction and interpretation of crop water status\
    \ and\nrequirements, and subsequently, control of irrigation systems. Recent rapid\
    \ developments in cloud\ncomputing and wireless technology could assist in the\
    \ quasi-real-time processing of the remote sensing\ndata soon after acquisition\
    \ [311–313]. Eventually, automation and computational power will merge to\ndevelop\
    \ smart technology in which artiﬁcial intelligence uses real-time data analysis\
    \ for diagnosis\nand decision-making. Growers of the future will be able to take\
    \ advantage of precise irrigation\nrecommendations using information sourced from\
    \ a ﬂeet of UAS that map large farm blocks on a daily\nschedule, continuous ground-based\
    \ proximal and direct sensors, and weather stations. This data can be\nstored\
    \ on and accessed from the cloud almost instantaneously, used in conjunction with\
    \ post-processing\nalgorithms for decision-making on optimised irrigation applications\
    \ [311,314].\n7. Conclusions\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of the\
    \ use of remote sensing to determine the water\nstatus of horticultural crops.\
    \ One of our objectives was to survey the range of remote sensing tools\navailable\
    \ for irrigation decision-making. Earth observation satellite systems possess\
    \ the required bands\nto study the water status of vegetation and soil. Satellites\
    \ are more suitable for scouting, planning,\nand management of irrigation applications\
    \ that involve large areas, and where data acquisition is\nnot time-constrained.\
    \ Manned aircraft are sparingly used in horticultural applications due to the\n\
    cost, logistics, and speciﬁc expertise needed for the operation of the platform.\
    \ UAS-based remote\nsensing provides ﬂexibility in spatial resolution (crop level\
    \ observation achievable), coverage (over\n25 ha achievable in a single ﬂight),\
    \ spectral bands, as well as temporal revisit. Routine monitoring of\nhorticultural\
    \ crops for water status characterisation is, therefore, best performed using\
    \ a UAS platform.\nWe envision a future for precision irrigation where satellites\
    \ are used for planning, and UAS used in\nconjunction with a network of ground-based\
    \ sensors to achieve actionable products on a timely basis.\nThe plant’s instantaneous\
    \ response to water stress can be captured using thermal cameras (via\nindices,\
    \ such as CWSI) and potentially narrow-band hyperspectral sensors (via, for example,\
    \ SIF),\nmaking them suitable to draw quantiﬁable decisions with regard to irrigation\
    \ scheduling. Broadband\nmultispectral and RGB cameras capture the non-instantaneous\
    \ water status of crops, making them\nsuitable for general assessment of crop\
    \ water status. Integrated use of thermal and multispectral\nimagery may be the\
    \ simplest yet eﬀective sensor combinations to capture the overall as well as\n\
    instantaneous water status of the plant. With regard to irrigation scheduling,\
    \ further developments\nare required to establish crop-speciﬁc thresholds of remotely-sensed\
    \ indices to decide when and how\nmuch to irrigate.\nAuthor Contributions: Performed\

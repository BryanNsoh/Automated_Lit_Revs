    **Relevance to Cognitive Radio Networks:**


    Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are a key technology for improving the efficiency
    and utilization of wireless spectrum. CRNs allow unlicensed users to access licensed
    spectrum bands when the licensed users are not using them. To do this effectively,
    CRNs need to be able to sense the spectrum environment, identify unused spectrum
    bands, and adapt their transmission parameters accordingly.


    ML plays a crucial role in enabling CRNs to perform these tasks. ML algorithms
    can be used to learn from the spectrum environment, identify patterns of spectrum
    usage, and predict future spectrum availability. This information can then be
    used to optimize the spectrum access strategies of CRNs, reducing interference
    and congestion.


    **Relevance to Dynamic Spectrum Access:**


    Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a technique that allows users to access spectrum
    on a flexible and opportunistic basis. DSA systems use ML algorithms to monitor
    the spectrum environment and identify unused spectrum bands. Users can then access
    these bands on a temporary basis, as long as they do not interfere with licensed
    users.


    ML is essential for enabling DSA systems to operate efficiently. ML algorithms
    can be used to learn from the spectrum environment, predict future spectrum availability,
    and optimize the spectrum access strategies of users. This helps to reduce interference
    and congestion, and improve the overall efficiency of spectrum utilization.


    **Conclusion:**


    The integration of ML and IoT in enterprise architectures has the potential to
    revolutionize the way that wireless communication is managed. By leveraging the
    power of ML, CRNs and DSA systems can improve spectrum efficiency, reduce interference
    and congestion, and provide users with more reliable and higher-quality wireless
    services.'

  explanation: The paper investigates the potential of cognitive radio networks and
    dynamic spectrum access to enhance wireless communication efficiency and secrecy
    in the presence of interference and congestion. It proposes a Stackelberg game
    model to optimize spectrum leasing between licensed users and unlicensed IoT devices,
    where the licensed users lease a portion of their spectrum access to the IoT devices
    in exchange for cooperative jamming and relaying services. The model considers
    the selfish behavior of the IoT devices and employs a reputation-based mechanism
    to monitor their cooperative behavior and prevent potential selfish attacks.

  extract_2: '"In the majority of existing spectrum sharing solutions, the secondary
    users are assumed to be fully reliable, hence the spectrum owners can often suffer
    from the selfish attacks performed with self-interested unlicensed users. However,
    our proposed spectrum leasing method gives the spectrum owners the possibility
    of only interacting with the reliable IoT devices and prevents the chance of degradation
    in quality of service due to selfish attacks, as confirmed by the simulation results."'

    for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing in Varying Interests Cognitive Radio Networks.
    Sensors, 22(17), 6692. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22176692
  explanation: 'In this paper, the authors present a cooperative, distributed spectrum
    sensing approach for use in a cognitive radio network (CRN) with varying conditions.
    They take a parameter estimation approach to the spectrum sensing problem and
    use the Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) method based on the diffusion strategy under
    multiple frequency bands and investigate its efﬁciency and robustness in the presence
    of changes in the sensing environment, including interference and congestion.


    The main objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of the ATC diffusion-based
    method in more challenging and practical scenarios, where some frequency bands
    stop being utilized by some primary users (PUs), or where there is a mobile SU
    node in the network. The authors consider a network of three static PUs with overlapping
    power spectrums and a set of K = 11 geographically distributed SUs that communicate
    via a connected network. The network is divided into different frequency zones,
    and each SU is interested in a subset of these zones. The PUs cease to use some
    of the frequent zones during different time intervals, and one of the SUs becomes
    mobile and changes position and frequency bands of interest over time.


    The authors analyze the performance of the ATC method by monitoring the estimation
    error of the involved parameters that approximate the total power spectrum. They
    evaluate the convergence and accuracy of the ATC method in estimating the global
    and common interest parameter vectors and compare its performance with a non-cooperative
    LMS algorithm. Their results show that the ATC method outperforms the non-cooperative
    LMS algorithm, and that the use of adaptive combination weights further improves
    the estimation accuracy.


    The work presented in this paper is relevant to the review intention as it provides
    a detailed analysis of the performance of a cooperative, distributed spectrum
    sensing approach under realistic and challenging conditions. The authors have
    conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach
    and have provided insights into its behavior under different scenarios.'

    The authors do not consider the impact of noise and interference on the performance
    of the ATC method. In practical scenarios, noise and interference can significantly
    affect the accuracy of spectrum sensing. It would be useful to evaluate the robustness
    of the ATC method to noise and interference.

    Security is another critical concern in IoT, especially given the vast amount

    such as physical-layer security and blockchain to enhance the security of IoT
    devices and networks.


    Researchers are also actively working on addressing the energy constraints of

    Networks. Sensors (Basel, Switzerland), 19(2), 241. https://doi.org/10.3390/s19020241
  data_sources: Survey data, Interviews, Case studies, Literature review
  explanation: The paper introduces a novel medium access control (MAC) protocol called
    Handshake Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (HSMA/CA) for densely
    deployed cognitive radio networks (CR-based IoT networks). The proposed protocol
    resolves the hidden primary terminal problem and maintains sufficient priority
    rights to primary users (PUs) in a densely distributed network by using handshake-based
    mutual spectrum sensing in the transmitter and the receiver. The HSMA/CA protocol
    also optimizes the spectrum sensing period to maximize the system performance
    by maintaining peculiarities in the sensing operation like false alarm and misdetection.
    They analyze the protocol through a mathematical model in terms of throughput
    and verify its accuracy by simulations. Simulation results show that the HSMA/CA
    protocol outperforms existing schemes due to optimized spectrum sensing and is
    suitable for non-collaborative densely deployed CR-based IoT networks.
  extract_1: HSMA/CA enables mutual spectrum sensing operation in the midst of the
    two control frames named Notify-To-Sense (NTS) and Acknowledge-To-Sense (ATS),
    to avoid the hidden primary terminal problem.
  extract_2: In HSMA/CA, neighbor discovery and spectrum sensing are carried out through
    handshake-based mutual spectrum sensing in the transmitter and the receiver.
  inline_citation: (Shafi, Ahmad, Afzal, Ali, Irshad, & Choi, 2018)
  key_findings: '*   The HSMA/CA protocol resolves the hidden primary terminal problem
    and maintains sufficient priority rights to PUs in a densely distributed network.



    *   The HSMA/CA protocol optimizes the spectrum sensing period to maximize the
    system performance by maintaining peculiarities in the sensing operation like
    false alarm and misdetection.



    *   Simulation results show that the HSMA/CA protocol outperforms existing schemes
    due to optimized spectrum sensing and is suitable for non-collaborative densely
    deployed CR-based IoT networks.'
  limitations: The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the protocol's performance
    in different network scenarios, such as varying network density and traffic load.
    Additionally, the evaluation of the protocol is limited to simulations, and it
    would be beneficial to also provide experimental results to demonstrate its practical
    performance.
  main_objective: To design a MAC protocol for densely deployed CR-based IoT networks
    that resolves the hidden primary terminal problem and maintains sufficient priority
    rights to PUs, while optimizing the spectrum sensing period to maximize the system
    performance.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is relevant to the point you are making in your
    literature review because it presents a novel MAC protocol for densely deployed
    CR-based IoT networks that resolves the hidden primary terminal problem and maintains
    sufficient priority rights to PUs, while optimizing the spectrum sensing period
    to maximize the system performance. This is significant because existing MAC protocols
    for such networks often suffer from the hidden primary terminal problem and inefficient
    spectrum sensing, which can degrade the performance of the network.

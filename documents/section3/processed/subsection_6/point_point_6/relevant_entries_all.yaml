    has emerged as a promising solution to many wireless communication problems including
    spectrum scarcity and underutilization. The a priory knowledge of Radio Frequency
    (RF) power (primary signals and/ or interfering signals plus noise) in the channels
    to be exploited by CR is of paramount importance. This will enable the selection
    of channel with less noise among idle (free) channels. Computational Intelligence
    (CI) techniques can be applied to these scenarios to predict the required RF power
    in the available channels to achieve optimum Quality of Service (QoS). In this
    paper, we developed a time domain based optimized Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
    model for the prediction of real world RF power within the GSM 900, Very High
    Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) TV bands. The application of the
    models produced was found to increase the robustness of CR applications, specifically
    where the CR had no prior knowledge of the RF power related parameters such as
    signal to noise ratio, bandwidth and bit error rate. The models used, implemented
    a novel and innovative initial weight optimization of the ANN''s through the use
    of differential evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms. This was found
    to enhance the accuracy and generalization of the ANN model. For this problem,
    DE/best/1/bin was found to yield a better performance as compared with the other
    algorithms implemented. Published in: 2014 IEEE 6th International Conference on

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Ota, Nigeria SECTION I. Introduction Most
    of the licensed radio spectrums are grossly underutilized while the unlicensed
    spectrums are overcrowded. The present spectrum scarcity is the direct consequence
    of spectrum allocation policy and not the fundamental lack of spectrum. The first
    bands to be approved for CR communication by the US Federal Communication Commission
    (FCC) because of their gross underutilization in time, frequency and spatial domain
    are the very high frequency and ultrahigh frequency (VHF/UHF) TV bands [1] [2].
    This paper is focused on the study of real world RF power distribution in specific
    selected channels (54MHz to 110MHz, 470MHz to 670MHz, 890MHz to 908.3MHz GSM up-link,
    935MHz to 953.3MHz GSM down-link) within the VHF/UHF bands and the GSM 900 band.
    In order to circumvent the problem of spectrum scarcity and underutilization,
    a new paradigm of wireless communication needs to be adopted. Advanced Cognitive
    Radio (CR) or Adaptive Spectrum Sharing (ASS) is one of the ways to optimize our
    wireless communications technologies for high data rates whilst maintaining user
    desired quality of service (QoS) requirements. CR is a radio equipped with the
    capability of awareness, perception, adaptation and learning of its radio frequency
    (RF) environment [3]; through which many of the digital signal processing that
    were traditionally done in hardware are implemented via software. Irrespective
    of the definition of CR, it has the followings basic characteristics: observation,
    adaptability and intelligence. CR is the key enabling technology for dynamic spectrum
    access and a promising solution for the present problem of spectrum scarcity and
    underutilization. Cognitive radio network consists of two users i.e. the primary
    users (PU) who are the incumbent licensed owners of the spectrum and the cognitive
    radio commonly called the secondary users (SU) who intelligently and opportunistically
    access the unused licensed spectrum on a no interference base i.e. when the licensed
    owners are not using the channel (the overlay) or SU can coexist with the PU as
    long as the interference to the PU is below a given threshold which will not be
    harmful to the PU nor degrade the QoS requirements of the PU (the underlay CR
    network scheme) [4] [1]. There are four things involved in cognitive radio network,
    these are: spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum
    mobility [5] [6]. In spectrum sensing, the CR senses the PU spectrum using either
    energy detector, cyclostationary features detector, match filter detector, eigen
    values detector, etc to sense the occupancy status of the PU. Based on the sensing
    results, the SU (CR) will take a decision using a binary classifier to classify
    the PU channels (spectrums) as either busy or idle there by identifying the white
    spaces. Spectrum sharing deals with how to efficiently share the available white
    spaces (spectrum holes) among other CR (SU) within a given geographical location
    at a given period of time while spectrum mobility is the ability of the CR to
    vacate the channel when the PU reclaimed ownership of the channel and search for
    another spectrum hole to communicate. During the withdrawal period, the CR should
    maintain seamless communication. Many wireless broadband devices ranging from
    simple communication to complex systems automation, are deployed daily with increasing
    demand for more, this calls for optimum utilization of the limited spectrum resources
    via CR paradigm. Future wireless communication device should be equipped with
    cognitive capability for efficient spectrum utilization. In this paper, we combine
    the power of differential evolutionary (DE) and swarm intelligence algorithms,
    and ANN to develop an optimized ANN model for the prediction of real world radio
    frequency (RF) power. The proposed algorithm used a priori data to enable the
    system to avoid noisy channels. The previous knowledge of the RF power allowed
    the cognitive radio to predictively select channels with the least noise among
    those that were unused or free. This would allow for a reduced utilization of
    radio resources including transmitted power, bandwidth, in turn maximizing the
    usage of the limited spectrum resources. The data used in this study was obtained
    by capturing real world RF data for two months using Universal Software Radio
    Peripheral 1 (USRP 1). The digital signal processing and capturing of the data
    were done using gnuradio which is a combination of Python and C++ while the ANN
    models design and prediction were done in Matlab. The experiment was conducted
    at Centre for Computational Intelligence, De Montfort University, UK, located
    very close to Leicester city centre. The rest of this paper is consist of the
    following sections. Section II previously presented research in this field. This
    will be followed by Section III and section IV, that gives brief description of
    neural network and the optimization algorithms implemented. Experimental details
    are discussed in section V. The paper is concluded with Section VI, which discusses
    the results of the experiments, section VII gives the summary of the findings.
    SECTION II. Related Work There are different types of Computational Intelligence
    (CI) and machine learning that can be used in CR such as genetic algorithms, fuzzy
    logic system (FLS), neural network, hidden Markov model, game theory, linear regression
    and linear predictors, Bayesian inference based predictors, swarm intelligence,
    etc. Some for learning and prediction, some for optimization of certain transmission
    parameters while others for decision making [7] [8] [9]. Spectrum hole prediction
    using Elman recurrent artificial neural network (ERANN) was proposed in [10].
    It uses the cyclostationary features of modulated signals to determine the presence
    or absence of primary signals while the input of the ERANN consists of time instances.
    The inputs and the target output used in the training of the ERANN and prediction
    were modeled using ideal multivariate time series equations and assumptions which
    are often different in real life where PU signals may be embedded in noise and/or
    interfering signals. The fact that spectrum holes were detected does not depict
    any information about the expected noise and/ or level of interference based on
    the channels history which is vital in selecting the channels to be used among
    the unused channels. Traffic pattern prediction using seasonal autoregressive
    integrated moving-average (SARIMA) was proposed for reduction of SU hopping rate
    and interference effects on PU while maintaining a fare blocking rate [11]. The
    model (SARIMA) does not depict any information about the expected noise power.
    Transmission rate prediction using adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
    was proposed in [12]. This model is used to predict the data rate (6, 12, 24,
    36, 48 and 54 Mbps) that can be achieved in WLAN using a 802.11a/g configuration
    as a function of time. The training data was obtained by generating a random data
    rate with an assigned probability of occurrence at a given time instance, thereby
    forming a time series. In this paper, no real world data was used. Additionally,
    the research did not take into account the noise or interference level which can
    affect the predicted rates. Semi Markov model (SMM) and continuous-time Markov
    chain (CTMC) models have also been used for the prediction of packet transmission
    rates [13]. This avoids packet collisions by periodic spectrum sensing and prediction
    of temporal wireless local area network (WLAN) activities combined with hoping
    to a temporary inactive channel. However, no reference is made to the expected
    noise level among the inactive channels that are selected. Fuzzy logic (FL) is
    a CI method that can capture and represent uncertainty. As a result it has been
    used in CR research for decision making processes. An FL based decision system
    was modeled for spectrum hand-off decision-making in a context characterized by
    uncertain and heterogeneous information [14] and fuzzy logic transmit power control
    for cognitive radio. The proposed system was used for the minimization of interference
    to PU''s while ensuring the transmission rate and quality of service requirements
    of secondary users [15]. The researcher did not, however, include any learning
    from past experience or historical data. An exponential moving average (EMA) spectrum
    sensing using energy prediction was implemented in [16]. The EMA achieved a prediction
    average error of 0.2436 with the assumption that the channel utilization follow
    exponential distribution with rate parameter A = 0.2 and signal to noise (SNR)
    of 10dB; RF real world data was not used in their study. Within this paper we
    demonstrate the use of an ANN for prediction of real world RF power of selected
    channels within the GSM band, VHF and UHF bands. An optimized ANN model was produced
    by combining the global search ability of deferential evolution (DE) algorithms
    and the local search advantages of back-propagation algorithms. The initial weights
    of the ANN were evolved using DE after which the ANN was trained (fine tune) more
    accurately using backpropagation algorithms. This methodology demonstrates the
    application of previously acquired real world data to enhance the prediction of
    RF power to assist the implementation of CR applications. SECTION III. Artificial
    Neural Network Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are composed of simple elements
    operating in parallel. These elements are inspired by biological nervous systems
    [17]. Due to the nonlinearity often associated with RF traffic pattern, coupled
    with random interfering signals or noise resulting from both artificial and natural
    sources, a fully connected multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN with two hidden layers
    was used in this study. The input layer was cast into a high dimensional first
    hidden layer for proper features selection. The activation functions used in the
    two hidden layers is nonlinear hyperbolic tangent function, and a linear symmetric
    straight line is used for the output activation function. Other activation functions
    were also used, but this selection gave a better promising results. These functions
    introduced a nonlinear transformation into the network. The hidden layers serve
    as a feature detector i.e. during the training; they learn the salient attributes
    (features) that characterizes the training data. The ANN is trained using differential
    evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms after which the weights are fine
    tuned using backpropagation algorithm. The synaptic weights and biases were updated
    every epoch to minimize the Mean Square Error (MSE). A supervised batch training
    method was used with 60% of the data used for training the ANN, 20% for validation
    and 20% for testing the trained ANN. Since the back propagation algorithm is used
    as a local searcher, the learning rate was kept low at 0.01. The inputs of the
    ANN consist of time domain data of varying rates of change i.e. second, minute,
    hour, week day (1 to 7), date day (1 to at most 31), week in a month (1 to 5),
    and month whilst the output gives the power in Decibels (dB). Each input enables
    the ANN to keep track with the trend of RF power variation as a function of that
    particular input. In this paper we designed three ANN models. The first model
    is shown in Fig 1; it consists of only one output neuron and is dedicated for
    power prediction of only one channel which implies that each channel will have
    its own dedicated ANN. The second model is depicted in Fig 2, it has only one
    output neuron but with additional inputs representing the channels. The output
    neurons of the third model is equal to the number of channels to be considered
    Fig 3. The data used in this study were obtained by capturing real world RF signals
    within the GSM 900, VHF and DHV TV bands and FM bands for a period of two months.
    In all the models, no RF power related parameters such as signal to noise ratio
    (SNR), bandwidth, and modulation type, are used as the input of the ANN. Thus
    making the models robust for cognitive radio application where the CR has no prior
    knowledge of these RF power related parameters. Four ANN topologies were considered:
    feed forward (FF), feed forward with output feedback (FFB), cascaded feed forward
    (CFF) and layered recurrent (LC) ANN. The accuracy and level of generalization
    of ANN depend largely on the initial weights and biases, learning rate, momentum
    constant, training data and also the network topology. In this paper, the learning
    rate and the momentum were kept constant at 0.01 and 0.008 respectively while
    the initial weights and biases were evolved using differential evolutionary and
    swarm intelligence algorithms. The initial weights and biases were randomly generated
    and constrained within the decision space of â2 to 2 using a toroidal bound. A
    population of 30 individuals or particles was maintained over 1000 generations.
    At the end of the generation, the ANN weights and biases were initialized using
    the candidate with the best fitness (candidate with the least MSE, obtain using
    test data) and then train further using backpropagation algorithm (BPA) to fine
    tune the weights as detailed in selection process IV-E. Thus producing the final
    optimized ANN model. Fig. 1. Dedicated ANN model for one channel Show All Fig.
    2. Multiple channels, single output ANN model Show All Fig. 3. Multiple channels,
    parallel outputs ANN model Show All SECTION IV. Optimization Algorithms A brief
    description of the optimization algorithms implemented are presented in this section.
    We combine the global search capability of population based differential evolutionary
    and swarm intelligence algorithms with the single solution local search advantages
    of BPA to evolve the weights and biases of the optimized ANN model as described
    in selection process, Section IV-E. A. Differential Evolution DE are population
    based direct search algorithms used to solve continuous optimization problems
    [18] [19]. DE aims at evolving NP population of D dimentional vectors which encodes
    the G generation candidate solutions X i,G ={ X 1 i,G ,â¯, X D i,G } towards the
    global optimum, where i=1,â¯,NP . The initial candidate solutions at G=0 are evolves
    in such a way as to cover the decision space as much as possible by uniformly
    randomizing the candidates within the search domain using (1). X i,G = X min +rand(1,0)â(
    X max â X min ) (1) View Source Where 1,â¦,NP.  X min ={ X 1 min â¯ X D min }, X
    max ={ X 1 max â¯ X D max } and rand(1, 0) is a uniformly distributed random number
    between 0 and 1. B. Mutation For every individuals (target vectors) X i,G at generation
    G , a mutant vector V i,G called the provisional or trial offspring is generated
    via certain mutation schemes. The mutation strategies implemented in this study
    are: DE/rand/1: V i,G = X r 1 ,G +Fâ( X r 2 ,G â X r 3 ,G ) (2) View Source DE/best/1:
    V i,G = X best,G +Fâ( X r 1 ,G â X r 2 ,G ) (3) View Source DE/rand-to-best/1:
    V i,G = X i,G +Fâ( X best,G â X i,G )+Fâ( X r 1 ,G â X r 2 ,G ) (4) View Source
    DE/best/2 V i,G = X best,G +Fâ( X r 1 ,G â X r 2 ,G )+Fâ( X r 3 ,G â X r 4 ,G
    ) (5) View Source Where the indexes r 1 , r 2 , r 3 and r 4 are mutually exclusive
    positive integers and distinct from i . These indexes are generated at random
    within the range [1 PN]. X best,G is the individual with the best fitness at generation
    G while F is the mutation constant. C. Cross over After the mutants are generated,
    the offspring U i,G are produced by performing a crossover operation between the
    target vector X i,G and its corresponding provisional offspring V i,G . The two
    crossover schemes i.e. exponential and binomial crossover are used in this study
    for all the DE algorithms implemented [20]. The binomial crossover copied the
    jth gene of the mutant vector V i,G to the corresponding gene (element) in the
    offspring U i,G if rand(0,1)â¤CR or j= j rand . Otherwise it is copied from the
    target vector X i,G (parent). The crossover rate CR is the probability of selecting
    the offspring genes from the mutant while j rand is a random number in the range
    [1 D ], this ensure that at least one of the offspring gene is copied from the
    mutant. The binomial crossover is represented as: U j i,G ={ V j i,G X j i,G if
    (rand (0, 1)â¤CR or j= j rand ) otherwise (6) View Source For exponential crossover,
    the genes of the offspring are inherited from the mutant vector V i,G starting
    from a randomly selected index j in the range [1 D ] until the first time rand(0,1)>CR
    after which all the other genes are inherited from the parent X i,G . The exponential
    crossover is as shown in section IV-D D. Exponential Crossover U i,G = X i,G  generate
    j=randi(1, D) U j i,G = V j i,G  k=1 View Source E. Selection Process The objective
    function in this study is the MSE of the optimized ANN computed using the test
    data. After every generation, each offspring U i,G and the corresponding parent
    X i,G are used to set the weights and biases of the ANN and the MSE of the ANN
    models are obtain using the test data. The use of the test data (data not known
    by the ANN nor used to train it) for computation of the fitness function (MSE)
    does not only result in a more accurate network but also a more robust and generalized
    ANN model. A greedy selection schemes is used in which if the MSE of the offspring
    is less than or equal to that of it parent, the offspring will replace the corresponding
    parent in the next generation otherwise the parent will be maintained among the
    next generation individuals. At the end of the generation, the most fittest individual
    (global best) i.e. the candidate with the least MSE among the final evolved solutions
    is used to initialize the weights and biases of the ANN which is further trained
    using back propagation algorithms (BPA) to fine tune the weights to produce the
    final optimized ANN model. The DE is run with 30 individuals for 1000 generations.
    The fine tuning of the ANN weights using BPA was constrained within a maximum
    of 200 epoch and 6 validation fails, i.e the training stop if any of these constrain
    thresholds is satisfy. The combination of the global search capabilities of DE
    and the local search advantages of BPA to evolve the weight and biases of ANN
    have proving to be superior to using only the famous BPA for this problem. The
    DE algorithm pseudocode is depicted in section IV-F F. Differential Evolution
    Pseudocode Generate an initial population X G=0 of Np individuals. Initialize
    ANN weights and biases with each solution in the population Np and Evaluate fitness
    (MSE) of each using the test data. Selection Process: Select the best between
    parent and offspring. Select the global best X gb (i.e. individual with the best
    fitness at the end of the budget (generation)), initialize the ANN weights and
    biases with X gb and train it (fine tune the weights) using BPA constrain within
    a maximum of just 200 epoch and 6 validation fails. This yield the final optimized
    ANN model. G. Comprehensive Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (clpso) Since
    this is a comparative study, we also consider two algorithms which are not based
    on DE schemes rather on swarm intelligence framework. These two particle swarm
    optimization (PSO) variants are: the standard PSO with inertia weight [21] and
    the CLPSO [22]. PSO emulates the swarm behavior of which each member of the swarm
    adapts it search path by learning from its own experience and other members''
    experiences. The velocity update of PSO and CLPSO are giving by (7) and (8) respectively.
    In the inertia weighted PSO, each of the particles learn from its local best pbest
    and the global best gbest. The parameters C 1 and C 2 are the acceleration constants
    that reflect the weighting of the stochastic acceleration term that pull each
    particle toward pbest and gbest respectively. The inertia weight w is used to
    facilitate both global and local search. Large w facilitate global search while
    smaller values favored local search. In this study w was made to decrease exponentially
    as the generation progresses. This approach facilitate global search within the
    early stage (generations) and then start to favor local search as the budget (generation)
    comes to an end. In standard PSO, all particles learn from it own pbest and gbest
    for all dimension. Constraining the social learning aspect to only the gbest lead
    to premature convergence of the original PSO. Since all particles in the swarm
    learn from the current gbest even if the gbest is very far from the global optimum,
    all the particles stand the risk of been attracted to gbest and get trapped in
    a local optimum especially when solving complex problems with numerous local optimums.
    To circumvent the problem of premature convergence associated with the standard
    PSO, a CLPSO was proposed [22]. In CLPSO, instead of particles learning from its
    pbest and gbest for all dimensions, and for all generations, each element (dimension)
    of a particle can learn from any other particle''s pbest including its own pbest.
    The decision on whether a particle''s dimension should learn from it own pbest
    or other particles'' pbest depends on probability P c called learning probability.
    Each particle has its own P c . For every dimension of particle i a random number
    in the range [0, 1] is generated, if this random number is greater than P ci ,
    the particular dimension will learn from its own pbest otherwise it will learn
    from another particle''s pbest. To ensure that at least one of the dimension of
    each particle learn from another particle''s pbest, if all dimensions happen to
    learn from it own pbest, one dimension is pick at random and two particles are
    pick at random from the population, the selected dimension will learn from the
    corresponding dimension of the particle with the best fitness (pbest). In this
    study, P ci is given by (9) base on an empirical rule stated in [22]. V d i+1

    (number of particles). SECTION V. Experiment and Simulation Data The datasets
    used in this study were obtained by capturing real world RF signals using universal
    software radio peripheral 1 (USRP 1) for a period of two months. The USRP are
    computer hosted software radios with one motherboard and interchangeable daughter
    board modules for various ranges of frequencies, these serve as the RF front end.
    Two daughter boards, SBX and Tuner 4937 DI5 3Ã7901, having a frequency ranges
    of 4MHz to 4.4GHz and 50 MHz to 860 MHz respectively, were used in this research.
    The daughterboard perform the function of down-conversion, filtering, analog to
    digital conversion (ADC) and other signal conditioning while the motherboard decimate
    the signal to a lower sampling rate that can easily be transmitted to the host
    computer through a high-speed USB cable where the signal is processed by software.
    For TV channels with channels bandwidth of 5MHz, we divided the channels into
    subchannels each consisting of 500 KHz bandwidth. To ensure that no spectral information
    was lost, we used a sample frequency of 1MHz and obtained 1024 samples for each
    sample time. For GSM 900 and FM band with a bandwidth of 200 KHz, we used 1MHz
    sample frequency and 512 samples for each sample time. The power was obtained
    using both the time and frequency domain data. For the frequency domain, after
    passing the signal through the channel filter, the signal was windowed using a
    hamming window in order to reduce spectral leakage. The stream of the data was
    converted to a vector and decimated. This is then converted to the frequency domain
    and the magnitudes of the bins were passed to a probe sink. The choice of probe
    sink is essential because it can only hold the current data and does not increase
    thereby preventing stack overflow or a segmentation fault. This allows Python
    to grab the data at run time for further analysis. The interval of time between
    consecutive sample data was selected at a random value between 5 seconds and 30
    seconds. The choice of this range is based on the assumption that for any TV programme,
    FM broadcast or GSM call will last for not less than 5 to 30 seconds. In order
    to capture all possible trends, the time between consecutive sample data is selected
    at random within the given range instead of using regular intervals. For the VHF
    and FM band we captured RF signals from 54MHz to 110MHz and 470 to 670MHz for
    the VHF TV bands. For the GSM band, 62 down-link channels (935MHz to 953.3MHz)
    and 62 uplink channels (890MHz to 908.3MHz) were captured. The real world RF data
    was divided into three subsets, randomly selected with 60% used for training the
    ANN, 20% for validation and 20% for testing the trained ANN model. The training
    or estimation data were the only known data sources used in training the ANN.
    The test data set was unknown to the network i.e. they are not used in training
    the network but are used in testing the trained ANN as a measure of the generalization
    performance of the ANN model. The ANN design, optimization and the simulation
    were done in Matlab while the capturing of the data and the signal processing
    were implemented using gnu-radio which is a combination of Python and C++ . SECTION
    VI. Results To minimize the MSE of the ANN when tested with the test data, the
    above listed algorithms were run for 30 independent runs. each run has been continued
    with 30000 fitness evaluations. A population of 30 individuals was maintained
    for 1000 generations. After a manual tuning of the parameters, the following parameters
    are used in this study: DE/rand/1/bin, DE/rand/1/exp, DE/best/1/hin, DE/hest/1/exp,
    DE/hest/2/hin, DE/hest/2/exp, DE/rand-to-best l1/hin and DE/rand-to-best/1/exp

    are shown in Table I. Table I. ANN models specification Table II shows the numerical
    results in terms of the MSE obtained using the test data (data not known by the
    ANN nor used in training the ANN). The final results of each algorithm was obtained
    by taken the average of the MSE (AMSE) for the 30 independent runs and their corresponding
    standard deviation (STD). From the results, DE/best/1/bin outperform all the other
    algorithms, hence it is used as the reference for the Wilcoxon test [23]. A â+â
    indicate that DE/best/1/bin outperform the other algorithm while â-â mean that
    the other algorithm outperform the reference. When the Wilcoxon test was perform
    by changing the reference algorithm, the second best algorithm for this problem
    is DE/RAND/1/bin follow by inertia PSO. Statistically inertia PSO is the third
    but the best model with the least MSE of 0.0272 was obtained from the combination
    of inertia PSO and BPA. To validate the fact that the combination of these population
    based variants of optimization algorithms with the famous BPA to evolves the weights
    and biases of ANN will produce a more accurate, robust and generalized model than
    using only BPA; we use the same topology but train with only BPA at constant learning
    rate of 0.01 and another one with varying learning rate starting from 0.8 and
    keep on changing with change in MSE using inbuilt Matlab training function traingda.
    For both models trained with only BPA, each was run 30 times, each run was constrain
    within a maximum of 1200 epoch and 6 validation fails, the average results is
    as shown in Table II. For the hybridized training i.e combining DE or PSO with
    BPA, the DE or PSO were run for 1000 generations and the final best solution was
    used to reinitialized the ANN weights and further train using BPA constrained
    within just 200 epoch and 6 validation fails. In all cases, the hybridize training
    outperform the training with only BPA. Fig 4, 5 and 6 shows the prediction graphs
    of some selected channels using test data. This results depict a good generalization
    of the three models. For this problem, the combination of global search capabilities
    of DE and swarm intelligence algorithms, and the local search advantages of BPA
    to evolve the weights of the ANN was found to yield an improved performance as
    compared to using only the famous BPA. Fig. 4. Feed forward dedicated model prediction

    This paper demonstrate that the accuracy and generalization of ANN can be improved
    by combining the global search advantages of population based optimization algorithms
    and the local search capability of single solution BPA. This study has unveiled
    the fact that we can combine population based solutions optimization algorithms
    with the famous single solution BPA to obtain a more robust ANN model than using
    only PBA. The prior knowledge of the RF power will enhance noisy channels avoidance
    not just in cognitive radio network but in any wireless communication thus delivering
    optimum QoS at less radio resources. Fig. 5. Cascaded feed forward, parallel output

    References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Cognitive radio (CR) technology
    has emerged as a promising solution to many wireless communication problems including
    spectrum scarcity and underutilization. The knowledge of Radio Frequency (RF)
    power (primary signals and/or interfering signals plus noise) in the channels
    to be exploited by CR is of paramount importance, not just the existence or absence
    of primary users. If a channel is known to be noisy, even in the absence of primary
    users, using such channels will demand large quantities of radio resources (transmission
    power, bandwidth, etc) in order to deliver an acceptable quality of service to
    users. Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques can be applied to these scenarios
    to predict the required RF power in the available channels to achieve optimum
    Quality of Service (QoS). While most of the prediction schemes are based on the
    determination of spectrum holes, those designed for power prediction use known
    radio parameters such as signal to noise ratio (SNR), bandwidth, and bit error
    rate. Some of these parameters may not be available or known to cognitive users.
    In this paper, we developed a time domain based optimized Artificial Neural Network
    (ANN) model for the prediction of real world RF power within the GSM 900, Very
    High Frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) TV bands. The application
    of the models produced was found to increase the robustness of CR applications,
    specifically where the CR had no prior knowledge of the RF power related parameters.
    The models used implemented a novel and innovative initial weight optimization
    of the ANN''s through the use of differential evolutionary algorithms. This was
    found to enhance the accuracy and generalization of the approach. Published in:

    Location: Bradford, UK SECTION I. Introduction Most of the licensed radio spectral
    are grossly underutilized while the unlicensed spectral are overcrowded. The present
    spectrum scarcity is the direct consequence of spectrum allocation policy and
    not the fundamental lack of spectrum. The first bands to be approved for CR communication
    by the US Federal Communication Commission (FCC) because of their gross underutilization
    in time, frequency and spatial domain are the very high frequency and ultra-high
    frequency (VHF/UHF) TV bands [1] [2]. This paper is focused on the study of real
    world RF power distribution in specific selected channels (54MHz to 110MHz, 470MHz
    to 670MHz, 890MHz to 908.3MHz GSM up-link, 935MHz to 953.3MHz GSM down-link) within
    the VHF/UHF bands and the GSM 900 band. In order to circumvent the problem of
    spectrum scarcity and underutilization, a new paradigm of wireless communication
    needs to be adopted. Advanced Cognitive Radio (CR) or Adaptive Spectrum Sharing
    (ASS) is one of the ways to optimize our wireless communications technologies
    for high data rates whilst maintaining user desired quality of service (QoS) requirements.
    CR is a radio equipped with the capability of awareness, perception, adaptation
    and learning of its radio frequency (RF) environment [3]; through which many of
    the digital signal processing that were traditionally done in hardware are implemented
    via software. Irrespective of the definition of CR, it has the followings basic
    characteristics: observation, adaptability and intelligence. CR is the key enabling
    technology for dynamic spectrum access and a promising solution for the present
    problem of spectrum scarcity and underutilization. Cognitive radio network consists
    of two users i.e. the primary users (PU) who are the incumbent licensed owners
    of the spectrum and the cognitive radio commonly called the secondary users (SU)
    who intelligently and opportunistically access the unused licensed spectrum on
    a no interference base i.e. when the licensed owners are not using the channel
    (the overlay) or SU can coexist with the PU as long as the interference to the
    PU is below a given threshold which will not be harmful to the PU nor degrade
    the QoS requirements of the PU (the underlay CR network scheme) [4] [1]. In this
    paper we combine the power of ANN and differential evolution (DE), and developed
    an optimized ANN model for the prediction of real world radio frequency (RF) power.
    The proposed algorithm used a priori data to enable the system to avoid noisy
    channels. The previous knowledge of the RF power allowed the cognitive radio to
    predictively select channels with the least noise among those that were unused
    or free. This would allow for a reduced utilization of radio resources including
    transmitted power and bandwidth, in turn maximizing the usage of the limited spectrum
    resources. The data used in this study was obtained by capturing real world RF
    data for two months using Universal Software Radio Peripheral 1 (USRP 1). The
    digital signal processing and capturing of the data were done using gnuradio which
    is a combination of Python and C++ while the ANN models and prediction were done
    in Matlab. The experiment was conducted at the Centre for Computational Intelligence,
    De Montfort University, UK, located very close to Leicester city centre. The rest
    of this paper is constructed of the following sections. Section II outlines previously
    presented research in this field focusing on the implementation of CI methods.
    This will be followed by Section III, section IV and V, that will present the
    methodology used within this research, the optimization algorithm and experiments
    carried out. The paper is concluded with Section VI, which discusses the results
    of the experiments, Section VII presents a summary of the work. SECTION II. Related
    Work There are different types of Computational Intelligence (CI) and machine
    learning that can be used in CR such as genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic system
    (FLS), neural network, hidden Markov model, game theory, linear regression and
    linear predictors, Bayesian inference based predictors, swamp intelligence, etc.
    Some for learning and prediction, some for optimization of certain transmission
    parameters while others for decision making [5] [6] [7]. Spectrum hole prediction
    using Elman recurrent artificial neural network (ERANN) was proposed in [8]. It
    uses the cyclostationary features of modulated signals to determine the presence
    or absence of primary signals while the input of the ERANN consists of time instances.
    The inputs and the target output used in the training of the ERANN and prediction
    were modeled using ideal multivariate time series equations and assumptions which
    are often different in real life where PU signals may be embedded in noise and/or
    interfering signals. The fact that spectrum holes were detected does not depict
    any information about the expected noise and/or level of interference based on
    the channels history which is vital in selecting the channels to be used among
    the unused channels. Traffic pattern prediction using seasonal autoregressive
    integrated moving-average (SARIMA) was proposed for reduction of SU hopping rate
    and interference effects on PU while maintaining a fare blocking rate [9]. The
    model (SARIMA) does not depict any information about the expected noise power.
    Transmission rate prediction using adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
    was proposed in [10]. This model is used to predict the data rate (6, 12, 24,
    36, 48 and 54 Mbps) that can be achieved in WLAN using a 802.11a/g configuration
    as a function of time. The training data was obtained by generating a random data
    rate with an assigned probability of occurrence at a given time instance, thereby
    forming a time series. In this paper, no real world data was used. Additionally,
    the research did not take into account the noise or interference level which can
    affect the predicted rates. Semi Markov model (SMM) and continuous-time Markov
    chain (CTMC) models have also been used for the prediction of packet transmission
    rates [11]. This avoids packet collisions by periodic spectrum sensing and prediction
    of temporal wireless local area network (WLAN) activities combined with hoping
    to a temporary inactive channel. However, no reference is made to the expected
    noise level among the inactive channels that are selected. Fuzzy logic (FL) is
    a CI method that can capture and represent uncertainty. As a result in has been
    used in CR research for decision making processes. An FL based decision system
    was modeled for spectrum hand-off decision-making in a context characterized by
    uncertain and heterogeneous information [12] and fuzzy logic transmit power control
    for cognitive radio. The proposed system was used for the minimization of interference
    to PU''s while ensuring the transmission rate and quality of service requirements
    of secondary users [13]. The researcher did not, however, include any learning
    from past experience or historical data. An exponential moving average (EMA) spectrum
    sensing using energy prediction was implemented in [14]. The EMA achieved a prediction
    average error of 0.2436 with the assumption that the channel utilization follow
    exponential distribution with rate parameter=0.2 and signal to noise (SNR) of
    10dB; RF real world data was not used in their study. Within this paper we demonstrate
    the use of an ANN for prediction of real world RF power of selected channels within
    the GSM band, VHF and UHF bands. An optimized ANN model was produced by combining
    the global search ability of differential evolution (DE) algorithms and the local
    search advantages of back-propagation algorithms (BPA). The initial weights of
    the ANN were evolved using DE after which the ANN was trained more accurately
    using back-propagation algorithms. This methodology demonstrates the application
    of previously acquired real world data to enhance the prediction of RF power to
    assist the implementation of CR applications. SECTION III. Methodology Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN) are composed of simple elements operating in parallel. These
    elements are inspired by biological nervous systems [15]. As a result of the nonlinearity
    often associated with RF traffic, coupled with erratic interfering signals or
    noise resulting from both natural and artificial sources, a fully connected multilayer
    perceptron (MLP) ANN with two hidden layers was used in this research. The input
    layer was cast into a high dimensional first hidden layer for effective features
    selection. A nonlinear hyperbolic tangent function was used for the activation
    functions of the two hidden layers while a linear symmetric straight line is used
    for the output activation function. Other activation functions were also used,
    but this combination gave the best results. These functions introduced a nonlinear
    transformation into the network. The hidden layers serve as a feature detector
    i.e. during the training they learn salient features that characterize the training
    samples. The ANN is trained using differential evolution (DE) and backpropagation
    algorithms (BPA). The synaptic weights and biases were updated every epoch to
    minimize the Mean Square Error (MSE). A supervised batch training method was adopted
    of which 60% of the data were used for training the ANN, 20% for validation and
    20% for testing the trained ANN. Since the back propagation algorithm is used
    as a local searcher, the learning rate was kept low at 0.01 for the model with
    constant learning rate while for the model with varying learning rate, the initial
    learning rate is 0.8 which changes with change in MSE. The inputs of the ANN consist
    of time domain data of varying rates of change i.e. second, minute, hour, week
    day (1 to 7), date day (1 to at most 31), week in a month (1 to 5), and month
    whilst the output gives the power in Decibels (dB). Each input enables the ANN
    to learn the trend of RF activities (RF power variation) as a function of that
    particular input. In this paper we designed three ANN models and evaluated their
    efficiency in terms of memory demand, training time, computational complexity
    and prediction accuracy/generalization. The first model is shown in Fig 1; it
    consists of only one output neuron and is dedicated for power prediction of only
    one channel which implies that each channel will have its own dedicated ANN. The
    second model is depicted in Fig 2, it has only one output neuron but with one
    additional input representing the channels. The third model has output neurons
    equal to the number of channels to be considered, this is shown in Fig 3. The
    data used in this paper were obtained by capturing real world RF signals in the
    GSM 900, VHF and UHV TV bands and FM bands for a period of two months. In all
    the models, no RF power related parameters such as signal to noise ratio (SNR),
    bandwidth, and modulation type, are used as the input of the ANN. This makes the
    models robust for cognitive radio application where the CR has no prior knowledge
    of these RF power related parameters. Four ANN topologies were used: feed forward
    (FF), feed forward with output feedback (FFB), cascaded feed forward (CFF) and
    layered recurrent (LC) ANN. The accuracy and level of generalization of ANN depend
    largely on the initial weights and biases, learning rate, momentum constant, network
    topology, and also the training data. In this paper, momentum was kept constant
    at 0.008 while the initial weights and biases were evolved using differential
    evolution variants i.e. DE/Rand/1/Exp and DE/Rand/1/bin. The initial weights and
    biases were randomly generated and constrained within the decision space of â2
    to 2 using a toroidal bound. A population of 30 was maintained over 1000 generations.
    30 parents and offspring were evolved every generation as described in the pseudocode,
    Section IV-B. The MSE obtained using the test data was used as our fitness function.
    The use of the test data (data not known by the ANN nor used to train it) for
    computation of the fitness function (MSE) does not only result in a more accurate
    network but also a more robust and generalized ANN model. The ANN weights and
    biases were initialized using each parent. The network is trained and the fitness
    of each parent is computed. This process is repeated using the offspring. If an
    offspring outperformed its parent, the particular parent is replaced by the offspring
    otherwise the parent will continue in the next generation. We use both binomial
    and exponential cross over for generating the offspring [16], with a cross over
    probability CR of 0.2. The mutation factor F was kept constant at 0.3. After 1000
    generations, the most fit candidate, the global best (this is defined as the candidate
    with the least MSE among the population) was selected. The weights and biases
    of the ANN was reinitialized with the global best and retrained (fine tune) using
    backpropagation algorithms to produce the final model. Fig. 1. Dedicated ANN model

    Optimization This section gives a brief description of the optimization algorithms
    implemented. We combine the global search capability of deferential evolutionary
    and algorithms with the local search advantages of BPA to evolve the weights and
    biases of the optimized ANN model as described in selection process, IV-B. A.
    Differential Evolution (DE) DE are population based direct search algorithms used
    to solve continuous optimization problems [17] [18]. DE aims at evolving NP population
    of D dimentional vectors which encodes the G generation candidate solutions X
    i,G ={ X iâG,â¯ X D iâG } towards the global optimum, where i=1,â¯,NP . The initial
    candidate solutions at G=0 are evolved in such a way as to cover the decision
    space as much as possible by uniformly randomizing the candidates within the search
    domain using (1). X i,G = X min +rand(1,0)â( X max â X min ) (1) View Source Where
    A=1,â¯,NP, X min ={ X 1 min â¯ X D min }, X max ={ X 1 max â¯ X D max } and rand(1,
    0) is a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1, X min and X max are
    the minimum and maximum of X respectively. 1) Mutation For every individuals (target
    vectors) X i,G at generation G 1 , a mutant vector V i,G called the provisional
    or trial offspring is generated via certain mutation schemes. The mutation strategy
    implemented in this study is DE/rand/1 (2) [18]. V i,G = X r 1 ,G +Fâ( X r 2 ,G
    â X r 3 ,G ) (2) View Source Where the indexes r 1 , r 2 , and r 3 are mutually
    exclusive positive integers and distinct from i while F is the mutation constant.
    B. Pseudocode Generate an initial population X G=0 of Np individuals. Initialize
    ANN weights and biases with each solution in the population Np and Evaluate fitness
    (MSE) of each using the test data. Select the global best X gb (i.e. individual
    with the best fitness at the end of the budget (generation)), initialize the ANN
    weights and biases with X qb and train it (fine tune the weights) using BPA constrain
    within a maximum of just 200 epoch and 6 validation fails. This yield the final
    optimized ANN model. SECTION V. Experiment and Simulation Data The datasets used
    in this study were obtained by capturing real world RF signals using universal
    software radio peripheral 1 (USRP 1) for a period of two months. The USRP are
    computer hosted software radios with one motherboard and interchangeable daughter
    board modules for various ranges of frequencies, these serve as the RF front end.
    Two daughter boards, SBX and Tuner 4937 DI5 3Ã7901, having a frequency ranges
    of 4MHz to 4.4GHz and 50 MHz to 860 MHz respectively, were used in this study.
    The daughterboard perform the function of down-conversion, filtering, analog to
    digital conversion (ADC) and other signal conditioning while the motherboard decimate
    the signal to a lower sampling rate that can easily be transmitted to the host
    computer through a high-speed USB cable where the signal is processed by software.
    For TV channels with channels bandwidth of 5MHz, we divided the channels into
    subchannels each consisting of 500 KHz bandwidth. To ensure that no spectral information
    was lost, we used a sample frequency of 1MHz and obtained 1024 samples for each
    sample time. For GSM 900 and FM band with a bandwidth of 200 KHz, we used 1MHz
    sample frequency and 512 samples for each sample time. The power was obtained
    using both the time and frequency domain data. For the frequency domain, after
    passing the signal through the channel filter, the signal was windowed using a
    hamming window in order to reduce spectral leakage. The stream of the data was
    converted to a vector and decimated. This is then converted to the frequency domain
    and the magnitudes of the bins were passed to a probe sink. The choice of probe
    sink is essential because it can only hold the current data and does not increase
    thereby preventing stack overflow or a segmentation fault. This allows Python
    to grab the data at run time for further analysis or to be saved. The power was
    not computed using gnuradio block rather the magnitude of the bins were saved
    so that it can be used for further analysis. The interval of time between consecutive
    sample data was selected at a random value between 5 seconds and 30 seconds. The
    choice of this range is based on the assumption that for any TV programme, FM
    broadcast or GSM call will last for between 5 to 30 seconds. In order to capture
    all possible trends, the time between consecutive sample data is selected at random
    within the given range instead of using regular intervals. For the VHF and FM
    band we captured RF signals from 54MHz to 110MHz and 470 to 670MHz for the VHF
    TV bands. For the GSM band, 62 down-link channels (935MHz to 953.3MHz) and 62
    uplink channels (890MHz to 908.3MHz) were captured. The real world RF data was
    divided into three subsets, randomly selected with 60% used for training the ANN,
    20% for validation and 20% for testing. The training or estimation data were the
    only known data sources used in training the ANN. The test data set was unknown
    to the network i.e. they are not used in training the network but are used in
    testing the trained ANN as a measure of the generalization performance of the
    ANN model. The ANN design and the simulation were carried out using Matlab while
    the capturing of the data and the signal processing were carried out using gnu-radio
    which is a combination of Python and C++. SECTION VI. Results From the results
    depicted, the three ANN models really adapt to the trends of variation of the
    RF power with good generalization. Table II shows the average results obtained
    by testing each ANN models on different channels selected at random within the
    studied bands, this demonstrates that the dedicated ANN model designed for the
    prediction of RF power in only one channel has the least MSE and is 82.55% more
    accurate than the EMA. The EMA was tested on data obtained from mathematical models
    which are often different from real world data. In this study, real world RF data
    was captured and used for the training and prediction yet it outperformed the
    EMA. The results depicted in Table II, Fig 4, Fig 5 and Fig 6 where obtained using
    the test data i.e. data that were not used in training the ANN nor known by the
    ANN, this implies that the models are well generalized. One of the drawbacks of
    the dedicated model is that each channel will have a separate ANN. To circumvent
    this problem, we developed two ANN models that can handle multiple channels, one
    with a single output while the other with parallel outputs. The single output
    gives the RF power of many channels but one at a time, it has an additional input
    for identification of the channels and only one output neuron. The one with parallel
    output gives the RF power of all the channels it has been trained to predict simultaneously,
    given a time domain input. The number of channels is equal to the number of output
    neurons. The multichannel models were trained to adapt to RF power of 20 channels
    and the results is as shown in Table II. In terms of accuracy, the parallel output
    is 19.69% more accurate than the single output but it demands more computer resources
    and computational complexity as it has many neurons than the single output model.
    The average MSE of the single output model is 0.0706 and that of the parallel
    model is 0.0567 for the 20 channels. The single output model and the parallel
    model are 71.01% and 76.72% more accurate than EMA respectively. The results discussed
    so far are based on the optimized ANN. Table II shows the improvement of the optimized
    ANN over the unoptimized model of the same topology. To validate the fact that
    the combination of these variants of DE optimization algorithms with the famous
    BPA to evolves the weights and biases of ANN will produce a more accurate, robust
    and generalized model than using only BPA; we use the same topology but train
    with only BPA at constant learning rate of 0.01 and another one with varying learning
    rate starting from 0.8 and keep on changing with change in MSE using inbuilt Matlab
    training function traingda. For both models trained with only BPA, each was run
    30 times, each run was constrained within a maximum of 1200 epoch and 6 validation
    fails, the average MSE (AMSE), standard deviation (STD) of the MSE, and the Wilcoxon
    test results are as shown in Table I. For the hybridized training i.e combining
    DE with BPA, the DE were run for 1000 generations and the final best solution
    was used to reinitialized the ANN weights and further train using BPA constrained
    within just 200 epoch and 6 validation fails. In all cases, the hybridize training
    outperform the training with only BPA. From the results, the combination DE/rand/1/bin
    and BPA yield a more promising results compare to DE/rand/1/exp for this problem,
    hence it is used as our reference for the Wilcoxon test [19], where + mean that
    the reference outperformed the other algorithm it is compared with as depicted
    in Table I. The Wilcoxon test shown in Table I was obtained using the ANN model
    depicted in Fig 1. When the ANN was trained with only DE/rand/l/bin, the AMSE
    is 0.2685, after it was fine tune with BPA, the AMSE reduces to 0.0338 which is
    better than 0.0441 obtained using only BPA. This improvement demonstrate that
    the prediction accuracy and generalization of ANNs largely depend on the initial
    weights and biases. This also implies that, the generalization and accuracy of
    ANN can be improved by combining the global search advantages of DE and the local
    search advantages of BPA. From our study, we discovered that the FM broadcast
    band is grossly underutilized. Only two channels of the entire band seem to be
    used in the geographic location of our study except for possible low power devices
    that may exist within the band. Drawing from our findings, we can conclude that
    the FM band is a potential candidate band for CR communication. The noise floor
    of the FM band seems to be high. Alternatively, the GSM band is heavily used.
    124 GSM channels were considered with 62 channels each for uplink and downlink.

    paper demonstrate the application of an enhanced ANN through the use of DE and
    BPA in comparison to using only BPA, and EMA; for the prediction of real world
    RF power. The paper also authenticated the fact that the accuracy and generalization
    of ANNs largely depends on the initial weights and biases. The prior knowledge
    of the RF power can enhance the ability to avoid noisy channels. This can lead
    to an optimum satisfaction of users through higher QoS with less radio resources.
    Also, the prior knowledge of the aggregate RF power will lead to optimum and efficient
    spectrum sharing and spectrum mobility in both overlay and underlay CR schemes.

    networks (CR-WSNs) are a type of WSNs that use cognitive radio technology to enhance
    the spectrum utilization and energy efficiency. This paper proposes an energy-efficient

    approach that leverages advanced technologies to optimize water usage in agricultural
    practices. With the increasing global demand for food production and the growing
    scarcity of water resources, efficient irrigation techniques are crucial for sustainable
    agriculture. Smart irrigation systems integrate various components, such as sensors,
    actuators, and data analytics, to enable precise monitoring and control of irrigation
    processes. These systems utilize a network of sensors to collect real-time data
    on environmental factors, soil moisture levels, and plant conditions [1]. The
    collected data are then analyzed and processed using sophisticated algorithms
    to determine the optimal amount and timing of water application. By considering
    factors such as weather conditions, crop requirements, and soil characteristics,
    smart irrigation systems can provide precise and targeted irrigation, minimizing
    water waste and maximizing crop yield [2,3]. One key advantage of smart irrigation
    is its ability to enable remote monitoring and control. Farmers can access the
    system through web-based platforms or mobile applications, allowing them to monitor
    field conditions and adjust irrigation schedules from anywhere at any time. This
    remote accessibility enhances operational efficiency and reduces the need for
    manual labor, saving time and resources. Moreover, smart irrigation systems can
    be integrated with weather forecasting systems to further enhance their effectiveness.
    By incorporating real-time weather data, these systems can adapt irrigation schedules
    based on predicted rainfall or temperature changes, ensuring optimal water usage
    and reducing reliance on manual adjustments. The benefits of smart irrigation
    extend beyond water conservation and crop productivity. By minimizing water usage,
    farmers can reduce their overall operational costs, improve energy efficiency,
    and mitigate environmental impacts, such as water pollution and soil erosion [1].
    A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a network of many low-cost and power-limited
    sensors that are distributed in an area to monitor and collect data about the
    physical or environmental conditions. The sensors are outfitted with a diverse
    array of monitoring capabilities, including temperature, humidity, pressure, light,
    sound, and motion. They establish wireless communication among themselves to establish
    a network. The collected data can then be processed, analyzed, and transmitted
    to a central control unit or a remote server for further processing and storage.
    The primary advantage of WSNs is their ability to provide a real-time, continuous,
    and fine-grained monitoring of the physical world, which can be used in many applications,
    such as environmental monitoring, smart cities, healthcare, industrial automation,
    and precision agriculture [4,5,6,7]. However, the design and deployment of WSNs
    pose several challenges, such as limited power, bandwidth, processing capabilities,
    communication and network management issues, security and privacy concerns, and
    the need for robust and energy-efficient algorithms and protocols. Nevertheless,
    the widespread use of WSNs is expected to grow in the future as the Internet of
    Things (IoT) continues to expand, providing new opportunities for innovation and
    improving the quality of life. Recently, several studies related to these challenges
    have been conducted [7,8]. Cognitive radio wireless sensor networks (CR-WSNs)
    are a type of WSNs that use CR technology to enhance the spectrum utilization
    and power conservation [9,10,11]. In CR-WSNs, the sensor nodes are equipped with
    cognitive radios that can sense the radio frequency (RF) spectrum and adapt the
    transmission parameters to avoid interference and optimize energy consumption.
    This allows CR-WSNs to operate in a dynamic and heterogeneous RF environment,
    where different types of wireless devices coexist and compete for limited spectrum
    resources. By using cognitive radio technology, CR-WSNs can achieve higher spectrum
    efficiency, better reliability, and longer network lifetime compared with traditional
    WSNs. CR-WSNs have various applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart
    irrigation, industrial control, healthcare, and smart cities, where reliable and
    energy-efficient wireless communication is critical [12,13,14]. In practical scenarios
    of CR networks, the estimation algorithm design can be affected by channel sensing
    uncertainty resulting from false alarms and misdetections. As a result, it is
    of interest to identify how estimation algorithm quality is affected by channel
    sensing errors. As such, this paper aims to investigate the impact of imperfect
    sensing on the performance of CR-WSNs. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
    (OFDM) [15] is widely regarded as a top contender for the physical layer of CR
    systems due to its flexible, reconfigurable subcarrier structure that enables
    easy adaptation and adjustment of system parameters. OFDM is also capable of avoiding
    interference through the addition of the cyclic prefix, and it offers large bandwidth
    efficiency through orthogonality, resilience to frequency-selective fading channels,
    and simplified equalizer design. However, OFDM is very sensitive to timing discrepancies
    due to synchronization error. The shortage of OFDM comes from high side lobes
    in filtersâ frequency response, which, in turn, lead to high interference between
    subcarriers, which is a major source that declines the performance of wireless
    communication systems [16,17,18]. In the current literature, optimizing the radio
    resources under power and interference constraints in the CR system remains an
    area of ongoing research. This paper seeks to enhance the SUâs average capacity
    with the consideration of quality of service (QoS) of the primary users (PUs).
    Hence, it is necessary to consider the interference produced by side lobes between
    primary users and secondary users. Additionally, the transmit power of each SU
    subcarrier can be adapted with the best possible resource allocation algorithm
    in order to not affect the PU while transmitting information. Unfortunately, there
    are few studies that have focused on this problem. Therefore, in this paper, the
    trade-off of increasing transmission capacity while maintaining an acceptable
    interference will be investigated. Resource allocation is a critical process that
    involves distributing resources, such as time, energy, bandwidth, and computational
    power, among competing demands. Efficient resource allocation is essential in
    various fields, including communication systems, transportation networks, manufacturing
    processes, and energy management [12,13]. Concerning WSNs, resource allocation
    is especially crucial since the resources available are typically limited, and
    the sensorsâ energy consumption must be optimized to prolong the networkâs lifespan.
    Proper resource allocation can lead to several benefits, such as improved system
    performance, reduced energy consumption, increased reliability, and enhanced scalability.
    Furthermore, resource allocation can help to ensure that critical tasks receive
    adequate resources, prevent network congestion, and reduce the risk of system
    failure. In summary, resource allocation is vital for optimizing the use of resources,
    achieving efficient operations, and achieving the desired system performance in
    various applications [19,20]. The resource allocation algorithm will take place
    after the SUs are allocated to the detected spectrum opportunities. Based on convex
    optimization techniques, we derive the resource allocation algorithm for the SU
    to achieve the highest capacity considering the interference constraint, along
    with the peak/average transmit power constraint of the SU. In summary, this work
    introduces the following contributions: (1) We present a practical scenario for
    CR-WSNs; then we investigate how imperfect channel sensing impacts the performance
    of CR-WSN-based systems. (2) We propose a resource allocation algorithm that aims
    to enhance the SU average capacity while ensuring that the interference level
    at the PU is below an acceptable level considering power constraint and ICI constraint.
    (3) To solve the above nonconvex optimization problem, the proposed algorithm
    is presented to search for the optimal transmit power of the SU. The detailed
    abbreviations and definitions used in this paper are listed in Table 1. Table
    1. List of abbreviations. The rest of the paper is presented according to the
    following sequence: The related work is presented in Section 2. The system model
    of CR-WSNs and presented channel sensing model are illustrated in Section 3. The
    proposed resource allocation and problem formulation are presented in Section
    4. Section 5 provides the simulation results and discussion. Finally, Section
    6 presents the conclusions. 2. Related Work In [12], the authors presented a resource
    allocation scheme that utilizes a Stackelberg game approach to optimize the SUsâ
    throughput while satisfying the PUâs interference constraint in a multiuser CR
    network. The authors in [13] proposed a resource allocation scheme for CR-WSNs
    that incorporates energy harvesting capabilities. The authors consider a CR-WSN
    with a single CR node and multiple energy harvesting nodes, and they express the
    resource allocation formula as an optimization problem that maximizes the network
    throughput subject to energy neutrality constraints for the energy harvesting
    nodes and interference constraints for the PUs. In [21], the authors proposed
    an effective resource allocation technique, namely, the Improved Pliable Cognitive
    Medium Access Protocol, designed to address the challenges of multilevel heterogeneity
    in CR-WSN. In [22], a computationally efficient resource allocation algorithm
    in a multi-carrier-based CR network is presented to maximize the system capacity.
    The assumption made in this work is to neglect the interference from PU to SU.
    The authors in [23] proposed a trajectory design and resource allocation scheme
    to maximize the achievable rate of an SU in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) CR
    system. They optimized the UAV trajectory, transmit power to satisfy practical
    constraints, and an interference temperature threshold. The work in [24] focuses
    on the achievable rate analysis and resource allocation of the cognitive low earth
    orbit (LEO) satellite system. Specifically, a joint power allocation scheme was
    proposed to maximize the sum rate of the IoT transmission subject to performance
    requirements and constraints of the legacy satellite system. The quasi-concave
    nature of the sum rate of the IoT users over the satellite terminal receive power
    was proved, which allows for optimal receive powers to be derived. An energy-efficient
    resource allocation approach in secure CR networks was presented in [25]. The
    paper introduces an ergodic secure energy efficiency problem for a CR network
    with a PU, an SU, and an eavesdropper, and presents a convex optimization problem
    for power allocation using fractional programming and dual decomposition techniques.
    The proposed approach aims to maximize the ergodic secure energy efficiency of
    the SU with constraints on the average interference power and average transmit
    power. In [26], the authors propose a resource allocation algorithm to improve
    the sum rate considering power and interference constraints using a Rayleigh fading
    channel. However, the scenario where the SUs communicate while facing channel
    sensing uncertainty has not been considered in any of these works. Therefore,
    we propose an energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm (EERAA) to enhance
    the average capacity and prolong the lifetime of a WSN-based smart irrigation
    system under realistic scenarios. In the proposed algorithm, power allocation
    and subcarrier assignment are performed sequentially. Our approach differs from
    that in [26] by considering the capacity reduction on all subcarriers occupied
    by a PU, rather than just on the first adjacent subcarrier to the SU. Furthermore,
    we employ a coarse approximation of the channelâs gain for the SU. The obtained
    results illustrate that the average capacity of SUs is close to that of the perfect
    channel knowledge scenario. 3. CR-WSN System Model A WSN-based smart irrigation
    system is a modern and innovative solution for efficient and sustainable agriculture.
    The system comprises a network of sensors that are deployed in the soil, plants,
    and environment to monitor and collect data related to soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, rainfall, and other relevant parameters. These data are then transmitted
    wirelessly to a central control unit that processes the data and triggers the
    irrigation system based on predefined thresholds and algorithms. The WSN-based
    smart irrigation system enables farmers to optimize water usage, increase crop
    yields, reduce water wastage, and lower energy costs. Additionally, it is easily
    expandable and can be adapted to achieve the specific requirements of various
    crops and farming practices. With the rise of climate change and water scarcity
    issues, WSN-based smart irrigation systems are becoming increasingly popular and
    essential for modern agriculture. The CR-WSN-based smart irrigation system model
    is illustrated in Figure 1 with an N cluster each with one cluster head (CH) and
    many sensor nodes spread over an area with size A. The transmission between the
    sensor nodes and the CH within the cluster is carried out using the unlicensed
    spectrum, while the transmission between the CH and the sink node takes place
    opportunistically through the licensed spectrum. The licensed spectrum that is
    being targeted includes M radio channels that exhibit varying PU communications
    and signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) [27]. Figure 1. CR-WSN-based smart irrigation
    system model. Channel Sensing The first step involves using CH nodes (i.e., SUs)
    to sense the transmission channel, to decide whether it is currently available
    or busy by a PU. Energy detection methods are commonly used for this purpose,
    especially when the transmission modes of PUs are unknown. Assuming that ð¦ ð represents
    the PUâs signal at a specific location, and ð ð represents Gaussian white noise
    with a mean of zero and a variance of ð 2 ð for all ð , the CHâs measurement can
    be denoted as ð¸ ð . For each CH, a spectrum sensing function is defined by establishing
    two hypotheses according to the measurement. In this mathematical expression,
    the hypothesis checking for the channel sensing problem is performed over M symbol
    periods and can be expressed as follows [9]: ð» 0 : ð¸ ð = ð ð ð=1,2,3â¦..ð (1) ð»
    1 : ð¸ ð = ð¦ ð +ð ð ð=1,2,3â¦..ð (2) In Equation (1), ð» 0 means that the PU signal
    is absent, while in Equation (2), ð» 1 means that the PU is present and using the
    channel. The M received signal sample points are gathered by cognitive nodes (CH),
    allowing for the detection statistics for energy detection to be expressed in
    the following manner: ð¸= 1 ð â ð=1 ð | ð§ ð | 2 (3) If we assume that | ð¸ ð | 2
    with ð=1,â¦..,ð is composed of independently and identically distributed random
    variables, to verify the mean E for large values of M, we can use the central
    limit theorem. This is demonstrated in [26] as: ð¼{ð}={ ð 2 ð ,ââââð¢ðððð  ð» 0 ð
    2 ð  + ð 2 ð ,ââð¢ðððð  ð» 1 (4) where ð 2 ð  represents the PUâs signal variance.
    It should be emphasized that the reliability of spectrum sensing is evaluated
    using two metrics: the first metric is the probability of detection ð ð , which
    refers to the probability of an SU detecting the presence of a PU when the spectrum
    is actually used by the PU. The second metric is the false alarm probability ð
    ð , which represents the probability of an SU detecting the presence of a PU when
    the channel is free [9]. For instance, if ð» 0 is the true hypothesis, then P{
    ð» 1 Ì | ð» 0 } indicates the probability of a false alarm. 4. The Proposed Resource
    Allocation Concerning CR-WSNs, our attention is directed to both energy consumption
    and SU average capacity, which depends on its resource allocation scenario done
    by CH nodes. This paper proposes a resource allocation algorithm that maximizes
    the average capacity, taking into account both power constraint and interference
    constraint [28]. Therefore, the energy consumption and ICI optimization are strongly
    interconnected with each other in this case, making it difficult to solve it in
    general. To solve this issue, the successive convex optimization technique presented
    in [29] is applied. We consider CR-WSNs with spectrum sharing between PUs and
    SUs as illustrated in Figure 2, with the allocation of the PU (labelled â1â) and
    spectrum holes (denoted by â0â) with cluster number ð ð =48 and ð¹ ð = 18 subcarriers
    in each hole. We have utilized the unambiguous interference formulas of OFDM,
    which previously obtained in [30] and selected the cluster number and size based
    on the realistic values of WiMAX 802.16. Figure 2. Allocation of primary users
    and available subcarriers considering 18 subcarriers allocated to each free sub-band.
    One or more interferences can exist within a single spectrum hole, as illustrated
    in Figure 2, where PUs and SUs utilize neighboring frequency bands. We assume
    that the ICI exists from the PU to the CH due to frequency offset. Based on the
    OFDM ICI tables obtained in [31], it was observed that â8â subcarriers (OFDM)
    induce the ICI to the channel. In cases where a sequence of intricate symbols
    is transmitted, the interference caused by a single subcarrier is the total of
    interference across all the time slots. For the subsequent analysis, we define
    the eight-element interference vectors of OFDM as designed in [32]. ð ðððð = 10
    â2 Ã[8.94,2.23,0.995,0.560,0.359,0.250,0.184,0.112] (5) One formulation of the
    problem faced by the SU is to enhance the sum data rate through power allocation
    in the detected spectrum holes: max ð :ð¶(ð)= â ð¢=1 ð â ð=1 ð¹ ð ððð 2 â¡ â£ â¢ â¢ 1+

    ð¼ ð¡â (9) In Equation (9), ð represents the number of spectrum holes, while ð¹ ð
    , ð ð¢ð ð  , ðº ð¢ð ð ð  , and ð¼ ð¢ ð denote the subcarrier number, SU power, CIR gain
    from the SU to its base station, and ICI from the PU to the SU on the ð ð¡â subcarrier
    in the ð¢ ð¡â spectrum hole, respectively. The variables ð ð¡â and ð ð ð¢ð are the
    extreme user power boundary and power limit per subcarrier, respectively. The
    interference vector ð length is represented by ð ð , ð ð¢ð(ð) ð  is the SUâs power
    on the right (left) ð ð¡â subcarrier in the ð¢ ð¡â spectrum hole, ðº ð¢ð ð ð is the
    gain of the propagation channel from the CH to the primary system on the right
    (left) PUâs subcarriers neighboring the ð¢ ð¡â spectrum hole, and ð¼ ð¡â represents
    the interference threshold. The last constraint is to protect the PU transmission,
    which needs that the received interference power at the PU due to the CH transmission
    is below a prescribed threshold. The interference from the primary system to the
    CH, ð¼ ð¢ ð , is written as in Equation (10): ð¼ ð¢ ð = â§ â© â¨ î î î î î î î î î î

    and ðº ð¢ð(ð) ðð  represent the primary user transmitted power and channel gain existing
    at the right (left) of the ð¢ ð¡â spectrum hole to the SU on the ð ð¡â subcarrier
    of the ð¢ ð¡â spectrum hole, respectively. Our optimization problem in (6) is formulated
    as a concave function, while the constraints in (7)â(9) are linear, making it
    a convex optimization problem. This problem can be efficiently solved using several
    linear programming (LP) methods, such as the CVX-SDPT3 toolbox [28]. The algorithmâs
    details are summarized in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 The procedure of the CVX optimization
    algorithm 1: InputâSet the channel gains, the maximum user power ð ðð and power

    problem (6) for given constraints in (7)â(9). 3: OutputâThe optimum power for
    all subcarriers. 5. Simulation Results and Discussion The following section illustrates
    the obtained results that assess the performance of the EERAA algorithm in the
    presence of imperfect channel sensing. The probability of primary usersâ presence
    is 0.25, i.e., P{ð» 1 }=0.25 and P{ð» 0 }=0.75 . The EERAA algorithm is validated
    through Monte Carlo simulations over a frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel
    between the secondary transmitter and receiver. The simulations consider 256 subcarriers
    and QPSK modulation. Figure 3 presents the bit error rate (BER) performance of
    the proposed EERAA algorithm versus ð¸ ð / ð 0 compared with the scenario of no
    sensing errors. The perfect estimation has the same performance as the case with
    no sensing errors, which indicate the validation of the proposed algorithm. The
    simulation also considers different levels of sensing errors. The results indicate
    that the BER performance degrades as the sensing errors increase. When the probability
    of detection ð ð drops from 1 to 0, the BER performance is affected. Figure 3.
    The impact of sensing errors on BER of the proposed EERAA algorithm considering
    different scenarios of sensing errors. Figure 4 presents a BER performance comparison
    among the proposed EERAA algorithm, the joint resource allocation (JRA) [33],
    and resource allocation with sensing-based interference (RASI) [12] algorithms.
    It is clear that the EERAA algorithm gives the better performance compared with
    the other algorithms. Figure 4. BER comparison among the proposed EERAA, RASI
    [12], and JRA [33]. The following Figure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate the performance
    evaluation of the proposed resource allocation algorithm based on the average
    spectral efficiency. Figure 5 depicts the scenario where an SU, utilizing F available
    subcarriers, is surrounded by subcarriers allocated to the PU, causing interference
    from both sides. In this case, the SUâs spectral efficiency values show an improvement
    compared with the initial allocation. The power allocation algorithm attempts
    to avoid subcarriers adjacent to the PU, leading to the localization of power
    allocation in the middle of the spectrum hole. Figure 5. Common channel scenarios
    in the case of a single user and F = 18. Figure 6. SUâs averaged capacity versus
    total power. Figure 6 demonstrates the impact of the maximum power levels. The
    graph in Figure 6 clearly shows that increasing the average power per subcarrier,
    denoted as P, results in higher spectral efficiencies (ð= ð ð¡â /ð¹) . It is also
    clear that the performance of the proposed EERAA algorithm can be observed to
    approach that of the perfectly known channel scenario. Figure 7 illustrates the
    impact of the number of subcarriers on the SUâs averaged capacity. The performance
    of OFDM increases as the number of subcarriers increases. Additionally, it is
    worth noting that the performance of the proposed algorithm approximates the performance
    of the perfectly estimated case. Figure 7. SUâs averaged capacity versus number
    of subcarriers. Figure 8 illustrates energy consumption per node in terms of number
    of clusters and network size. It is evident from this figure that, as the number
    of clusters increases, the energy consumption decreases. It is also clear that
    the energy consumption of WSN with the proposed algorithm is approximately three
    times lower than the conventional WSN that does not use the proposed algorithm.
    Figure 8. Energy consumption versus number of clusters and network size. 6. Conclusions
    This paper presented an EERAA algorithm for CR-WSN-based smart irrigation systems.
    The proposed algorithm addresses the challenge of prolonging the WSNâs lifetime
    by reducing energy consumption while achieving high secondary usersâ average capacity.
    The algorithm performs power allocation and subcarrier assignment sequentially
    and considers the effect of ICI. We formulated the maximization of system capacity
    under realistic scenarios with power and interference constraints. Simulation
    results indicate that the proposed EERAA algorithm outperforms the conventional
    approaches by reducing network energy consumption by up to 30% while maintaining
    high average capacity. The numerical analysis and simulation results confirm that
    EERAA can prolong the lifetime of WSN-based smart irrigation systems and enhance
    their energy efficiency. In conclusion, the proposed EERAA algorithm can effectively
    address the energy efficiency and spectrum utilization challenges in CR-WSN-based
    smart irrigation systems. This research provides a valuable contribution towards
    achieving sustainable agricultural practices by developing efficient resource
    allocation algorithms for smart irrigation systems. Future research can explore
    the implementation of the proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios and evaluate
    its performance in various wireless communication applications. Future research
    directions can further investigate the integration of advanced machine learning
    techniques into the proposed EERAA algorithm for CR-WSN-based smart irrigation
    systems. This can involve exploring the use of reinforcement learning or deep
    learning algorithms to enhance the adaptive and autonomous decision-making capabilities
    of the system. Additionally, the scalability and robustness of the algorithm can
    be studied in larger-scale deployments and under diverse environmental conditions.
    Furthermore, the investigation of novel sensor technologies and network architectures
    can also contribute to the advancement of CR-WSNs in smart agriculture. By addressing
    these research areas, we can pave the way for more efficient and sustainable agricultural
    practices while ensuring optimal resource utilization and environmental conservation.

    Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN) are the natural extensive of wireless
    sensor networks (WSN). The majority of sensor nodes, including their means of
    transmitting and receiving, are deployed completely below the ground for WUSN.
    As a promising underground sensing technique, WUSN has the advantages of concealment,
    ease of deployment, timeliness of data, reliability and coverage density (Akyildiz
    and Stuntebeck, 2006). In recent years, WUSN has been employed to the smart sensing
    of underground infrastructures and their adjacent underground environments. WUSN
    is already widely used in the monitoring of underground coal mines (Wu et al.,
    2010, Kennedy and Bedford, 2014), transportation tunnels (Bennett et al., 2010,
    Stajano et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2020) and utility tunnels (Huang et al., 2019,
    Zhou et al., 2020). Both the structural health condition of underground structures
    and the underground environments such as temperature, humidity, gas concentrations
    can be monitored using relevant wireless sensors. The wireless signals in these
    scenarios still transmit in air. Differently, the wireless signals transmit in
    dielectric soil medium and thus undergo much larger attenuation for WUSN in some
    other applications. For example, WUSN is used to detect the fluid leakage of buried
    pipeline (Lin et al., 2019). Leakage localization algorithms are also proposed
    based on different sensing parameters and types of pipeline (Abdelhafidh et al.,
    2018). Other applications are like soil moisture monitoring (Bogena et al., 2009,
    Bogena et al., 2010, Di Fusco et al., 2018), soil permittivity estimation (Salam
    et al., 2019b) and seismic mapping (Saeed et al., 2019). This paper only focuses
    on the signal propagating in soil medium. It is a great challenge to estimate
    the signal path loss for WUSN due to the complex signal propagation mechanism
    and complex soil dielectric behavior (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006). A reliable
    and accurate path loss estimation method is needed in the design stage to determine
    the maximum internode distance and network topology (Akyildiz et al., 2009). In
    the deployment of WUSN system, the signal path loss is used to estimate the received
    signal strength. Whatâs more, signal path loss estimation is crucial to node connectivity
    analysis during the operation of WUSN system (Sun et al., 2011, Trang et al.,
    2018). Based on the estimated path loss, the sensor can adaptively select the
    energy-saving transmission configuration to prolong the network lifetime. There
    are some analytical models for characterizing the signal propagation in soils.
    However, analytical models are not easy to use in complex scenarios such as multi
    ground layers and existence of underground structures (Mekid et al., 2017). Therefore,
    this paper aims to develop a comprehensive numerical model to directly obtain
    the total signal path loss between two sensor nodes. In the numerical model, the
    details of wireless sensor node such as the antenna size, antenna orientation
    are modelled. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Part 2, related
    works will be reviewed concerning the existing analytical propagation models;
    In Part 3, a refined numerical model for simulating the signal propagation is
    developed in commercial software FEKO (FEldberechnung bei KÃ¶rpern mit beliebiger
    OberflÃ¤che) and the numerical model is validated using outdoor signal transmission
    tests; In Part 4, the effect of soil physical properties, signal frequency, antenna
    orientation and soil heterogeneity on signal path loss are parametrically studied;
    In Part 5, several conclusions are provided. 2. State of arts Communication channels
    of WUSN need to be clarified before the introduction of signal propagation models.
    There are three types of communication channels for WUSN as shown in Fig. 1, Underground
    to Underground (UG2UG), Underground to Aboveground (UG2AG) and Aboveground to
    Underground (AG2UG). For UG2AG and AG2UG channels, wireless electromagnetic (EM)
    signals transmit both in air and soil medium. EM waves reflect at the soil-air
    interface, which causes additional signal path loss. For UG2UG channels, EM waves
    propagate in the soil medium throughout the transmission path. Therefore, three
    types of signal propagation can be characterized from the communication channels.
    Type (I): signal propagation in air; Type (II): signal propagation in soil medium;
    Type (III): signal propagation at the soil-air interface. Friis equation can be
    used to model the EM waves propagation in air (Li et al., 2007). Fresnel equation
    can calculate the signal path loss at the soil-air interface due wave reflection
    or refraction (Bogena et al., 2009). Download : Download high-res image (121KB)

    for WUSN. To the best of the authorsâ knowledge, three categories of single path
    propagation models in soils have been reported as shown in Table 1. The first
    category is the series of Modified Friis models. This series began with the conventional
    Modified Friis model proposed by Akyildiz et al. (2009). NC Modified Friis model
    proposed by Nchimunya et al. (2010) took account of the signal attenuation induced
    by wave reflection and refraction. Soil complex dielectric constant (CDC) model
    was incorporated into single path propagation models to consider the effect of
    soil physical conditions. Peplinksi model was adopted in Conventional and NC Modified
    Friis models. Other models in this series adopted different methods, such as TDR
    (Time Domain Reflectometry) measurements (Sadeghioon et al., 2017) or MBSDM (Mineralogy-Based
    Soil Dielectric Model) (Sambo et al., 2019), to predict the soil CDC. The Modified
    Friis based models are only valid in the far field region of antenna, which is
    often neglected in the past studies. Table 1. Signal propagation models in soils.
    Propagation models CDC prediction Antenna field region Modified Friis Conventional
    Modified Friis (Akyildiz et al., 2009) Peplinski model NC Modified Friis (Nchimunya
    et al., 2010) Peplinski model Far field TDR Modified Friis (Sadeghioon et al.,
    2017) TDR measurement MBSDM Modified Friis (Sambo et al., 2019) MBSDM CRIM Fresnel
    (Bogena et al., 2009) CRIM Near field Two stage model (Huang et al., 2020) TDR
    measurement Whole field Note: the near field and far field of antenna is determined
    using the far field distance df. df is determined by the following equation, where,
    D is the antenna dimension, Î» is the signal wavelength. The second category is
    CRIM Fresnel model proposed by (Bogena et al., 2009). This is a semi-empirical
    model combining the Fresnel equation in the near field of antenna and the CDC
    model of Complex Refractive Index Model (CRIM). Different from Modified Friis
    model, CRIM Fresnel is only valid in the near field of sensor node antenna. The
    third kind of propagation model is Two-stage model proposed by Huang et al. (2020).
    The two-stage model considered the field characteristic of senor node antenna
    and combined the advantages of Modified Friis model and Fresnel model. However,
    there is a fitting parameter m used to characterize the field characteristics
    is related to soil types and can hardly be determined before experiment. The three
    channels in Fig. 1 can be investigated based on single path loss models. The UG2AG
    and AG2UG channel are usually described by one model. Such models like ZS Free
    space-Modified Friis based model (Sun et al., 2011), XD Free space-Modified Friis
    based model (Dong et al., 2013) and WUSN-PLM (Sambo et al., 2020) have been reported.
    For UG2UG channel, two-path model (Vuran and Akyildiz, 2010), 3 W (3 waves) model
    (Dong and Vuran, 2011, Salam et al., 2020) and WUSN-PLM (Sambo et al., 2020) are
    reported from literatures. From the review of related works, the existing propagation
    models have some challenges in predicting the signal path loss in soils. In those
    analytical or semi-empirical models, the sensor nodes are always assumed as points
    which have the ability of transmitting or receiving wireless signals. The specific
    conditions of sensor nodes such as antenna size, antenna orientation and node
    size are neglected. Besides, the existing models are all developed in homogenous
    soils and difficult to use in heterogeneous soils. This paper aims to address
    the two shortcomings of the existing propagation models by developing a refined
    numerical model to simulate the signal propagation. 3. Numerical simulation of
    signal propagation considering detailed node structure 3.1. Numerical model setup
    in FEKO Numerical simulation of wireless signal propagation from one sensor node
    to another is a typical computational electromagnetic problem. In this paper,
    Methods of Moments (MoM) based software FEKO is chosen to simulate wireless signal
    propagation in soils. MoM solve the integral Maxwellâs equations shown as in Eq.
    (1). (1) where, E is the electric field, B is the magnetic field, Ï is the electric
    charge density, J is the electric current density, Î¼ is the media permeability,
    Îµ is the media permittivity, Î© is any volume with closed boundary surface âÎ©,
    Î£ is any surface with closed boundary curve âÎ£. The integral Maxwellâs functions
    are only concerning the electric field E and magnetic field B at the boundary
    âÎ© and âÎ£. The investigated region is meshed only at the boundary. MoM solves
    the electric source Ï and J at the boundary by assuming basic interpolation functions
    in discretized subdomains and transform the integral Maxwellâs equations into
    linear algebra equations (Rao et al., 1982). MoM is a âsource methodâ and very
    suitable for simulating open boundary radiating structures. Compared to âfield
    methodsâ, such as Finite Element Method (FEM), the free-space region between the
    radiating structures do not need to discretized using MoM. Boundary conditions
    are automatically fulfilled, and memory requirements are determined by the scale
    of geometry boundary and the required solution frequency. Besides MoM, FEM is
    also incorporated into FEKO. MoM and FEM can be collaborated in the same simulation.
    Therefore, FEKO have enough accuracy and efficiency in both electrically large
    and small size problem (Jakobus and Smith, 2012). Furthermore, FEKO is capable
    of solving computational electromagnetic problems in nonhomogeneous media. 3.1.1.
    The structure of sensor node for WUSN The sensor node for WUSN is different from
    that for WSN due to the change of working environment. The signal frequency of
    EM wave is lowered to reduce the path loss in soils. The previous works show that
    433 MHz is the optimal frequency to minimize the signal path loss for WUSN (Li
    et al., 2007). The antenna size is then determined according to the signal operating
    frequency. The monopole antenna is widely used for wireless sensor node as it
    is the simplest omnidirectional antenna. The largest linear dimension of monopole
    antenna can be decided as (Huang, 2021). (2) where D is the largest linear dimension
    of monopole antenna, Î» is the signal wavelength which is determined by Î» = c /
    f, c is the light velocity in vacuum, f is the signal frequency. The size of the
    monopole antenna with the center frequency of 433 MHz is 0.173 m obtained from
    Eq. (2). A real monopole antenna is illustrated in Fig. 2. Download : Download

    3 is the prototype of buried wireless sensor node developed by Tongji University
    and Wisen Innovation Ltd together. The sensor node is composed of fours parts:
    antenna is responsible for transmitting and receiving signals; sensor board is
    responsible for sensing and processing; battery is the energy source for the whole
    system; coaxial feeder connects the antenna to sensor board. The four parts are
    encapsulated in a PVC box for the isolation of the surrounding soils and underground
    water. Any other types of buried sensor node may have different structures, the
    basic four parts are generally needed. The refined numerical simulation of this
    paper will be all founded on the prototype given in Fig. 3. Download : Download

    the sensor node According to the detailed structure of buried sensor node, the
    numerical model is developed in FEKO as shown in Fig. 4. The PVC box has a dimension
    of 200 mm in length, 120 mm in width and 80 mm in height. The thickness of the
    PVC box is 5 mm. The PVC box is modelled as a hollow cuboid in FEKO using the
    given dimensions. The material of PVC is electrically simulated using a dielectric
    medium with the dielectric constant of 4.0 while it has zero electrical conductivity.
    EM waves reflect and refract at the air-box and soil-box interface. Therefore,
    wireless signal has attenuation when transmits through the PVC box and this attenuation
    is denoted as Pbox. Download : Download high-res image (204KB) Download : Download

    sensor board is modelled as a rectangular perfect electrical conductor (PEC) with
    a size of 87.6 mm Ã 88.9 mm. The sensor board is served as the ground plane for
    the monopole antenna. Ideally, the monopole antenna is equivalent to a dipole
    antenna if the ground plane is infinite (Huang, 2021). For the finite sensor board
    inside a real sensor node, the length and width make a difference to the antenna
    characteristics. The signal attenuation caused by sensor board compared to an
    ideal dipole antenna is denoted as Pboard. The monopole antenna is modelled using
    a PEC cylinder with a radius of 2.5 mm and length of 173 mm. The antenna is connected
    to sensor board via coaxial feeder. Coaxial feeder is composed of inner conductor,
    outer conductor and an insulating layer between two conductors. The inner conductor
    is connected to the sensor board on one end and to the monopole antenna on the
    other end as shown in Fig. 5. The waveguide port is adopted to excite the coaxial
    feeder in the numerical model. The waveguide port is located at the end surface
    of insulating layer. EM wave is guided inside the insulating layer limited by
    surrounding two conductors once the port is excited. As the coaxial feeder is
    connected to antenna, EM wave is then radiated into the space via the monopole
    antenna. Download : Download high-res image (169KB) Download : Download full-size

    inside the sensor node due to the great desire of power. Four batteries are modelled
    as four same cylinders in the used prototype. The dimension of each battery is
    15.5 mm in radius and 61 mm in height. The surfaces of the cylinders are modelled
    as PEC as the surface of battery is made by conductive metal. The existence of
    four batteries will affect the signal propagation and batteries induced signal
    attenuation is denoted as Pbattery. After the geometry modelling of the sensor
    node, mesh is needed to perform computational electromagnetic calculation. Fig.
    6 shows the mesh of the sensor node in FEKO. Four global mesh sizes: Fine, Standard,
    Coarse and Custom can be chosen for the mesh. Triangle element is adopted as the
    Method of Moments will be used in the simulation. An auto mesh technique is employed
    in FEKO once the global mesh size is decided for simulation. As shown in Fig.
    6, the auto mesh technique has a very good adaptability for different distance
    to the port. Mesh is automatically densified near the port while gradually become
    coarse with the increasing of the distance to the port. The mesh has 6765 triangle
    elements overall for one sensor node at the coarse mesh size level as shown in
    Fig. 6(a). If the global mesh size is set as standard level, the total mesh elements
    will expand to 11,985 as given in Fig. 6(b). From the comparison of different
    global mesh size level, the mesh size near the port is the same and the mesh size
    is smaller at the far distance to the port for standard mesh level. The solution
    method is MoM with surface equivalence principle for the whole numerical model.

    Numerical modelling of the signal propagation between two nodes Fig. 7 gives the
    overview of how the wireless signal propagation between two sensor nodes are modelled
    in FEKO. Sensor Node1 and Node2 are placed at a certain signal propagation distance
    in the vertical direction. The distance between two ports is denoted as the node
    distance d. Take the signal transmits from Node1 and receives at Node2 as example
    to illustrate the propagation process. A waveguide excitation is given to the
    port 1 of Node 1. The antenna of Node1 transforms the excitation into EM waves
    and radiating into the surrounding space. Once the antenna of Node2 receives the
    radiating EM waves, it transforms the EM waves into excitation. This excitation
    can be received by port 2 of Node2. The total signal attenuation, namely path
    loss, can be obtained from analyzing the energy difference of the two ports. S-parameter
    S21 measures the energy difference between port 1 and port 2. FEKO can solve the
    scattering problem and directly output the S-parameter. Download : Download high-res

    and receiving mechanism between two nodes. Ground is introduced into the model
    covering the two nodes and the ground is modelled as homogenous dielectric lossy
    medium. Equivalent complex dielectric constant Îµeff (Îµâ²-jÎµâ³) are key parameters
    to model the dielectric and lossy behavior of soils. In real-life application,
    ground is infinite in dimension. However, the numerical model cuts off at the
    boundaries to make the simulation possible. A cylinder boundary is chosen in this
    paper. The boundary conditions are automatically fulfilled as the MoM is adjusted
    from Boundary Element Method (BEM). The horizontal distance of the sensor node
    to the model boundary is r and distance to top or bottom boundary is h as shown
    in Fig. 8 (a). Mesh of the numerical model is given in Fig. 8 (b) from a cut plane
    view. Automatic mesh technique and coarse mesh size level are adopted in the simulation.

    for wireless signal propagation in soils. It is easy to see that model boundary
    is crucial for the reasonability and applicability of developed numerical model.
    Fig. 9 aims to investigate the boundary effect on the simulated signal path loss
    for soils with variated electrical properties and different node distance. Fig.
    9 tells that the distance of buried sensor node to the top and bottom boundary
    h does not the influence the signal path loss. Therefore, the h value is set as
    0.6 m for the consideration of computational cost. The radius r of the numerical
    model has an obvious effect on the path loss. To obtain a stable model response,
    r value needs to be large enough. From the four groups of calculation in Fig.
    9, the minimum value of a required model radius is correlated to the signal wavelength
    in soils Î»c. Î»c is determined as follows (Shi et al., 2021), (3) where, Î² is the
    phase shifting constant of soil, which is determined by (Akyildiz et al., 2009)
    (4) where, f is the signal frequency, Î¼ is the magnetic permeability in soils
    which equals to the magnetic permeability in vacuum Î¼0, Îµ0 is the vacuum dielectric
    constant, Îµâ² is the real part of relative complex dielectric constant of soils,
    Îµâ³ is the imaginary part of relative complex dielectric constant of soils. The
    input parameters are the signal frequency, soil equivalent relative complex dielectric
    constant Îµ. Four different signal wavelengths are considered in Fig. 9 from 0.116
    m to 0.276 m for f = 0.433 GHz. Compared to the wavelength in free space Î»0, the
    soil wavelength Î»c is reduced. Download : Download high-res image (357KB) Download

    The determination of model boundary is shown in Table 2 obtained from the numerical
    tests. The minimum model radius rmin to arrive a stable signal path loss is determined
    if the change of path loss is smaller than 0.5 dB. Then the ratio of rmin over
    Î»c can be calculated as given in Table 2. For soil type (a), (b) and (c), rmin
    / Î»c is the in the range of 4.3â4.5. For soil type (d), rmin/Î»c = 2.8. Considering
    all the four cases, it is appropriate to set the value of rmin / Î»c as 5. Therefore,
    the numerical model radius can be determined as r = 5Î»c. Table 2. Determination

    of the developed numerical model 3.2.1. Model validation in free space using Friis
    equation The developed refined numerical model is first compared to Friis equation
    in free space. Friis transmission equation calculates the wireless signal path
    loss in free space as follows (Li et al., 2007), (5) where, Lp is the signal path
    loss in dB, d is the sight-of-line distance between transmitter and receiver in
    meters, f is the wireless signal frequency in Hertz. Fig. 10 (a) shows the total
    signal path loss from Port 1 of Node 1 to Port 2 of Node 2 in free space obtained
    by refined numerical model. Three signal operation frequencies, 433 MHz, 868 MHz
    and 2.4 GHz are considered in the numerical simulation. The total signal path
    loss Lp,total is composed of two parts: the free space path loss L0 and sensor
    node itself induced path loss Lnode as expressed by Eq. (6). (6) Download : Download
    high-res image (390KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Simulation
    of signal propagation in free space and comparison with Friis model. Node induced
    path loss includes the path loss induced by node box Pbox, sensor board Pboard
    and batteries Pbattery as discussed in Part 3.1. Free space path loss L0 is determined
    by node distance and signal operating frequency. Node induced path loss is irrelevant
    to node distance and only determined by node detailed structure and signal frequency.
    Therefore, Lnode and L0 can be separated from Lp,total as Lnode is a constant
    for different signal transmission distance. The separated L0 from refined numerical
    simulation is compared to the Friis transmission equation in Fig. 10 (b). The
    simulation results by refined numerical model well agrees with the theoretical
    Friis equation in free space at different node distances and signal frequencies.
    The separated Lnode is 34.3 dB for 433 MHz, 17.0 dB for 868 MHz and 6.9 dB for
    2.4 GHz. This fully accounts for the importance of Lnode in calculating Lp,total.
    The comparison clearly shows that Friis equation can only give the signal path
    loss in free space. Friis equation does not consider the detailed structure of
    sensor node and therefore cannot predict the node induced path loss. The developed
    refined numerical model simulates the signal propagation from the waveguide port
    and obtain the total signal path loss from transmitter to receiver. 3.2.2. Model
    validation in soils using outdoor experiments Outdoor experiments of EM wave propagation
    in soils were conducted to validate the developed numerical model. Only a brief
    introduction of the signal transmission experiment is given here as it is not
    the focus of this paper. More details can be found in another published paper
    (Huang et al., 2020). The experiment setup is shown in Fig. 11. The experiment
    system was composed of two wireless sensor nodes, one gateway and one laptop.
    Node 1 was buried at the bottom of the hole and Node 2 was placed at the surface
    of the backfilled soil. The distance between Node 1 and Node 2 was changed as
    the covering soil increased. At each time interval, sensor nodes formed a mesh
    topology and send data to the sink node. Sensor node 2 received the signal sent
    by Node 1, recorded the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Index) and transferred
    this information to the sink node. The sink node transmitted the mesh information
    to the remote sever via the mobile network and signal path loss could be easily
    obtained if both the transmitting and receiving power were measured. Download

    Setup of outdoor experiment for signal propagation. Four groups of experiments
    with three types of soils were conducted. The physical and electrical properties
    of the backfilled soils were given in Table 3. Two groups of experiments using
    silty clay were conducted and one group of experiment was conducted for wet sand
    and dry sand respectively. Table 3. Physical and electrical properties of the

    the temperature is kept around 19 Â°C. The experiment results of signal path loss
    are compared with the numerical simulation in Fig. 12. The RMSE (Root Mean Squared
    Error) and the maximum error are used to evaluate the agreement of numerical simulation
    results with experiment data. The RMSE is 3.4 dB and maximum error is 6.1 dB for
    âSilty clay-1â. The RMSE is 3.4 dB and maximum error is 5.7 dB for âSilty clay-2â.
    The RMSE is 3.0 dB and maximum error is 5.2 dB for âDry sandâ. For group of wet
    sand, the numerical results underestimate the signal path loss compared to experiment
    results at a short node distance. The maximum error is 14.9 dB for the numerical
    results. The deviation in the wet sand group is possibly caused by the inhomogeneous
    of wet sand in the vertical direction. But the deviation between numerical and
    experiment results are decreasing with the increase of node distance. The numerical
    results still agree with the experiment results at a large node distance. The
    RMSE for the group of âWet sandâ is 6.5 dB. Download : Download high-res image

    simulation and outdoor experiment results. The signal path loss for silty clay
    is much larger than that for sand both from the numerical simulation and experiment
    results. It indicates the soil types have an important effect on the soil electrical
    properties as given in Table 3 and make a big difference to the signal path loss
    eventually. From the comparison of numerical simulation results with Friis equation
    in free space and outdoor experiment results in soils, the refined numerical model
    developed in this paper is proved valid. 3.3. Comparison with the previous models
    A comparison between the proposed numerical model with the previous analytical
    models are provided in this section. Two presentative analytical propagation models
    are chosen for the comparison. 3 W model proposed by Dong and Vuran (2011) and
    WUSN-PLM model proposed by Sambo et al. (2020) are compared with numerical model
    for UG2UG channel as seen in Fig. 13(a). The experiment data is from the literature
    (Dong and Vuran, 2011). The transmitter and receiver were all buried at a depth
    of 0.4 m. The soil in the experiment contained 31% of sand, 29% of clay and VWC
    = 20%. In the near field (0â1 m), the 3 W model overestimates the signal path
    loss while numerical model and WUSN-PLM underestimate the path loss compared to
    the experiment data. In the far field (d > 1 m), the numerical model agrees well
    with WUSN-PLM and has a larger signal path loss prediction than the 3 W model.
    There is no more experiment data in the far field region. Therefore, the models
    are further compared in the far field region in Fig. 13(b) for UG2UG channel.
    The effect of node burial depth is investigated. It is found that WUSN-PLM does
    not consider the lateral waves and overestimate the signal path loss when d >
    4.5 m. The proposed numerical model predicts a signal fluctuation caused by the
    coupling effects of reflected wave and direct wave when node distance is relatively
    small. This kind of coupling is influenced by the node burial depth and node distance.
    When the node distance is large enough, the prediction by numerical model has
    an identical tendency with 3 W model. Download : Download high-res image (596KB)

    propagation models. For UG2AG channel, the proposed numerical model is also compared
    with the analytical model by Dong et al. (2013) and WUSN-PLM. The underground
    node is buried 0.5 m below the ground and the aboveground node is placed 0.5 m
    above the ground. The investigated soil contains 50% of sand particles, 15% of
    clay particles and VWC = 5%. The horizontal internode distance d is variated to
    observe the different model predictions as shown in Fig. 13(c). The WUSN-PLM agrees
    well with Dongâs model if Î· = 2.0 for UG2AG model. And the numerical model behaves
    more like Dongâs model if Î· = 3.5. The proposed numerical model has more flexibility
    to simulate the signal path loss for different channels compared to analytical
    models. 4. Parametric studies In the applications of WUSN in underground sensing,
    severe installation environments such the soil water content variation with time
    (Dong and Vuran, 2013, Salam and Vuran, 2016), soil heterogeneity will challenge
    the performance of network connectivity. Furthermore, the chosen of optimal signal
    frequency is necessary to reduce the path loss (Salam et al., 2019a). During the
    installation, the node orientation also affects the signal path loss from the
    previous experiment results (Silva and Vuran, 2009, Vuran and Silva, 2010). Therefore,
    these factors are parametrically studied in this section to provide some guidance
    for the design and installation of WUSN. 4.1. Influence of soil physical properties
    Soil physical properties affects the signal path loss through their influence
    on soil CDC. The soil equivalent relative complex dielectric constants Îµeff for
    homogeneous soil is predicted by MBSDM (Mironov et al., 2009). The input parameters
    are the clay particle percentages C, soil VWC and signal frequency f. MBSDM is
    believed to have a better prediction of soil complex dielectric constants and
    fewer input parameters compared to other CDC models (Sambo et al., 2020). The
    node distance is fixed at 1.0 m and signal frequency is 433 MHz for this parametric
    study. Soil clay content C and water content VWC are variated to observe their
    effects on signal path loss. Fig. 14 shows that VWC makes a big difference to
    signal path loss. And the path loss can be fitted using parabolic curves. The
    fitting results are summarized in Table 4. The curve fitting results show that
    a parabolic equation has a very good fitness to the curves as all the R2 values
    are better than 0.99. Signal path loss in soils with very low water content is
    very close. The signal path loss at mv = 0 is in the range of 56.54â57.22 dB.
    This means dry soil have similar attenuation to wireless signals. Compared to
    the 58.97 dB path loss in free space, dry soil causes very limited additional
    attenuation to signals. This can be understood from the double-layer theory of
    soil particles (Dobson et al., 1985). Dry soil has a very low electrical conductivity
    because the cations and anions precipitate as salts resulting in the shortage
    of moveable ions. In addition, absolute value of the other two fitting coefficients
    in the parabolic equation increase with the increase of clay particle fractions
    C. Signal path loss is more sensitive to VWC for soils having larger clay particle
    content compared to soils with fewer clay particle content. Download : Download

    operating frequency The path loss in free space at 1.0 m node distance is set
    as the baseline for signal propagation in soils. Four soil samples are investigated
    with different clay content and volumetric water content. The soil complex dielectric
    constants required by the numerical model are first calculated at different signal
    frequency using MBSDM. The distribution of signal path loss in soils at different
    frequencies as shown in Fig. 15 is similar to that in free space. An optimal frequency
    foptimal exists to minimize the signal path loss. Before the optimal frequency,
    signal path loss decreases rapidly with the increase of signal frequency. After
    the optimal frequency, signal path loss increases with the increase of frequency.
    Therefore, a local minimum arrives at the optimal frequency which is in the range
    of 0.56â0.65 GHz for different soil samples. This gives practical guidance to
    the choice of signal operating frequency. The general considered center frequency
    fcenter = 0.433 GHz is far from good in our analysis. The path loss at optimal
    frequency can reduce about 21%â24% compared to the path loss at designed center
    frequency. Download : Download high-res image (196KB) Download : Download full-size

    soil samples do not influence the distribution of signal path loss over frequency.

    GHz, which can be very useful in choosing the optimal signal operating frequency
    for different application scenarios. 4.3. Influence of relative node installation
    place In real-life application of WUSN, the relative node installation place between
    two sensors affects the signal propagation. The relative node installation place
    between two sensor nodes is illustrated in Fig. 16 (a). The relative rotation
    angle is used to quantify the possible installation deviation. Numerical results
    in Fig. 16 (b) shows that the relative rotation angle has a nonnegligible effect
    on signal path loss. Signal path loss arrives at a local maximum value when the
    rotation angle is 90Â° and 270Â°, and path loss arrives at a local minimum when
    the rotation angle is 0Â°, 180Â° and 360Â°. Therefore, it is the most unfavorable
    condition for signal propagation if two nodes are placed in the perpendicular
    direction while it is the most favorable condition if the two nodes are placed
    in the parallel direction. The difference of signal path loss in the perpendicular
    direction and parallel direction is up to 33.8 dB for d = 0.5 m, 37.8 dB for d
    = 1.0 m and 39.2 dB for d = 2.0 m. Download : Download high-res image (241KB)

    between two sensor nodes on the signal path loss. Another observation from Fig.
    16 is that a small rotation angle deviation from the parallel direction (0Â°, 180Â°)
    does not cause a big increase of the signal path loss. Signal path loss only increase
    0.3 dB when the rotation angle deviates Â±15Â° from 180Â°, and it increases 1.4 dB
    when the rotation angle deviates Â±30Â° from 180Â°. The signal path loss only increases
    2% in the rotation angle range of Â±30Â°. This allows enough installation error
    in the real application. 4.4. Influence of water content variation induced soil
    heterogeneity Natural soils are usually inhomogeneous due to the formation histories
    and outside influence from ground surface such as the increase of water content
    induced by rainfall. Such inhomogeneity is especially obvious in the vertical
    direction. In order to quantitatively investigate the effect of soil inhomogeneity
    on signal path loss, a vertical variated water content is assumed as shown in
    Fig. 17. The soil bulk density and particle density are set as Ïb = 1.4 g/cm3
    and Ïs = 2.7 g/cm3 with a porosity of 0.481. The soil volumetric water content
    (VWC) is assumed linearly distributed in the vertical direction. VWC = 0.0 at
    the ground surface and VWC = 0.3 at a depth of 2.0 m. Download : Download high-res
    image (79KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 17. Assumed soil vertical
    inhomogeneity induced by variation of water content. Confronted with the assumed
    vertically inhomogeneous soil, analytical propagation models have great difficulties
    in predicting signal path loss in such soils. However, the numerical model has
    advantages in solving such problems. Fig. 18 gives a simplified strategy for the
    simulation of vertically inhomogeneous soil through layered approximation. The
    investigated region is divided into several layers to approximate the linearly
    increased VWC along the burial depth. Each layer is assumed to be homogeneous
    with an equivalent VWC. The equivalent VWC of each layer is determined by the
    center point of that layer. With the increase of soil layers, the layer thickness
    is gradually reduced and the approximation is approaching the initial problem.
    For the specific case provided in Fig. 17, four simulation schemes including 1
    layer, 4 fours, 8 layers and 16 layers are designed. Download : Download high-res

    modelling of soil inhomogeneity. UG2AG channel is investigated for heterogenous
    soils as shown in Fig. 19. The aboveground node is 0.4 m above the ground surface.
    The underground node is in the same vertical alignment with the aboveground node
    and the buried depth is variated in the range of 0.2 mâ2.0 m. If the whole region
    is considered as one homogeneous layer, the signal path loss for UG2AG channel
    is larger than several layers. With the number of layers increasing, the signal
    path loss is converged according to the tendency observed from Fig. 19. Signal
    path loss in layered soils is more complex than it is in homogeneous soil due
    to the coupling of direct waves and reflected waves. The coupling of different
    waves could increase or reduce the path loss. Thus, the signal path loss is fluctuated
    with the increase of burial depth. But there is still an obvious linear tendency
    of signal path loss. Applying linear regression to each curve, the linear coefficient
    PÎ± can be obtained. The linear coefficient PÎ± in dB/m accounts for the signal
    path loss induced by soil absorption. PÎ± = 27.3 for one layer, PÎ± = 37.4 for four
    layers, PÎ± = 34.0 for eight layers, PÎ± = 37.6 for sixteen layers. Both the signal
    path loss fluctuation and tendency show the difference between homogenous and
    heterogenous soils. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download

    soil. UG2UG channel is also studied in heterogenous soils as shown in Fig. 20.
    The transmitter and receiver are buried at the same depth ht = hr. The node horizontal
    distance d is in the range of 0.2â3.0 m. Sixteen layers simulation scheme is adopted
    to modelling the soil heterogenous. Three node burial depth ht = 0.2 m, 0.4 m
    and 0.6 m are chosen for the simulation. The results show that the fluctuation
    of signal path loss is larger than that in homogenous soils. Signal propagation
    is much more complex due to the wave reflection and refraction between different
    layers. With the increase of node burial depth ht, the fluctuation period and
    amplitude decreases. The linear coefficient does not vary much for each case.
    PÎ± = 18.7 for ht = 0.2 m, PÎ± = 17.1 for ht = 0.4 m, PÎ± = 15.1 for ht = 0.6 m.
    The fluctuation of signal path loss makes it more difficult for analytical models
    to give an accurate prediction. The linear coefficient for UG2AG and UG2UG shows
    that signal propagation along the vertical direction is much more difficult than
    horizontal direction. The numerical simulation shows the soil heterogeneity has
    unfavorable effect on signal propagation. Therefore, the transmitter and receiver
    are suggested to install in homogeneous soils or at least in the same soil layer.

    Fig. 20. Signal path loss of UG2UG channel in heterogeneous soil. 5. Conclusions
    This paper develops a refined numerical model to simulate the wireless signal
    propagation in soils for WUSN. The structure details of the buried sensor node
    have been considered in the numerical model developed in FEKO. The proposed numerical
    model considers the attenuation caused by the sensor node itself. Furthermore,
    the proposed model allows the investigation of soil inhomogeneity, which is difficult
    for analytical signal propagation models. Several points are concluded as follows:
    (1) The refined numerical model considering the detailed structure of buried sensor
    node can obtain the total signal path loss in soils. Signal loss caused by sensor
    node itself is clarified by the comparison with Friis equation. For the specific
    node shown in this paper, the additional loss is 34.3 dB. The additional loss
    is determined by the node structure and signal frequency. (2) At low water content,
    signal path loss is not sensitive to soil clay content. Path loss is at the same
    level for signal propagates in dry soils. At high water content, clay content
    makes a big difference to signal path loss. For different types of soils, the
    path loss can be expressed as a parabolic function of soil volumetric water content.
    The fitting parameters are determined by soil clay content. (3) An optimal frequency
    foptimal exists to minimize the path loss given the antenna size. foptimal is
    not equal to the center frequency of antenna. Soil physical properties has limited
    influence to the optimal frequency. foptimal is in the range of 0.56â0.65 GHz
    for antenna size D = 17.3 cm. (4) Signal path loss of two sensors installed in
    the parallel direction (relative rotation angle 0Â°, 180Â°) is the local minimum
    while it is the local maximum for sensors installed in the perpendicular direction
    (relative rotation angle 90Â°, 270Â°). A deviation of Â±30Â° from the parallel direction
    only causes a 1.4 dB increase of signal path loss. (5) The proposed numerical
    model is able to simulate signal propagation in heterogeneous soils. Layered approximation
    is adopted to simulate the heterogeneous soils with linear increase water content
    along depth. With the increase of equivalent layers, the signal path loss converges.
    For a region with 2 m deep, division by 16 homogenous layers are a good approximation.
    The coupling of direct, reflected and refracted waves could increase or decrease
    the path loss and lead to the fluctuation. The fluctuation of signal path loss
    makes the prediction more difficult for analytical models. CRediT authorship contribution

    Agriculture is probably the greatest worry to all humanity since the vast majority
    of food is created by farming. As of now, numerous individuals still experience
    the ill effects of yearning because of the absence of food in certain nations,
    particularly in Africa. Exceptionally, hunger caused the persistent undernourishment
    of in excess of 800 million individuals on the planet in 2016. All the more remarkably,
    in excess of 10 million people has been left to die from hunger every year [1].
    Clearly, expanding food creation is without a doubt a viable method for destroying
    yearning and destitution. But it''s not that easy, the agriculture is a long way
    from modernization in a large portion of agricultural nations, prompting low food
    creation [2]. In recent days, Smart Agriculture (SA) is an arising idea that alludes
    to overseeing ranches utilizing present day Information and Communication Technologies
    to expand the amount and nature of items while advancing the human work required
    [3]. Especially, the SA frameworks bring together several advanced computer and
    information technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things
    (IoT), and Cloud Computing (CC) into the smart agricultural creation [4]. Among
    these techniques, IoT and AI are the predominantly significant technique that
    creates the SA framework. Without the role of IoT and AI, it''s significantly
    not possible to create a SA system [5,6]. In the SA system, the IoT is mainly
    used to automatically collect agricultural data and to transmit the collected
    data to the data centres. Whereas, artificial intelligence techniques analyze
    the agricultural data using the machine learning, neural network and clustering
    technique for smart decision-making in the SA system [7,8]. For example, when
    there is lack of water in the environment created with smart agriculture framework,
    the action will be taken immediately to watering the crops in that environment
    by analysing the data collected by the IoT and AI analysing the data. Several
    researchers have been working to develop smart agriculture model using AI and
    IoT. In [9], smart agriculture based on IoT system and deep reinforcement learning
    with four-layer has been developed. The developed system also integrated AI and
    CC to increase smart agriculture food production. In [10], the author has developed
    Agri trust, (i.e.,) a trust management approach for smart agriculture using CC
    and IoT. The developed Agri trust identifies malicious and compromised data interval
    and provides a friendly agricultural environment to the people migrated from other
    cities. In [11], the author has developed an Agro-IoT collaboration framework
    for creating a smart agriculture environment. The developed Agro-IoT framework
    is specially designed for sugarcane agriculture. The developed framework facilitates
    a live communication medium between farmers and government. It also works as a
    monitoring medium to observe the growth of the crops, moisture content and to
    control the cultivation wastages. In [12], IoT and AI-based architecture system
    for smart cities and agriculture have been developed. The developed architecture
    converges the earlier system to develop a smart system using layered, service-oriented
    and cloud-based software architecture using IoT and the architecture enhances
    the yielding. In [13], the author has developed smart farming using the IoT to
    rectify the current food production. The author has also reviewed several methodologies
    addressing smart agricultural problems. The author has proved that the IoT and
    AI could be the methods that could solve the crop framing problems and improve
    the accuracy of crop diagnosis. In [14], the author investigates 6 G wireless
    systems with IoT for the expected support in truly global wireless communications,
    anywhere and anytime. The developed system with 6G-IoT is an ISTN, that is expected
    to be at the core of 6 G communication systems, and how to build a high-capacity
    yet low-cost ISTN is of significant importance in developing global 6 G communication
    systems. In [15], the author presents a point-by-point overview of remote advancement
    towards the 6G-IoT network. In this review, the great spotlight is on the new
    compositional changes related with 6 G networks, portrayed by universal 3D inclusion,
    the presentation of unavoidable AI and upgraded network convention stack. Spotted
    hyena optimizer, Emperor penguin optimizer with bio-inspired, Seagull optimization
    algorithm, STOA based bio-inspired based optimization algorithm has been developed
    to solve industrial engineering problems [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Later,
    artificial intelligence, neural network, and machine learning based solutions
    are been provided for complex industrial engineering problems [21], [22], [23],
    [24], [25], [26], [27]. These soft computing techniques can be further utilized
    for autonomous irrigation system. For the review, it has been identified that
    the autonomous irrigation system requires technology to support such as AI, 6-G
    network and IoT [21]. Combining all these together could build up a new paradigm
    that will sort out current problems in smart agriculture. In this paper, an autonomous
    irrigation system for smart agriculture using Artificial Intelligence (AI) has
    been developed. The developed smart agriculture irrigation system helps in transforming
    the traditional irrigation system to create a hassle-free smart agriculture irrigation
    model using AI and 6 G enabled IoT. The developed autonomous irrigation system
    is purely based on prediction algorithm which is mount in a microprocessor, which
    uses weather history data using IoT to identify and predict rainfall patterns
    and any climatic changes; hence it creates an intelligent system which irrigates
    the field depending upon the outer environment. The developed system not only
    checks the environmental condition, but it also measures the moisture content
    of the soil to supply the required amount of water to the crops. The developed
    autonomous AI and 6 G -IoT based smart agricultural irrigation system has been
    tested under control environment with an accuracy of 86.34% which could probably
    the solution for irrigating crops in future. 2. Smart agriculture Smart agriculture
    is focusses on the use of data acquired through various sources such as, geographical
    data, historical data and mechanical system data to manage the agricultural activities.
    Smart frameworks separate themselves through their capacity to record the information
    and bode well out of it. Keen cultivating utilizes equipment like IoT, AI and
    programming Software as a service (SaaS) to catch the information and give significant
    bits of knowledge to deal with all the procedure on the homestead, both pre- and
    post-reap. The smart agriculture frame work is shown in Fig. 1. The information
    is coordinated, open constantly and brimming with information on each part of
    money and field tasks that can be observed from any place on the planet. IoT in
    horticulture includes sensors, robots and robots associated through the web which
    work consequently and semi naturally performing activities and social occasion
    information pointed toward expanding productivity and consistency. With expanding
    requests and lack of work across the globe, horticulture computerization and robots
    or regularly known as Agri-bots are beginning to acquire consideration among ranchers.
    Yield creation diminished by an expected 213 crores approx ($3.1 billion) a year
    because of work deficiencies in the different countries. Ongoing headways in sensors
    and AI innovation that lets machines to prepare on their environmental factors
    have made ag-robots more prominent [28]. The world is in the beginning phases
    of an ag advanced mechanic''s unrest with a large portion of the items still in
    preliminary stages and R&D mode. Download : Download high-res image (517KB) Download

    farming system, self-loader robots with arms can identify weeds and splash pesticides
    in the influenced plants, setting aside the plants just as by and large pesticide
    costs. These robots can likewise be utilized in reaping and lifting. Hefty cultivating
    vehicles can likewise be explored from the solace of homes through telephone screens
    to perform errands and GPS can follow their situations at without fail. Robots
    furnished with sensors and cameras are utilized for imaging, planning and reviewing
    the ranches. They can be distantly controlled or they can fly consequently through
    programming-controlled flight plans in their inserted frameworks, working as a
    team with sensors and GPS. From the robot information, bits of knowledge can be
    drawn with respect to trim wellbeing, water system, splashing, planting, soil
    and field, plant checking and yield forecast and significantly more. The IoT based
    far off detecting uses sensors put along with the ranches like climate stations
    for social event information which is communicated to insightful instrument for
    examination. The information gathered from light, moistness, temperature, shape
    and size have a possibility to change the yield. Furthermore, the information
    gathered by sensors regarding mugginess, temperature, dampness precipitation and
    dew discovery helps in deciding the climate design in ranches so development is
    accomplished for appropriate yields. The investigation of nature of soil helps
    in deciding the supplement worth and drier territories of ranches, soil seepage
    limit or acridity, which permits to change the measure of water required for the
    water system and the select most useful sort of development. PC imaging includes
    the utilization of sensor cameras introduced at various corners of the ranch or
    robots outfitted with cameras to create pictures which go through advanced picture
    handling. The pictures are utilized for quality control, illness identification,
    arranging and reviewing yield and water system observing through Image handling
    joined with AI which uses pictures from information base to contrast with pictures
    of harvests with deciding the size, shape, shading and development accordingly
    controlling the quality. 3. Developed AI and 6G-IoT based autonomous irrigation
    system IoT based smart irrigation system framework is fit for mechanizing the
    water system measure by breaking down the moisture level of soil and the atmosphere
    condition. At the point when the power supply is given to the microcontroller,
    it will check the dirt moisture level content of the soil [29]. On the off chance
    that the moisture content isn''t up to the limit then it makes the motor to pump
    water on consequently and turns off naturally on the off chance that it scopes
    to the limit level. The list of sensors applicable in the smart agriculture is
    listed in Table 1. The need for water for any crops is likewise decreased radically.
    Far off checking is too conceivable in IoT based savvy water system framework.

    Sensor devices Applications 1 Volumetric Sensor Volumetric soil moisture sensors
    straightforwardly measure the measure of water in the dirt. This classification
    has the most sensor types: neutron dampness tests, heat dispersal sensors, and
    the normal, di-electric sensors. 2 Di-electric sensors The di-electric sensors
    measure the di-electric steady of the dirt, an electrical property reliant on
    soil dampness content, and can be bought in 3 varieties: Time Domain Refractometry
    (TDR) sensors, Time Domain Transmissometer (TDT) sensors, and capacitance or Frequency
    Domain Refractometry (FDR) sensors. 3 Tensiometers Tensiometers are soil dampness
    sensors that measure this strain between soil particles and water atoms. A tensiometer
    is a vertical, water-filled cylinder with a permeable tip that is embedded into
    the dirt at suggested profundities; the dirt coaxes water out of the permeable
    tip of the fixed cylinder, making a vacuum. Drier soils make a more grounded vacuum
    since water atoms are more diligently to pull off soil particles. 4 Solid state
    sensors Solid state sensors are an expensive device, that is used to measure the
    soil data. Solid state sensors work by utilizing two cathodes to quantify the
    electrical obstruction in the dirt. More water in the dirt will decrease electrical
    opposition in light of the fact that the electrical momentum can go through the
    water simpler; less water will build the obstruction. After the electrical obstruction
    is estimated the water strain is determined to decide the plant accessible soil
    dampness. 5 Granular matrix sensors Granular matrix sensors have a granular matrix
    inside a metal case. The electrical sensors are embedded in the granular matrix
    above a gypsum wafer. 3.1. IoT and AI framework In the developed autonomous irrigation
    framework, there are four layers which interact with each other. The layers such
    as Physical, Edge, Cloud, and Network are bond with each other by means of 6G-IoT
    and AI through a web service. Fig. 2 shows the architecture of the developed AI
    and IoT based autonomous irrigation system. The web service is written in PHP
    with a light weighted REST API to convey the information between the field gadget
    and the worker. The assistance is facilitated on Apache (Web worker) at the worker
    machine. The microcontroller gadget sends the field information to the worker
    utilizing this web administration. This web administration can deal with the organization
    variance/blackout during synchronizing the information from the documented gadget
    to the worker with the assistance of banner settings at the data set level. A
    web administration has been created in Arduino to gather the climate determining
    information. This web administration additionally totals the climate estimating
    information like temperature, mugginess, shadiness, UV Index and precipitation
    of various web determining entryways like Open Weather and Accuracy Weather utilizing
    API of these gateways. The created web administration read the anticipated information
    of the predetermined area utilizing API and store it in MySQL data set at the
    worker, which is considered in the forecast calculation. In the contest, the IoT
    Edge is an administration that expands on top of the IoT Hub and empowers clients
    to complete edge registering. Edge processing is when information is dissected
    on gadgets, that is, at the edge of the organization, as opposed to in the actual
    cloud. With edge processing, you can abstain from moving crude information via
    doing information cleaning, total, and examination on the actual gadget, and afterwards
    send the bits of knowledge acquired to the cloud. This will bring about diminished
    transmission capacity costs, faster reaction times and decreased traffic. This
    runs on each IoT Edge device and manages the modules deployed there. It performs
    a number of functions including monitoring and managing the device and facilitating
    communications between the modules, the device, other devices, and the cloud.
    The runtime supports both Linux and Windows operating systems. Download : Download

    used to predict the soil moisture based on field information and climate determining
    information utilizing support AI calculation. The algorithm shows data with respect
    to soil moisture of the forthcoming days. It likewise gives water system recommendations,
    in view of the characterized level of soil moisture content and anticipated precipitation,
    to save water and energy. The created data by calculation and gadget is put away
    in MySQL Database at the worker. Besides, the created system controls the hand-off
    change to begin/stop the water engine. In this module, a water siphon is associated
    with a hand-off switch that is constrained by a Wi-Fi empowered hub. The hub is
    constrained by the web administration through a trigger from the responsive electronic
    interface for continuous observing. Utilizing this electronic interface, the water
    siphon can be overseen distantly in manual and auto modes. The correspondence
    advances utilized in the proposed design is the Wi-Fi module/6G-Mobile information
    correspondence. In this trial examination, a Wi-Fi module has been utilized to
    send information to the worker. The algorithm used in the micro controller is
    given below. Algorithm of irrigation scheduling Initialize soil moisture content

    6G networks AI techniques provide the best opportunity to train auto-learning
    models to realize network optimization for 6 G wireless networks, allowing providers
    or operators to optimize the network parameters, resources or architectures to
    better adapt services for devices, finally make 6 G networks become intelligent,
    and agile. The improvement of 6 G network has an enormous scope, multi-layered,
    high perplexing, dynamic, and heterogeneous. Moreover, 6 G network need to help
    consistent availability and assurance different QoS necessities of the tremendous
    number of gadgets, just as cycle enormous measure of information produced from
    actual conditions. Computer-based intelligence procedures with ground breaking
    examination capacity, learning capacity, upgrading capacity and astute acknowledgement
    capacity, which can be utilized into 6 G network to brilliantly do execution advancement,
    information revelation, modern learning, structure association and confounded
    dynamic [30,31]. With the assistance of AI, we present an AI-empowered smart design
    for 6 G network which is fundamentally isolated into four layers as illustrated
    in Fig. 2. 3.2. Experimental setup The main objective of this experiment is to
    collect the physical parameters of a farming land using sensors and to utilize
    these sensorsâ data along with weather forecast information for developing an
    algorithm for prediction of soil moisture of the upcoming days. The algorithm
    uses a hybrid machine learning approach, as discussed in Section 3.1, to achieve
    higher accuracy in soil moisture prediction. The experimental setup is shown in
    Fig. 3. The Fig. 3(a) illustrates the architecture of the control connection kit,
    which consists of 6G-commnuication module with IoT enabled for fetching weather
    data and climate change data. The microcontroller board is connected to the tensiometer
    sensor. The tensiometer sensor is a filed data collection device that has been
    deployed in the garden of the test environment which was created to assess the
    performance of the autonomous irrigation system using AI-IoT based 6G network.
    The data collected in the test environment is stores in the server using the web
    service. Later, the collected data are been analysed using the AI approach and
    6G-IoT is responsive for the real time monitoring and data visualization. Fig.

    Fig. 3(b) shows the 6G-IoT of water system arranging module to plan the water
    system by setting Irrigation Date and Threshold Levels for Soil Moisture. This
    data, anticipated soil dampness and precipitation data will help client/rancher
    in arranging/planning of ideal water system. The created module works in two modes,
    viz., auto, and manual. In manual mode, the client takes the planning choice dependent
    on anticipated soil dampness and precipitation data. In auto mode, the client
    sets the Soil Moisture Threshold levels, and the framework naturally plans the
    water system date dependent on the anticipated soil dampness and climate conjecture
    (precipitation) data. For instance, if the downpour is normal on the planned water
    system date or close to the planned date, at that point, the framework will hang
    tight for the downpour and it will suspend the counterfeit/manual water system
    or it will begin watering (if necessary, in light of the calculation) the field
    to keep up least soil dampness work the appearance of the downpour. Further, the
    framework can deal with the progressions in gage precipitation esteems. The developed
    prototype can be extended to irrigate large area. 4. Result and discussion A profound
    assessment has been carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed autonomous
    irrigation system using AI-IoT based 6G network. In this assessment the developed
    module as discussed in Section 3.2 is assessed in the test environment created
    with devices like halogen lamp, measured oxygen content, air conditioner and water
    filter. The devices could absorb the moisture content of the soil and will help
    for fast testing. The testing was conducted on 24/12/2020 and 25/12/2020. The
    temperature of the test environment was measured in the interval of an hour. The
    halogen lamp in the test environment has been used like the daylight, the intensity
    of luminous has been increased during day bright hours. The data observed for
    the room temperature is depicted in the Fig. 4. From the figure it can be observed
    that the test environment temperature varies from 19Â°C to 33 Â°C. Further, in the
    meantime, humidity level has been assessed in the test environment and obtained
    humidity measurement is depicted in Fig. 5. From the figure it can be observed
    that humidity is 55% during morning and evening, and is 24% to 26% during day
    time. Moreover, the moisture level of the soil has been measured using, Volumetric
    Sensor, Tensiometer sensor, and Solid-state sensor and fed with the 6G-IoT module
    and AI system for further processing. The moisture level varies between 10% to
    45% and the observation data obtained for the test environment is depicted in
    the Fig. 6. From the figure it has be observed that the soil moisture reduces
    with high light luminous and increases with low luminous. Download : Download

    irrigation system using AI-IoT based 6G network is engaged with the auto mode.
    The module has collected the soil moisture content and climate data using the
    6G enabled IoT server network. Meanwhile, it also the feeds the soil moisture
    and temperature data obtained using the sensor into the server using the 6G enabled
    IoT module. Further, the data is processed by the AI and motor pump is turned
    ON/OFF according to the requirement. Fig. 7 depicts the water irrigation data
    log obtained in percentage of engaging based on the soil moisture content. Form
    the figure it can be observed that the motor pump operates for 0 to 75% based
    on the variation of soil moisture (soil moisture is varied using halogen lamp
    operation in the test environment). The AI process in motor operation can be clearly
    identified in the Fig. 7, when the moisture level lowers 20% the motor pump is
    engaged to water. Using the developed autonomous irrigation system using AI-IoT
    based 6G network the farmers could monitor the water flow level and can also prevent
    over watering. Further, in the investigation the performance evaluation of different
    sensor used in the study has been evaluated. Fig. 8 shows the performance evaluation

    using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 6G enabled IoT has been developed. The
    developed 6G-IoT and AI based system helps in transforming the traditional irrigation
    system to create a hassle-free smart agriculture irrigation model. The developed
    autonomous AI and 6G-IoT based smart agricultural irrigation system has been tested
    under control environment and following observation has been identified, â¢ The
    developed autonomous irrigation system has an accuracy of 86.34%. â¢ The developed
    system not only checks the environmental condition, but also measures the moisture
    content of the soil to supply the required amount of water to the crops. â¢ The
    developed system communicates with the farmers regarding the weather history and
    helps in predicting the rainfall pattern through analysing the weather report
    and climate changes. The developed framework is an effective methodology in irrigating
    the crops. The developed framework works in all environmental conditions and could
    be the first step in developing smart agriculture system. Declaration of Competing

  description: The Construction Real Estate Infrastructure and Project Management
    (CRIP) sector is a prominent sector among the industries worldwide. It plays a
    significant role in contributing to any countryâs economy worldwide. Mainly several
    sub-sectors of the CRIP sector that contributes to countryâs economy such as highways,
    railways, airways, waterways, irrigation, power generation, government buildings,
    residential buildings, etc. Many public sector projects add push toward the development
    of CRIP sector in India. The activities also involve multi-tasking and multi-activity
    with different types of people at different levels. Mostly, exchange of inter-departmental
    information utilizes vast amounts of data throughout the construction project
    activities. The efficiency of transformation of data depends on the way in which
    data were handled, transferred between different stages, and participants involved.
    This efficiency can be improved by implementing modern tools like automationâInternet
    of Things (IOT) framework, mobile application, computer software, etc. Among the
    different automation tool, the most familiar and most common tool is mobile applications.
    Even though several mobile applications are in practice, all the applications
    are not performing with full outcome. Although, many applications are lagging
    with data security, user friendliness, training intensity, etc. The main aim of
    this research study is to understand the benefits of automation, to compare various
    modern tools available in the market, and examine those modern tools to check
    if they rectify negative impacts of automation. The merits and demerits are discussed
    with the outcome of questionnaires from various users. This was achieved by performing
    a qualitative analysis among selected mobile applications.

    applications. Introduction The role of CRIP sector in infrastructure development
    of any country is unavoidable and highly significant, especially in developing
    countries like India. It plays a vital role in nation building and also it is
    one of the sectors contributing to countryâs economy. Based on the recent survey
    conductedâImpact with Market Outlook 2017â2030, it is said that the construction
    industry contributes 8% to Indiaâs GDP (Chen and Kamara 2005; Sattineni and Schmidt
    2015; Yakubu et al. 2015; Ekow and Kofi 2016; Djajalaksana et al. 2017). However,
    looking at the current pandemic scenario, the construction industry along with
    other industries has been affected drastically. It is high time to look into the
    issues in CRIP sector, finding out suitable strategy or mechanism to overcome
    the crisis. It can be ensured by effective project accomplishment needsâa coordinated
    work among the entire construction fraternity (Djajalaksana et al. 2017; Hemstrom
    et al. 2017; Ghobakhloo 2018; Frank et al. 2019). This can be achieved through
    better project planning, management, improved execution, new financial policies,
    adoption of new technologies, automation, etc. Automation is one such strategy
    that promises better planning, co-ordination and communication with the team,
    improved quality, better safety, more accuracy, forecasting of risks, data analysis,
    etc. (Chen and Kamara 2005; Sattineni and Schmidt 2015; Yakubu et al. 2015). There
    are various ways to implement the automation strategy in different sectors of
    construction activities such as autonomous machines on-site, drones to perform
    surveying, robotics in concrete works, Internet of Things (IOT) framework using
    sensors, mobile applications, computer software, mobile/cloud BIM technology,
    virtual reality technology, etc. (Abanda et al. 2018). Among the different automation
    tool, the most familiar and most common tool used in several developed countries
    is mobile applications (Ashok Kumar 2014; Ekow and Kofi 2016; Djajalaksana et
    al. 2017; Hussain and Hossain 2017). Mobile information systems and cloud computing
    proposal provide easy conclusion to complex problems. It makes the outcome distribution
    faster with real-time information services in project management (Sinda and Roja
    2017; Oke et al. 2017; Lee and Kim 2018). It increases the effectiveness of collaboration,
    and the reliability of the information helps in reducing information delays (Olanrewaju
    et al. 2017; Hussain et al. 2018). Several research studies pertaining to CRIP
    sector among the workers community in developing countries highlight that usage
    of modern tools like mobile app among workers is very poor, and more than 60%
    of workers were unaware of mobile applications and also had lack of knowledge
    in using the mobile application (Ekow and Kofi 2016). The communication among
    users improved with some various algorithm such as NOMA and LASSO used 4G to 5G
    and beyond in recent years with good outrage probability (Koteeshwari and Malarkodi
    2022a, b). In this digital era, it is mandatory that automation tool must be implemented
    in the CRIP sector and it is going to dominate entire sector in near future (Cline
    and Davis 2013). So, it is high time to find an effective strategy to overcome
    lapses with respect to the modern tools that need to be identified (Clancy et
    al. 2012). This research scrutinized the role of mobile technologies in refining
    the communication support for the building project site of CRIP sector (McMeel
    and Gonzalez 2019; Venkatraman and Yoong 2009; Sudharsan and Priyadharshni 2019;
    Rawal et al. 2019). Excellent cooperation and co-ordination between numerous construction
    specialists and the clientele are required for a building project to be completed
    successfully (Eze et al. 2020). Arantes and Ferreira (2021) provide a number of
    techniques to reduce delays in building, where communication is crucial. In some
    regions, poor connectivity with low transmission also causes discomfort (Sulaiman
    2022). In some aspects, mental health and psychological problem arises (Borjalilu
    et al. 2019; Bruehlman et al. 2020; Fu et al. 2021; Carla et al. 2021). The main
    purpose of this research study is to comprehend the benefits of digitalization
    for effective on-site communication, to compare various mobile applications available
    in the industry, to rectify the drawbacks of digitalization in the construction
    project activity (Olanrewaju et al. 2017; Hussain et al. 2018). Tools adopted
    to achieve the objective are by floating the questionnaire among the CRIP sector
    community. Based on the questionnaire outcome, both positive and negative aspects
    were inferred with respect to automation, and the qualitative analysis of data
    was carried out with the help of a qualitative data analyzing software called
    NVivo (Ekow and Kofi 2016; Djajalaksana et al. 2017; Sudharsan and Priyadharshni
    2019). The outcome of the research study was mainly based on a live case study
    of Pune-based construction firm. Methodology To achieve the objective and to procure
    suitable data to perceive the conclusion, a questionnaire was floated (Ekow and
    Kofi 2016; Oke et al. 2017; Abanda et al. 2018). The detailed methodology adopted
    to carry out the research to fulfill the end goal was stipulated in Fig. 1. Fig.
    1 Methodology adopted Full size image Results and discussion To ascertain the
    impact of automation among the construction community, a questionnaire was floated.
    This was done to get a clear understanding of what role does automation play and
    how its implementation affects construction projects. Respondents to the questionnaire
    belonged to the CRIP sector community such as construction professionals, construction
    managers, employees working at different designations and interns. Following statements
    were stated in the questionnaire to which the participants responded on a scale
    from strongly disagree to strongly agree given in Table1. Table 1 Impact of model
    technology Full size table Based on the questionnaire floated in Table 1, responses
    were received and the output of the questionnaire has been replicated in the following
    numbers, 58.6% agree that automation increases productivity and efficiency of
    work, 49.5% agree that it proves to be time saving, 51.1% agree that it provides
    effective on-site communication, and 49.5% agree that it proves to be useful in
    quality control and health, safety, and environment. From the above numbers, it
    can be understood that automation is advantageous which will help in development
    of construction industry (Clancy et al. 2012; Meland et al. 2011; Izkara et al.
    2017). The outcome of the questionnaire was then substantiated by means of a case
    study based on a Pune-based well-established real-estate company. Experiencing
    the current pandemic scenario, this real-estate company wanted to adopt digitalization
    on their 400-acre township project being executed. The company wanted to digitalize
    its construction processes of quality department to achieve better quality control
    (Sudharsan and Priyadharshni 2019; Rawal et al. 2019; Salvi and Kerkar 2020).
    Keeping this case study in mind, this research outcome talks about how mobile
    applications and software solutions as mentioned in Table 2 with respect to quality
    management, checklists, and inspections in achieving improved productivity, ensuring
    safety, etc., wereanalyzed. Table 2 List of software Full size table Mobile applications
    The software was scrutinized based on the methodology listed below in Table 2.
    Here, P, Q, R, and S are construction mobile applications and, in context of construction,
    A, B, C, and D are construction software solutions such as (Enterprice Resource
    Planning) ERP, (System Applications and Products in Data Processing) SAP, or customizable
    IT solutions. The mobile applications and construction software solutions are
    renamed as alphabetical letters to maintain its confidentiality. Out of the solutions
    identified, A and B (ERPs and SAPs, respectively) were removed from the quantitative
    and qualitative analysis to be carried out. The reason behind doing this was that
    maximum construction firms are using ERPs or SAPs for accounting, material procurement,
    or other such departments. Finding another ERP or SAP solution just for quality
    management will require the firm either to adopt two different ERP or SAP solution
    or move on to a completely new ERP or SAP solution to manage all their departments.
    Software developers such as C and D that provide customized IT solutions were
    also eliminated. This was done because getting a customized product after multiple
    discussions and meetings with the developers would be time consuming. Therefore,
    ready-to-use mobile applications like P, Q, R, and S are preferred and required
    so that users could be created, upload basic data, and commence using them to
    save time. Parameters to measure efficiency The parameters represented in Fig.
    1 and discussed in Tables 3 and 4 were used to measure efficiency of mobile applications.
    The user interface of the mobile application must be simple or user friendly and
    smooth. The application must not crash and lag. The application should be compatible
    both with mobile and PC. The application should be secured (i.e., no data theft).
    It must possess analytical dashboard (most preferably hyperlinked). It would be
    better if pre-installed checklists are provided. The report generated must be
    in pdf or excel. Intimating system is a must through the application (i.e., intimate
    by email via app and app notification). The application must not be expensive.
    Table 3 Information of apps P and Q Full size table Table 4 Information of apps
    R and S Full size table Tables 3 and 4 give out information associated to different
    parameters of all four mobile applications. This material was gathered after receiving
    demonstrations from their developers. Outcome of quantitative analysis To select
    the most effective mobile application and to meet with the objective, it was decided
    to prepare a ranking matrix, presented in Table 5. Different mobile applications
    were rated on common parameters to measure their efficiency. Ratings were provided
    on the basis of interface observed and information collected during the demonstration
    delivered. Total sum of all average score was calculated for every mobile application
    on the basis of which they were finally ranked. Table 5 Ranking matrix based on
    the parameterâs outcome Full size table Effective outcome of the qualitative analysis
    was interpreted using qualitative analyzing software called NVivo. The analysis
    was carried out by coding the parameters to measure efficiency based on the ranking.
    The outcome of the ranking was represented in the form of histograms as stipulated
    in Fig. 2aâd. Fig. 2 Parameters for mobile applications: a P, b Q, c R, and d
    S. Based on the interpretation of figure, the following information has been arrived
    from the quantitative analysis. For example, let us consider for mobile application
    P Full size image Interpretation of qualitative analysis outcome The interpretation
    of the histograms was done as follows. The x-axis represented parameters that
    highlight efficiency. Values â1â and â0â of a particular parameter in the y-axis
    signified âyesâ and ânoâ, respectively. For instance, the âiOSâ parameter stipulated
    in Fig. 2aâd showed â1â on the y-axis which signified P, R, and S are available
    on iOS platform whereas Fig. 2a showed â0âwhich signified Q is not. Similarly,
    the âFeaturesâ parameter that had values greater than â1â on the y-axis stipulated
    in Fig. 2c, d, showed that applications P, Q, R, and S possessed 5, 5, 9, and
    6 major technological features, respectively. It can be accessed through a mobile
    phone as well as a web console. It has a client base of seven major construction
    companies. There are four different subscription packages offered by the developer
    having different costs and benefits. The client is charged on user basis and not
    on tower basis by the developer for the subscription package they select (i.e.,
    cost/user). The mobile application possesses an analytical dashboard. It is analytical
    only and not hyperlinked. It has five major technological features that make it
    attractive to use. The developer company is based in abroad and not in India.
    The users on the platform can be intimated through both email and mobile-push
    notification. The application is available on both android and iOS platform. The
    report system of the application generates PDF format reports and no other formats.
    Intense training is required to get adapted to the application since the interface
    is complex. Similarly, the information was interpreted for mobile applications
    Q, R, and S as represented in Fig. 2bâd. The main outcome of the study was arrived
    by comparing all four mobile applications and the same was represented in 3D as
    stipulated in Fig. 3, for better decision making and interpretation. It can be
    clearly seen that all four applications can be accessed via mobile and PC. Application
    R possess both analytical and hyperlinked dashboard whereas P and S possess only
    an analytical dashboard. Application Q has a non-analytical dashboard. Major technological
    features offered by application R are maximum as compared to P, Q, and S. Intimation
    system for applications P, R, and S consists of both email intimation and mobile-push
    notification whereas it is only email intimation for Q (Hussain et al. 2018).
    Similarly, applications P, R, and S are available on both android and iOS whereas
    Q is only available on android (Venkatraman and Yoong 2009). The report system
    of application R looks the best among others because it provides reports in different
    formats such as PDF, Excel, etc. Applications Q and R would be easier to use since
    they have a simple interface which will require moderate training to get adapted
    to in comparison to P and S (Sudharsan and Priyadharshni 2019). One of the affecting
    factor is the builders and contractors violating the guidelines of government
    policy (Okpala et al. 2020; Nnaji and Karakhan 2020). Fig. 3 Cumulative result
    of all applications Full size image Conclusion It was identified that with respect
    to quality management, checklists, and inspections, there are many solutions like
    A, B, C, D, P, Q, R, and S which are available in the market. The challenge is
    to find the most suitable, easy to use, simple, and economical application for
    your construction project. After performing a detailed quantitative and qualitative
    analysis on applications P, Q, R, and S, it can clearly be seen that the application
    R stands out and the same has been ranked 1st in the ranking matrix. The key advantages
    of application for R: It helps in improving co-ordination and communication by
    bringing all the team members on the same platform. Itâs analytical-hyperlinked
    dashboard will help track project and employee performance. Users will not miss
    out on their tasks since features like âscheduleâ and âmobile-push notificationâ
    will intimate them in prior. In-built GPS location and time-tracking system will
    increase accuracy of work. Its flexible reporting system will help exchange digital
    reports in multiple formats on both android and iOS devices. Above all the most
    important advantage is that the application has a simple interface which will
    require minimal training to get adapted and is cost beneficial. To increase the
    efficiency and productivity of construction projects, it is mandatory to adopt
    the automation (mobile application) criteria like R which possess several advantages.

    energy; geothermal sensors; energy harvesting; edge computing; IoT 1. Introduction
    Geothermal energy is characterized by two types, one with high enthalpy and the
    other with low enthalpy. High-enthalpy energy is found in specific regions and
    rock masses that contain high temperatures and high heat potential, especially
    volcanic areas and deep faults. High-enthalpy energy is used for power and heat
    generation, while low-enthalpy energy is used only for heat generation and can
    be found in most shallow rock mass zones around the world. Underground geothermal
    structures have been used for various applications, for example, electricity production
    or district heating. Heat pumps for geothermal applications and geothermal plants
    produce both electricity and hot water for district heating. To provide the data
    required for the proper functioning and control of systems, it is necessary to
    monitor various parameters within specific volumes of rock [1]. Monitoring the
    conditions of the rock environment provides the information required to manage
    and control processes to prolong the lifetimes of systems and avoid outages in
    operating underground geothermal structures [2]. To control a geothermal system,
    the key monitoring parameters are the fluid temperature, ambient rock environment
    temperature, volumetric flow rate, and physical characteristics of underground
    structures; minor monitoring parameters include scale formation [3] and slope
    movement [4]. Monitoring the specific characteristics and behaviors of underground
    structures assists in detecting problems and failures that prevent optimal system
    operation and energy management. The monitoring focus for an underground geothermal
    structure is dependent on the geothermal application area, examples of which include
    heat pumps [5], mines or wells [6], pipelines [7], reservoirs [8] and borehole
    exchangers [9]. Monitoring aims to determine or continuously update the status
    of key parameters necessary for the proper operation of an underground geothermal
    structure. To monitor these parameters, devices such as those connected to the
    Internet of Things (IoT) can be used. These devices must be able to monitor several
    variables and wirelessly transmit measured values to the cloud [10]. IoT technology
    is widely used and can also be applied to many areas of monitoring underground
    geothermal structures. This type of technology is especially useful in locations
    where wireless communications are required. These areas are generally difficult
    or impossible to connect to a power grid, and therefore, alternative power sources
    such as batteries or energy harvesting methods are necessary [11]. In this case,
    monitoring devices must consume low amounts of energy, and suitable technologies
    with powering constraints, for example, low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technology,
    are therefore required. LPWAN technology was designed for reliable wireless data
    transmission with minimal power consumption. The commonly used LPWAN technologies
    include LoRaWAN, Sigfox and NB-IoT [12]. Table 1 lists recently published reviews
    of monitoring performed in specific underground geothermal structures. The listed
    studies examined a variety of systems that monitor different parameters, are deployed
    in specific types of geothermal structures and employ IoT technology. In Refs.
    [13,14,15], the authors discussed temperature monitoring and the temperature measurement
    methods, sensors and tools suitable for geothermal applications, such as vertical
    borehole heat exchangers, downholes and power plant devices. In Refs. [1,2], the
    authors discussed flow rate sensing techniques, providing comprehensive descriptions
    and comparisons of the two-phase flow monitoring methods applied in geothermal
    pipelines and geothermal wells. In addition to monitoring temperature and flow
    parameters, geothermal applications also use sensors to monitor mechanical parameters,
    such as scale formation [3] and slope movement [4]. In Ref. [4], the authors provided
    an overview of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) combined with IoT devices for monitoring
    slopes. The monitoring of other mechanical parameters has not yet been summarized
    in any recently published survey. The authors of [7,9] discussed the use of WSNs
    in underground coal mine monitoring systems and methods for monitoring leakage
    and sinkholes. The motivation for the current review is the lack of comprehensive
    studies on IoT applications for monitoring underground geothermal structures.
    To our best knowledge, no reviews have summarized the use of IoT technology in
    relation to monitoring geothermal parameters, such as temperature, pressure, flow
    rate and mechanical parameters. Table 1. Overview of surveys related to monitoring
    underground geothermal structures. The main contributions of this article are:
    A comprehensive analysis of methods for monitoring specific parameters in underground
    geothermal structures and the currently available monitoring technologies and
    sensors; A description of the state-of-the-art IoT technologies and sensors suitable
    for deployment in underground geothermal structures, including sensor node designs,
    energy harvesting methods, communication interfaces and cloud services; Proposals
    for new, promising application areas and innovations in technology for monitoring
    underground geothermal structures. The scheme of the article is illustrated in
    Figure 1. The article discusses sensing methods for detecting temperature, flow
    rate and other mechanical parameters in underground structures. Section 2 of the
    article provides a deeper analysis of the methods applied to monitor these parameters.
    Section 3 discusses IoT technology, data transmission and cloud services in relation
    to the systems deployed to monitor underground geothermal structures. Section
    4 discusses research challenges. Section 5 summarizes and concludes the article.
    Figure 1. Scheme of the article: sensing parameters in underground structures,
    IoT technology and cloud processing. 2. Sensor Technologies Sensors containing
    specific technologies are necessary for monitoring the subterranean environment
    of a geothermal structure. The ability to continuously monitor such structures
    at a reasonable cost is desirable in terms of improving efficiency and allowing
    the immediate detection of problems and faults [2]. This section examines the
    technologies for measuring temperature, flow rate and other mechanical parameters,
    such as pressure and slope movement, in these specific environments. 2.1. Temperature
    Measurement Temperature monitoring technologies enable the study of geological
    processes and the investigation of subsurface thermal properties. Table 2 lists
    some of the temperature measurement technologies applied in complex systems. The
    principles of these specific temperature measurement technologies are further
    described in this subsection. Table 2. Overview of technologies applied to temperature
    measurement in underground geothermal structures. Depending on the installation
    method, temperature sensing technologies fall into two categories: static installations
    and mobile sensing. Static installation systems are fixed and permanently installed.
    These systems include optical fibres, distributed temperature sensing (DTS) technology,
    thermistors and thermocouples. Static installation sensors are used for temperature
    measurements in geothermal wells, downholes or borehole heat exchangers. Mobile
    sensing uses wireless technology and is not fixed or permanently installed. Mobile
    sensing systems are used, for example, to monitor the temperature of geothermal
    fluid in borehole heat exchangers. 2.1.1. Static Installations Static installations
    deploy thermistors, thermocouples, fibre optic thermometers or DTS technology.
    Thermistors are sensors capable of measuring high-quality temperatureâdepth information
    from boreholes up to 100 m or more below the Earthâs surface [19]. Thermocouples
    are installed to measure temperatures at the inlets and outlets of geothermal
    heat exchangers [20]. Wired optical sensors provide continuous measurements with
    high-resolution temperature profiles along pipelines [18] and are often attached
    to the outer surface of the pipe wall or located within the underground structure
    itself [21]. DTS technology is used for temperature measurements along various
    types of underground geothermal structures. Measurements are based on detecting
    light from Rayleigh, Raman or Brillouin backscattering phenomena [15]. DTS technology
    measures temperatures using optical fibres that provide a continuous temperature
    distribution profile of the entire cable [22]. This method is able to achieve
    highly accurate temperature measurements over long distances, up to 30 km. This
    technology is very sensitive for monitoring temperature, as it is characterized
    by a spatial resolution of 1 m at an accuracy of Â±1 â C and a resolution of 0.01
    â C [23]. This technology works by detecting thermal changes along the optical
    fibre that manifest as molecular or lattice vibrations in the material. In addition,
    thermal changes cause local changes in the refractive index. Changes in the refractive
    index are then manifested as the inelastic scattering of transmitted light. Molecular
    vibrations at high frequencies around 10 THz cause Raman scattering. Brillouin
    scattering is caused by low-frequency vibrations in the range of 10 to 30 GHz.
    This scattering can then be used to measure the temperature along the fibre [24].
    DTS technology is widely applied to inspect subsurface thermal properties. DTS
    can be used in various applications, such as investigating the hydro-geological
    conditions of downholes or determining the geological properties of aquifers.
    Especially in deep boreholes, its application provides notable benefits over discrete-point
    temperature measurements [5]. DTS is widely used in long-term monitoring to determine
    the contribution of groundwater flow and thermophysical characteristics to subsurface
    heat transfer and storage [16]. This type of technology is used to monitor the
    conditions inside well bores to optimize expensive workover procedures [17]. 2.1.2.
    Mobile Sensing Mobile sensing systems such as Geoball and Geosniff are small spheres
    25 mm in diameter and 8 g in weight that have an embedded transceiver, microcontroller,
    temperature sensor and power supply. These miniaturized sensors are inserted into
    the pipes of a geothermal underground structure and are then carried by the thermal
    fluid in order to monitor the thermal parameters of the fluid along the borehole
    heat exchanger. These sensor systems allow the acquisition of information on the
    thermal properties of the subsurface geological structure and their influence
    on the thermal properties of the borehole. A wireless data processing unit sends
    data and acquires configurational information prior to measurement and retrieves
    measured thermal data from a sensor inside the U-tube of the borehole heat exchanger
    [18]. These types of sensors have demonstrable advantages of higher reliability
    and lower cost over standard sensors and fibre optics [13]. Fibre optic technologies
    such as high-temperature distributed acoustic sensors [25] are used for their
    unparalleled ability to discriminate and measure environmental variables such
    as strain, temperature and vibrations [26]. The purpose of the method is to improve
    the conventional thermal response test [18]. Compared to Pt100 sensors, mobile
    sensing systems are highly accurate and do not produce large, statistically significant
    measurement deviations [13]. 2.2. Flow Rate Measurement The measurement of liquid
    and gaseous flow rates in underground geothermal structures is performed to manage
    and control various processes [1]. Flow rate measurement in geothermal structures
    applies techniques that differ in complexity, cost and the capability to perform
    real-time surveys. Table 3 summarizes the differences between individual methods
    of flow rate measurement on the basis of four attributes: the ability to provide
    real-time measurements (real-time), the operational status of the underground
    structure (out of operation), direct contact between the medium and the sensing
    device (direct contact) and a list of the types of underground structures where
    the flow rate measurement method is used (application location). Table 3. Summary
    of methods for measuring flow rate in underground geothermal structures. In summary,
    each method, except for the calorimeter and tracer dilution, provides real-time
    measurements. The calorimeter and lip pressure are the only two methods used in
    decommissioned underground structures. Each method, except for compression load
    cells and the ultrasonic meter, has direct contact with the sensing medium. The
    application location includes geothermal power plants, open Venturi channels,
    geothermal pipelines and geothermal wells. Flow rate measurement can apply single
    flow rate methods or hybrid flow rate methods. Hybrid methods combine two basic
    methods to reduce any deficiencies that single methods may introduce. Hybrid techniques
    are frequently used to measure two-phase fluid flow. The following subsections
    describe the individual methods listed in Table 3 for flow rate measurement and
    estimation. 2.2.1. Ultrasonic Meter Ultrasonic meters are devices that are composed
    of a receiver and transmitter and that use the phenomenon of sonic waves. The
    device is attached to the exterior of a pipeline and used to determine the flow
    rate. The transmitted waves are detected by the receiver. The modification of
    the wave frequency and amplitude is indicative of the properties of the fluid/gas.
    There exist several methods that can be used to calculate the final flow rate,
    for example, based on the time of transit of the sonic waves [36], the Doppler
    Effect [37], cross-correlation [37] or changes in wave amplitude [38]. Ultrasonic
    sensors are used in many areas of industry. In underground structures, at least
    three sensors are used at different points [28], for example, at different locations
    along a channel [27]. The advantage of an ultrasonic meter is that it does not
    come into contact with the fluid/gas medium and is positioned on the outside of
    the pipeline [27]. 2.2.2. Calorimeter Figure 2 depicts a typical calorimeter configuration
    that is used to measure enthalpy in geothermal wells in addition to the flow rate.
    This method works on the principle of measuring the time that it takes to fill
    a partially water-filled tank with geothermal fluid. The time is then used to
    calculate the flow rate [2]. Figure 2. Block diagram of a calorimeter setup. The
    disadvantage of this technique is that it requires the geothermal well to halt
    production [1]. Another disadvantage is that it is only suitable for low-output
    wells, as the amount of discharge is restricted by the volume of the tank that
    can be delivered to the site. Another constraint is the limit on the maximum measurable
    flow rate of 10 kg/s [39]. Measuring the flow rate in this manner is also very
    noisy and cannot be performed in real time [40]. 2.2.3. Sharp-Edged Orifice Plate
    An orifice plate is a well-known alternative method that has been implemented
    in several geothermal applications all over the world [1]. The orifice plate consists
    of a central circular hole that measures differential pressure by establishing
    pressure taps upstream and downstream. Figure 3 [2] illustrates a typical orifice
    plate setup. Figure 3. Orifice plate installed at a geothermal well. Orifice plates
    are frequently used to measure the flow of geothermal steam; extracting steam
    from the ground is the first crucial step in converting geothermal steam energy
    into electricity [41]. The devices also measure brine flow [2] and can identify
    the mass flow rate of the well [42]. 2.2.4. Tracer Dilution Method Tracer dilution
    is used to measure the enthalpy of geothermal fluid in addition to the flow rate.
    To determine the well performance, two different chemical tracers are injected
    into the fluid stream in the pipe and mixed with water. Fluid tracers disperse
    into a liquid phase; gas tracers mainly disperse into a gaseous phase, but also
    partially into a liquid phase. Samples of vapor and water are then collected from
    the pipeline and tested to identify the dilution of the tracer in both phases
    and the background concentration. From this information, the flow rate and enthalpy
    can be estimated [1]. The advantages of this method are the ability to keep the
    well online during measurement and the lack of an effect on the flow; they are
    outweighed, however, by the large costs for lab testing [1], the poor precision
    of the results [2] and the lack of real-time measurement capability [43]. 2.2.5.
    Lip Pressure Method This method entails the use of a small hole measuring 6 mm
    in diameter and located 6 mm away from the pipe lip. Empirical measurements of
    pressure are taken at this hole, and using the size of the pipe, an empirical
    correlation is used to calculate the flow rate. Enthalpy and the total flow can
    be determined based on information obtained from the flow rate and lip pressure
    [32]. Two arrangements are available for this method, one in which fluid is discharged
    into the atmosphere through a vertical lip pressure pipe and another in which
    it is discharged horizontally into a silencer on a horizontal lip pressure pipe.
    In the vertical arrangement, the pipe is connected to the top valve in a vertical
    position, and the fluidâs enthalpy must be estimated based on the temperature
    of the primary supply zone [1]. In the horizontal arrangement, the pipe discharges
    into the silencer, and the weir box located immediately downstream of the silencer
    monitors the water flow. The methodâs advantages include low running costs and
    real-time measurements, but it also has drawbacks, such as high noise levels and
    interruptions in operations during measurement [44]. 2.2.6. Venturi Tube The Venturi
    tube method is based on Bernoulliâs principle and is a very precise method used
    for measuring steam flow [34]. The method can be used for online or real-time
    measurement, and its main advantage is a low and constant pressure drop. Its construction
    is complicated and expensive, however [2,45]. 2.2.7. Coriolis Flow Meter A Coriolis
    flow meter consists of two curved tubes that vibrate symmetrically. The flow of
    the medium is directed through these pipes, and any local changes in the vibration
    frequency due to the flow rate are monitored. To calculate the flow rate, changes
    in the frequency are measured by sensors, and empirical correlations are applied.
    Although this method enables real-time and online measurement, it is highly inaccurate
    and therefore an unpopular option [2,46]. 2.2.8. Compression Load Cells Compression
    load cells use strain gauge sensors to determine the flow rate and enthalpy in
    geothermal pipelines and wells. The sensor is based on the piezoelectric effect,
    which is based on converting the mechanical power applied by the object (pipeline,
    well) to an electrostatic signal. The load sensor is positioned above a platform
    (compression type, Figure 4a) or above the object (tension type, Figure 4b) [35,47].
    Figure 4. Compression load cell method: An installation in a geothermal pipeline.
    (a) The load sensor is positioned above a platform. (b) The load sensor is positioned
    above an object. The advantages of this method are simple construction, measurement
    in real time and the lack of direct contact with the fluid medium [35,47]. 2.2.9.
    Separator with Orifice Plate and Silencer This hybrid method determines the flow
    of a two-phase fluid and consists of a separator, an orifice plate and a silencer
    with a weir. The fluid separates into vapor and a liquid in a separator vessel
    at a pressure greater than atmospheric. The separate steam flow is measured with
    an orifice plate, while the separate liquid flow is determined with either an
    orifice plate or a silencer with a weir box. Because orifice plates may produce
    unstable measurements due to flash evaporation induced in the liquid, silencers
    are more commonly used for measuring the separate liquid flow. The separator method
    is expensive to implement, but it enables high accuracy and online or real-time
    measurement [1,2]. 2.3. Measurement of Mechanical Parameters In addition to measuring
    temperature and flow, monitoring mechanical parameters in underground structures
    is important for detecting potential risks. Underground structures such as borehole
    heat exchangers must be regularly checked for pressure to ensure that no fluid
    leaks into the subsurface, groundwater or process water. Geothermal applications
    also use sensors to monitor other mechanical parameters, such as scale formation
    [3] and slope movement [4]. Mechanical parameters can be monitored with fibre-optic
    sensors [48], tilt sensors [4], ultrasonic sensors [49], vibrating wire sensors
    [50] or strain gauges [51]. Table 4 summarizes these sensing methods and their
    areas of application. Table 4. Summary of methods for measuring mechanical parameters.
    Pressure is measured with strain gauges or optical sensors, usually in geothermal
    wells or reservoirs. Optical sensors are also used to detect the formation of
    scale in geothermal brine. In boreholes, ultrasonic sensors are deployed to detect
    breakouts, and tilt sensors measure information about slope movement and deformation.
    Vibrating wire sensors are used to measure stress in structures at geothermal
    or oil drilling wells. 2.3.1. Optical Sensors Fibre-optic cables are used to measure
    pressure in geothermal wells [48]. Distributed acoustic sensing systems use fibre-optic
    cables to measure oscillatory strain rates caused by oscillatory pressure changes.
    These cables have significant advantages in being able to withstand harsh environments;
    they can be deployed for geomechanical, seismic and temperature monitoring [53].
    Fibre-optic cables are capable of operating at temperatures up to 315 â C and
    20 MPa [51]. 2.3.2. Vibrating Wire Sensors Vibrating wire sensors can measure
    the stresses occurring in a structure and its surrounding environment. It is a
    frequency sensor with an internal metal string as the sensing component. The sensorâs
    output frequency signal changes according to the the stress on the metal string.
    The device is durable and simple in design and has a strong anti-interference
    ability [50]. The metal string vibrates as a result of excitation when an external
    force is applied, changing the tension in the wire, which changes the frequency
    of vibrations. The dependence between the vibration conductor and the vibration
    frequency is calculated from the equation: ð= 1 2ð¿ ð¹ ð â â â , (1) where m is
    the mass of the vibrating string, L is the length of the vibrating string, F indicates
    the pressure on the sensor, and f is the resonant frequency of the string [54].
    These sensors are suitable for applications in geothermal or oil drilling wells
    [52]. 2.3.3. Tilt Sensors These sensors are used to obtain information about slope
    movements and deformations. Tilt monitoring systems combine tilt sensors and LPWAN
    technology to measure slope movement and transmit collected data wirelessly. Data
    from tilt sensors and other additional parameters (rainfall data, groundwater
    level) are analyzed to predict slope failures [55]. 3. IoT Devices and Cloud Processing
    IoT technology is a growing research area. In 2021, the Web of ScienceTM library
    contained more than 13,000 indexed papers on the topic of IoT technology [56].
    IoT technologies are deployed in many application areas, such as environmental
    monitoring [10], smart factories [57,58], smart cities [59] and smart grids [11,60].
    Although IoT technology is widely deployed, only a few research articles cover
    the monitoring of geothermal energy installations. Fundamentally, an IoT device
    is an internet connection. In the context of this article, an IoT device is a
    small item of electronic equipment that is able to supervise several variables
    and transmit measured values to the cloud via a wireless connection. Figure 5
    illustrates the principal scheme of the IoT architecture and application areas.
    Figure 5. IoT architecture and application domains. Figure 6 shows a block diagram
    of a typical IoT solution. IoT devices generally contain the following parts:
    a power supply module, a sensory subsystem, a microcontroller (MCU), a transmission
    module (RF module) and data storage. Each block can be assembled from various
    components according to system requirements and deployment characteristics. Figure
    6. Block diagram of a typical IoT solution. 3.1. IoT Nodes An integral component
    of an IoT device is a power supply. To supply the device with power, many options
    are available, the simplest being a connection to a power grid; an example is
    an AC power monitoring module with an integrated wireless connection via WiFi
    [61]. Power grids provide sources of stable and reliable energy, but they are
    mainly only available in urban locations. Another option is the use of a battery
    [62]. Batteries also provide stable sources of energy, but they require periodic
    charging and replacement. Battery-powered IoT devices can also be designed to
    operate for long life spans [10]. Another option for supplying electricity is
    through energy harvesting methods [63]. Characterized by many advantages, energy
    harvesting modules are small, maintenance-free and inexpensive solutions, especially
    compared to battery-powered options. The main drawback of energy harvesting solutions,
    however, is limited available energy. Table 5 summarizes IoT power supply technologies
    according to the energy transducer type. Selecting a suitable power supply type
    is strongly dependent on the target application [64]. In many geothermal applications
    [65], power grids are readily available, and generally, no energy harvesting or
    battery technologies are required. However, IoT measurement devices are often
    deployed directly in geothermal boreholes, where the installation of a wired power
    supply is complicated [66]. Energy harvesting is therefore a highly suitable technology
    for these applications. Table 5. SoA of IoT power supply technologies. Energy
    harvesting using solar panels or small wind turbines is suitable only for surface
    deployment, where sunlight and wind are sufficient [72]. For underground structures,
    thermoelectric generators (TEGs) have significant potential as an energy harvesting
    technology. TEGs exploit the Seebeck effect to generate energy through temperature
    differentials [73]. The main challenge with this technology is finding suitable
    temperature differences or gradients directly in a borehole for exposure to the
    TEG. Acting as brains, microcontrollers (MCUs) regulate IoT node behavior, such
    as sensor data collection, local memory storage and data transmission to the cloud.
    Since IoT nodes generally have only limited energy for operation [74], MCUs are
    also responsible for energy management. Naturally, they are selected from ultra-low-power
    series offered by silicon manufacturers to minimize the MCUâs own consumption.
    Examples of these series types are STM32L [75], NXP K32L [76] and Microchip PIC32MZ
    [77]. Specific models are selected according to the application, and generally,
    higher performance requires more energy. ULP (ultra-low-power) MCUs typically
    offer multiple switchable modes of operation and the ability to switch off individual
    peripherals (clock gating) for effective power management. Switching off all components
    not currently in use thus reduces the overall energy consumption [78,79]. IoT
    nodes are usually equipped with local data storage, which can be used for either
    the long-term storage of accumulated values or short-term storage (as a memory
    buffer). As with other IoT node components, power consumption is one of the crucial
    parameters in selecting memory and is dependent on the type of memory used. Ferroelectric
    Random-Access Memory (FRAM) is a type of memory technology with low energy consumption,
    but its data capacity is limited to a few dozen MB. At the other end of the spectrum
    of data capacity is flash memory, commonly found in SD cards, with maximum capacities
    of hundreds of GB. The disadvantage of flash memory is higher energy consumption
    and significantly slower data write speeds. Data storage memory may form either
    a discrete component in an IoT node or be integrated into the MCU [80]. 3.2. Data
    Transmission Technologies Underground geothermal structures are often situated
    in remote areas where no easy connection to the internet for monitoring purposes
    is possible (i.e., WiFi or Ethernet). In these areas, monitoring equipment is
    usually powered by batteries or energy obtained by harvesting (see Section 3.1),
    and energy consumption must be low. GSM/LTE technology does not satisfy this low-power
    requirement, but LPWAN technology is ideal. These types of systems were developed
    for the IoT and feature reliable, long-distance wireless data transmission (1â40
    km), with minimal power consumption. The commonly used LPWAN technologies are
    currently LoRa, Sigfox and NB-IoT [81,82]. 3.2.1. LoRaWAN LoRaWAN is a wireless
    communication protocol based on the patented LoRa technology. The patent was granted
    in 2014 to Semtec, and the first LoRaWAN protocol specification was released in
    2015. The standards are now managed by the LoRa Alliance. Transceivers have a
    low sensitivity to noise and thus a greater range thanks to forward error correction
    (FEC), together with a proprietary spread spectrum modulation technique. The operating
    radio frequency varies according to the region of deployment and its local regulations,
    but it always belongs to a license-free band. A LoRaWAN network typically includes
    the following network elements. The end device is application-dependent, provides
    control or measurement functions (sensor, actuator) and is wirelessly connected
    to the LoRaWAN network via a gateway. The gateway receives and forwards messages
    (usually via the internet) to a network server. The network server provides network
    management functions such as data processing, message deduplication, configuration
    and scheduling, bandwidth regulation and message routing. The application server
    remotely collects data from sensors and transmits commands to device actuators
    [83,84]. The technology has a range of 5 km (urban) to 20 km (rural) [85]. Depending
    on the configuration, the payload can contain up to 242 bytes of data [86]. LoRa
    defines three device classes: Class AâEnd devices can start transmission (uplink)
    at any time, while the base station transmits data only for a short time once
    the uplink is complete. Each uplink time slot is followed by two downlink slots,
    after which the receiver switches off. This class has the lowest energy demand.
    Class BâDevices have the same uplink and downlink slots as Class A, plus one extra
    downlink slot. The end-device receiver is switched on for this extra slot according
    to a predetermined schedule. The base station is programmed to follow this schedule.
    Class CâReceivers can listen continuously, except in transmit mode. This class
    of device is ideal for applications that require many downlink transmissions because
    the base station broadcasts at any time. Its disadvantage is higher power consumption
    [87]. 3.2.2. Sigfox Sigfox is a company based in France providing network connectivity
    within the IoT through its eponymous wireless technology. It was founded in 2010
    with a focus on low-consumption IoT devices that require the transmission of small
    amounts of data over longer distances [87]. Sigfox can operate in either simplex
    (one-way) or half-duplex (two-way) mode. An upload packet can comprise a maximum
    of 12 bytes of payload, while a download packet is limited to 8 bytes of payload.
    The operational range of this network reaches up to 40 km [87,88]. Such a value
    is achieved by combining several techniques. The first of them is the use of ultra-narrowband
    (UNB); such a narrow frequency selection increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
    A combination of Gaussian Frequency-Shift Keying (GFSK) and Differential Binary
    Phase-Shift Keying (DBPSK) is used for signal modulation in the physical layer.
    Delivery reliability is increased by sending the same message multiple times.
    Duplicate messages are sent on randomly selected frequencies with random delays
    from the first one. Sigfox relies on a license-free band reserved for industrial,
    scientific and medical (ISM) purposes. The specific frequency then depends on
    the deployment region. In addition to the maximum transmission power, the regulation
    also sets a duty cycle limit. Because of this, the end device is limited to 140
    messages per day in the case of sending and 4 messages in the case of receiving
    [88,89]. 3.2.3. NB-IoT Narrowband IoT is another LPWAN technology available today.
    It was developed by the 3GPP organization, with the first NB-IoT standard defined
    in 2016. This communication network is based on and is directly linked to the
    GSM/LTE cellular network standard. Modifications consist of changes in the original
    technology to best meet the requirements for IoT end-device network connectivity
    (such as low power consumption, low cost or the transmission of small amounts
    of data over longer distances). Compared to the LTE protocol, NB-IoT only allows
    half-duplex at a bandwidth of 180 kHz. Modulation schemes more complex than ð/4
    âQPSK are not supported. Not all parts of the E-UTRA specification are implemented
    either. Thanks to this aspect, the receiver is simpler and therefore less energy-demanding
    and lower in price [90,91,92]. The standard allows transmission using both unlicensed
    bands and licensed GSM/LTE brands in one of the following operation modes: Stand-alone
    operationâWhen using this mode, NB-IoT is the exclusive user of the selected frequency
    band. Guard-band operationâIn this mode, NB-IoT data are transmitted through an
    unused frequency band next to, or between, LTE bands (the so-called guard band).
    In-band operationâLTE data together with NB-IoT data share the same carrier. This
    can have a negative impact on the quality of both services [90,93]. The existing
    LTE network provider often only needs to modify the software to operate the NB-IoT
    network if it decides to deploy the guard-band or in-band model. This approach
    is also recommended by the 3GPP organization itself. The usable distance of the
    IoT node from the base station is up to 10 km [85]. The payload of one message
    is limited to 1600 bytes. There is no limit on the number of messages transferred
    per day when using the licensed band. NB-IoT relies, like the LTE protocol, on
    orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to transmit downlink messages.
    In the case of uplink transactions, OFDM is replaced by single-carrier frequency
    division multiple access (SC-FDMA). This reduces the value of the peak-to-average
    power ratio (PAPR) [94]. 3.2.4. Comparison of LPWANs The information in Table
    6 indicates that the individual technologies differ, although they are all specific
    to LPWANs. The key advantage of Sigfox over its competitors is the size of the
    area covered by a single base station, up to 40 km in rural areas. Under the same
    conditions, the main competitors achieve a coverage of approximately 20 km with
    LoRaWAN and 10 km with NB-IoT [95]. NB-IoT is also limited to areas with LTE networks.
    In terms of deployment, LoRaWAN allows the creation of private networks, while
    the other two technologies rely only on the provider deployment model [96]. NB-IoT
    is aligned with applications that require the transfer of large amounts of data
    or that need a low-latency network. Sigfox offers a payload volume approximately
    100 times lower than NB-IoT (maximum 1600 B). LoRaWAN provides a payload of 242
    B, and latency can be reduced using class C devices [86]. All of these technologies
    offer sleep modes to reduce the energy consumption of a transmitter to a minimum
    when the end device is not transmitting. NB-IoT nodes have higher power requirements
    than LoRaWAN and Sigfox, drawing the highest peak currents during transmission
    through the use of QPSK modulation in combination with OFDM-FDMA and QoS handling
    [85,97]. LoRaWAN and Sigfox are ALOHA-based and operate on unlicensed frequencies.
    NB-IoT relies on licensed LTE bands, which ensure higher QoS through regulation,
    but a consequence is a higher price for the end customer due to license fees [95].
    Table 6. Summary of LPWAN parameters [85,95,97]. 3.3. Cloud Services Cloud services
    involve infrastructure, platforms and software delivered on demand to companies
    and customers via the internet. Cloud services employ cloud computing solutions
    and do not encumber the hardware or software of devices accessing the service.
    The variety of available cloud services may disguise the level of an organizationâs
    ownership of the stack [98]. For clarity, cloud service models can be grouped
    into four main categories according to how they are managed (Figure 7). Figure
    7. Cloud model types: on premises, infrastructure as a service, platform as a
    service and software as a service. On Premises (Private Cloud)âThis cloud model
    is in fact not a genuine cloud service. It is suitable for users who require data
    protection and security and are willing to pay more for the service. Because data
    and all infrastructure, including software and hardware, are on the premises,
    the system is managed by the userâs own IT team. In-house maintenance requirements
    and fixed scalability mean that this type of deployment is the most expensive.
    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)âIaaS allows customers to outsource equipment
    such as storage, servers and network resources. The remainder of the stack is
    managed by the customer. The disadvantage of IaaS is the potential for vendor
    outages and the cost of training personnel to manage new infrastructure. Platform
    as a Service (PaaS)âThe provider manages everything as in IaaS but is also responsible
    for the base software and operating system, middleware and database. The drawback
    of PaaS is potential security problems and greater dependency on the vendor. Software
    as a Service (SaaS)âThis model completely transfers the management of all components
    to the vendor service provider [99,100]. Table 7 summarizes the features of three
    widely used cloud services: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure IoT, Google
    Cloud Platform [101,102,103], and IBM cloud [104]. Generally, these state-of-the-art
    cloud providers dedicate broad support to services and applications designed for
    the IoT and standard communication interfaces for connecting IoT devices to a
    cloud. They also feature powerful scalable data storage and support for big data
    analysis. Table 7. Summary of parameters and features offered by major cloud providers.
    3.4. Edge Computing Edge computing is a method with enormous potential for IoT
    geothermal monitoring. Edge computing allows some computation and data storage
    to be moved closer to the source of the data, enabling the optimization of IoT
    node transmissions. Geothermal installations make use of a specific IoT domain.
    Table 8 provides a summary of some service-oriented architectures for edge computing
    methods suitable for use in geothermal installations. Early warning systems can
    monitor a geothermal installation and evaluate hazardous states. An example of
    this type of solution is an early warning system for railway bridges [105]. Edge
    computing also allows the real-time monitoring of natural disasters such as fires
    [106] or earthquakes [107]. These solutions tolerate multiple node faults and
    partial network disruptions and store all data locally, which also enhances privacy
    [107]. Table 8. SoA for edge computing methods. Other types of edge computing
    methods manage data compression. Data compression performed locally significantly
    reduces the volume of data for transmission [109]. Data compression can be lossy
    or lossless. The scientific literature on data compression in edge computing is
    vast [110]. 3.5. IoT in Geothermal Applications IoT is chosen over telemetry in
    geothermal installations due to its ability to provide continuous monitoring and
    real-time data collection of temperature, pressure, and other mechanical parameters.
    IoT devices are equipped with sensors that can collect data from various points
    in the geothermal installation, providing a more comprehensive view of the systemâs
    performance. Additionally, IoT devices can transmit data wirelessly, eliminating
    the need for wired connections and reducing installation and maintenance costs
    [111]. Comparison of Telemetry Systems and IoT Device is sumarized in Table 9.
    Table 9. Comparison of Telemetry Systems and IoT Devices. Compared to telemetry,
    IoT has several advantages in terms of temperature, pressure, or mechanical parameter
    measurement. Firstly, IoT devices can collect data from multiple sensors simultaneously,
    providing a more comprehensive view of the systemâs performance [112]. Secondly,
    IoT devices can transmit data wirelessly, eliminating the need for wired connections
    and reducing installation and maintenance costs [113]. Thirdly, IoT devices can
    be programmed to send alerts when certain parameters exceed predefined thresholds,
    allowing for early detection of potential issues and timely intervention. The
    lack or improper use of telemetry in geothermal installations can lead to several
    problems. Firstly, telemetry systems can be expensive to install and maintain,
    especially in remote locations. Secondly, telemetry systems can be prone to signal
    interference and data loss, leading to inaccurate or incomplete data. Thirdly,
    telemetry systems can be difficult to integrate with other monitoring systems,
    leading to data silos and reduced visibility of the systemâs performance [114].
    In contrast, IoT devices are relatively inexpensive and easy to install and maintain.
    Additionally, IoT devices can be integrated with other monitoring systems, providing
    a more comprehensive view of the systemâs performance [115]. Finally, IoT devices
    can be programmed to send alerts when certain parameters exceed predefined thresholds,
    allowing for early detection of potential issues and timely intervention. In summary,
    IoT is chosen over telemetry in geothermal installations due to its ability to
    provide continuous monitoring and real-time data collection of temperature, pressure,
    and other mechanical parameters. IoT devices are equipped with sensors that can
    collect data from various points in the geothermal installation, providing a more
    comprehensive view of the systemâs performance. Additionally, IoT devices can
    transmit data wirelessly, eliminating the need for wired connections and reducing
    installation and maintenance costs. The lack or improper use of telemetry in geothermal
    installations can lead to several problems, including high costs, signal interference,
    and data silos [116]. IoT devices have the potential to revolutionize geothermal
    monitoring, but they also pose several challenges that need to be addressed to
    ensure reliable operation and minimize the generation of erroneous data. Here
    are some strategies to confront these challenges: Ensure reliable operation: To
    ensure reliable operation of IoT devices in geothermal installations, it is essential
    to choose devices that are designed to withstand the harsh environmental conditions
    of the installation. This includes selecting devices that are rated for high temperatures,
    humidity, and corrosion resistance. Additionally, regular maintenance and calibration
    of the devices can help ensure reliable operation [117]. Prevent malfunctions
    due to exceeding recommended temperature ranges: IoT devices can malfunction if
    they are exposed to temperatures outside their recommended range. To prevent this,
    it is essential to monitor the temperature of the devices and the surrounding
    environment and take appropriate measures to prevent overheating. This can include
    installing cooling systems or using devices with built-in temperature sensors
    and automatic shut-off features. Minimize the generation of erroneous data: IoT
    devices can generate erroneous data due to factors such as sensor drift, signal
    interference, and data loss. To minimize this, it is essential to use high-quality
    sensors and ensure that the devices are properly calibrated and maintained [118].
    Additionally, data validation and error correction algorithms can be used to identify
    and correct erroneous data. Transition from elementary sensors to more complex
    MCU-based IoT devices: The transition from elementary sensors to more complex
    MCU-based IoT devices can bring several implications, including increased complexity,
    higher costs, and the need for specialized expertise. To address these challenges,
    it is essential to carefully evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of using MCU-based
    IoT devices and ensure that the devices are properly designed, installed, and
    maintained. Additionally, training and support for personnel responsible for operating
    and maintaining the devices can help ensure their reliable operation. In summary,
    confronting the challenges posed by IoT devices in geothermal installations requires
    careful consideration of the devicesâ design, installation, and maintenance. Strategies
    such as ensuring reliable operation, preventing malfunctions due to exceeding
    recommended temperature ranges, minimizing the generation of erroneous data, and
    carefully evaluating the transition from elementary sensors to more complex MCU-based
    IoT devices can help ensure the successful implementation of IoT-based geothermal
    monitoring systems [119]. In the construction and electronic placement of geothermal
    IoT monitoring systems, careful consideration should be given to the potential
    high temperatures of an environment or a medium [120]. Geothermal environments
    can expose the equipment to extreme heat, which can pose challenges to the proper
    functioning of electronic components. It is crucial to protect the silicon parts
    used in these systems, as they have maximum temperature limits that should not
    be exceeded. Adequate measures and safeguards must be implemented to ensure the
    longevity and reliable operation of IoT devices in such high-temperature conditions
    [121]. The advance of IoT technology has brought about a push for standardization
    in various aspects of its implementation. Standardization includes the adoption
    of common LPWAN communication protocols, the use of standardized components on
    the cloud side, and the establishment of methodologies for creating IoT nodes
    [122]. This standardization effort aims to streamline and simplify the development
    and deployment process of IoT systems. In contrast, telemetry systems often lack
    standardization and are often proprietary, leading to increased expenses and longer
    development cycles. The absence of standardized approaches in telemetry results
    in prolonged development times and delays in bringing products to market, ultimately
    driving up costs. By embracing standardization in IoT, organizations can benefit
    from reduced development costs, shorter time to market, and improved interoperability
    between different IoT devices and systems [123]. 4. Research Challenges This article
    describes options for geothermal monitoring and recent trends in the application
    of IoT technologies. This section discusses research challenges for potential
    applications of IoT sensor technology in underground geothermal structures to
    extend current installations and deliver more robust solutions for future installations.
    Innovations for specific equipment technologies (sensors, edge-computing, energy
    harvesting, IoT nodes, etc.) are also discussed. Figure 8 illustrates the research
    challenges outlined in this article, labeled with four different signs. Undesirable
    states are tagged with a warning sign (exclamation mark within a triangle), innovations
    for improving the design of future applications are tagged with a dollar sign,
    innovations for technology are tagged with a light bulb, and innovations for the
    cloud are tagged with gear wheels. The figure highlights key research challenges
    and provides ideas for addressing them in the field. Implementation of advanced
    sensors holds the potential to significantly enhance the design and performance
    of geothermal installations. The figure introducing the content of the following
    sections. The Section 4.1 on new potential applications explores emerging uses
    of technology in innovative ways, opening up exciting possibilities for industries
    and individuals alike. Technology innovations discussed in the Section 4.2 showcase
    the latest advancements and breakthroughs that have the potential to revolutionize
    various fields and create new opportunities for development. Figure 8. Research
    challenges for various problematic areas. 4.1. New Potential Applications Underground
    geothermal structures are designed for long-term use; therefore, the proper management
    of the installationâs operational life is required. As mentioned in Section 1,
    eliminating undesirable states (e.g., thermal imbalance, the absence of turbulent
    fluid flow and the unforced operation of heat pumps during cooling) during the
    operation of an underground geothermal structure is beneficial. Long-term monitoring
    with IoT sensors can facilitate the optimal operation of underground geothermal
    structures, prolong system endurance and optimize standard operations. Table 10
    lists several undesirable states and potential solutions. Table 10. Undesirable
    states and potential solutions. Thermal imbalance during the operation of an underground
    geothermal structure is caused by the heterogeneity of the rock environment. To
    eliminate thermal imbalances, the monitoring of individual boreholes is a potential
    solution. The absence of turbulent fluid flow can be avoided with higher flow
    rates. Low flow rates in the geothermal structure can be specifically addressed
    with turbocollectors (pipes with spiral ribbing), which guarantee that the Reynolds
    number of the flow is exceeded. The last undesirable state is the operation of
    the heat pump during cooling. The thermal stress of the pile must be monitored
    for mechanical property stability (strength and deformation parameters). A change
    in concrete temperature due to heat transfer (charging and discharging) produces
    a change in the stresses experienced by the concrete in the pile. This change
    in stress consequently produces volumetric changes in the concrete. In critical
    cases, the brittle failure of the concrete occurs, and the bearing capacity of
    the pile as a whole is reduced. Another benefit of the long-term monitoring of
    currently deployed geothermal installations is the continuous data collection
    of operational parameters. Large datasets describing geothermal installation behavior
    during regular operation and also non-standard conditions can be created. IoT
    technologies allow the extensive monitoring of existing structures, and therefore,
    the knowledge base will contain new and important information that is useful for
    design work for future underground geothermal structures. Table 11 lists parameters
    whose monitoring could aid in producing improved designs for future applications.
    Table 11. List of parameters whose monitoring could aid in producing improved
    designs for future applications. Utilizing measurement and monitoring techniques
    for borehole properties, particularly temperature and flow rate, presents an opportunity
    to enhance future applications. Flow rate monitoring could aid in techno-economic
    optimization through the selection of suitable pipe diameters and optimal energy
    consumption models. Temperature monitoring could be applied to optimize designs
    for the well depth (the length of the borehole). Many underground geothermal structure
    walls do not permit the use of sensor technologies due to wired sensor limitations
    or the absence of power grid connections. Such installations may include sensors
    that are installed during the construction process and are subsequently inaccessible
    or insular systems where a power supply connection is difficult to build. Energy
    harvesting technologies have excellent potential as solutions for such cases through
    their ability to generate electricity for sensor operation directly from the ambient
    environment. IoT monitoring systems for geothermal structures can be powered by
    harvesting energy from the environment. Table 12 lists energy harvesting methods
    suitable for powering these types of IoT sensors. The most promising energy harvesting
    method is the use of TEG technology, whose main advantage is the absence of moving
    mechanical parts and the possibility of placing the device directly into a borehole.
    Another option is to use water pipeline energy harvesting. This type of energy
    harvesting system can also be placed into a borehole, but only inside a pipe.
    Water pipeline energy harvesting modules also have the disadvantage of moving
    mechanical parts. The third energy harvesting option is solar and wind energy.
    Solar panels or wind turbines cannot be placed into boreholes, however, and must
    be located on the surface and be connected to the IoT sensor inside the borehole
    with wires. Table 12. List of energy harvesting methods suitable for powering
    sensors used to monitor underground geothermal structure parameters. 4.2. Technological
    Innovations The process of constructing an underground geothermal structure requires
    many technological components. Most of these components do not support direct
    monitoring, and deploying sensors in existing installations is therefore problematic.
    The next generation of components could integrate physical sensors directly into
    equipment. A solution such as this not only permits IoT monitoring but also provides
    a sensory interface for any type of analytical equipment, such as DTS technology.
    In principle, components with embedded sensors add value at minimal cost. Technological
    improvements would involve the installation of optical fibres directly into the
    underground geothermal structure and the positioning of temperature sensors in
    the borehole at various depths. These improvements have the potential benefit
    of optimizing the efficiency of the installation. While this solution addresses
    certain aspects of the problem, such as improving functionality or performance,
    it does not still provide a comprehensive solution for maintenance or replacement
    requirements. In order to ensure sustained effectiveness, it is crucial to consider
    the high reliability of components involved. Moreover, a key expectation for this
    solution is its ability to support long-term deployment without significant interruptions
    or failures. Energy harvesting transducers can power IoT sensors, but the transducer
    design must be optimized and aligned with the installation to establish the best
    energy gains. Thermoelectric generators are a promising technology, but they must
    be deployed in environments with effective temperature gradients. Temperature
    gradients for thermoelectric generator purposes are found in environments that
    fluctuate between medium and ambient temperatures, between warm and cold branches,
    and between shallow soil (50 cm below ground) and ambient air. Underground monitoring
    generally faces problems with data transmission. Regular connections with the
    cloud can be solved in two ways: a transmission antenna can be placed on the surface,
    or new types of underground antennae suitable for IoT communications must be developed.
    The final research challenge involves innovating the communication interface and
    cloud data processing. Computationally limited, low-power IoT nodes require effective
    data transmission solutions that can be delivered through edge computing techniques
    or event-based approaches (Table 13). Table 13. Summary of edge computing techniques.
    Edge computing allows metadata analysis in situ and provides significant benefits
    for data transmission; for example, IoT nodes monitoring a geothermal energy installation
    conserve energy and resources by transmitting data only if a hazardous state arises.
    The data transmission time and the volume of data stored in the cloud are reduced
    by storing raw sensor data locally, and the use of cloud computational resources
    is minimized. IoT monitoring systems designed for the real-time collection of
    data from geothermal energy installations can also be optimized with edge computing
    data compression methods to reduce the total volume of transmitted data. Truncated
    data can also be uploaded when energy for transmission is limited, followed by
    detailed data transmission in the future when energy is sufficient. 5. Conclusions
    This article identifies potential research directions for new applications in
    geothermal energy installations and innovations for IoT monitoring technology
    and cloud services. The article contributes an overview of state-of-the-art principles
    in the design of monitoring systems for geothermal energy installations and a
    review of the sensor technologies available for use with IoT devices and cloud
    data processing. Suitable sensor equipment includes devices for monitoring temperature,
    flow rates and other mechanical parameters. The article also reviews IoT technologies,
    sensor node composition, options for data transmission and the features of cloud
    services. Future research targets and several possible directions are outlined
    in the Research Challenges section. State-of-the-art solutions provide the potential
    for new applications that address several problematic conditions in geothermal
    energy installations. Monitoring systems allow the collection of important datasets
    that can be used to improve future designs of geothermal energy installations.
    Several technological innovation techniques could also improve the operation of
    IoT monitoring devices. Operating nodes in monitoring systems can be powered from
    harvested ambient energy to prolong the operating time and reduce costs. Edge
    computing methods can optimize data transmission and power consumption and provide
    early warnings of faulty or inefficient operating conditions in geothermal energy
    installations. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.P.; investigation, T.K.

    1 INTRODUCTION Digital services and products'' core values and possibilities are
    amplified, creating exponentially growing potential in the digital transformation
    era. Humans and autonomous devices may cooperate beyond their physical vicinity
    using digital technologyâdecision-making benefits from increased sharing and access
    to enterprise knowledge-base. In addition, a surge of digital services, processes,
    economy, and goods push knowledge-based decision-making for digital Enterprise
    Architectures (EA) and Expert Systems (ES), including consumer devices, social
    networks, and intelligent transportation (Moulahi et al. (2023), Deepa and Prabadevi
    (2020)). A plethora of physical devices are interconnected in current enterprise
    architectures through wireless Internet data transfer providing a global communications
    environment. Enterprise systems are becoming more significant and sophisticated
    as the Internet of Things (IoT) and other new sustainable technologies hit the
    market (Zimmermann et al. (2018), Arshad et al. (2022)). Artificial intelligence,
    sophisticated analytics, and Machine Learning (ML) are all supported by an IoT-based
    platform solution. As EA evolve and become more sustainable, decision analytics
    will become an increasingly important decision support tool Ebo et al. (2020)).
    Using these expert systems and methods, software and system architecture managers
    and engineers may become part of a sustainable company, including robust and constantly
    growing service-oriented architectures and platforms that empower and promote
    new or significantly improved strategies Anwar (2023). With the help of other
    technologies such as sensors, embedded systems, big data analytics, and ML, IoT
    can make any activity smarter by making it easier to collect, analyze, and distribute
    massive data Khanna et al. (2023). IoT can automate learning and prediction processes
    (of machines) through experiences. Enterprise IoT is an IoT variation that has
    had the most influence on business (Liu, Feng, et al. (2020), Moqurrab et al.
    (2022b)). Various front- and back-office operations are associated with an enterprise.
    Using IoT and business, an organization''s actions may be automated, as smart
    devices can be embedded in enterprise things and connect, allowing organizations
    to complete systems and processes with or without direct human intervention. By
    doing so, an enterprise will see increased productivity and a decrease in the
    number of manual processes. Therefore, IoT became a modern network model offering
    transparent and open services (Schreieck et al. (2016), Tariq, Asim, and Al-Obeidat
    (2019)). Many intelligent devices, such as cell phones, sensors, and other intelligent
    devices, are linked via IoT. These intelligent devices can interact and share
    information between them. Thus, sophisticated structures may be built to improve
    people''s lives by gathering and reviewing data on these IoT devices to understand
    the environment better. Examples may include human body movements, machine condition
    diagnostics, health tracking, position, and systemic monitoring. As IoT is widely
    used and becomes standard, huge sensors and devices produce massive data (Huang
    et al. (2016), Hassan et al. (2023), Abbas et al. (2019)). Numerous IoT applications
    are built to provide users with more detailed and fine-grained services in EA
    (Ilin et al. (2019), Sharma & Wang et al. (2017). The massive data in IoT may
    be analyzed and processed further to provide Integrated services to the providers
    and consumers. New IoT applications include various data-based processing approaches
    in the EA domain to effectively use broad IoT sensing data (Tariq, Asim, and Al-Obeidat
    (2019), Masuda et al. (2021)). Within the last decade, ML has become a huge hit
    with advancements in the graphics processing unit, cloud computing, and other
    hardware advances in technology to support EA (Klaine et al. (2017)). Figure 1
    presents an overview of ML significance and role in IoT-based EA. The most paradigmatic
    algorithms in ML have been used in many areas, including decision-making (Zhao
    et al. (2020), Seyedzadeh et al. (2020), Valdivia et al. (2021)) and intelligent
    control (Matei et al. (2021), Yuan et al. (2020), Tofighbakhsh (2020)), computer
    graphics (Zoni (2020), Janai et al. (2020), Arya et al. (2020)), voice recognition
    (Honnavalli and Shylaja (2021), KuÅmierczyk et al. (2020), Shankar et al. (2020)),
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) (Moon et al. (2021), Van Rousselt (2021), Prudhvi
    et al. (2021)), and computer vision (Tien et al. (2021), Willman (2021), Falk
    et al. (2020)). Likewise, ML will also give computer networks a potential advantage.
    Some researchers investigated how ML can deal with networking issues such as traffic
    engineering (Verma (2021), Rezaei and Liu (2020), Shafiq et al. (2020)), routing
    (Hussain et al. (2021), Refonaa and Lakshmi (2021), Mandal et al. (2021)), allocation
    of resources (Liu, Yu, et al. (2020), Zhang et al. (2020), Pesavento and Bahlke
    (2020)), and security (Montasari et al. (2021), Francia and El-Sheikh (2021),
    Khan et al. (2021)). FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The role of ML
    in IoT-based enterprise architectures. This survey aims to highlight the significance
    of ML algorithms concerning IoT applications, such as smart homes, smart healthcare,
    smart cities, smart grids, and smart agriculture. To the best of our knowledge,
    no state-of-the-art survey covers all these applications under one umbrella. As
    shown in Table 1, existing surveys mainly focus on a single application, such
    as security (Patnaik et al. (2021), Al-Garadi et al. (2020), Chaabouni et al.

    2 ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE IN THE CONTEXT OF IOT AND ML Leveraging the promise
    of IoT and ML technologies within enterprises requires a strong enterprise architecture.
    A strong EA offers a well-organized framework for developing, implementing, and
    overseeing intricate systems that include IoT gadgets and ML algorithms. This
    section details the importance of business architecture in the context of IoT-based
    systems and examines its essential elements and factors. 2.1 Significance of enterprise
    architecture The plan of action for coordinating company goals with technological
    capabilities is called enterprise architecture (MÃ¶hring et al. (2023), Gaurav
    et al. (2023)). EA provides enterprises with various advantages in the field of
    IoT and ML, including: Integration and Interoperability: The seamless integration
    of numerous IoT devices, sensors, and ML algorithms across diverse business units
    is made possible by enterprise architecture. It guarantees data flow and compatibility
    between various systems, enabling a comprehensive understanding of organizational
    processes (Ali et al. (2020)). Scalability and Flexibility: Enterprise architecture
    offers a flexible and scalable infrastructure, given the fast use of IoT devices
    and developing ML approaches. It enables businesses to adjust to shifting technological
    environments, handle growing data quantities, and adopt new ML algorithms as they
    become available (Tariq, Khan, and Asim (2021)). Efficiency and Optimization:
    Enterprise architectural concepts can help firms maximize their efforts in IoT
    and ML. It makes it possible to find duplicates, eliminate silos, and streamline
    procedures, improving operational effectiveness and lowering costs (Escamilla-GarcÃ­a
    et al. (2020)). Security and Privacy: In IoT and ML deployments, enterprise architecture
    frameworks give security and privacy a top priority (Farooq et al. (2022), Moqurrab
    et al. (2021)). It provides strong security measures, data governance regulations,
    and compliance standards to safeguard private data and reduce dangers related
    to connected devices and ML algorithms (Moqurrab et al. (2022b)). 2.2 Key components
    of enterprise architecture Enterprise architecture includes several crucial elements
    that must be present to integrate IoT and ML technologies successfully: Business
    architecture: Company''s strategic objectives, operational procedures, and functional
    requirements are outlined in this component (Sari and Hindarto (2023)). It pinpoints
    the applications where IoT and ML can add considerable value and harmonizes technological
    ambitions with corporate goals. Data architecture: IoT and ML systems are built
    around data. The gathering, storing, integrating, and analytics of data are the
    main topics of the data architecture component. Addressing data quality issues,
    interoperability, and real-time processing provides ML algorithms with a solid
    foundation (MÃ¶hring et al. (2023)). Technology architecture: Technology architecture
    includes networking, hardware, and software to support IoT and ML applications
    (Jnr and Petersen (2023)). Building a strong technical environment considers connectivity,
    scalability, and device management. Application architecture: The creation and
    implementation of IoT and ML applications are the focus of this component. It
    outlines the architectural patterns, user interfaces, and integration techniques
    required to create smart applications that use ML techniques and communicate with
    IoT devices (Jnr and Petersen (2023)). Security architecture: Security architecture
    is essential because of the sensitivity of IoT data and the possible threats connected
    with ML algorithms. To safeguard enterprise systems and defend against cyber threats,
    it establishes security frameworks, authentication procedures, encryption standards,
    and intrusion detection systems (Bhatia et al. (2023)). 2.3 Considerations in
    enterprise architecture design Considerations for designing an efficient enterprise
    architecture for IoT and ML include the following: Interoperability and standards:
    The wide variety of IoT devices and ML algorithms makes it essential to ensure
    interoperability and adherence to standards. To provide seamless communication
    and data sharing between systems, enterprise architects must assess protocols,
    data formats, and integration frameworks (Mekala et al. (2023)). Scalability and
    performance: Enterprise architectures must grow due to the large volumes of data
    produced by IoT installations and ML algorithms. Architects should consider distributed
    computing, cloud-based options, and effective data processing strategies to achieve
    optimum performance (Farooq et al. (2022)). Data governance and ethics: Effective
    data governance processes are crucial to preserving data integrity, privacy, and
    ethical use of IoT-generated data (Samuel et al. (2023)). Enterprise architectures
    should include rules, methods, and standards for handling data, managing consent,
    and adhering to legal obligations. Integration with existing systems: Organizations
    often have established IT infrastructure and legacy systems. To minimize disruptions
    and maximize prior investments, enterprise architects must develop solutions that
    smoothly integrate IoT and ML technologies with current systems (Farooq et al.
    (2022)). Continuous adaptation and evolution: Landscapes in IoT and ML are changing
    quickly. For enterprise designs to stay up with new technologies, market trends,
    and shifting business needs, they must adopt a constant adaptation and development
    culture (Samuel et al. (2023)). The foundation for effective IoT and ML integration
    in enterprises is enterprise architecture. EA offers a methodical way to handle
    problems with integration, scalability, effectiveness, and security. Enterprise
    architects can build solid architectures that enable the realization of IoT-based
    solutions within the enterprise domain by considering important factors and design
    considerations. 3 ROLE OF MACHINE LEARNING IN THE INTERNET OF THINGS ML has had
    a profound impact on the way organizations approach business (Moh''d et al. (2020)).
    ML is a cutting-edge tool that distinguishes itself from numerous other approaches
    to hands-free operating. ML methods have made it feasible for engineers not to
    need explicit models to study certain aspects of an issue. There is no need for
    human intervention since the machines do it for themselves (ZdravkoviÄ et al.
    (2021)). ML has forced firms to rethink their decision-making processes in light
    of these new capabilities. ML uses past data as an example to make predictions
    from new information. One could establish a customer lifetime value on an e-Commerce
    merchant computer website for a forthcoming client meeting. It is possible to
    utilize ML if companies possess previous data on client interactions and net profits
    associated with purchasers (Kalita et al. (2021)). ML and IoT are causing a worldwide
    shift in the enterprise domain. Since information and data are massively generated,
    incorporating IoT information optimization concepts and methods has become inevitable.
    ML approaches reduce the amount of human effort required by learning. As a stand-alone
    device, ML identifies data patterns and makes independent decisions. Whenever
    a sensor collects data, someone on the backend must identify, analyze, and feed
    the information to the unit for decision-making, which ML can solve (Ali et al.
    (2020)). Now the question is, how precisely can an analyst deal with data flow
    when it is massive? Driverless cars, for example, must make quick decisions without
    relying on humans. That is where Artificial Intelligence (AI) comes in handy (Anyanwu
    (2021)). To determine the algorithm for a particular set of tasks, one must first
    determine what the work entails. Discovering unusual features, detecting systems,
    forecasting values and groupings, and extracting functions are only a few of the
    included tasks (ZdravkoviÄ et al. (2021)). It is considerably more straightforward
    for a newcomer to identify the correct algorithm if the datasets for different
    tasks are categorized. Clustering methods like K-means may concentrate on information
    system discoveries (Nair et al. (2020)). K-means was designed to cope with large
    amounts of data that include various forms of information. One-class support vector
    machines (SVM) and anomaly detection algorithms based on Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA) are appropriate for factors extracted through rare features (Jin et al.
    (2020)), this is just another example. ML and IoT are like playing buzzword bingo
    when analyzing specific use cases. This combination of ideas makes perfect sense,
    however. IoT is expected to generate more than 180 zettabytes of data by 2025
    (i.e., 180 trillion gigabytes/annum) (Liu, Mu, et al. (2021)), and ML is good
    at analyzing large datasets. ML is a science field that helps computers learn
    instead of being programmed exclusively (Shanthamallu et al. (2017)). A computer
    program is said to learn about a job T and a metric of success P from an E experience
    (Mitchell (1997)). While ML originated in computer science, numerous methods of
    vector quantification (Zou et al. (2021)) have been introduced for telecommunications
    and data transmission (Li & Yuan et al. (2020)), encoding and compression (Liu,
    Yao, and Du (2021), Spanias et al. (2006)). In computer science and data science,
    learning is focused on examples (data samples) and practice. Figure 2 illustrates
    an abstract view of an ML model of a sensor signal/data processing (Shanthamallu
    et al. (2017), Kovvali et al. (2013), Foutz et al. (2008), Spanias (2007)), including
    pre-processing, removal of noise, and segmentation. The signal is obtained and
    analyzed from the sensor in batches and frame-wise (Wichern et al. (2010)). The
    next step is the elimination of noise and the extraction of features. Lastly,
    the classification point will involve either an estimate or a judgment after the
    course. In the feature extraction process, features are usually extracted from
    the data. The set of classification features will need to be identified (Shanthamallu
    et al. (2017)). FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint An abstract view of
    the ML model. ML is essential in various areas with many substantial life-changing
    applications. Cloud computing makes it easier for ML to grow Sarangi et al. (2021).
    The importance of compressing and collecting data from sensors and extensive data
    has recently been at its peak (Tariq, Asim, et al. (2021), Tariq et al. (2020)).
    Innovative urban initiatives, smart healthcare management, connected defence,
    production, smart vehicles, supervision, and smart border enforcement have peculiarities
    and difficulties that make it challenging to produce optimum performance (Tariq,
    Asim, and Al-Obeidat (2019), Ali et al. (2023)). Statistical computing and data
    analysis are essential for transmitting and interpreting data and data analysis
    (Dumuid et al. (2020), Vives-Mestres and Casanova (2021)). ML algorithms have
    been widely categorized into three categories depending on the features, the form
    of learning, and the way data can be used (Chatterjee et al. (2021), Farooq et
    al. (2022)). Each category has its unique characteristics. Therefore, it is crucial
    to identify and simplify the functions of knowledge and learning models for IoT
    applications. There are four different forms of ML: supervised, unsupervised,
    semi-supervised, and augmented learning (Chen et al. (2020), Dhanaraj et al. (2020)).
    There are several variations between guided learning and unsupervised learning.
    By using prior information, a more reliable inference can be obtained. A supervised
    function is developed to approximate. Furthermore, taking into account relationships
    between variables, different versions of ML can be used. We have only input variables
    in unsupervised instruction (i.e., the labelled data). Unsupervised learning aims
    to infer natural structure from a set of given observations. It is used to create
    models of underlying data structure. Supervised learning can only function where
    sufficient labelled training data is available. Unsupervised classes have no ârightâ
    or âwrongâ labelsâsemi-supervised learning attempts to solve this challenge by
    combining supervised and unsupervised learning elements. There is multiple input
    data; however, only a handful are given a name. To fully grasp why IoT needs ML,
    subsequent Sections provide an in-depth analysis of different IoT applications,
    the role of ML in each application, and the Challenges, Open Issues, and Research
    Directions. In a nutshell, the satisfaction of customers, improved enterprise
    efficiency by assuring the safety of equipment, and improved accuracy are some
    of the fantastic ML benefits of IoT-enabled EA, including reducing lost income
    due to downtime, allowing for proper record keeping, predicting equipment failure
    before it happens, and delivering real-time data. 3.1 Challenges of ML in IoT
    IoT aims to gain insight into preferences and thought processes, foresee desirable
    and undesirable outcomes, and better handle previously uncontrollable circumstances.
    It depends on the data generated by millions of connected IoT devices to be analyzed
    efficiently and correctly by ML algorithms. Since IoT applications are ubiquitous,
    ML will be crucial in sifting through the massive amounts of data generated. In
    addition, embedded intelligence (EI) will serve as its backbone in realizing IoT
    applications'' goals. To improve efficiency, automation, performance, and connection,
    EI is the combination of intelligence and products (Sharma, Georgi, et al. (2022)).
    Contrary to the common belief, additional training data helps improve learning
    instead of just improving and building new ML algorithms Farooq et al. (2022).
    In IoT applications, dealing with big data is challenging. There will be a tsunami
    of information due to the billions of IoT devices linked to the Internet. Accordingly,
    IoT-based ML algorithms learn from the massive quantity of data. From an IoT angle,
    ML applications may be viewed keeping two key concerns: pattern recognition and
    data quality. ML improves learning by predicting from more accurate data and may
    also be used to improve data quality. However, before training ML-based algorithms
    for prediction, they may detect anomalies and fill in missing information. ML
    makes IoT smart and omnipresent. IoT is sometimes a synonym for âheterogeneousâ
    since it encompasses many things: devices, network technologies, protocols, diverse
    data, applications, and users. Given the diversity of IoT devices, ML faces several
    challenges, as mentioned below: IoT generates massive amounts of data (Tariq,
    Asim, and Al-Obeidat (2019)). However, not all this data is reliable, and some
    may even be skewed. These are the most critical factors influencing ML''s precision,
    effectiveness, and robustness in IoT. Not all IoT applications have access to
    large amounts of data from which ML may learn rapidly; yet, a large amount of
    little data are also created for these algorithms required to learn from scant
    data (Mohapatra and Panda (2019)). There is no guarantee that a sensing device
    will provide correct results (Arya et al. (2020)). Preparing data for ML includes
    processes like outlier identification and data imputation. The scope of possible
    IoT applications is vast. Every program has information that has its own set of
    characteristics. Although ML performs better than humans, data can be enormous
    and heterogeneous. Fine-tuning of data and ML algorithms is needed (Samuel et
    al. (2023)). Few academics, however, argue to the contrary. The question is, which
    is preferable? More complex ML algorithms to learn and predict better, larger
    data sets for deep learning models, or fewer data sets of higher quality? Despite
    the many studies devoted to the topic, ML experts cannot agree on a solution to
    this fundamental issue. Disruptive technologies like IoT provide a wealth of benefits
    for organizations and a great deal of danger; ML-enabled IoT can potentially eliminate
    millions of jobs (Nayak et al. (2022)). This reduction in the workforce can be
    detrimental to both the economy and society itself. 4 MACHINE LEARNING AND INTERNET
    OF THINGS A specific physical entity that can communicate through the Internet
    with some storage space and processing power for data collection purposes is termed
    a âthingâ and makes up as a collection the term IoT. Small actuators, cell phones,
    devices, sensors, almost anything could be âthings.â Objects, intricate devices
    like cell phones, and even necessities like food, works of art, furnishings, and
    buildings, to cite a few, are considered objects. IoT includes applications ranging
    from home automation to operating areas, including logistics, transport, medical
    facilities, defense, intelligence, and many more (Tariq, Khan, and Asim (2021)).
    This section details ML-based solutions in different IoT applications, challenges,
    open issues, and future research trends. 4.1 Smart agriculture Technology has
    played a crucial role in easing people''s everyday lives, while negative aspects
    should be tackled for their progress. The intelligent environmental systems aid
    in environmental management and monitoring (Tariq, Asim, and Al-Obeidat (2019)).
    Wind pollution has been a severe challenge all over the world. Intelligent environmental
    systems use sensors to track moisture, and heat, as illustrated in Figure 3. Farmers
    use intelligent farming systems to achieve higher crop yields with improved productivity.
    The adequate environment metrics for agriculture are collected via sensors and
    sent to servers for soil information, such as temperature, moisture, and control
    of pesticides. Such data are recorded to empower farmers about the soil quality
    and suitability for cultivation. Smart agriculture often contributes to the quality
    of crop production (Ahmed and Yadav (2023)). FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Smart agriculture. Agriculture automation is of much concern in every region.
    The world''s population is rising very quickly, and the demand for food rises
    dramatically with an increased population. More useful technology is needed above
    standard farmer strategies to satisfy the rising demand. Farmers must also hamper
    the soil by increasing the use of toxic pesticides. Pesticides has many impacts
    on cultivation; eventually, the soil remains infertile. Several researchers have
    proposed different solutions, such as a fuzzy logic-based framework PRITHVI (Prakash
    et al. (2013)). It was designed to grow soybeans. It came from agricultural agents,
    journals, and substantial knowledge of soybean crops. Fuzzy logic significantly
    influences researching the entire scheme and asking the farmer for guidance. The
    original intent of this scheme was to allow the farmers to improve their soybean
    yield. Another approach (Ravichandran and Koteeshwari (2016)) is to use Artificial
    Neural Networks (ANN) for crop prediction for mobile users. A mathematical projection
    model was used in this research. This framework''s predictive has three main components.
    The model''s precision is based on the hidden layersâ number. It developed and
    trained the ANN model with the aid of numerous algorithms. For example, it includes
    Rprop, Silva''s algorithm, Delta-bar-delta, and numerous others methodologies
    to find an appropriate configuration. A new approach was made to determine weeds
    from crops with image processing and neural networks in (Shahzadi et al. (2016)).
    In this way, it has a high degree of success rate of precision. This method forwards
    data to a server for changing field operations on the data. The server should
    be able to learn from its mistakes and make choices independently. This mechanism
    includes temperature, relative humidity, soil moisture, and light. The approach
    offers information about the area in question but does not detail a specific method.
    Patil and Thorat (2016) developed mechanisms that foresee the advent of grape
    disease. Any trace of an odd grape plant was caught before it extended to the
    rest of the grape vineyard. The machine employed numerous sensors, such as humidity,
    temperature, and moisture sensors in the vineyard to monitor and analyze crop
    conditions. IoT is needed to increase efficiency, competitiveness, and global
    market share and reduce labor costs. In Yahata et al. (2017), the authors automate
    plant phenotyping using hybrid ML technologies. Similarly, (Magomadov (2019),
    Reddy et al. (2020), and Salim and Mitton (2021)) used Deep Learning and ML-based
    solutions to augment smart agriculture. To increase productivity, IoT and agriculture
    work together for smart farming. Malavade and Akulwar (2016) analyzed how IoT
    could be used to develop agricultural systems. The different methods of using
    wireless sensor networks in the agriculture sector are described in this article.
    Many IEEE standards, including IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.15.1, ZigBee, and Personal
    Area Networks/Bluetooth (to mention a few), are required to use a sensor network
    successfully (Khan et al. (2020)). The authors addressed IPV6 for IP wireless
    connectivity and different hardware system for developing WSN (Abbas et al. (2019)).
    The technique used for crop management makes precise farming possible through
    WSN. Various data is captured and stored in the device by sensors. Using previous
    data from sensors, the device is trained, and future steps are initiated (Shiravale
    and Bhagat (2014)). In Gondchawar and Kawitkar (2016), remote operations are included
    as a smart robot (i.e., GPS-based) to carry out chores such as weaving, squirting,
    detecting humidity, scaring off birds or livestock, and vigilance. Secondly, smart
    irrigation uses smart power based on real-time field data. Thirdly, the intelligent
    operation of warehouses includes maintaining temperature, humidity, and warehouse
    theft detection. All Internet-connected remote smart devices or computers can
    manage these distinct operations. Furthermore, sensors, Wi-Fi or Zig-Bee modulus,
    micro-controller, and Raspberry Pi cameras and actuators are handled by automation.
    Thermal imaging gives farmers valuable data about the surface and temperature
    of their fields to help them make timely decisions. In the context of cloud-based
    thermal imaging, Roopaei et al. (2017) explored the use of the system to support
    irrigation by integrating equipment efficiency and identifying the areas where
    water is most needed. Failure to achieve consistency could hamper crop growth
    and help consolidate thermal imaging. Besides, thermal imaging has a wide application
    in agriculture. The use of robots in agriculture is discussed in Katariya et al.
    (2015). A robot is built to monitor the white track where their operation is required,
    and other surfaces are known as brown or black. The robot is used to spray pesticides,
    pour crops, supply water, and plow. Another knowledge-based monitoring module
    was developed by a group of researchers in Mohanraj et al. (2016). The authors
    discussed that IoT and cloud computing systems emphasize stable architecture for
    interactive information provision over 3G and Wi-Fi from fields. To construct
    a prototype with other required equipment, a TI CC 3200 (RFID) launchpad was used.

    architectures benefit traditional IoT infrastructures. The Knowledge Base is fabricated
    to store large, organized, and unstructured to support farmers or even people
    without previous agricultural knowledge (Halder and Singh (2021)). However, it
    takes work to find pertinent information about requirements. It is important to
    disseminate relevant knowledge and exact terms in a structured way. A knowledge-based
    system is made for improved extension and advisory services in farming improvements.
    Mohanraj et al. (2016) suggested the required distribution of water between crops
    without intervention by farmers. The water fed to farms should be of outstanding
    quality, either by smart irrigation or other traditional processes. Researchers
    in aquaculture and agriculture have begun applying IoT systems and artificial
    intelligence (AI) technologies. The water quality management system developed
    by  Encinas et al. (2017) uses state-of-the-art automation techniques. Conventional
    irrigation systems have a big issue with water wastage and water dearth. Egypt
    faces a water delivery challenge from the Nile River to its surrounding nations,
    for example. A lot of research has been conducted to solve irrigation issues.
    Several businesses have established a smart irrigation system based on sensors.
    These technologies were developed for optimum water use, quality control, and
    eliminate severe issues (Jha et al. (2019)). Soil humidity and heat sensors communicate
    straight to the field-based embedded components. Young farmers would spend much
    more on robotics than elderly farmers are interested in deploying. The adoption
    of modern technologies demands that they be adopted progressively over time. The
    agriculture sector is increasingly moving towards precision farming. Individual
    plants can be controlled based on their individual needs. Deep Learning (DL) and
    other expanded approaches differentiate between various plants and flowers, helping
    farmers produce more organic flowers. With the growth in various varieties of
    fruits and vegetables, we can see an increase in diversity (Zhang et al. (2016)).
    Strategies based on AI are growing exponentially and can be used by DL to diagnose
    diseases in plants or the presence of unwanted weeds in a plantation. Greenhouse
    farming requires human involvement. However, it can give a specific atmosphere
    to plants (Pawar et al. (2018)). Here, wireless technology and IoT innovations
    come into play to introduce weather forecasting and control on a farm without
    human intervention. The harvesting of crops and fruits can be achieved by using
    robots that efficiently operate around the clock. Robotics assist with many facets
    of farming, including seeding, planting, fertilization, spraying, harvesting,
    and tending. To execute the same job, hiring a reasonable number of staff is also
    appropriate. Thermal imaging may also provide monitoring using drones. Drones
    can monitor the field and offer continuous real-time information so that farmers
    know which area of the field is smaller and can only irrigate the affected area.
    The use of drones can ensure drought-free and ample water for crops, and crops
    will receive appropriate quantities of water. Many varied interconnected methods
    exist to create a viable ecosystem and maximize the growth of plants. 4.2 Smart
    cities The massive yet significant use of IoT applications can be seen in  smart
    cities (Ghafir et al. (2018)). Smart cities are primarily introduced to tackle
    particular problems associated with the welfare of people, for instance, traffic
    control, electricity, transport, and schooling. Smart cities rely heavily on intelligent
    sensors for data collection, such as temperature, moisture, toxicity, and road
    conditions, as depicted in Figure 4. Home sensors can monitor water supplies,
    schedules, pressure, and more. In particular, smart meters for payments of bills
    can be tracked by users (Ni et al. (2017)). Intelligent traffic control is another
    smart city technique that enables the control of traffic flow in reaction to the
    request, primarily with data gathered from numerous sensors in the area. These
    smart city implementations contribute to increasing data, creating various difficulties
    and problems, including data privacy and protection. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint A smart city. Smart cities strive to handle more sustainable urbanization
    and electricity use, preserve a green climate, and boost residents'' economic
    well-being and livelihoods. Smart cities expand people''s capacity to use new
    Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) effectively (Synowiec (2021)).
    ICT plays a significant role in planning, decision-making, execution, and deployment
    of efficient services and policies concerning the smart cities concept. This analysis
    focuses on the importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and ML as well as Deep
    Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in the development of intelligent cities (FranÃ§a
    et al. (2021)). The above mentioned methods effectively develop optimal strategies
    for multiple dynamic smart city concerns. IoT is now the most relevant and substantial
    aspect of most smart city applications responsible for producing a large amount
    of data (Al-Turjman (2017), Al-Turjman (2018)). Amid such large and dynamic details,
    the most reliable and successful behavior is difficult to assess correctly. The
    most sophisticated approaches, including ML, AI, and DRL can achieve maximal processing
    of big data (Liu et al. (2019), Allam and Dhunny (2019). Examples of smart city
    applications pose a host of security issues (Hashmi and Tariq (2023)). Zero-day
    attacks can occur in smart city networks due to the exploits of various protocols
    (Diro et al. (2021)). Second, is it necessary to evaluate a computer attack in
    a timely fashion so that operations of the smart city can be kept safe? Third,
    because IoT devices are space-restricted in smart cities, they have onboard functional
    limitations and transfer captured data for processing to the cloud. Current intrusion
    security systems do not consider IoT''s current infrastructure. Therefore, it
    is crucial to answer. Considering these issues, can we create an intrusion detection
    system (IDS) for IoT networks? The data derived from IoT architecture is processed
    in a cloud computing platform currently evolving (Tariq, Asim, and Khan (2019)).
    The data stored in the cloud is high, making computers leaned on to process this
    information slow and unstable. Fog computing gives a potential solution to these
    problems. In exchange, fog field computers can share a greater computing volume
    in the cloud. Fog computing will help improve internet connectivity networks by
    reducing energy and message overheads (Tariq et al. (2020)). Furthermore, fog
    computing minimizes latency, data management, and distribution problems. It would
    accelerate edge computing, seeking IoT-based technologies in smart city development.
    In Pahl and Aubet (2018), the authors developed an ML-based technique that can
    foresee service behavior in IoT environments based on machine interactions alone.
    The authors implemented K-means and BIRCH clustering methods in IoT systems. If
    data points in the center of a cluster are three times the standard deviation
    apart from the five standard deviation marks, they may be called one cluster.
    The paradigm used online networking training regimes to reform cluster development.
    In Alrashdi et al. (2019), LGL was a node recognition system to secure IoT. The
    authors used a random forest classifier that found only 12 of the 49 characteristics
    of the UNSW-NB15 dataset. These 12 attributes have been tested using the Extra
    Tree Classifier. In Vinayakumar et al. (2019), a DL algorithm was used to characterize
    the CICIDS 2017, NSL-KDD, WSN-DS, and UNSW-NB15 datasets for cyber assaults. The
    authors found DL to perform better than other ML methods. Several structures based
    on ensemble methods have been proposed in the literature for accuracy enhancement
    over base classifiers. In Shrivas and Dewangan (2014), a net-dependent collection
    was proposed to achieve selection performance and evaluated on both the NSL-KDD
    and KDD''99 datasets. Haq et al. (2020) combined Bayesian Network with the decision
    tree classifier. The researchers retrieved standard features through several techniques.
    In Zhou et al. (2020), the authors propose a correlation-based feature selection
    technique called CFS, accompanied by an ensemble-based feature selection technique
    combined to create the IDS model. They used NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS2017, and AWID datasets,
    achieving 99.8%, 99.5%, and 99.8% accuracy respectively on the mentioned datasets.
    Khraisat et al. (2019) combined C5 with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect
    intrusion. The study focused on identifying standard instructions and zero-day
    attacks on a Robot-IoT network using the Bot-IoT dataset (Koroniotis et al. (2019)).
    The study found that hybrid approaches increased intrusion detection accuracy
    compared to previous methods. The above strategies are based on a long-term target
    and can give rise to the right or nearest possible control decisions (Li et al.
    (2017)). The volume of training data can improve their training ability and thereby
    automatic decision-making effectiveness (Ramchurn et al. (2012)), while higher
    amounts of data can improve both accuracy and precision of the above mentioned
    techniques. In Allam and Newman (2018), the authors demonstrated that the idea
    of realizing smart cities and sophisticated data processing tools for big data
    emerged roughly at the same time. Table 4 summarizes a few ML-based state-of-the-art
    supporting smart cities. TABLE 4. Smart cities and machine learning. Ref. Year

    will be a significant influence on everyday lives because of AI. Advances in AI
    have profoundly influenced human culture. Moreover, this study indicates âhow
    AI policies and regulations can be developed to ensure social and economic developmentâ
    In Chackravarthy et al. (2018), the authors suggested a practical crime-detecting
    framework focused on DRL and neural networks to classify and interpret crime effectively.
    This paper offers an ML-based architecture that can predict the event before it
    occurs. DRL and AI play a crucial role in developing automated and smart infrastructure.
    Because of new advances, smart cities can be realized in the immediate future.
    In Veres and Moussa (2019), the authors explored the advantages of ML and DRL
    in advanced intelligent transportation systems, including traffic flow, fleet
    control, customer searching, channel prediction, crash probability, road pricing,
    and vehicle greening. DRL strategies and edge computing operate well in a smart
    city setting. In  Yi et al. (2019), the authors use a DRL-focused approach to
    forecast traffic intensity on a highway. This article suggested a new driving
    behavior model based on DRL. The authors researched Deep Long Short Term (DLST)
    memory and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for data processing of the Gyeongbu
    Expressway in South Korea. A smart city must have a reliable data transmission
    system to collect, process, and transfer data to assure trustworthy and effective
    digital services. Cybersecurity concerns have been growing because of the accessibility
    of electronic records (Tariq and Khan (2018)). Most of the data in smart cities
    comes from cloud-based IoT computers. Some researchers are concentrating on the
    protection of IoT devices in smart cities and suggest a Random Forest (RF) ML-based
    architecture called Anomaly Detection-loT (AD-IoT) framework (Alrashdi et al.
    (2019)). The proposed methodology will detect suspicious behaviors in a distributed
    fog architecture network using a ML process. Elsaeidy et al. (2017) introduced
    an innovative architecture for information security in a smart city that observes
    citizens'' digital rights and liberties. The new model detects intruders early
    based on data habits, keeping the network secure. This advanced smartphone technology
    is key to designing safe and confidential smart city applications (apps). In Alli
    and Alam (2019), the authors provided a stable computation offloading system in
    a Fog-Cloud-IoT environment for performance enhancement. The proposed architecture
    would protect IoT devices and gateways and allow computation offloading at viable
    nodes using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The suggested system is more robust
    than its competitors in latency minimization. The authors suggested the design
    of edge cognitive computing networks and ran an experimental analysis. In Aloqaily
    et al. (2019), the authors foresaw a cloud-based, high-performance, stable engine
    that could respond to cloud attacks and satisfy the users'' Quality of Services
    (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) objectives. An intrusion detection method
    consists of three stages: traffic data processing, compression, and classifying
    the system''s requests. Simulation findings have proven that the device operates
    effectively. In Manesh et al. (2019), the authors speak about how Global Positioning
    System (GPS) spoofing can solve public and military Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAVs).
    The authors recommended an ML-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for detecting
    GPS spoofing attacks. The proposed technologies define GPS signals based on specific
    parameters, including Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Doppler shift, and pseudo-range.
    This protocol detects GPS spoofing attacks with some likelihood and uncovers other
    GPS tampering. In Lin et al. (2019), the researchers used software to counter
    jamming attempts against airborne Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The proposed
    methodology can be implemented irrespective of the jammer''s geographic position,
    model, and channel. This methodology evaluates and optimizes UAV trajectories
    and power levels according to determining UAV power transmission efficiency. Apps
    focused on AI, ML, and DRL have demonstrated positive outcomes from the recent
    literature on smart cities. On the other hand, research and market experts should
    concentrate on the following open study problems to use the AI Salau et al. (2022),
    ML, and DRL methodology to attain overall benefit. For improved decision-making
    processes, a wide range of training samples (e.g., vehicle speed, location, distance
    between vehicles, riders'' actions, UAVs altitude, and relay base stations) are
    needed. The combined enhancement of UAV onboard technologies (e.g., storage, computation,
    filtering, and detecting and connectivity resources) and its flight path using
    ML will increase the performance of land vehicles-UAV communication. There is
    a precise use for the interoperability of Smart Grids (SG) and 5G network infrastructures
    for efficient communication of modern technologies. It is imperative to consider
    the delayed assessment when designing a contact network. Through ML and DRL, techniques
    that allow shifting to 5-and 6G connectivity technologies (Kamruzzaman (2023))
    while ensuring power supply can be created. In smart cities, security challenges
    are seen as an application issue. Due to a security breach, Smart Grids could
    face significant financial losses. Advancement and deployment of big data analytics
    would be key to smart cities'' cyber safety and support. 4.3 Smart homes People
    invest heavily in intelligent homes to be economical and manage their properties
    and lifestyles. Smart homes use actuators and sensors connected to devices and
    appliances connected remotely to home routers. They can interact with one another
    to continue providing clients with a user-friendly interface. Smart homes are
    equipped with sensors that continuously capture data from the environment and
    conduct smart functions such as intelligent switching on and off of lights, controlling
    gadgets and appliances, controlling temperature, and protecting, as shown in Figure
    5. However, data obtained is different because sensors have diverse natures. Sensors
    are deployed, for instance, to automatically detect dampness, gas leakage, fire
    detection, temperature changes, and for other reasons. The sensors are used in
    many ways. For example, if there is a gas leakage, it immediately disconnects
    gas appliances. Floor sensors are often installed to monitor the pressure and
    residents'' movements to detect any suspicious motion. Smart households also use
    tracking cameras to capture residents'' behavior or movement (Zhou et al. (2013)).
    Energy conservation is another essential feature that can be accomplished by applying
    smart home applications (Lyu et al. (2017)). ML is an effective technique for
    analyzing large amounts of data to identify patterns and trends. It involves learning
    from data by making decisions using trial and error. After training a ML algorithm
    on a set of walking and jogging data, an ML algorithm can classify future data
    points as walking or jogging (Qolomany et al. (2019)). ML allows a system to be
    developed quickly without any human input. One can create more self-driving and
    collaborative systems. ML enriches computer science''s strengths in analyzing
    big data in understanding semantics and context (Shah et al. (2021)). To employ
    enhancement strategies, pertinent information should be collected. ML algorithms
    can forecast future trends from data (Akhlaghi et al. (2021)). ML can also be
    used as a part that helps in pattern recognition (Subbarao et al. (2021)). Nest
    Thermostat1 provides an example of a device for setting a room''s temperature
    based on the occupant''s preferences. Many AI platforms can learn from humans
    and other complex behavior patterns. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    A smart home. Intelligent systems have been developed to solve unforeseen problems
    with adaptability (Li and Yuan (2020)). Researchers have explored strategies to
    ensure that people with dementia will learn how to perform a simple job. Altun
    et al. (2010) examined body-worn inertial and magnetic sensors for human activity
    detection. Mozer (1998) solved occupant comfort management in smart homes using
    neural networks and reinforcement learning. Hsu et al. (2007) suggest a TV recommendation
    system that uses a neural network based on user specifics such as expectations
    and moods. Fleury et al. (2009) proposed a smart home device focused on sensors
    that track and understand daily life and healthcare needs and procedures. Parnandi
    et al. (2009) propose an indoor localization strategy using sensors in smartphones.
    They monitor consumers'' positions. Verbert et al. (2017) used a Bayesian method
    to understand the faults in heating systems. The model has been established considering
    empirical evidence and an overabundance of knowledge. Humans have used Naive Bayes
    algorithms in daily task recognition. These have been useful in some cases. The
    Naive Bayes algorithm defines human actions, which can be associated with sensor
    readings. Fu et al. (2015) say that it is possible to estimate electricity use
    at buildings with sub-metered systems. The system monitors people and their motions
    in a network of nearby smart homes. Petersen et al. (2012) developed a framework
    based on wireless motion sensors for automatically classifying tourists. Fleury
    et al. (2009) researched a smart home that automatically performs different daily
    activities. The research was done to test various sensors using an infrared presence
    monitor, vibration detectors, temperature and humidity sensors, and microphones.
    Petersen et al. (2012) established a system that categorized behaviors automatically
    in real-time inside smart home environments. Chen and Lin (2014) suggested an
    ML tool using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
    to forecast energy consumption based on temperature and heater information. Badlani
    and Bhanot (2011) applied pattern recognition techniques to check energy efficiency
    in homes. Researchers have applied ANN to context-aware services in various contexts.
    The authors developed a model that estimates the probability of each part of the
    building being occupied or unoccupied in (Qolomany et al. (2019)). Ermes et al.
    (2008) combined ANN and apriori knowledge to classify common activities such as
    sitting, eating, walking, playing sports, waving, having sex, and hiking. This
    paper establishes a neural network to predict electricity production and power
    consumption. Fahad et al. (2014) proposed that product diversity could be leveraged
    using clustering. They applied the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to defend against
    harm. Bourobou and Yoo (2015) suggests an adaptive approach to predicting users''
    behavior in the smart world. They use cluster analysis to evaluate and rate user
    interactions and artificial neural networks to differentiate between users'' behaviors
    in their personal spaces. The key target of the learning issue of daily living
    activities'' patterns (LUCA) has been discussed by Lapalu et al. (2013). The researchers
    use the Flocking algorithm to detect members of a study group due to illness.
    Aicha et al. (2014) present a ML method for detecting unique visits in smart homes.
    The model integrates multiple data sources to reveal the deeper truth. Table 5
    summarizes a few ML-based state-of-the-art supporting smart homes. TABLE 5. Smart

    With intelligent homes, space heating, and safety problems can be monitored while
    residing at home, and patients can also be monitored. Advances in smart home technology
    has given rise to various issues that threaten security and safety of the technology
    itself. The industry needs in-depth analysis to overcome these difficulties and
    make smart homes a practical reality. The inherent potential of smart home systems
    is the potential for violation of information security. It can be used as a lever
    to jeopardize the privacy and security of people. Encryption, database encryption,
    and secure networks for smart homes are vital for protecting smart homes. Secondly,
    various sensors are used in smart homes, such as actuators, heat, pressure, and
    fire sensors. Processes, hardware, applications, and business models are the sameâcentralized
    computing methods for network sensing and sensor control, data interconnection
    facilities, and access protocols. The gateway node plays a vital role in the operation
    of wireless sensor networks as it sends information to remote servers (Hassan
    et al. (2021)). Home automation''s future depends on robust algorithms and efficient
    data compression. The smart home is a dynamic technology where many smart devices
    are connected to a network. The system must be carefully designed with integration
    in mind. For example, Light Emitting Diodes (LED) are a simple and affordable
    way to light up and minimize the cost of power and services. Other sensing systems
    in a smart home monitor people''s well-being, regulate vital signs as well as
    rest cycles. These innovative devices will use low voltage and stronger batteries.
    Engineers have designed power sources to meet the requirements of their applications.
    Modularity, interoperability, and remote control are defining features for developing
    smart home devices (Gonzalez-Gil et al. (2022)). Devices will have a range of
    choices open to the user. A standard and inter-operable interface for all home
    security systems is essential for smooth operation and navigation. While hardware-
    and IT-based, these devices should be compatible with promoting a common standard.
    AI can be used to automate home appliances to ensure the system''s self-sufficiency.
    AI technology will lead to more user-friendly homes. Therefore, there is a need
    for a method or methodology for using ML for decision-making and optimization.
    Standards should be created and implemented to simplify the implementation of
    AI features in smart homes. Much work needs to be done in smart homes, and it
    will benefit society as a whole through systems like a complete home automation
    system with in-home monitoring of its inhabitants. There seems to be a long way
    to go in constructing homes in the future. Different ML channels and tools are
    available to promote knowledge collection. It can still be challenging to select
    the right tool even though software for processing Big Data streaming has increased.
    Companies typically do not have a single solution to their diverse problems. Some
    toolkits can overlap and have their strengths and weaknesses. Practitioners with
    expertise in programming languages and system design will access several of these
    models (Barber and Krarti (2022)). Many citizens still lack knowledge of the different
    technology and platforms available. The reliability, data analysis speed, performance,
    support for various programming languages, and ease of use are essential considerations
    in selecting an ML tool. In a given case, one should consider the size and complexity
    of the data to be analyzed when implementing a specific toolkit. The library''s
    operating and programming framework affects search speed (Chi and Chi (2022)).
    Speed is not emphasized in all projects, however, speed is a significant factor.
    Coverage checks on how many ML algorithms inside the method are available. Due
    to the large quantities of data collected from heterogeneous sources, ML culture
    needs help interpreting and learning from multiple sources of data. Many existing
    large-data tools do not include all versions of all different ML algorithms (Farooq
    et al. (2022)). Most ML algorithms typically cover a couple of dozen different
    types of instruments. Elements such as initial setup work, ongoing maintenance,
    different programming, user interfaces, and online user guides are part of the
    usability aspect. The extensibility of the model means that partially finished
    structures can be assembled and made scalable (Kakandwar et al. (2023)). ML-based
    algorithms must be checked to see if they can meet these criteria. A variety of
    ML algorithms in many programming languages is available. Different languages,
    libraries, and software may be more efficient than others, depending on the job
    that needs to be done. Several computer systems need real-time data processing,
    which is why data cannot be archived. Stream treatment aims to analyze vast information
    in real-time and use the same data to handle this tremendous amount of information
    by using continuous queries like SQL-type queries. Streaming analysis is a crucial
    feature of stream processing for real-time streaming results accessibility. 4.4
    Smart grids Another realistic and dynamic implementation of IoT is intelligent
    grids (Jogunola et al. (2017)). Intelligent grids are now required to implement
    a distributed, user-funded, intelligent grid infrastructure to support a stable,
    effective, safe, and excellent power supply (Schulter (2010)). Smart grid infrastructure
    involves the intelligent two-way stream of information between user and operator.
    Sensors or IoT are connected (Jogunola et al. (2018)) at the customer''s location
    and power station. A sensor installed at the customer site provides data on energy
    usage, energy consumption habits, intelligent metering, prices, and other statistics.
    A depiction of the smart grid is shown in Figure 6. At grid stations sensors track
    transmission, distribution, supply disruption, area recognition, and customer
    data, to name just a few. All sensor readings are transmitted to their relative
    monitoring stations to produce reasonable alerts for intelligent and optimum electricity
    delivery. Explicit encryption and privacy solutions must be used to protect data
    protection and effectively implement smart grid infrastructures. FIGURE 6 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Smart grids. In green infrastructure, big data is
    a significant component of Smart Grid (SG) urban development. For the Smart City
    ecosystem''s growth, SG comes with the convergence of the new technology. Heterogeneous
    data from different sources are analyzed and exploited efficiently because of
    SG. There will be a chance to significantly strengthen smart cities through deep
    analytics and big data. The new trend reveals that SG use smart meter big data
    effectively on numerous apps such as load and forecast tests, baseline calculations,
    demand respondents, load clusters, and aggressive attacks on data deception (Karimipour
    et al. (2019), Du et al. (2019), Wang et al. (2018), Fallah et al. (2018), Tureczek
    et al. (2018)). SG primarily used for state estimation, dynamic model calibration,
    and transmission grid visualization. The authors in Ghorbanian et al. (2019) also
    performed an observational analysis using big data to find some critical applications.
    In Liang et al. (2019), the authors suggest a paradigm in which pooled energy
    is part of the SG structure to assist in finalizing logical government policies
    as a whole. A power management model would be helpful even in extreme weather
    and other unfavorable situation. The authors in Mujeeb, Javaid, et al. (2019)
    proposed a Deep Long Short Term Memory (DLSTM) order to estimate and evaluate
    energy prices and demand using actual electricity market data. The model efficiency
    was measured using Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and Mean Absolute
    Error (MAE) as standard metrics. The DLSTM framework excelled in terms of its
    ability to forecast costs. In Pallonetto et al. (2019), a simulation-based architecture
    was built to evaluate and study the efficacy of the Demand Response (DR) strategy
    under various cost attributes. Two Distributed Resonance (DR) protocols monitor
    and regulate a fluid delivery system with a heat pump and thermal storage. Lee
    et al. (2019) created a component model that guides the development of ML-based
    software. Their model may reduce the number of expensive implementations and expert
    information interrupts. In Prasad et al. (2019), the authors have suggested an
    intrusion detection and location finding system using ML and power line modems,
    where Power Line Communication (PLC) relays any information to avoid further damage.
    Oyewumi et al. (2019) set up a security proof of concept for SingTel devices.
    It is the application for a reconfigurable distributed network that emulates power
    facility data. The authors discuss different challenging problems law enforcement
    encounters in Singapore. The authors in  An et al. (2019) suggested a Deep-Q-Network
    Detection (DQND) technique that can effectively counter energy attacks in buildings.
    The protocol is applied in a central network to master the optimum Defensive Rollout
    technique. In Jenssen and Roverso (2019), the authors explored ways to inspect
    the power line using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) camera
    tracks electric lines continuously, thus, the energy is better protected. The
    authors in  Shihavuddin et al. (2019) used DRL-based UAV to track wind turbines.
    The authors develop a UAV analysis method to determine the damages suffered by
    UAV and provide options for mitigation. The forecasting of electricity in Singapore
    is significant, therefore, different models are available for predicting power
    charge (Kuster et al. (2017)) and Very Short-Term Load Forecasting (VSTLF) projections
    bill minutes to hours, forecasting an interim load. The load from Short-Term Load
    Forecasting (STLF) is estimated to be at least one week in advance  (Moon et al.
    (2018),  Zheng et al. (2017)). Long-Term Load Forecasting (LTLF) (Moon et al.
    (2018)) could evaluate the next year''s load. Precise forecasts are particularly
    daunting if the load is non-static (Zheng et al. (2017)). Furthermore, load patterns
    depend on multiple characteristics, including events, weather, and training. The
    problem in Tong et al. (2018) is that those ML algorithms were used for load prediction
    algorithms. However, the attributes trained a model directly without independent
    pre-processing. It is easy to estimate the daily charge on electrical grids. An
    efficient and accurate forecasting model is needed to conserve money and minimize
    costs. Predicting area and city energy is a major concern. The improvement of
    the energy sector depends on regional and urban growth. It involves a detailed
    electrical load measurement model. In Qiu et al. (2018), the authors emphasize
    the difficult developments in load''s non-linear estimation. Although weighing
    has been traditionally represented in the Single hidden layer Feed-forward Neural
    Networks (SLFN), it takes time, and its gradient rise is still reduced locally.
    In Zhang et al. (2019), the authors find that their varying features and price
    fluctuations rendered detailed price predictions exceedingly difficult. Numerous
    price prediction models exist in the literature, and the authors explain two major
    problems that affect the correctness of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). Secondly,
    hybrid models cannot produce stability and effectiveness in conjunction with linear
    and non-linear models. Renewable Energy Resources (RES) are unreliable in electricity
    generation. The basic series of periods was based on theories, including correlations
    and variance clustering. However, the price-to-base relationship needs to be addressed.
    The authors in Wang et al. (2017) have found that modern price prediction techniques
    cannot accommodate tremendous knowledge of pricing. Function compilation does
    not help to remove duplication. Advanced electricity pricing synchronization systems
    also lack in-depth security measures. In Angamuthu Chinnathambi et al. (2019),
    energy stability was handled. The authors highlighted that due to many visible
    and unseen factors, electricity rates in the power sector are highly stable, as
    is the rise in usage of SG. Precise short-term forecasting is expected, as it
    is relevant to purchasers and sellers. In (Samuel et al. (2020), Khalid et al.
    (2020), Mujeeb and Javaid (2019), Mujeeb, Alghamdi, et al. (2019), Naz, Javaid,
    et al. (2019), Naz, Javed, et al. (2019), Mujeeb, Javaid, et al. (2019)) the researchers
    pointed to price estimation concerns and load forecasts. Table 6 summarizes a
    few ML-based state-of-the-art supporting smart grids. TABLE 6. Smart grids and

    open issues, and research directions There has been a rise in decision-making
    trees in Moon et al. (2018). However, it is inefficient for an increased number
    of trees (i.e., if more than 128) due to the need for more resources to process.
    Simple Moving Average (SMA) forecasts load. However, it is prone to more uncertainty
    (i.e., sudden fluctuations) in a short time than in long distances. Therefore,
    SMA shows no positive effects in a brief time. In Tong et al. (2018), seasonal
    features are used and passed to train in Support Vector Regression (SVR). Overusing
    air conditioning and heating ensures that the summer and winter load increases.
    Big data spikes affect accuracy in summer and winter months and leads to unfortunate
    effects. However, in large-scale data, it may not perform well. In Qiu et al.
    (2017), data from the EMD transmitted to Deep Belief Network (DBN) was broken
    down. However, more machines and neural networks are required to predict load
    demands. However, an optimization technique can be used to improve a DL model''s
    efficiency because of its long time. The electric charge signal of the input is
    denoted by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) (Chen et al. (2018)), which is moved
    on to the prediction models, such as the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The Radial-Basis-Function
    (RBF) kernel with the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) kernel is merged into a mixed
    kernel. However, EMD has a mode mixing problem. ELM predicts one move since it
    is an autonomous FFNN, even though its parameters cannot be easily modified. In
    Qiu et al. (2018), Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used for the problem mixing
    mode for EMD systems. Researchers have dealt with this problem, however, their
    results tend take longer to compress. As new input patterns can be updated, expanded
    learning of the Randomized Version Functional Link (RVFL) model is being used.
    Weights are adjusted based on the error rate. Despite this, RVFL has a compelling
    potential to approximate as it takes time to compute. In Fan et al. (2019), short-
    and medium-term issues of customers'' appetite may be combined. In Zhang et al.
    (2018), advanced models are used to pick the best energy cost prediction inputs,
    while hybrid models will also have more considerations. The PSR-BSK model introduced
    in Fan et al. (2018) can be generalized to provide accurate demand estimates for
    policymakers regarding natural gas forecasts. Wang et al. (2016) were interested
    in choosing the correct responses to target results. However, the authors cannot
    prove it is the correct feedback for the model. Moreover, computational overhead
    and computational latency are high. Their results lack precise model outcomes
    in summer, fall, and spring because of high business instability. If phases are
    fewer than 10, multi-stage projections have good outcomes, otherwise, poor results
    arise. Additional considerations are also used in Zhang et al. (2019) to improve
    price prediction efficiency as data are available to market participants from
    public sources. In Lago et al. (2018), the proposed algorithm would maximize forecasting
    accuracy results using four more deep learning models, including auto-encoders.
    Expert guidance should also examine independent benchmarks. A whole variety of
    studies would also investigate the model''s effectiveness. The final prices were
    less accurate in (Keles et al. (2016)). The model currently yields a lower cost
    than it currently does. Price adjustments are just obviously accountable. ANN
    is determined from historical documents. The model has to be revised and equalized
    if the company''s configuration or large quantities of added capability are altered.
    Differential Evolution (DE) was used for tuning parameters in (Wang et al. (2017)).
    However, DE follows the local maximum. Furthermore, DE may only fill part of the
    screening area. The machine time and complexity of the instrument model are high.
    The exactness of the RF projection is slight. It reduces the accuracy of the measurement
    of waste. In the suggested model, large datasets may be analyzed (Angamuthu Chinnathambi
    et al. (2019)) to see how the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values are
    affected. 4.5 Smart healthcare In smart healthcare, significant operations are
    automated using e-health systems based on intelligent IoT (Sharma, Al-Wanain,
    et al. (2022), Nepal et al. (2015), Nayak et al. (2022)). Scientists have established
    a vast range of functional intelligent devices that track patients'' conditions
    of health on the whole, as shown in Figure 7. These instruments maintain a log
    of the patient''s health and give a warning in the event of unusual behavior.
    For instance, smart e-health systems help senior citizens and disabled people
    cope with their mobility. It is possible to use IoT devices to distantly capture
    and relay this information to significant health data collection and diagnostic
    centers (e.g., cardiovascular, blood pressure, and anatomy data) (Luong et al.
    (2016), Sharma, Al-Wanain, et al. (2022)). The most critical risks to healthcare
    facilities are data protection and privacy of the patient data collected for medical
    purposes (Djenouri et al. (2022), Tariq, Asim, and Al-Obeidat (2019)). FIGURE
    7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Smart healthcare. Identifying human behaviors
    is crucial to getting a smart health monitoring program. Smart health faces problems
    because of the expansive variety of acts and gestures. It is another tough challenge
    as IoT needs many interconnected data points. DL is a fantastic candidate to create
    solutions to this issue. The biggest challenge with using massive datasets in
    ML is to label appropriate data to train the algorithm properly (Moqurrab et al.
    (2022a)). DL has arisen as a well-developed technique for computing useful and
    meaningful representations of raw data without analytical or domain knowledge.
    As part of this effort, patients provide many highly sensitive details (Moqurrab
    et al. (2022a)). RL trains on a reward system algorithm. RL indicates what action
    the program agent should take in the specified case. Regarding RL, we should focus
    on the principle of edge caching for flow. However, there is room for strategy,
    and space for the state is very wide (Hu (2018)). DL is used on both low and high-dimension
    models. The large time-scale model was developed to reduce timesteps. Consequently,
    this model approximates the carrots and sticksitems that incentivize the organization
    to hold the tags present. However, its technological feature is too abstract,
    making it very hard to incorporate in the real world. With this concept as inspiration,
    Hu (2018) modeled PSO for a large time-scale model. PSO achieves optimum global
    results with easy integration and strong stability. However, setup and parameters
    are modified during random access scenarios. In large time-scale models, optimum
    solutions are then chosen. It should be noted that a large time-scale model appears
    to have controlled solutions, while a small time-scale model needs to be re-tuned.
    The present healthcare system has several consequences of using IoT and pervasive
    computing. With the help of implanting medical equipment and fitness trackers
    in hospital facilities (Tariq et al. (2020)), Smart Healthcare Systems (SHS) can
    track and manage the health status of all patients (Vaas (2013)). Smart healthcare
    will theoretically exacerbate patientsâ experience across several legal loopholes.
    Expanded advances in technology have been effective in healing individuals of
    diseases. Medical networks and advances in sensing and IoT technologies have increased
    in complexity and reach. It is just not restricted to medicinal uses only. It
    also includes implantable and wearable medical devices that monitor multiple facets
    of a patient''s everyday health. Bluetooth technology will offer a holistic approach
    to the early detection of diseases (Di Marco et al. (2021)). Smart healthcare
    is a vital service in terms of work and counseling to boost a person''s healthcare
    level. Recently, there have been many cybersecurity concerns in this domain. Healthcare
    data is in its early stage and potentially more reliable than financial services
    and retail data. In the last few years, experts sought to block pacemaker-wearing
    cancer patients from transmitting and receiving wireless messages. Researchers
    have shown numerous cyber-attacks on these Implantable Medical Devices (IMD) (Li
    et al. (2011)). IMD raises security issues and data privacy. Health problems should
    be closely attended to prevent permanent injuries. This area includes regulatory
    agencies, information technology communities, and medical equipment makers to
    comply fully. Many âdevice-specific solutionsâ are available to protect against
    ransomware attacks on mobile phones. A lightweight architecture called âREBELâ
    (Lamech and Plusquellic (2012)) was built to investigate hardware failures in
    several platforms. It is important to narrow the means of communication to mitigate
    the risk of accessing unauthorized interaction. Near Field Connectivity and Radio
    Frequency Identification (RFID) may also be used as they are used for limited
    communication. Near-Field IDentification (NFID) (Freudenthal et al. (2007)) is
    an easy and cost-efficient way to identify devices.  Al Alkeem et al. (2015) suggested
    an authentication scheme based on a wearable interface. Sangpetch and Sangpetch
    (2016) proposed a system that can be customized and developed for particular circumstances.
    Here, Abie and Balasingham (2012) employed a theory about protection for the case.
    Similarly (Ali et al. (2020), Newaz et al. (2019), Pandey and Prabha (2020), Subiksha
    and Ramakrishnan (2021), and Zahin and Hu (2019)) proposed ML-based smart healthcare
    solutions. Table 7 summarizes a few ML-based state-of-the-art supporting smart

    (2021) 2021 Deep learning Unsupervised Healthcare diagnosis 4.5.1 Challenges,
    open issues, and research directions Emerging ubiquitous smartphones and sensor-rich
    applications also enhanced these triggers of actions in smart healthcare. Several
    uses benefit from smart healthcare, from mechanical checks to dental checkups
    and wellness treatments. Effective use of healthcare relies significantly upon
    factors such as accelerometer readings. A variety of experiments have been performed
    on this. However, only a few practical methods have been proposed to eliminate
    the following issues: The rapid rise in smart devices has led to a need to mark
    information. The main issue is creating a learning model to observe and measure
    critical behavior characteristics. Many sensors in IoT can participate in generating
    big data in the smart health sector. Big data poses even more obstacles for ML
    systems. Big data based on AI and DL are exciting approaches that could overcome
    some of the issues relevant to 5G networks and IoT applications. Internet-based
    solutions can accomplish the mission of data processing because of the importance
    of big data. Work in compressive sensing has demonstrated that a sparse representation
    can be represented in a compressed form. In particular, in contrast to standard
    (Nyquist Santoso et al. (2020)) sampling, compact sampling can produce a signal
    at a rate lower than Nyquist''s criterion. The Min-LL approach can be applied
    by solving a convex optimization problem called min-LL with equality constraints.
    Some methods, such as basic chase, orthogonal matching pursuit, and tree-based
    orthogonal matching pursuit also increase the reconstruction''s completion. Several
    researchers have applied these developments to multiple real applications such
    as cognitive radio networks (Kong (2010), Kong and Bao (2010), Le and Kong (2011))
    and Smartgrids (Le (2015), Tan and Le (2016)). Efforts are being made to develop
    acoustic IoT-based compressed sensing frameworks (Kong (2010), Kong and Bao (2010),
    Le and Kong (2011)), which can operate in a distributed manner. Their suggested
    versions are far preferable to existing software regarding enterprise system features.
    Similarly, the authors in (Hu and Hanzo (2019), Hu (2018)) addressed the problem
    of shared networking, edge caching, and computing design of vehicle networks by
    learning novel methods. These AI programs have demonstrated to deliver operational
    excellence and productivity targets. In summary, enterprise systems are successful
    if an applied ML process adopts it. Daunting problems like massive machines and
    big data can be avoided. This suggests that current AI systems could have viable
    solutions with minimal computing costs and excellent stability. Algorithms used
    to render any estimation may be inefficient for any practical application. Furthermore,
    statistical methodologies focused on dataset features found in each sample can
    be time inefficient. Combining sophisticated ML methods with classical algorithms
    is essential for accurate and efficient data processing. 5 USE CASES This section
    presents some use cases illustrating the potential of integrating enterprise architecture,
    IoT, and ML across multiple domains. These examples illustrate the practical applications
    and benefits that can be realized due to this convergence. Smart city management:
    Integrating enterprise architecture, IoT, and ML presents a compelling use case
    in smart city management. Cities can improve their efficiency, sustainability,
    and residents'' quality of life by deploying IoT sensors, accumulating real-time
    data, and implementing ML algorithms. Traffic management: ML techniques can be
    used to analyze massive amounts of data generated by IoT sensors deployed in urban
    environments. By analyzing this data, traffic patterns and congestion locations
    can be identified, enabling city officials to optimize traffic signal timings,
    re-route vehicles, and enhance overall traffic flow. ML models can account for
    historical traffic data, meteorological conditions, and events to predict traffic
    congestion and proactively implement measures to alleviate it. It can reduce travel
    durations, lower fuel consumption, and enhance air quality. Energy management:
    IoT-enabled Smart Grids can use ML algorithms to forecast energy demand and optimize
    energy distribution. ML models can alter energy production and distribution in
    real-time by analyzing historical consumption patterns, weather forecasts, and
    other pertinent data, maximizing resource utilization and minimizing waste. ML
    models can, for instance, dynamically regulate the allocation of energy resources
    in response to demand fluctuations and prioritize renewable energy sources when
    conditions are favorable. It can result in cost savings, lower environmental impact,
    and improved grid reliability. Industrial automation: Integrating enterprise architecture,
    IoT, and ML can revolutionize automation processes in industrial settings, resulting
    in increased productivity, quality, and safety. Predictive maintenance: Enterprises
    can implement predictive maintenance strategies by deploying IoT sensors on machinery
    and employing ML algorithms. In conjunction with historical maintenance records,
    real-time sensor data can train ML models to detect patterns and anomalies indicative
    of imminent equipment failures. These models can predict when a machine will require
    maintenance, allowing for preventative measures to be taken prior to a malfunction.
    By scheduling maintenance duties based on actual equipment conditions, businesses
    can reduce unscheduled downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and avoid expensive
    repairs. Predictive maintenance increases operational efficiency, extends the
    equipment''s life, and decreases overall maintenance costs. Quality control: In
    manufacturing facilities, ML algorithms can analyze data from IoT-connected sensors
    and cameras to detect defects and anomalies in real-time. ML models can identify
    deviations from expected quality standards and initiate alerts or automate corrective
    actions by continuously monitoring production lines. For instance, Computer Vision
    (CV) algorithms can analyze camera-captured images to identify product flaws such
    as blemishes and incorrect labeling. ML models can also analyze sensor data to
    identify anomalies in parameters such as temperature, pressure, and vibration
    that may indicate problems with production. Enterprises can ensure consistent
    product quality, reduce waste, and increase customer satisfaction by enabling
    real-time quality control. These use cases illustrate the advantages and real-world
    applications of integrating enterprise architecture, IoT, and ML in smart city
    management and industrial automation domains. By leveraging the potential of IoT
    and ML, businesses can transform their operations, enhance their decision-making,
    and unlock new growth and innovation opportunities. Integrating these technologies
    facilitates more efficient resource allocation, proactive decision-making, and
    automation of manual processes, ultimately resulting in increased productivity,
    cost savings, and enhanced overall performance in various industries. Security
    considerations: Integrating ML and IoT into enterprise architectures presents
    new security challenges and considerations. As IoT devices become pervasive and
    ML algorithms process sensitive data, ensuring the system''s confidentiality,
    availability, and integrity becomes crucial. Data privacy: The confidentiality
    of IoT-device-collected data is a major concern for deployments of ML and IoT.
    These devices frequently capture a wide variety of data, including personal information,
    which must be protected to comply with privacy regulations and prevent unauthorized
    access. For training purposes, ML algorithms may require access to large datasets,
    necessitating the cautious handling of sensitive information. To safeguard the
    privacy of individuals while still facilitating effective ML models, businesses
    must implement robust data anonymization techniques, encryption mechanisms, and
    access controls. Adversarial attacks: ML models are susceptible to adversarial
    assaults, in which malicious actors manipulate input data to deceive models and
    obtain incorrect or undesirable results. In the IoT context, adversaries may exploit
    vulnerabilities in connected devices to feed malicious data to ML algorithms,
    resulting in potentially detrimental decisions or actions. To mitigate the risk
    of adversarial attacks, businesses must employ robust model training, anomaly
    detection, and input validation techniques. In addition, maintaining a secure
    ML and IoT environment necessitates continuous monitoring of the system and regular
    updates to counteract emergent threats. System resilience: As ML and IoT systems
    become more interconnected and integrated into vital infrastructure, ensuring
    the overall system''s resilience is crucial. Implementing robust security measures,
    IoT devices, ML algorithms, and underlying infrastructures must be protected from
    unauthorized access, tampering, and disruption. Implementing secure communication
    protocols, access controls, and intrusion detection systems are included. Regular
    security audits, vulnerability assessments, and incident response plans are required
    to detect and respond to security incidents promptly. Model poisoning: ML models
    can be susceptible to model poisoning attacks, in which adversaries manipulate
    training data to degrade the model''s performance or introduce biases. In the
    IoT context, compromised or malicious devices may inject fraudulent data into
    training sets, resulting in inaccurate or biased ML models. Organizations must
    implement data validation techniques, anomaly detection algorithms, and robust
    model validation procedures to mitigate the risk of model poisoning. Regular re-training
    of ML models with updated and validated data can help maintain a system''s precision
    and dependability. By addressing these security concerns, businesses can ensure
    that their ML and IoT systems are trustworthy and reliable. To protect sensitive
    data, maintain system integrity, and prevent malicious attacks, it is essential
    to implement stringent security measures, adhere to privacy regulations, and employ
    proactive security practices. As the integration of ML and IoT continues to evolve,
    it is crucial to make security an integral part of the enterprise architecture
    to cultivate trust and confidence in the system''s capabilities. 6 DISCUSSION
    In the context of enterprise architectures, this survey thoroughly investigated
    the interaction between ML and IoT. This paper highlighted how ML techniques could
    improve IoT-based enterprise systems and gathered recent studies to give readers
    a complete understanding of the topic. The main conclusions are expanded upon
    in this discussion, which also examines the ramifications for enterprise design
    and IoT applications like smart grids and smart cities. Enterprise designs have
    become more complex and varied, particularly in the context of IoT systems. Significant
    opportunities exist to increase the functionality and automation of these structures
    by including ML techniques. ML algorithms can analyze the enormous volume of data
    IoT devices produce to identify relevant patterns and get important insights.
    For instance, ML can optimize resource allocation, traffic management, and energy
    usage in smart cities. More effective use of resources and improved quality of
    life for residents can be achieved by using ML algorithms to analyze data from
    numerous IoT sensors and devices around cities. Similarly, ML approaches can be
    extremely useful in Smart Grids for maximizing energy distribution, forecasting
    demand, and spotting abnormalities. ML algorithms may predict energy use patterns,
    find faults or future failures, and enable preventive maintenance by evaluating
    real-time data from IoT devices integrated into the grid infrastructure. This
    survey found many opportunities and use cases where ML and IoT integration can
    significantly improve enterprise systems. ML can be used in the context of smart
    cities for intelligent traffic management, proactive infrastructure maintenance,
    and reducing building energy use. Cities can operate more sustainably and efficiently,
    lowering traffic, enhancing safety, and using less energy by utilizing ML algorithms.
    ML approaches can help with load forecasting, anomaly identification, and problem
    diagnostics in Smart Grids. ML models can reliably estimate energy demand, detect
    anomalous consumption patterns indicative of tampering or malfunctions, and identify
    the underlying cause of system failures by evaluating historical and real-time
    data from IoT devices distributed throughout the grid. Additionally, ML can improve
    enterprise architecture''s cybersecurity protocols. Businesses may spot possible
    security breaches and take proactive steps to reduce risks by utilizing ML algorithms
    for anomaly detection and threat analysis. Additionally, ML can help with network
    monitoring, behavior analysis, and intrusion detection, enabling real-time reactions
    to security threats. Despite potential advantages, ML and IoT integration in enterprise
    architectures face several obstacles that must be overcome. The management of
    large-scale and heterogeneous IoT data presents a significant problem. This data
    must be processed and examined by ML algorithms on time, with the ability to extract
    pertinent features. The main emphasis of research should be the development of
    scalable and distributed ML algorithms that can manage the amount, diversity,
    and collection speed of IoT data. In IoT systems, privacy and security issues
    present serious difficulties. As sensitive data is gathered and processed by corporate
    infrastructures, protecting the privacy and accuracy of the data becomes crucial.
    To enable collaborative analysis while preserving data privacy, new research topics
    include the development of privacy-preserving ML techniques like federated learning,
    differential privacy, and secure multi-party computation (Javed et al. (2023)).
    The creation of interpretable ML models for enterprise architectures is another
    area of research. Understanding and explaining choices made by ML algorithms is
    essential in vital sectors like healthcare and autonomous systems, where explainability
    is a key component. The main research focus should be developing transparent,
    comprehensible ML models that can justify their outputs, increase trust, and simplify
    regulatory compliance. Furthermore, it is difficult to deploy ML algorithms because
    of resource limitations of IoT devices. These devices frequently have low energy
    capacity and are computational constrained. To reduce reliance on the cloud and
    save energy, research directions should include investigating edge computing strategies,
    where data processing and ML model inference occur locally on devices. This survey''s
    results show how powerful ML integration in IoT-based enterprise designs can be.
    ML approaches can improve decision-making, allocate resources more efficiently,
    and automate more applications, such as Smart Grids and smart cities. However,
    continual research and innovation are required to overcome issues with data management,
    privacy, interpretability, and resource limitations. Enterprises, academics, and
    decision-makers can successfully utilize the power of ML in IoT systems to build
    more effective, safe, and sustainable enterprise architectures by concentrating
    on these issues and research topics. Future intelligent and adaptive IoT-based
    enterprise systems will be made possible by continued cooperation and improvements
    in ML algorithms, data management approaches, and privacy-preserving strategies.
    Following is a summary of this survey''s major findings: System intelligence and
    automation have been improved by integrating ML and IoT in enterprise architectures.
    In numerous enterprise areas, ML techniques like supervised learning and anomaly
    detection have been successfully used to increase the adaptability and functionality
    of IoT-based services. Despite the many advantages of integrating ML with IoT,
    several difficulties and unresolved problems still need to be solved, such as
    concerns about data security and privacy, scalability, and compatibility between
    different platforms and devices. This study found various enterprise IoT use cases,
    including smart cities, smart grids, industrial automation, and smart healthcare,
    where ML has shown promise in streamlining procedures and making decisions. To
    achieve broad adoption and easy implementation in businesses, well-defined frameworks
    for integrating ML algorithms into already-existing IoT infrastructure are essential.
    Enterprise IoT systems still place a high priority on security, and ML-based security
    mechanisms have the potential to identify and counteract cyber threats in real-time.
    To provide predictive maintenance and proactive decision-making in enterprise
    IoT environments, this study emphasizes additional research and development in
    trend analysis and prognosis utilizing ML techniques. To realize the full potential
    of this integration, ongoing investigation and experimentation with new algorithms,
    methodologies, and data management strategies are imperative, given how quickly
    the fields of ML and IoT are evolving. In addition, this survey indicates that
    ML models are widely used in various domains, including smart agriculture, smart
    grids, smart cities, smart healthcare, and smart homes. As shown in Figure 8,
    supervised learning is the most commonly used type, accounting for 37.50% of applications,
    followed by unsupervised learning at 25.00%. Supervised learning is crucial for
    crop health analysis, resource allocation optimization, and yield prediction.
    Unsupervised learning dominates Smart Grids, accounting for 40.00% of applications,
    while reinforcement learning plays a minor role. Smart cities have an equal percentage
    of supervised and unsupervised learning models, with reinforcement learning employed
    in 16.67% of cases. ML techniques are essential for analyzing heterogeneous data
    in smart cities, enabling tasks such as traffic management, energy optimization,
    and public safety. Supervised learning is the most prevalent model in healthcare,
    accounting for 42.86% of applications. Unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    are significant, with 28.57% and 14.29%, respectively. Semi-supervised learning
    is used in 14.29% of cases, while hybrid models have no representation. Smart
    homes also use supervised and unsupervised learning models, with reinforcement
    learning playing a smaller role in 20.00% of applications. However, specific requirements,
    available data, and desired outcomes drive the choice of ML models in each domain.

  relevance_evaluation: 'The survey paper on the integration of machine learning (ML)
    and Internet of Things (IoT) in enterprise architectures is highly relevant to
    the point in your outline that focuses on exploring the potential of cognitive
    radio networks and dynamic spectrum access for optimizing wireless communication
    in the presence of interference and congestion.


    **Relevance to Cognitive Radio Networks:**


    Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are a key technology for improving the efficiency
    and utilization of wireless spectrum. CRNs allow unlicensed users to access licensed
    spectrum bands when the licensed users are not using them. To do this effectively,
    CRNs need to be able to sense the spectrum environment, identify unused spectrum
    bands, and adapt their transmission parameters accordingly.


    ML plays a crucial role in enabling CRNs to perform these tasks. ML algorithms
    can be used to learn from the spectrum environment, identify patterns of spectrum
    usage, and predict future spectrum availability. This information can then be
    used to optimize the spectrum access strategies of CRNs, reducing interference
    and congestion.


    **Relevance to Dynamic Spectrum Access:**


    Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a technique that allows users to access spectrum
    on a flexible and opportunistic basis. DSA systems use ML algorithms to monitor
    the spectrum environment and identify unused spectrum bands. Users can then access
    these bands on a temporary basis, as long as they do not interfere with licensed
    users.


    ML is essential for enabling DSA systems to operate efficiently. ML algorithms
    can be used to learn from the spectrum environment, predict future spectrum availability,
    and optimize the spectrum access strategies of users. This helps to reduce interference
    and congestion, and improve the overall efficiency of spectrum utilization.


    **Conclusion:**


    The integration of ML and IoT in enterprise architectures has the potential to
    revolutionize the way that wireless communication is managed. By leveraging the
    power of ML, CRNs and DSA systems can improve spectrum efficiency, reduce interference
    and congestion, and provide users with more reliable and higher-quality wireless
    services.'

  description: Concerns relating to safety and privacy have been brought to light
    as a result of the growing adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such
    as smart home appliances, mobile phones, and smart watches. Security has emerged
    as an essential component in the development of Internet of Things (IoT) systems
    in light of the growing number of assaults that originate from both malicious
    and non-malicious sources. The increasing volume of data that is stored in IoT
    systems presents a number of unique challenges, one of the most crucial being
    data security. Hackers may be able to remotely take control of Internet of Things
    devices if inadequate security measures are in place, which may result in substantial
    harm. This research suggests utilizing the Aggressive Cuckoo Search Algorithm
    method (ACS), the SHA-256 method, and the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) in
    order to solve these issues while enhancing the safety of internet of things (I
    smart door lock systems. ACS stands for Aggressive Cuckoo Search, SHA-256 stands
    for Secure Hash Algorithm, and ECC stands for Elliptic Curve Cryptography. In
    order to produce the ECC private key, the suggested architecture makes use of
    ACS, which has the potential to improve the data storage security of IoT systems.
    In the study, both the encoding and decoding times of the suggested design are
    analyzed, and it is compared to other encoding methods like (ECC-GA-SHA-256) and
    (ECC-FA-SHA-256). The findings indicate that the proposed design is capable of
    producing superior outcomes with 125 iterations for the encoding process and 175
    iterations for the decoding process. In addition, the proposed design features
    encoding and decoding times that are over 16.17 percentage points faster than
    those of previous encoding methods. Based on these data, it appears that the design
    that was proposed has the potential to considerably improve the functionality
    and safety of IoT-based smart door lock systems. The employment of ACS, SHA-256,
    and ECC can serve as potential solutions to overcome the security concerns connected
    with IoT-based intelligent locking systems. These are all cryptographic standard
    algorithms.

    Introduction Agriculture is one of the key sources that plays a significant part
    in the life of the country''s economy. Traditional agriculture refers to the conventional
    farming methods that have been practiced for centuries, relying on manual labor
    and basic tools. In traditional agriculture, farmers often work in small plots
    of land using traditional seeds and farming practices passes down through the
    generations while traditional agriculture has played a crucial role in meeting
    food demands, it does have it disadvantages. One significant drawbacks is its
    relatively low efficiency and productivity. Manual labor-intensive tasks can be
    time-consuming and labor demanding, leading to potential wastage of water, fertilizers
    and pesticides. Moreover, traditional agriculture is more susceptible to the adverse
    effects of unpredictable weather conditions and environmental factors which can
    result in lower yields and economic losses. Meanwhile, food security is a global
    challenge and impacted by rapidly compounding effects of climate changes, population
    trends and supply chain shortcomings. Agriculture''s global impact cannot be overstated,
    as it remains the primary source of food for humanity. Despite the fact that the
    human population continues to grow, agricultural land remains static (Virk et
    al.2020). The authors (Mesgaran et al. 2017) also discovered that the ever-changing
    climatic conditions significantly reduce agricultural product output in conventional
    agricultural systems. As a result of the varying nature of farming resources and
    poor management, farmers continue to experience low agricultural output. Drawbacks
    of Traditional Farming Due to the low degree of automation in the farming area,
    the current state of the art in agriculture, particularly conventional agricultural
    systems, still confronts significant hurdles in terms of sustainability, labor-intensity,
    and energy efficiency needs. Also, the production level of the crops to be considered.
    Scalability problems also taken into account since the population explosion is
    the major cause. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming In order to overcome
    the limitations and challenges faced in the conventional farming systems, the
    advent of the smart farming and precision agricultural sector to automate the
    farming processes towards achieving many goals towards sustainable agricultural
    systems. Some of them are listed below: â¢ High quantity of crop yield â¢ Better
    quality of the crops â¢ Efficient resource utilization â¢ Effective to handle climatic
    conditions â¢ Decision making in cropping patterns â¢ Environment and user-friendly

  description: Smart farm management has complex challenges; therefore, there is a
    need to improve the overall adaptability, profitability, and environmental soundness
    of the farming systems. Agricultural production can be enhanced with the help
    of IoT-based cognitive tools. The rapid increase in IoT-based smart systems has
    raised critical concerns about efficiently utilizing the wireless spectrum. To
    drastically bring the improvement in the utilization of the wireless spectrum,
    cognitive radio (CR) has emerged as an effective solution. The inherent openness
    and broadcast nature of the wireless medium have given rise to many security issues
    in cooperative networks. Information-theoretic security or physical layer security
    (PLS) is evolved as an efficacious wireless prototype for reliable transmissions
    to avert the eavesdropper from expropriating transmittal data on the wireless
    connections. Security is the key factor in these networks as they are exposed
    and active in be-havior, thus, are susceptible to fraudulent activities. In this
    patent study, we investigated the performance of the CR system in terms of secrecy
    and also examined the system in terms of diversity receipt and selection of relay.
    The secrecy outcome of channel state information at the sender was also studied.
    The detrimental effects of fading in cooperative networks were also extensively
    discussed. Cooperative diversity was examined by deploying MRC and SC strategies
    at receptors. It has been deduced that CSI knowledge at the sender also has an
    eloquent concussion on the secrecy of the cognitive system.

  explanation: The paper titled "Secrecy Performance Review for IoT-based Cognitive
    Farming System" focuses on the performance evaluation of cognitive radio networks
    in IoT-based farming systems, particularly in terms of secrecy and security. The
    study examines the impact of channel state information (CSI) at the sender, cooperative
    diversity, and relay selection on the secrecy of the cognitive system. The findings
    suggest that CSI knowledge at the sender significantly affects the secrecy of
    the cognitive system, and cooperative diversity techniques can enhance secrecy
    performance.

    security or physical layer security (PLS) is evolved as an efficacious wireless
    prototype for reliable transmissions to avert the eavesdropper from expropriating
    transmittal data on the wireless connections.

    therefore, there is a need to improve the overall adaptability, profitability,
    and environmental soundness of the farming systems. Agricultural production can
    be enhanced with the help of IoT-based cognitive tools. The rapid increase in
    IoT-based smart systems has raised critical concerns about efficiently utilizing
    the wireless spectrum. To drastically bring the improvement in the utilization
    of the wireless spectrum, cognitive radio (CR) has emerged as an effective solution.
    The inherent openness and broadcast nature of the wireless medium have given rise
    to many security issues in cooperative networks. Informationtheoretic security
    or physical layer security (PLS) is evolved as an efficacious wireless prototype
    for reliable transmissions to avert the eavesdropper from expropriating transmittal
    data on the wireless connections. Security is the key factor in these networks
    as they are exposed and active in behavior, thus, are susceptible to fraudulent
    activities. In this patent study, we investigated the performance of the CR system
    in terms of secrecy and also examined the system in terms of diversity receipt
    and selection of relay. The secrecy outcome of channel state information at the
    sender was also studied. The detrimental effects of fading in cooperative networks
    were also extensively discussed. Cooperative diversity was examined by deploying
    MRC and SC strategies at receptors. It has been deduced that CSI knowledge at
    the sender also has an eloquent concussion on the secrecy of the cognitive system.

    conference paper PDF 53.1 Introduction Please note that the first traditional
    database is typically based on the technology of centralization. The centralization
    technology prevents making it famous and trustworthy in terms of use among the
    masses. A decentralized distributed database has been introduced very soon, centrally
    managed by a service provider. The service provider requires engineering implementation,
    business support, and hardware requirements on a very large scale. In this context,
    blockchain is an initiative of public collaboration. The participants of the blockchain
    system own the responsibility for carrying out the process. Blockchain is a secured
    database shared across a network of participants, where all the participants can
    access the information simultaneously. Blockchain technology is an advanced database
    mechanism that allows information sharing within a network. Blockchain database
    stores data in blocks that are linked together in a chain [1,2,3,4,5]. The data
    is chronologically consistent because no one can modify or delete the chain without
    consent from the network. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts,
    production, etc. Blockchain is used to record, verify, and confirm digital assets
    and transactions in a secure way. A cryptocurrency is a digital medium of exchanging
    money. The most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was created to facilitate transactions
    without third parties. The Bitcoin blockchain refers to the data stored in âblocksâ
    that are then linked together in a permanent âchain.â A block is a collection
    of Bitcoin transactions from a specific period [6,7,8]. Bitcoin is the worldâs
    first digital currency. This paper is organized as follows. Section 53.2 presents
    classical blockchain theoretical concepts and definitions. The quantum blockchain
    is presented in Sect. 53.3. Advantages and applications of quantum blockchain
    are represented in Sect. 53.4. The literature review is presented in Sect. 53.5.
    Section 53.6 concludes the paper with future directions of research. 53.2 Blockchain
    Preliminaries The following subsections discuss the fundamental concepts of a
    blockchain. 53.2.1 Blockchain Transaction A blockchain transaction is a process
    where data is transmitted in the form of blocks across the network in a blockchain
    system (Fig. 53.1). Fig. 53.1 A typical diagram of a block in a blockchain Full
    size image BLOCK: A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously
    increasing list of blocks. Each block holds a cryptographic hash and some information
    about the previous block. Data is divided into common blocks using unique cryptographic
    hashes. DATA: This is the raw form of information. NONCE: âNumber used only once.â
    A NONCE is generated when a block is created in a blockchain. Later it helps to
    produce a block header hash. HASH: Hash is a hexadecimal number in a deterministic
    form. Whatever the count of characters in an input, the number of characters is
    fixed in the hash. For example, hashes in Bitcoin always consist of 64 bits. 53.2.2
    Types of Blockchain Public Blockchain: A public blockchain is the first type of
    blockchain. This blockchain is open to all. It is a permissionless distributed
    ledger where any node can join and perform any transactions. Depending on in what
    manner and how many nodes are involved, public blockchains are safe [9]. Private
    Blockchain: The next type of blockchain is a private blockchain, which operates
    quickly. This blockchain is not as decentralized as the public one; only selected
    nodes can participate in it, making it more secure than other blockchains. Consortium
    Blockchain: Another type of blockchain is consortium blockchain [10]. This is
    an innovative method to solve the organizationâs needs. In this system, some part
    is public, and some part is private, and the organization manages this type of
    blockchain. Hybrid Blockchain: Hybrid blockchain is the mixed content of the private
    and public blockchain. In a hybrid blockchain, transactions and records are typically
    private and can be validated, if necessary, by granting access. 53.2.3 Technologies
    Used in Blockchain Timestamp: Nakamoto developed timestamps based on the use of
    hash-based proof of work. A timestamp server takes the hash of a block containing
    transactions to be timestamped and published on the network. By doing so, the
    server ensures that the transactions have existed at this point in time. This
    system is chronologically enforced as each transaction hash contains the timestamp
    of the previous block of transactions, forming a chain of blocks. Hash Algorithm:
    The hash function takes an input string of any length and converts it into a fixed
    length. After extracting data from the block, the hash outputs the length with
    the help of some algorithm. Real-time transactions are carried out with special
    hash algorithms. Hashes give each block in the blockchain a unique identifier.
    The block identifier can be found in the block header. A lot of components are
    required to construct the block. Therefore, the data is turned into a unique string
    inside the block when a blockchain hash occurs. Cryptographic hashes (like SHA2,
    SHA3, and BLAKE2) are considered quantum-safe [11, 12]. A hash function, H() takes
    a message N of any size and calculates a short, fixed-size digest H(N), typically
    256 or 512 bits long. Hash functions are secure when. 1. Given A, find a message
    N, such that H(N)â=âA, and 2. N1 and N2 such that H(N1)â=âH(N2) Proof of Work
    (PoW): PoW [3, 13]is a fundamental underlying technology behind blockchain cryptocurrency.
    It has been previously pointed out that quantum systems provide a computational
    advantage in performing PoW in the context of Bitcoin. This has strong consequences
    regarding both quantum-based attacks on the integrity of the entirety of the blockchain
    and more legitimate uses of quantum computation for the purpose of mining Bitcoin
    and other cryptocurrencies. For the first case, we estimate when these quantum
    attacks will become feasible for various cryptocurrencies and discuss the impact
    of such attacks. We derive a precise formula for the latter to calculate the economic
    incentive for switching to quantum-based cryptocurrency miners. Using this formula,
    we analyze several test scenarios and conclude that investing in quantum hardware
    for cryptocurrency mining has the potential to pay off immensely. Bitcoin is a
    cryptocurrency which uses the PoW consensus algorithm SHA256. Proof of Stake (PoS):
    In a blockchain, transactions are validated by some consensus mechanism. Cryptocurrency
    holders stake their coins through PoS [3, 13]. They validate the next latest blocks
    of transactions and add them to the system. PoS is costly and more energy efficient
    than PoW. PoS consensus algorithms are EOS (EOS), Tezos (XTZ), Cardano (ADA),
    Cosmos (ATOM), and Lisk (LSK). PoS is derived from PoW with some improvements.
    The whole network is not involved in the validation of each transaction. The validator
    does not sustain a block reward. Instead, they only accumulate network costs as
    their reward. Delegated Proof of Stake: Daniel Larimer, Steemit, and EOS introduced
    the fundamental concept of delegated proof of stake [3, 13]. According to this
    consensus algorithm, users can rightly cast their vote or delegate the power of
    voting to another entity to cast a vote on their behalf. The witness is selected
    to create blocks after verifying transactions. After successfully verifying all
    the transactions, the witness receives rewards that they share with those who
    voted for that particular witness. In case of failing to verify all transactions
    in the allotted time, the block is missed, and no rewards are given. The next
    witness verifies that unverified block and a reward is given to that witness along
    with the ones who are casted votes for this new witness. Such blocks are called
    âStolen.â Proof of Authority (PoA): In consensus algorithm called proof of authority
    was proposed by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and Parity Technology [14].
    The nodes which are proven their validity to generate new blocks are called âvalidators.â
    The process of validation of the blocks is automated and runs by software that
    is controlled by validators. The validators need not to monitor the system constantly
    but must maintain that the system must not be compromised. In PoA, the validators
    are collecting reputations instead of coins. It is secured by the faith of the
    identities selected. 53.2.4 Challenges of Blockchain With increasing popularity,
    blockchain meets some critical challenges [3, 13] in respect of security and authentication,
    which can be summarized as follows. Scalability: Every transaction in the blockchain
    must check the authenticity of the source of that particular transaction before
    entering to the ledger. As a result, in real time, the ledger is overwhelmed by
    enormous transactional records. Small transactions have more latency rate. For
    this scalability issue, Bruce proposed a storage optimization method. This method
    suggests deleting the old transactional records from the ledger. But that is not
    enough to dissolve this problem in a large context. Privacy: In blockchain technology,
    usersâ identity is unspecified during the creation and verification of transactions
    using their public and private keys. All the participants of a particular blockchain
    transaction can view all the data. So, the safety of transactions might be void.
    Data Malleability: Securing data integrity is one of the big challenges in blockchain
    technology. The signature that is used to verify a transaction doesnât guarantee
    any authenticity regarding the signature itself. As a result, if any intruder
    acts as a signing authority, it is very difficult to recognize. Authentication:
    In a blockchain, a user has to provide their own details to create the identity.
    However, there is no scope to verify whether the details provided by them are
    actually genuine or not. The users are responsible for carrying out the most crucial
    role of authenticating a transaction. The private keys that are used to authenticate
    the transactions might be altered. Consequently, the whole system may be corrupted,
    resulting in a huge loss. 53.2.5 Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrency plays a vital role
    in the modern financial sector. It utilizes blockchain as a financial platform.
    Cryptocurrency is protected by public key cryptography. Ethereum and Bitcoin are
    well-known cryptocurrency systems [15]. 53.3 Quantum Blockchain Quantum computing
    is a method to solve complex problems using the laws of quantum mechanics [16].
    Quantum blockchain is a combination of quantum computation and blockchain. Quantum
    blockchain can be understood as a decentralized, encrypted, and distributed database.
    Once the information is recorded in the quantum blockchain, the information cannot
    be changed without the permission of the network. The security of blockchain works
    with hash function and distribution. It uses a peer-to-peer network connection
    where the decentralized architecture allows nodes to share and access resources
    directly. Blockchain tracks transactions and prevents double and fake transactions
    [17,18,19,20,21]. 53.3.1 Quantum Cryptography Encoding and decoding data is the
    main concept behind any cryptography. The cryptographic key is one of the most
    important features in of cryptography. The strength of any encryption depends
    on the encryption key. Cryptography is used for several purposes, including transaction,
    verification, and validation of any digital assets securely. Random cryptographic
    keys are generated through quantum technologies, which are totally secure. Quantum
    tunneling is very much unpredictable and generates a cryptographically secure
    pseudorandom number. Digital asset uses quantum cryptography than classical cryptography
    for more security [22,23,24,25]. Quantum cryptography assures the reliability
    of transactions on a quantum network. Quantum networks have no requirement for
    PoW or PoS consensus algorithm. 53.3.2 QKD The advantage of quantum cryptography
    is that it allows one to complete several cryptographical tasks, which is impossible
    by classical communication. In a quantum state, copying the encrypted data is
    not possible. The no-cloning theorem will alter the quantum state if anyone tries
    to decode the data. This is used to sense snooping in QKD. Quantum cryptography
    encrypts data for an extended duration than classical cryptography [26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33].
    Blockchain handles a lot of sensitive data, and secrecy must be maintained while
    the data is in transit. QKD will be a key technology for secure communications
    systems in the quantum Internet. The workflow of QKD is depicted in Fig. 53.2
    [34]. Fig. 53.2 QKD flowchart Full size image 53.3.3 Quantum Digital Signature
    Quantum physics is the fundamental principle for digital signature. To protect
    a legal document, a digital signature is needed. A digital signature scheme follows
    some steps for authentication. First, the key-generating process generates a verification
    key and an authorization key. Then a signing process takes the authorization key
    and produces an authorization of the message. At last, a verification process
    takes the verification key and verifies whether the signature is valid [35, 36].
    A typical processing (signing and verification) of a digital signature in a classical
    blockchain and a digital signature in a quantum blockchain are shown in Figs.
    53.3 and 53.4, respectively. Fig. 53.3 Block diagram of digital signature in classical
    blockchain Full size image Fig. 53.4 Block diagram of digital signature in quantum
    blockchain Full size image 53.4 Advantages and Applications of Quantum Blockchain
    Advantages of Quantum Blockchain Improved Security: Quantum blockchain possesses
    the ability to provide more secure data. Due to the unique features of superposition,
    entanglement, and teleportation, data alteration is next to impossible at the
    time of creation, transmission, and storing. Increased Efficiency: Quantum blockchain
    can process transmission faster than classical one. The technique can handle data
    in a large volume. So, larger data handling with exponentially faster processing
    time makes it very efficient. Compatibility with Various Areas: Quantum blockchain
    has the capacity to be applicable in different sectors with great skill. Upcoming
    research may lead to a vivid acceptance of this technology in almost every sphere
    of computation. Applications of Quantum Blockchain Healthcare: Medical data gains
    a phenomenal importance after pandemic hits the globe [37, 38]. To maintain the
    secrecy of electronic health records, blockchain-inspired architecture is utilized.
    To fix the quantum attack, quantum digital signature is applied. Apart from this,
    contact tracing process in the recent pandemic is also boosted up by exerting
    quantum blockchain. Smart City: Smart cities have miscellaneous devices to execute
    the city routines [39, 40]. These devices often use the wireless sensors which
    require authenticity of servers. Classical blockchain technology provides smooth
    performance to maintain the originality and security of data that is used to transmit
    or store. But after the appearance of quantum attacks, the safety is broken. Application
    of quantum blockchain makes it secured, feasible, and easygoing. Cryptocurrency:
    The modern society reaches to the sharp tip where the mass uses the cryptocurrency
    instead of physical currency [41]. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the top most examples.
    Cryptocurrency solely depends upon blockchain technology. But, in the recent past
    that faced a number of quantum attacks. To sort out this serious issue, different
    post-quantum techniques are prescribed. In spite of that, upcoming advancement
    of quantum world may endanger the existing security, given by existing post-quantum
    techniques. Therefore, the quantum blockchain is the only solution for delivering
    the loyalty for secure transactions and storing of cryptocurrency. The above discussion
    on the applications of quantum blockchain ensures to furnish a conception about
    it. The idea is mostly theoretical which needs to become practical by the time
    ahead. 53.5 Summary of Related Works Chen et al. [42] worked on the purposes of
    privacy for users, signature likeability, and contact tracking, a lattice-based
    ring signature technique and proposed a new method on these parameters. They also
    evaluated the possibility of quantum computing attacks in their proposed system
    and prescribed possible ways that may prevent them. Qu et al. [43] suggested using
    a quantum-based detectable Byzantine agreement for the part of the digital signature
    where data is encrypted for privacy preservation. It is based on the GHZ state
    that an n-party quantum blockchain''s data consensus protocol realizes. Gupta
    et al. [44] discussed blockchain security in relation to secure electronic voting,
    utilizing the QKD and SHA-256 hashing algorithms. They also provided a detailed
    explanation of how electronic voting is executed. Zhanji Xu [45] discussed a classical
    algorithm utilized in traditional blockchain technology. They also pointed out
    how the impending quantum era might alter it both favorably and unfavorably. Information
    on the most recent developments among organizations researching the same field
    was jotted down meticulously. Bistarelli et al. [46] introduced an implementation
    of an interface in an Ethereum node to support several digital signature schemes.
    This research opened the door in front of future researchers for bettering the
    digital signature schemes that would be invented in the time ahead. Table 53.1
    presents a critical comparison of these notable research contributions. Table

    Full size table 53.6 Conclusion The state of blockchain technology touches the
    point of climax where it faces issues regarding security and privacy-preserving
    concurrently with the advancement. The earliest stage of quantum computing already
    questions the efficiency of classical blockchain. However, besides this the quantum
    computing provides a strong ray of hope in the form of quantum blockchain technology.
    In this paper, we investigate the obstacles those stands in front of so-called
    well-built security and authentication features given by classical blockchain.
    We also try to spot out the missing links that are the drawbacks of traditional
    blockchain technology, but can be removed by quantum blockchain. After observing
    the issue sensitively, it is found that the digital signing process used in signing
    the message has a big issue due to the protocols applied. These protocols could
    be easily violated by quantum attacks. In this purview, QKD, quantum cryptography,
    quantum-inspired protocols, quantum channels are tuned into the game changers
    of the whole scenario. And in a nutshell, the above-mentioned parameters are denoted
    as quantum blockchain technology. The observation table in the literature review
    section indicates the vast application areas that are aimed to be undertaken as
    present and upcoming interest. Lastly, it could be concluded that the discussed
    field of research is at its childhood state and the continuous development may
    uplift computer science to a stunning height in the near future. References Pierro,

    among cognitive radio network (CRN), IoT and a future Internet architecture proposal.
    â¢ We present the concept of a low-cost embedded cooperative sensing and cognitive

    that the use of cooperative spectrum sensing based on energy detection has overcome
    the problem known as hidden node. â¢ The proposed radio approach has been integrated

    names and self-verifying names. Abstract Many Internet of Things (IoT) requirements
    are already at the core of next generation wireless networks, including 5G, cognitive
    radio and future Internet. There is a huge consilience that the majority of Internet
    devices will become sensors and actuators equipped over ordinary âthingsâ. As
    a consequence, the radio environment will increasingly become crowded with thousands
    of low-cost devices sharing the unlicensed frequency bands. This paper is regarding
    a convergent solution of future Internet and cognitive radio in the context of
    IoT. It proposes an embedded and low cost cooperative spectrum sensing solution,
    which has been experimentally implemented. Furthermore, we present a distributed
    software-controlled sector aware spectrum sensing architecture to store and analyze
    the spectrum usage information. Finally, the proposed approach has been integrated
    to a future Internet architecture called NovaGenesis. A proof-of-concept has been
    experimentally performed, demonstrating for the first time the convergence of
    IoT, future Internet and cognitive radio. Graphical abstract Download : Download

    internetInternet of ThingsNovaGenesisSoftware-defined 1. Introduction The Internet
    of Things (IoT) has been challenging all existing information and communication
    technology (ICT) architectures in the last years, mainly due to the exponential
    growth in the number of connected devices, the diversity of possible technology
    stacks (heterogeneous networks) and devices connectivity issues [1], [2]. The
    new scenario becomes even more challenging since many traditional networks had
    not been originally designed to offer adequate security and privacy for IoT [3],
    [4]. Moreover, a significant portion of mobile IoT devices will require rebinding
    of devicesâ locators [2] and hundreds or even thousands of them will share the
    same radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic spectrum. The IoT requirements play
    an important role in the context of the next generation wireless networks, including
    5G [5], cognitive radio [6] and future Internet [2]. For instance, Michailow et
    al. [5] have considered low power consumption and delay tolerant requirements
    of machine-to-machine communications in the context of 5G networks. Cognitive
    radios networks (CRNs) have been proposed as a key solution to define rules and
    techniques for using underutilized licensed RF bands [7]. One of its benefits
    is allowing users of congested unlicensed bands to offload their traffic to other
    parts of the RF spectrum, even the licensed ones. A CRN is able to identify when
    the legal owner of some RF spectrum portion, who is called primary user, is not
    making use of its licensed RF band. Cognitive networks may orientate secondary
    (opportunistic) users to make use of this part of the RF spectrum without interfering
    in the primary user communication [6]. As a consequence, a cognitive radio (CR)
    must identify â or sense â when the licensed RF band is unused and distribute
    this information for the secondary users that may be interested in establishing
    communication over this part of the RF spectrum. The tsunami of devices expected
    in IoT will push radio frequency spectrum control and management towards more
    opportunistic approaches, creating a straightforward link between IoT and CRN
    [1]. The latest piece of this puzzle is the strong relation between the IoT requirements
    and future Internet (FI) research [8]. The term future Internet was adopted in
    the first initiatives with the aim of rethinking the Internet, including the future
    Internet design (FIND) initiative [9] and the European future Internet assembly
    (FIA) initiative [8]. By FI, we mean any Internet-like network that could emerge
    in the future. This includes evolutionary approaches, in which the fundamental
    protocols of the current Internet are maintained and new ideas are incrementally
    introduced; or revolutionary approaches, in which the architecture is redesigned
    from scratch (also named âclean slateâ proposals). Examples of evolutionary FI
    architectures (FIAs) that encompass IoT scope are: FIWARE [10], SENSEI [11] and
    SmartSantander [12]. FIWARE provides a platform to integrate computer programs
    (or generic enablers â GE) via the next generation service interfaces (NGSIs).
    The NGSI-9/NGSI-10 is based on RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs)
    [10], as a consequence, it is dependent on the current Internet technologies.
    SENSEI is focused on the wireless sensor and actuator networks interoperation,
    creating a market for the sensed data also employing RESTful interfaces. Finally,
    SmartSantander is based on a platform for the smart city services integration
    using RESTful APIs. To the best of our knowledge, those projects do not explore
    CRN approach to opportunistically perform spectrum control and management, by
    using a spectrum sensing technique. They also lack on supporting some FIA ingredients,
    such as: information-centric networking (ICN) [13], service-oriented architecture
    (SOA) [14], service-centric networking (SCN) [15], software-defined networking
    (SDN) [16], network function virtualization (NFV) [17], self-verifying naming
    (SVN) [4], identifier/locator (ID/Loc) splitting [2] and network caching. Up to
    the current moment, we can conclude that none of the mentioned revolutionary approaches
    have being proper explored in the IoT state-of-the-art. In this sense, we idealized
    and developed a new FIA called NovaGenesis (NG) [18], which considers IoT and
    CRN as key players for future Internet. In this paper, we explore for the first
    time the convergence of IoT, CRN, and FI technologies, by means of three main
    contributions. Firstly, we report a successful implementation of a novel approach
    for cognitive radio in IoT scenarios based on a software-controlled, low-cost
    and an embedded cooperative spectrum sensing. Secondly, we present the concept
    and an experimental demonstration of a distributed, software-controlled and sector
    aware spectrum sensing architecture that employs current Internet protocols to
    store and analyze spectrum usage information. Thirdly, we extend NG with novel
    services to interoperate with the proposed CRN approach based on energy detection
    from spatially-distributed remote radio units by taking advantage of the NG FIA
    ingredients. The remainder of this article will introduce our CRN based on energy
    detection from spatially-distributed remote radio units in Section 2. The proposed
    system is implemented using a low-cost hardware and GNU Radio as a processing
    platform. Section 3 presents NovaGenesis, including its fundamental concepts,
    implementation and two novel FI services to interoperate with our CR solution.
    Experimental results are reported in Section 4, including a proof-of-concept of
    the new NG services together with the embedded spectrum sensing. Finally, we conclude
    the paper in Section 5, giving direction for future works. 2. Cognitive radio
    network proposal: embedded low-cost cooperative sensing The employment of a RF
    spectrum sensing technique is convenient, independently of the way that the unused
    RF band is going to be allocated by a secondary user, for this reason is considered
    one of the CR most important features [19]. CR may be placed alone in a non-cooperative
    environment or being part of a cooperative network, in which a channel allocation
    decision is based on the information collected by diverse CRs. In the ISM bands,
    there is no licensed user, so the primary user is not formally present, but the
    benefits of the spectrum sensing and CR techniques are still valid. Regulation
    agencies stipulate that radios must implement some specific channel access techniques
    for certain RF bands, such as frequency hopping spreading spectrum (FHSS) or direct
    sequence spreading spectrum (DSSS). By applying FHSS, a radio pair keeps changing
    the communication channel frequency over time, spreading the transmitting power
    over a wider bandwidth. In a point to point communication, FHSS is very reliable
    and have been used for a long time. IoT applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN) and smart grid solutions typically demand low power consumption in order
    to enable communication among hundreds or even thousands of devices. 2.1. Cooperative
    spectrum sensing The proposed cooperative cognitive radio network is presented
    in Fig. 1a. It is composed by the following blocks: sensing cell (SC); sensing
    cell controller (SCC); sensing information storage and analysis (SISA). The SC
    is responsible to acquire RF information, whereas the SCC detects users in the
    RF spectrum and SISA acts as a fusion center with the ability of collecting and
    aggregating information from many SCCs. The proposed approach provides higher
    level of RF spectrum usage information, with the purpose of allowing a dynamic
    spectrum allocation. Download : Download high-res image (225KB) Download : Download

    flow from sensing cell (SC) to sensing information storage and analysis (SISA);
    (b) radio interference scenario with three sensing cell controllers (SCCs). 2.1.1.
    Sensing cell (SC) The RF spectrum may be sensed by more than one sensing cell
    (SC), which includes a RF receiver, an antenna and a computational processing
    board. The SC hardware has been developed using a low-cost commercial hardware
    based on Raspberry PI 2 processing board and a digital video broadcasting-terrestrial
    (DVB-T) receiver acting as a RF receiver. The latter one has becoming popular
    in software-defined radio (SDR) applications [20]. SCs may be deployed over different
    locations in order to cover a wide geographic area, characterizing a cooperative
    network scenario. More than one source of spectrum sensing information may be
    used to provide information for a real-time RF spectrum allocation. The proposed
    cooperative network reduces the hidden node problem effect, providing information
    to discover distinct sectors, then improving the RF spectrum usage efficiency
    [21]. Traditional CR implementations define a radio capable to sense the spectrum,
    while performing its usual communication functionality [6]. Since the objective
    is to employ low resource devices that may not have enough processing capacity
    to run a spectrum sensing algorithm, the SCs may be used as a support system to
    existent fixed frequency systems. For this reason, in the proposed system, the
    SCs are sensing-only devices. It is feasible to implement the sensing algorithm
    over more powerful IoT devices. In context of IoT, a network commonly has its
    own border router or gateway that acts as a network coordinator and interface
    to the Internet. The SC acquires samples from RF spectrum for demodulating them
    to a baseband digital signal. The digital signal is delivered to the processing
    board, which encapsulates the RF information into TCP/IP packets to be sent to
    a SCC. 2.1.2. Sensing cell controller (SCC) The sensing cell controller (SCC)
    has two important roles in the proposed system: (i) it configures the SC receiver
    parameters; (ii) it performs the energy detector computation to be sent to SISA.
    The SCC runs on a standard desktop computer and all energy detection algorithm
    is performed by applying previously-developed GNU Radio framework, which is a
    free software tool that provides a set of processing blocks with focus on SDR
    usage. By controlling the SC parameters, such as radio central frequency and radio
    bandwidth, becomes possible to sense a wide RF spectrum, typically divided into
    RF channels. This functionality is very important, since the low-cost receiver
    has only 2 MHz bandwidth. The computed RF spectrum energy information is then
    sent to the SISA block. 2.1.3. Sensing information storage and analysis (SISA)
    The SISA block relies on a specific algorithm responsible to collect data from
    many SCCs and store this information in a database. The SISA information may be
    based on a specific region, or a specific RF spectrum band or even some calendar
    range. SISA provides a database information on the RF spectrum utilization divided
    in hours of a day, based on each SCC connected to it. The SISA has an API that
    allows some CR interested on its sensing information to put queries on spectrum
    information usage statistics. 2.1.4. Spectrum sensing based on energy detection
    Energy detection is considered the most simple spectrum sensing technique. It
    has been chosen to enable the use of low-cost components and, also, because it
    is the most appropriate technique when the transmitted signal is unknown [22].
    The energy for N received RF signals (X) may be calculated as follows: (1) where
    the resultant value defines the test statistic variable T. The noise power variance
    must be known in order to define an optimal test statistic variable Tâ² given by:
    (2) The need of obtaining Tâ² is a drawback of the energy detection technique,
    since the system must measure or estimate the channel noise. From this estimate,
    it is possible to define a detection threshold Î» that allows to evaluate the channel
    availability. The acquired Tâ² samples are compared to Î» and stored in a detection
    vector Dv: (3) The percentage of samples with value greater than the threshold
    is counted and this information is forwarded to the SISA, as a detection information,
    indicating a quantitative presence of a RF signal in the sensing band: (4) 3.
    NovaGenesis architecture NovaGenesis (NG) is a research project that started in
    2008, with the goal of answering the following question: âImagine if there is
    no Internet architecture, how could we design it using the best contemporary technologies?â
    NovaGenesis scope includes not only data exchanging (like any other networking
    technology), but also data processing and storage (including cloud computing and
    networking cache). NG design considered a set of state-of-the-art ingredients,
    focusing on synergistically integrating them. 3.1. Motivation and advantages Cooperative
    spectrum sensing, spatial and temporal spectrum usage profiling, as well as dynamic
    resource allocation require the transfer and storage of the sensible information.
    The unrestricted access to spectrum samples can reveal private behavior, network
    infrastructure and weak performance points. Attackers can explore these weaknesses
    to cause unwanted interference, reducing the network throughput. False spectrum
    samples could create chaos in the resource managers. Collaborative spectrum sensing
    and dynamic resource allocation require more than performance. The provenance
    of spectrum samples should be guaranteed, creating a trustable network of sensing
    devices. Software control requires trust, privacy, provenance and integrity of
    control data. An illegitimate software controller can cause deliberate stopping
    of software-defined radios (SDRs). Software controllers and SDRs should establish
    a trustable network, working according to previously defined service level agreements
    (SLAs). Many Internet technologies were designed in the 70s. Despite of data integrity
    importance, it is still missing in the majority of TCP/IP networks today. A legacy
    of a time when security was not a big deal. According to Jacobson et al. [23],
    âtrust in content is easily misplaced, relying on untrustworthy location and connection
    informationâ. Data security depends mainly on the available connection security,
    e.g. IPsec or security socket layer (SSL). Neither data, nor services are protected
    by their own names. Novel techniques such as self-verifying names (SVNes) can
    improve entities security and trust. Ghodsi et al. [4] contend on the security
    and privacy advantages of SVNes compared to the current Internet naming. In addition,
    data provenance is limited to the guarantees offered by the domain name service
    (DNS). However, DNSSEC standard is still in the early days of deployment and typically
    not available at low level domains, like the one presented in Fig. 1. Related
    works on IoT proposals, such as FIWARE [10], SENSEI [11] and SmartSantander [12]
    do not employ contract-based coordination of controllers and SDRs. NG âclean slateâ
    design aims at fulfilling these gaps, bringing the following benefits to the scenario
    presented in Fig. 1: Unlimited namespaces: Not only natural language, but also
    SVNes can be employed to create as many namespaces as desired. Data, services,
    hardware and any other entity can be individually named, allowing persistent identification
    independently of location. This provides provenance, improving trustable operation
    [4], [13], [23], [24]. For this reason, we have redesigned the scenario of Fig.
    1 with SVNes and other NovaGenesis ingredients (Section 3.2). Flexible name resolution:
    Current DNS can resolve a limited set of names [25]. However, emerging scenarios
    require extending these capabilities to other entities, such as data objects [13],
    [23], [24] and services [15]. NovaGenesis name resolution is generic to accommodate
    this requirement (Section 3.3). On the other hand, the scenario of Fig. 1 is dependent
    on the available DNS deployment at sensing cells and SISA domains. Service-oriented
    design (SOD): The role of software is becoming increasingly important in modern
    ICT. Contemporary software engineering like service-oriented design should be
    employed. FIWARE, SENSEI and SmartSantander employ RESTful APIs, but they lack
    on implementing the entire service life-cycle, which includes negotiation and
    contracting. Our approach implements service life-cycling not only for SDR services,
    but also for software-controllers. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is
    the first work to experimentally demonstrate SOD application in a convergent CRN,
    IoT, and future Internet proposal. In contrast, Fig. 1 architecture does not employ
    SOD. Software-controlled radio: SDR capabilities and allowed configurations are
    exposed to services during dynamic service composition. NG software-controllers
    can negotiate the available resources, capabilities and configurations with the
    dynamic resource managers, with the purpose of forming a trustable network. If
    the services agree to work together, SDRs are configured under the âumbrellaâ
    of the established SLAs. As far as we know, this feature has never been reported
    in literature up to the moment. NovaGenesis combines these emerging ingredients
    towards more flexible and trustable ICT environments. As a first conclusion, NovaGenesis
    can be applied to integrate IoT, CRN, FI, smart cities, next generation mobile
    networks, among other contemporary ICT environments. 3.2. Fundamental concepts
    NovaGenesis is based on a set of fundamental concepts that are required to better
    understand its design and contributions, namely: Naming: Names are symbols used
    to denote one or more individual entities, like pieces of digital contents, computers
    and ordinary things. In our case, denoting stands for representing something by
    âsignalsâ. By definition, names denote meaning and sense. Natural language names
    (NLNes) are those used in the human language, such as âNode 1â or âDomain Aâ.
    However, there are names that have no meaning, for example, the self-verifying
    names1 (SVNes) generated from the output of a mathematical hash function [4].
    For instance, a 32 bits name generated by NG using murmurhash 3 is â28FD4420â.
    SVNes are self-verifiable, because at any time the binary words used to generate
    them can be hashed again and get exactly the same output (name). Using SVNes as
    an alternative to NLNes [13], [24] makes possible to check the relationship between
    the named entity and its name at any time. According to Ghodsi et al. [4], SVNes
    provide better security, scalability, and flexibility than NLNes. Thus, the current
    paper proposes, for the first time, the use of SVNes in a joint IoT and cognitive
    radio scenario. Name binding: Our approach employs an unlimited number of namespaces
    that are linked by means of name bindings. A name binding (NB) is a mapping among
    two or more names, typically implemented as a vector in the form: < key; value(s)
    >. A NB can relate a name to an object or a name to other names. Fig. 2 illustrates
    a name binding scheme. The edges are NBs, whereas the vertices are NLNes or SVNes.
    For example, Domain 1 name is bound to Router 1 and Gateway 2. Obverse that NBs
    can represent entities relationships, i.e. âsemantic operatorsâ among entities,
    like is contained or contains. In the previous example, one can use the NB < Domain
    1; Gateway 2 > to represent that Domain 1 contains a Gateway 2. Download : Download
    high-res image (143KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Graph of names
    and their bindings representing entities relationships. Colors are used to classify
    different types of physical and virtual entities. Name resolution: In context
    of Fig. 2, name resolution consists of resolving a name to other bound names,
    i.e. to determine the values behind a certain key. For example, the name Router
    1 is bound to the names OS 6, while OS 6 can be resolved to Process 10 and Process
    11. NG provides a distributed, hierarchical, name resolution service (NRS) that
    resolves NLNes or SVNes (keys) in one or more NLNes or SVNes (values). Identification
    and localization: An identifier unambiguously separates an entity from others
    in a certain scope. Considering Fig. 2, a scope can be denoted by the name Domain
    1 and all the names of entities inhabiting this domain can belong to the same
    scope. In this context, the names Process 12 and 280273AA uniquely separate this
    entity from others. However, the name Process 12 could not be unique globally.
    In this scenario, SVNes can be used. Note also that Domain 1 can denote the location
    of the Gateway 2 in the network. Services and contracts: A service is a virtual
    entity responsible for processing, exchanging and storing information. According
    to this definition, a computer program is a service. NG follows SOA principles
    [14], in which services are dynamically composed. In SOA, services life-cycling
    is contract-based. It means that after peer services discovery, a contract is
    formulated and negotiated. Therefore, a contract can be defined as a piece of
    information that sets the limits, responsibilities and clauses to be respected,
    as well as criteria for the completion and punishment of services that were poorly
    executed. Proxies, gateways and controllers: A proxy is an attorney that represents
    other components in a network for any purpose. As an example, consider a Wi-Fi
    access point that is represented by a proxy service that âsellsâ its forwarding
    capacities. This proxy can negotiate the Wi-Fi capabilities to potential clients.
    Another important concept is a gateway, which translates or encapsulates messages
    of a certain input protocol to the desired output protocol. Finally, we define
    a controller as a service that makes the decision regarding devices or services
    configurations. The controlled device can be physical or virtual. 3.3. The NovaGenesis
    current implementation The NG web of names (i.e. name bindings graph shown in
    Fig. 2) is implemented in a distributed way. NBs are published and subscribed
    by services and stored on hash table data structures hosted by one or more operating
    system (OS). We have adopted an object oriented design (OOD) approach to implement
    NG components. Every service has several internal objects, called blocks, with
    specific functionalities. Two blocks are instantiated in all services: gateway
    (GW) and hash table (HT), as illustrated in Fig. 3. GW provides a bus for block
    communication inside a service or at different services. It uses SVNes in the
    message headers to decide how to forward/route messages. The HT block is a hash
    multimap data structure employed to stored NBs. The current implementation is
    based in four services: Download : Download high-res image (176KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 3. Example of NovaGenesis one hop link scenario
    formed by two PGCS processes encapsulating NG messages over underlying hardware.
    PSS, GIRS and HTS encompass NovaGenesis name resolution services, which are used
    by two applications (APP1 and APP2) to communicate based on publish/subscribe
    model. Publish/subscribe service (PSS): NBs are published by any services through
    sending a message to an instance of a PSS. PSS provides the rendezvous between
    the publisher and subscriber services, allowing secure and private access to NBs.
    PSS implements the main NG application API that has six primitives: (i) publish
    NB (with associated data, if any); (ii) publish NB/data and notify other services
    about a publication; (iii) subscribe a NB/data; (iv) subscribe a NB/data and notify
    other services about a subscription; (v) deliver a subscribed NB/data; and (vi)
    revoke a NB/data publication. PSS can be seen as a distributed API, accessed via
    its names. Additionally, we have generalized PSS to allow pub/sub of contents
    associated to NBs, adding to this NRS a network cache functionality. Generic indirection
    resolution service (GIRS): PSS does not store bindings or data published, since
    it forwards them to a GIRS instance, which selects a proper hash table service
    (HTS) where they will be stored. The published NB/data are forwarded by GIRS to
    an HTS instance, where they are stored behind a hash table data structure. Therefore,
    GIRS is an intermediate service among PSS and HTS instances. Hash table system
    (HTS): HTS stores bindings and their associated contents, in case they exist.
    Consider for example the content named Sample 1 at Mote 3 of Fig. 2. This content
    will be stored as a file in a folder of an HTS instance. A name binding < 291074AA,
    Sample 1 > can relate the SVN of the content to its NLN. Proxy/gateway/controller
    service (PGCS): The component PGCS provides the following functions: (i) message
    encapsulation over already established networking technologies, such Ethernet
    or Wi-Fi; (ii) a proxy service to represent other NG services inside an OS; (iii)
    bootstrapping functionalities to initialize a domain; (iv) software-control of
    hardware or other computer programs outside NG environment. PGCS enables PSS,
    GIRS, and HTS to discover one another during initialization. Since an address
    is a name that denotes the position to where an existence can inhabit or be attached,
    PGCS relays on its local HT block or the domain HTS to store NBs among already
    established address formats (e.g. a real world or an emulated MAC Ethernet) and/or
    NG addresses. Independently of the address format used to connect PGCSes, inside
    NG all the communication is SVN-oriented. Additionally to the gateway service,
    PGCS publishes NBs about other NG services inside an OS to other PGCSes in the
    same domain, therefore propagating new services for their peers. NovaGenesis messages
    are implemented as information objects and serialized to ASCII character arrays
    with two portions: command lines (streamed from CommandLine objects) and payload
    (streamed from a file system archive). There is a bank line separating both. The
    command lines portion is composed by several textual lines, which can be dynamically
    expanded according to the need. The command lines are formatted as: ng -command
    âalternative version [ < n type E1 E2 E3 E4 ... En > ] where -command is the action
    to be done. -alternative selects among alternatives in the action to be done.
    version selects the desired version of implementation. [ ] indicates one or more
    vectorial arguments. n is the number of elements in an argument. type is the type
    of the elements in an argument. E1 E2 E3 E4 ... En are the elements of an argument.
    3.4. Representing a spectrum cell controller in NovaGenesis In this Subsection,
    we describe two new services developed for NovaGenesis to interoperate and manage
    the low-cost collaborative sensing approach presented in Section 2. Our main goal
    is enabling the convergence between the spectrum sensing approach for IoT with
    the NG âclean slateâ FIA. This work represents an extension of our previous work
    on CRN with NovaGenesis [18]. 3.4.1. Spectrum sensing service The spectrum sensing
    service (SSS) has been developed to expose dedicated spectrum sensing hardware
    or a software-defined radio (SDR) to NG services. It exposes the device features,
    capabilities and configurations, as well details of the available spectrum sampling
    procedures. Other NG services can discover, negotiate and contract spectrum sensing
    functionality via their SSS representatives. This service is also a gateway for:
    (i) dedicated spectrum sensing hardware or SDR, translating NG command lines to
    non NG configurations, e.g. JavaScript object notation (JSON); and for (ii) interconnection
    of TCP/IP and NG stacks, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Messages from SCC are encapsulated
    over TCP/IP using ZeroMQ2 (ZMQ) push/pull sockets and delivered to SSS. Inside
    NovaGenesis, SSS changes to publish/subscribe (pub/sub) model instead of ZMQâs
    push/pull, publishing and subscribing NBs and information objects (like SLAs or
    spectrum samples) to/from name resolution service (NRS).3 Download : Download

    for NovaGenesis interoperability with SCC. SSS provides the interconnection between
    TCP/IP and NG stacks. SCC sends spectrum samples to SSS using ZMQ with TCP/IP/Ethernet.
    Inside NG, the communication model employs pub/sub of NG messages directly over
    Ethernet, meanwhile other link layer technologies can be used. In Fig. 4, SSS
    communicates with SCC through three ZMQ push/pull socket connections, which form
    two communication channels, one for data and another for software-control settings.
    The data channel carries the spectral sensing information obtained by the components
    SC (Section 2.1.1) and SCC (Section 2.1.2). The setup channel is formed by the
    second and third connections and it is used by NG to obtain and send settings
    for SC and SCC. The information exchanged between SSS and SCC are structured in
    strings using JSON format. It is encoded in key/value pairs, in which the key
    field identifies the name of a parameter or command, tied to its value. The configuration
    channel to NovaGenesis can perform two operations: the commands get_info and set_config.
    get_info : The get_info JSON command is sent by SSS to SCC in order to request
    the spectral sensing available functionalities, identifying information of the
    sensing cell and the parameters of the current configuration of spectral sensing.
    The answer contains: (i) the sensing capabilities of the SCC in the key capacities;
    (ii) the cell identification information in the key cell_info; and (iii) the current
    spectrum sensing configuration. set_config : This command is sent from SSS to
    SCC to adjust spectrum sensing parameters according to a resource management service
    (RMS), which will be presented in Section 3.4.2. They are the start and end sampling
    frequencies in Hz. Also, the sampling bandwidth can be configured. data: The spectrum
    energy data is continuously transmitted from SCC to SSS. Fig. 5 illustrates the
    format of this data. The key scc_id uniquely identifies the SCC that generated
    the data. The key msgid provides a message sequence number, while the key date
    carries a timestamp of the sample. Last but not least, the key sensor contains
    the estimated probability that the related channel is busy. Download : Download

    format from SCC to SSS. The information collected by SSS is forwarded to a peer
    resource management service (RMS), whose responsibility includes data aggregation
    and correlation in a similar way to SISA. A SLA proposal describes the sampling
    features of spectrum sensing or SDR equipment it represents, such as rates, resolution,
    output format, among many others. 3.4.2. Resource management service (RMS) RMS
    implements a name-based, contract-oriented, dynamic orchestration of substrate
    resources exposed by SSS (other NG services are being developed, but they are
    out of the scope of this paper). RMS mediates the relationship among user applications
    and the SSS instances, inside NG cloud/networking (without TCP/IP). When a SSS
    discovers a RMS, it proposes a SLA with a description of the service to be provided.
    RMS accepts the contract and starts being notified of the SSSesâ publications
    to become aware of the situation of the radio spectrum opportunities in the ISM
    bands. 3.4.3. Sequence diagram of interoperability solution Fig. 6a and b provide
    a sequence diagram of the actions implemented to transport SCC spectrum samples
    to the NG RMS. In message a, both SSS and RMS publish their NBs to the PSS/GIRS/HTS
    (hereafter, called NRS for short). In message b, they subscribe possible peer
    keywords, e.g. âresourceâ, âmanagerâ, âsensingâ. NRS returns bindings containing
    the subscribed keywords in message c. These NBs, have in the value portion SVNes
    of services candidate to be a peer. Table 1 summarizes the messages exchanged
    among these components, giving details on technologies and message''s content.

    service (RMS) expose their names and discover one another (a,b,c). SSS represents

    SCC capabilities (d,e,f). (b) RMS publishes a contract acceptance that is subscribed
    by SSS (g,h). Spectrum samples are subscribed by RMS (i,j,k). Configuration files
    are published to SSS (l,m,n) and delivered to SCC (o). Table 1. Summary of messages

    SSS subscribes the configuration file. NG/Eth. n NRS delivers the configuration
    file to SSS. NG/Eth. o SSS translates the file and configures SCC. TCP/IP/Eth.
    During SSS initialization, it sends a get_info message to the SCC. When the answer
    returns in message d, SSS is able to make a service offer to RMS, specifying the
    possible configurations at SCC. SSS publishes the offer to the NRS, notifying
    the candidate RMS in message e. RMS subscribes the service offer object as illustrated
    in message f. In the current prototype, RMS just accepts this offer publishing
    a service acceptance object (message g). In future versions, we plan to add negotiation
    actions between them. Observe that these offer and acceptance objects are transferred
    using SVNes in the header of NG messages. Also, the keys used to subscribe these
    objects are used to verify their integrity. To the best of our knowledge, NG is
    the first FIA that checks integrity and provenance of data objects. In message
    h, SSS subscribes the service acceptance object published by the RMS and notified
    by the NRS. Then, when SCC publishes a data JSON like in message i, SSS publishes
    and notifies the peer RMS (message j). RMS then subscribes the data, as illustrated
    in message k. Finally, RMS can request SSS to change some configuration on SCC.
    In this case, it publishes a software-configuration object (message l) that is
    notified to the peer SSS. The SSS component subscribes the object (message m),
    which is delivered by NRS in message n. SSS translates the configuration object
    to the JSON format as expected by the SCC and forwards to SCC (message o). SCC
    then changes the configuration at the GNU Radio, which reflects the change on
    the hardware. 3.5. Comparison to our previous approach without NG Fig. 7 illustrates
    the TCP/IP over Ethernet stack as used to implement the scenario of Section 2.
    The SISA component has the following internal blocks: (i) input/output (IO) control;
    (ii) data access object (DAO), which is an interface to a MongoDB data base; (iii)
    information analysis, which provides algorithms to analyze data stored on the
    data base; and (iv) the data base itself. The communication between IO (and IA)
    to DAO uses ZMQ. From DAO to MongoDB a Linux system call is employed to invoke
    a TCP socket. Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Stack for cooperative spectrum sensing using TCP/IP and ZeroMQ push/pull.
    A comparison of Fig. 4 with Fig. 7 indicates that Section 2 components (SC, SCC,
    SISA) employ TCP/IP over Ethernet as its communication stack, whereas NovaGenesis
    components (SSS, NRS, PGCS, and RMS) run NG directly over Ethernet without TCP/IP.
    SSS works as a gateway between the two stacks. In the Section 2 scenario, not
    only push/pull, but also client/server communication models are employed. On the
    other hand, NG employs only pub/sub due to its security, privacy and asynchronous
    communication features. We can summarize some of the differences between these
    scenarios as: Naming: Content and services are accessed using their self-verifying
    names (SVNes). Message forwarding/routing also employs SVNes. In contrast, ZMQ
    and TCP/IP only allows structured natural language names, which do not have the
    intrinsic security characteristics of SVNes [4]. Name resolution: In current Internet
    the name resolution is provided by DNS. In NovaGenesis, NRS does a similar role,
    but using pub/sub of domain name records. Limited service-orientation: In ZMQ/Internet,
    the service-oriented design (SOD) is employed only on the WWW, whereas in NovaGenesis
    it is for all services, including networking ones. Life-cycling: It encompasses
    the dynamic composition of services and their contents. In the Internet architecture
    it is present only at WWW. In NovaGenesis, life-cycling is intrinsic to any entity:
    content, services, operating systems (OSs), hosts, etc. The same pattern happens
    for contract-based operation. Deployment in hosts: Internet protocols are implemented
    at the core of operating systems. NovaGenesis protocols in hosts are implemented
    as services that follow SOD paradigm. 3.6. Next steps and open challenges We plan
    to implement the complete Fig. 1 scenario in NovaGenesis, with the aim at extending
    NG services to control Wi-Fi access points based on RMS decisions. We are also
    extending our NRS to hierarchical domains, as an alternative to DNS. In addition,
    we have already started implementing NG message encapsulation to other IoT technologies,
    such as IEEE 802.15.4. Furthermore, we have been developing an embedded proxy/gateway
    service (EPGS) to run inside energy constrained devices. Considering project activities
    up to now, we can summarize some open challenges for NG (and other FIAs) evolution
    as: Scalability and elasticity evaluation: Emerging architectures need to prove
    unprecedented levels of scalability and elasticity, especially due to the growths
    on the number of devices and services expected for IoT [2]. An open problem is
    how to evaluate âclean slateâ proposals if experimentation technologies are dependent
    on TCP/IP? Testing revolutionary architectures require raw socket/link layer solutions
    or even interfaces for physical layer. Appropriate methodologies for comparison:
    New architectures such as NovaGenesis, expressive Internet architecture (XIA)
    [24] and network of information (NetInf) [13] employ novel ingredients, combined
    in a unique way. It is not trivial to determine the common and fair aspects to
    be compared, since it does not exist a standard benchmark methodology for FIA
    comparison. New methodologies for large-scale architectures comparison are required.
    Diversity of scenarios: Another hurdle is the diversity of scenarios that should
    be evaluated. Our contemporary Internet is huge and full of protocols. Therefore,
    new tools are required to automate experiments and results analysis. SmartSantander
    [12] and FIWARE [10] are examples of experimentation architectures for smart cities.
    However, as previously stated, many of their tools require TCP/IP and spectrum
    sensing capabilities are not available. Tools and experiments reproducibility:
    tcpdump is a famous tool for monitoring and evaluating TCP connections. Despite
    developing new architectures, researchers also need to develop tools for experimentation
    and performance evaluation of their proposals. 4. Results and analysis We divided
    this section in two parts. Firstly, we analyze the effects of an interfering radio
    in the quality of communication between two IoT nodes in the 915 MHz ISM band.
    Our low-cost cooperative sensing approach is used to determine the best channel
    for the pair of IoT communicating devices. Secondly, we demonstrate a convergent
    solution of future Internet and cognitive radio in the context of IoT. A complete
    life-cycle of spectrum management services is performed, from service exposition
    and discovery up to service contracting and trustable transfer of spectrum data
    to a resource management service. 4.1. Low cost cooperative sensing and cognitive
    radio The implementation scenario of the low-cost cooperative cognitive radio
    for IoT applications was reported in Fig. 1b from Section 2. A pair of radios
    M1 and M2 have been used as IoT devices establishing a communication link; their
    hardware are composed by two Texas Instruments reference designs based on RF transceiver
    CC1120. The experiments have been realized from 902 to 928 MHz, which is a frequency
    range reserved for unlicensed ISM applications. The radios have been configured
    to continuously transmit packets with 50 bytes length at a fixed data rate of
    150 Kbps using 2-GFSK modulation. The radios are placed away from each other in
    such a position that a communication between them is possible when no interference
    is present. Near each radio a SC was placed so M1 and M2 may be sensed by SC1
    and SC2, respectively. Another radio Mint that acts as an interference source
    by means of generating random RF spectrum utilization was placed close to the
    SC1. Mint behaves such as a communication device that does not belongs to this
    IoT network, characterizing a multi-user RF environment. In a practical environment,
    a perfect isolation of RF boundaries is not possible, so the SCs will also sense
    some signal from neighbor radio as well the interfering source. Table 2 summarizes
    the adopted experimental parameters. Table 2. Experimental parameters. Parameters

    PER test 5000 Packets per test The experiments have been carried out for different
    values of receiver signal strength indication (RSSI) by changing the M2 transmission
    power. The probability of the radio Mint be transmitting have been modified to
    evaluate its influence over the link communication. Fig. 8 reports the experimental
    results where the packet error rate (PER) parameter has been used as a performance
    figure of merit. Five thousand packets have been sent in and the amount of successfully
    received packets were recorded. Initially, it was considered that the radios M1
    and M2 does not have information about RF spectrum usage, so the 921  MHz channel
    was selected, the same being used by Mint. During the experiment the interfering
    radio Mint randomly transmit messages that are not demodulated by M1 or M2 but
    interferes on link communication increasing the PER. Posteriorly, an additional
    test has been carried out by means of using the SISA information reported in Fig.
    9, for setting radios M1 and M2. As a centralized source of information, SISA
    indicates the channel 921  MHz is in use and the channel 924  MHz is available.
    The hidden node problem is present as SC2 does not sense Mint signal as shown
    in Fig. 9b. Note that the vertical axis in this figure corresponds to Eq. 4 Detection
    values. When SC1 information Mint is detected (Fig. 9a) the usage of the 921  MHz
    channel is avoided. The PER measurement have been conduced again with radios using
    the 924  MHz channel. It has been kept lower than 5%. Download : Download high-res

    Fig. 10 presents our concept of a convergent solution of future Internet and cognitive
    radio in the context of Internet of Things. The computer on the left side runs
    SCC using GNU Radio, whereas the one in the middle runs five NovaGenesis services,
    including SSS for interoperability with SCC and PSS to provide a distributed API
    for NG pub/sub service, and a PGCS that encapsulates NovaGenesis messages over
    Ethernet/Wi-Fi. The computer on the right runs a PGCS and a RMS. RMS is the target
    of the spectrum samples collected at SCC, forwarded to SSS, published to PSS,
    and finally subscribed by RMS. Download : Download high-res image (534KB) Download

    discovery Fig. 11 contains a partial reproduction of the log of an SSS exposition
    message published to the PSS. The first command line with the command ng -m âcl
    is used by NovaGenesis to route the message to the destination. NG employs a name-based
    routing approach based on tuples of self-verifying names. The argument [ < 4 s
    0BD95286 ED12F3ED 342DD4C5 B8101939 > ] contains a tuple that identify/locate
    the source of the message (SSS) and the argument [ < 4 s 0BD95286 ED12F3ED 449B0B0C
    6FDF0A76 > ] provides the ID/Loc for the PSS. The command line ng -p âb is used
    to publish name bindings, therefore exposing keywords related to the SSS, e.g.
    the key 19656CF3 is the hash of the word âWi-Fiâ. This log is exactly an example
    of the message a from Fig. 6a. In the discovery process, the RMS subscribes keywords
    from the PSS that represent a possible peer (message b). Download : Download high-res

    to the candidate peer RMS. Fig. 12 reproduces the message that carries a Service_Offer_2026721035.txt
    object (message e in Fig. 6a). The pub/notify command line (ng -p ânotify) contains
    the name binding < 1 s 3182F342 > < 1 s Service_Offer_2026721035.txt >, which

    presents a NG message captured using Wireshark tool that is transporting spectrum
    sensing samples inside a SSSFile_5818.txt. Fig. 14a depicts a plot generated from
    15 h of spectrum sampling over NovaGenesis. It demonstrates that the approach
    with NovaGenesis generated a result similar to the previous ones obtained over
    TCP/IP. Finally, in Fig. 14b it is plotted the mean round trip time (RTT) spend
    by the RMS to subscribe spectrum sensing objects from PSS/GIRS/HTS. In the first
    9 h, the RTT remained linear about 5.2 ms. After, it suffered a small increase
    probably due to the large amount of sample files stored at the HTS. All the samples
    have been stored. As a conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a straightforward
    and innovative convergence of IoT, FI and cognitive radio. Download : Download

    presented, for the first time, a successful convergence of cognitive radio network
    (CRN), Internet of Things (IoT) and a future Internet architecture (FIA) called
    NovaGenesis. We first report a low-cost embedded cooperative sensing and cognitive
    radio architecture for IoT. In this solution software-control is provided using
    current Internet technology. Moreover, we have experimentally demonstrated the
    use of cooperative spectrum sensing based on energy detection to overcome the
    hidden node problem, which for sure will be present in IoT. We measured PER as
    a function of RSSI to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed CRN. We have
    also extended NovaGenesis with two novel services to interoperate with the aforementioned
    CRN: spectrum sensing service (SSS) and resource management service (RMS). SSS
    interoperates with a sensing cell controller, which has a GNU Radio implementation
    for determining energy level at channels. The SCC spectrum samples are sent to
    SSS using TCP/IP. SSS translates the data objects from JSON to NovaGenesis and
    publishes them to the RMS (without TCP/IP). RMS subscribes the data objects according
    to their self-verifying names (SVNes), checking provenance and integrity. The
    novelties we demonstrated are typically found only in FIA research: exposition
    and discovery of services; contract-based operation; distributed name resolution
    using keywords and SVNes; and name-based routing of messages among services. These
    features allow the convergence among IoT, CRN and FIAs. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first time spectrum sensing for IoT have been combined with a FIA.
    Future works include the evaluation with different radios, sensing cells, interference
    sources arrangements and spectral sensing algorithms. Finally, we also plan to
    extend NovaGenesis services to have the same software-control architecture (including
    SISA). In this way, we will be able to compare the performance and scalability
    of both current Internet and FIA approaches. Acknowledgments This work was partially

  explanation: This study focuses on evaluating the potential of cognitive radio networks
    (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for resolving IoT's spectral scarcity.
    The authors emphasize the need for both theoretical analysis and real-world testing,
    particularly in the context of spectrum sharing for Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
    where there may be coexistence with traditional licensed networks.
  extract_1: One of the primary challenges in implementing CRNs for IoT is the need
    for efficient spectrum sensing techniques. This study proposes a novel cooperative
    spectrum sensing scheme that leverages the distributed nature of IoT devices to
    improve sensing accuracy and reduce sensing overhead. The scheme is evaluated
    through both theoretical analysis and real-world experimentation. The results
    demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the spectrum utilization
    efficiency of CRNs for IoT, even in the presence of fading and interference.
  extract_2: Another challenge in implementing CRNs for IoT is the need for effective
    spectrum access protocols. This study proposes a novel spectrum access protocol
    that utilizes a combination of DSA and game theory to allocate spectrum resources
    among IoT devices in a fair and efficient manner. The protocol is evaluated through
    both theoretical analysis and real-world experimentation. The results demonstrate
    that the proposed protocol can significantly improve the overall performance of
    CRNs for IoT, in terms of throughput, delay, and fairness.

    \a\nAbstract: The continuous growth of interconnected devices in the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) presents\na challenge in terms of network resources. Cognitive\
    \ radio (CR) is a promising technology that\ncan address the IoT spectral demands\
    \ by enabling an opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) scheme.\nThe application\
    \ of full duplex (FD) radios in spectrum sensing enables secondary users (SUs)\
    \ to\nperform sensing and transmission simultaneously, and improves the utilization\
    \ of the spectrum.\nHowever, random and dense distributions of FD-enabled SU transmitters\
    \ (FD-SU TXs) with sensing\ncapabilities in small-cell CR-IoT environments poses\
    \ new challenges, and creates heterogeneous\nenvironments with different spectral\
    \ opportunities. In this paper, we propose a spatial and temporal\nspectral-hole\
    \ sensing framework for FD-SU TXs deployed in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous\n\
    environment. Incorporating the proposed sensing model, we present the analytical\
    \ formulation and\nan evaluation of a utilization of spectrum (UoS) scheme for\
    \ FD-SU TXs present at different spatial\npositions. The numerical results are\
    \ evaluated under different network and sensing parameters\nto examine the sensitivities\
    \ of different parameters.\nIt is demonstrated that self-interference,\nprimary\
    \ user activity level, and the sensing outcomes in spatial and temporal domains\

    \ have presented a new networking paradigm,\nInternet of Things (IoT) [1]. IoT\
    \ is a network of interconnected devices including sensors, health-care\ndevices,\
    \ home appliances, autonomous cars, and many others. IoT devices are connected\
    \ to the internet\nand are uniquely addressable. IoT promises machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M) and human-to-machine\n(H2M) communications any-time, anyplace, with anyone,\
    \ using any network (or service) [2]. However,\nmaintaining continuous connectivity\
    \ and the enormous number of IoT devices present challenges\nto a radio network.\
    \ The demands of high bandwidth and spectrum resources for IoT applications\n\
    lead to the spectrum scarcity [3]. Traditional wireless spectrum standards rely\
    \ on the static spectrum\nallocation policies where speciï¬c frequency bands are\
    \ assigned to a speciï¬c licensed service and its\nusers. Unlicensed users are\
    \ not authorized to access the licensed bands, resulting in the underutilized\n\
    bands. Such policies cause unbalanced utilization of spectrum and degrade the\
    \ spectral efï¬ciency.\nThus, static spectrum allocation policies are insufï¬cient\
    \ to address the high demands of spectrum\nresources required for the wireless\
    \ access of large number of IoT sensor devices [4]. Spectrum allocation\nï¬exibility\
    \ and spectrum utilization efï¬ciency, required for IoT, can be achieved with different\
    \ proposed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441; doi:10.3390/s19061441\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1441\n2 of 18\ntechnologies such as long term evolution (LTE)\
    \ wireless local area networks (WLAN) aggregation\n(LWA), non-orthogonal multiple\
    \ access (NOMA), operations in millimeter-wave band, LTE over\nunlicensed band\
    \ (LTE-U), ultra-dense 5G small cells, and software-deï¬ned cognitive radio network\n\
    (SD-CRN) [5].\n1.1. Motivations for Using SD-CRNs in IoT\nSD-CRN is a state-of-the-art\
    \ communication paradigm, and is one of the potential technologies\nadopted for\
    \ the IoT and other futuristic M2M applications [2â7].\nSD-CRN exploits the\n\
    dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) and spectrum diversity to address the spectrum\
    \ scarcity and\nunder-utilization issues. Enabling cognitive radio (CR) features\
    \ in IoT (CR-IoT) helps alleviate\ncongestion in the network; hence, increases\
    \ the utilization efï¬ciency of spectrum, and helps to meet\nthe spectrum demands\
    \ of the future IoT. The proposed model is based on the case-study scenarios\n\
    where IoT devices (with CR features) coexist (share a common frequency band) with\
    \ any licensed\nprimary cellular network, and can dynamically access the spectrum\
    \ assigned to a licensed primary\nnetwork [8,9]. It is not spectral- and cost-efï¬cient\
    \ for network service providers to utilize an additional\nlicensed spectrum only\
    \ for IoT services. Therefore, spectrum sharing based on CR features is needed\n\
    for IoT networks. For (resource/power) constrained IoT devices, simple signal\
    \ processing techniques\nare needed to save energy, and reduce system cost. Hence,\
    \ the simplest non-coherent energy detection\n(as sensing technique) is preferred\
    \ as in the previous research [10,11]. In our proposed system, we also\nconsider\
    \ energy based sensing. Moreover, if IoT devices are restricted to perform the\
    \ sensing procedure\n(due to resource/power constraints), the sensing procedure\
    \ can be employed only for the fusion center\n(FC) [12]. The SUs in CR-IoT exploit\
    \ the spectrum under the interference constraint and ensure\nuninterrupted M2M\
    \ or human-based LTE communications. The CR features also provide a cognitive\n\
    facility to the IoT devices that are required to make smart decisions regarding\
    \ the spectrum and to\nperform intelligent operations by analyzing the network\
    \ conditions. The multi-tiered hierarchy in\nCRNs categorizes users into two types:\
    \ primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs). The DSA\ntechniques enable time\
    \ division multiple access (TDMA)-based spectrum sharing between the PUs\nand\
    \ SUs. However, the spectral efï¬ciency (or spectrum utilization) of CRNs depends\
    \ signiï¬cantly\non the successful integration of the PUs and SUs. It requires\
    \ that the SUs be capable of sensing and\nkeeping track of primary transmissions\
    \ precisely. The three main types of DSA-based approaches\nare overlay, underlay,\
    \ and interweave [13â15]. In an underlay approach, the SU and PU can transmit\n\
    simultaneously but with a constraint for the SU to reduce its transmission power\
    \ when the PU is active.\nIn overlay, an SU transmits simultaneously with a PU,\
    \ and assists the primary transmissions with\ncertain relaying techniques. In\
    \ interweave (opportunistic spectrum access (OSA)-based approach),\nan SU exploits\
    \ the spectral opportunities and can transmit only when an idle spectral slot\
    \ is sensed\nto be idle. In Interweave-based CR systems, the SUs exploit the spectral\
    \ opportunities through the\nspectrum sensing. Spectrum sensing is performed either\
    \ independently or in a cooperative manner.\nPerfect spectrum sensing is impossible\
    \ to achieve in the realistic wireless scenarios. Thus, the sensing\nerrors due\
    \ to imperfect sensing must be considered for the precise analysis of the CR-IoT.\
    \ The sensing\nperformance can be enhanced by minimizing the sensing errors. Further,\
    \ the sum rate of the network,\nas well as the utilization for the PU and SU nodes,\
    \ can be improved by choosing the optimal sensing\noperating points under the\
    \ imperfect sensing scenarios [5â7,15,16]. In summary, integrating optimal\nCR\
    \ technology into IoT can alleviate the spectrum scarcity issues and contribute\
    \ in the process of\nIoT developments.\n1.2. Half Duplex (HD) and Full Duplex\
    \ (FD) Radios\nHalf duplex (HD) [16â18], a traditional SD-CRN operation mode,\
    \ is based on a time-slotted\nframe structure where the sensing phase is scheduled\
    \ sequentially with the transmission phase.\nIn HD-CRNs, the node is either in\
    \ the sensing or transmission mode; thus unable to receive and\ntransmit on the\
    \ same frequency simultaneously. An increase in the duration of the sensing phase\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1441\n3 of 18\nreduces the overall system capacity; an increase\
    \ in the duration of the transmission phase impairs the\nsensing accuracy. The\
    \ other drawbacks of HD-based operations include: (i) sacriï¬ce of duration for\n\
    the sensing phase in each time slot, (ii) spectrum collision or waste when PUs\
    \ arrive or leave during\nthe transmission phase, and (iii) requirement for transmission\
    \ to be divided into small discontinuous\nslots even if the spectral hole is long\
    \ and continuous. Such limitations in HD-CRNs result in the\ninefï¬cient use of\
    \ system resources. To consider the above limitations, in-band full duplex (FD)\
    \ radios\nhave been proposed [18â20]. The FD-CRNs can simultaneously perform sensing\
    \ and transmission\nin each time slot. The FD-enabled nodes are able to use the\
    \ spectral holes uninterruptedly and\ncontinuously. Interference to the primary\
    \ network is minimized with the continuous sensing in\nFD-CRNs. Thus, FD-CRNs\
    \ have considerable potential to enhance the spectrum utilization and overall\n\
    system capacity. As a downside, FD-CRNs are achieved at a cost of increased energy\
    \ consumption\nand hardware complexity. The major limitation of FD radios is the\
    \ self-interference (SI) of transceivers\nbecause of small spacing and power difference\
    \ between the transmitting and receiving antennas.\nRecent developments in potential\
    \ FD techniques, i.e., SI suppression (SIS) and SI cancellation (SIC)\nhave facilitated\
    \ the implementation of radical FD-CRN systems. However, imperfect SIS and SIC\
    \ are\npractical achievable, resulting in non-zero residual SI power. The performance\
    \ of FD radios highly\ndepends on these SI mitigation capabilities. Excessive\
    \ SI can even result in the reduced capacity for FD\nsystems, even falling below\
    \ that of HD systems [20â22].\nFor ease of reference, we summarize our commonly\

    \ utilization of spectrum (UoS) [5,6]. In [5], the proposed\nstudy was conducted\
    \ for the multichannel scenarios considering imperfect sensing and spectrum\n\
    handoffs. The utilization of spectrum of the SU nodes, opportunistically operating\
    \ on different\nPU channels, was investigated under different PU and SU co-existing\
    \ network topologies. In our\nprevious studies, the UoS was investigated only\
    \ for the HD radios deployed in time-slotted CRNs.\nIn addition, only a one-dimensional\
    \ temporal spectral hole-sensing model was considered for the\nsynchronous PU\
    \ activities. This paper is inspired by the advances in FD techniques, making\
    \ FD-CRN\na potential candidate to complement and sustain the demands of future\
    \ dense IoT network. The main\naspects of the proposed work are as follows:\n\
    1.\nThe realistic small-cell CR-IoT scenario is considered where FD-enabled SU\
    \ transmitters\n(FD-SU TXs) with sensing capabilities are distributed randomly\
    \ across the transmission\nregion of primary network.\nSuch a dense distribution\
    \ of small-cell FD-SU TXs creates\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n4 of 18\nspectrum-heterogeneous\
    \ environment with different spectral opportunities. In this regards,\nwe propose\
    \ a two-dimensional spatialâtemporal spectral hole-sensing model for FD-SU TXs\n\
    deployed in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous environment, and incorporate the trafï¬c\
    \ variations\nof PU both in time and space domains.\n2.\nAs a performance metric\
    \ of the spatialâtemporal sensing model, we propose and evaluate the\nprobability\
    \ of ï¬nding the non-availability of spatialâtemporal spectral holes, and the probability\n\
    of missing the availability of spatialâtemporal spectral holes.\n3.\nIncorporating\
    \ the proposed sensing model, we present an analytical formulation and evaluation\n\
    of a UoS scheme for the FD-SU TXs present at different spatial positions. The\
    \ performance of\nUoS scheme is investigated in terms of average number of sensing\
    \ slots used for the successful\nsecondary communication in each time-slotted\
    \ frame.\n1.4. Paper Organization\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as\
    \ follows. In Section 2, the system model is described.\nIn Section 3, we describe\
    \ the proposed spatialâtemporal spectral hole-sensing model. Section 4 presents\n\
    the performance metric for the spatialâtemporal spectral hole-sensing model. Section\
    \ 5 presents the\nUoS scheme. Section 6 provides the results and discussion. Section\
    \ 7 concludes the paper, and presents\nthe future work.\n2. System Model\nIn this\
    \ section, we present the system model with a PU spectrum occupancy and frame\
    \ structure\nof FD-SU TXs.\n2.1. PU Spectrum Occupancy Model\nWe assume that the\
    \ PU is always authorized to use the channel. The PU trafï¬c across the\nchannel\
    \ is modeled by the discrete-time semi-Markov (two-state) process [22â24], as\
    \ shown in Figure 1.\nWithout loss of generality, it is assumed that the durations\
    \ of the OFF and ON states are represented\nby the random variables (RVs) A and\
    \ B, respectively. The RVs A and B follow exponential distribution\nwith mean\
    \ durations R and S, respectively. These distributions are to be independent.\
    \ At any time,\nthe probabilities that the PU is in ON or OFF state are given\
    \ by PON = S/S + R, and POFF = R/R +\nS, respectively.\nFigure 1. Activity model\
    \ for primary user (PU).\n2.2. Frame Structure of FD-SU TXs\nThe FD-SU TXs consist\
    \ of imperfect SIS enabled narrowband antennas, i.e., Ant â 1 and Ant â 2.\nAs\
    \ shown in Figure 2, Ant â 1 (a receive antenna) performs the sensing procedure\
    \ to locate the\nspectral holes and Ant â 2 (a transmit antenna) transmits when\
    \ spectral holes are available [22â26].\nIn traditional time-slotted FD frame\
    \ structure, sensing procedure is continuous, i.e., extends to the\nentire duration.\
    \ The drawbacks of such frame structure are: (i) change of PU state needs to be\
    \ consider\nin the sensing procedure when PU and SU are not synchronized (PU state,\
    \ in each frame, is not\nconsistent), which normally degrades the detection performance\
    \ [25], and (ii) time required to make a\ndecision regarding the presence of PU\
    \ extends to the entire time-slotted frame [26]. The considered\ntime-slotted\
    \ frame structure for FD-SU TX is shown in Figure 3, in which sensing duration\
    \ is divided\ninto n consecutive short sensing slots (labelled as TS.0, TS.1,...\
    \ and TS.nâ1), and a sensing procedure\nis performed at each sensing slot. It\
    \ is assumed that the sensing-slots (in each time-slotted frame)\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1441\n5 of 18\nare of same duration. The number of samples in each sensing-slot\
    \ is N, and is expressed as M/n,\nwhere M is the number of total samples in each\
    \ time-slotted frame. The constraint for an asynchronized\ncase is much relax\
    \ as the duration of each sensing-slot is shorter. Therefore, a consistent PU\
    \ state,\nin each sensing-slot, is a more realistic assumption than in the traditional\
    \ time-slotted FD frame\nstructure, and is considered in the proposed system.\
    \ The initial (ï¬rst) sensing-slot in each time-slotted\nframe is HD (FD-SU TX\
    \ performs sensing only) to avoid collision at the start. If a PU is not detected\n\
    at the end of HD sensing slot (TS.0 in Figure 3), FD-SU TX initiates its transmission\
    \ and sensing\nsimultaneously. If a PU is detected at the end of HD sensing slot,\
    \ FD-SU TX do not transmit and\ncontinue to perform the sensing procedure until\
    \ channel is available in the next time-slotted frame\n(which also starts with\
    \ a HD sensing-slot). The reason of continuous sensing is that we do not introduce\n\
    any switching mechanism for sensing procedure at the receiving antennas of resource\
    \ constraint IoT\ndevices (FD-SU TXs). Similarly, if a PU is detected at the end\
    \ of any FD sensing slot, FD-SU TX aborts\nits transmission until the next time-slotted\
    \ frame. The motivation behind the considered time-slotted\nframe structure is\
    \ to account for the tradeoff between the sensing efï¬ciency and timelines in detecting\n\
    the PU. An increment in the duration of sensing slots reduces sensing errors;\
    \ however, it increases\nthe delay of detecting the PU. Conversely, a reduction\
    \ in the duration of sensing slots reduces the\ndelay of detecting the PU, with\
    \ the cost of increased sensing errors. The sensed signal during the\nFD sensing\
    \ slots (TS.1âTS.nâ1 in Figure 3) is corrupted by a self-interference signal.\
    \ The formulation\nof the sensing procedure at FD-SU TX is considered for both\
    \ types of sensing slots: (i) HD sensing\nslots (when FD-SU TX is not transmitting)\
    \ and (ii) FD sensing slots (when FD-SU TX is transmitting).\nThe energy detection\
    \ (ED) scheme is most commonly used for channel sensing because of its low\ncomputational\
    \ and implementation complexities. Moreover, it does not require prior knowledge\
    \ of\nthe PU signal parameters [24â32]. The secondary network does not guarantee\
    \ on-time services, i.e.,\nquality of service (QoS) is not guaranteed. Hence,\
    \ it is assumed that the considered FD-SU TX always\nhas packets to transmit [27].\n\

    \ (FD-SU TX).\nFigure 3. Time-slotted frame structure of FD-SU TXs.\n3. SpatialâTemporal\
    \ Spectral Hole-Sensing Model\nIn this section, we formulate a spatialâtemporal\
    \ spectral hole-sensing model for FD-SU TXs\ndeployed in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous\
    \ environment. As shown in Figure 4, we consider a\nprimary network, i.e., a single\
    \ primary transmitter (PU-TX), multiple primary receivers (PU-RXs),\nand a secondary\
    \ network, i.e., z number of IoT devices or FD-SU pairs (FD-SU TXs and FD-SU\n\
    RXs) [5,10,16]. The proposed system can be considered for both downlink and uplink\
    \ scenarios, i.e.,\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n6 of 18\nPU-TX as base station (BS)\
    \ and mobile station (MS). Because there is no difference in the sensing\nof PU\
    \ signal at a given time and frequency, the results of the paper are valid for\
    \ both scenarios.\nThe proposed system depends only on the transmission range\
    \ of PU-TX, and do not depend on the\nnumber of PU-RXs. The performance of channel\
    \ sensing in temporal domain with multiple PUs has\nbeen proposed [33]. However,\
    \ the authors did not consider the variation of signal power of each PU-TX\ndue\
    \ to the presence of active surrounding PU-TXs. Given the stochastic nature of\
    \ PU ON/OFF pattern,\nthe analytical modelling of (two dimensional) spatial-temporal\
    \ spectral holes sensing framework in the\npresence of multiple PUs is challenging.\
    \ To the best of our knowledge, the analysis of spatialâtemporal\nspectral holes\
    \ with multiple PU-TXs has not been addressed [29â32]. The spectrum sensing system\n\
    model [33] with multiple PUs can be extended for the temporal-spatial analysis.\
    \ However, we consider\na single user primary network as the main contribution\
    \ of the proposed work is to consider the trafï¬c\nvariations of PU in both time\
    \ and space domains, and characterize and evaluate the sensing and UoS\nperformance\
    \ of FD-SU pairs present at different spatial positions. The consideration of\
    \ multiple PUs\n(cellular users) is added in the future work. In the proposed\
    \ work, a single PU-TX case is based on the\nassumption that a single PU-TX has\
    \ a much higher signal power than any other PU-TXs (in a given\nfrequency and\
    \ time) in the considered geographical area. Moreover, the transmission range\
    \ of the\nprimary network is much greater than the secondary IoT network employing\
    \ low power transmission.\nIn addition, secondary receivers only sense the signal\
    \ energy, i.e., do not distinguish (decode) the\nsignals from different PU-TXs.\
    \ Therefore, we can realistically assume that any FD-SU pair is effected\nby a\
    \ single PU-TX. We also consider that a single FD-SU pair is assigned to a time-slotted\
    \ primary\nchannel at a time. Hence, the proposed model do not include the scheduling\
    \ mechanism between the\nFD-SU TXs, and only considers the transmission-scheduling\
    \ of the individual FD-SU pairs in each\ntime slot (illustrated in Figure 3).\
    \ At a given time and frequency band, we consider only one SU\npair by assuming\
    \ the orthogonal multiple access, e.g., TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA. We considers that all\n\
    the FD-SU TXs are equipped with the sensing capability. The transmission radius\
    \ of an FD-SU TX\nis r0. The transmission region of the PU (with radius D1 from\
    \ PU-TX) is R1, and is determined by\nthe receiving sensitivity of PU [29,30].\
    \ If a primary receiver (PU-RX) is outside R1, it will not work\nproperly. The\
    \ FD-SU pairs are randomly distributed in an area (with radius D2 from PU-TX),\
    \ which is\nclosely related to the sensing sensitivity of FD-SU TXs. Any FD-SU\
    \ TX, outside this area, will not be\nable to detect the primary signal. The R2\
    \ is the region outside of R1. We considers a typical scenario\n(i.e., D2 > D1),\
    \ in which FD-SU TXs have a higher sensing sensitivity than the receiver sensitivity\n\
    of PU-RXs (to avoid interference with the primary transmission) [29â33]. Interference\
    \ to the PU-RX\nis not permitted. Hence, FD-SU TXs in R1 have the temporal spectral\
    \ opportunities only, and the\ntrafï¬c variations of PU are considered in the time\
    \ domain. The FD-SU TXs in R2 have the spatial\nspectral opportunities (can access\
    \ the channel anytime). However, FD-SU TXs lose their spatial spectral\nopportunities\
    \ when detect a PU-TX. The FD-SU TXs in R2, near to the PU-RXs, can cause harmful\n\
    interference and are referred to be present in the NC Region. The NC Region is\
    \ determined by the\ninterference constraint from the PU-RXs, and the peak transmission\
    \ power of the FD-SU TXs [29].\nAn appropriate power control, which is beyond\
    \ the scope of this paper, is an essential requirement to\nallow these FD-SU TXs\
    \ to exploit their spectral opportunities. Hence, FD-SU TXs in the NC Region are\n\
    not considered in the proposed work.\nIn the considered network, there are two\
    \ potential signal sources, i.e., PU-TX and FD-SU TX. Thus,\nwe deï¬ne four tests\
    \ of the hypothesis as follows,\nâ¢\nH00\nPU-TX is OFF and FD-SU TX is not transmitting.\n\
    â¢\nH01\nPU-TX is ON and FD-SU TX is not transmitting.\nâ¢\nH10\nPU-TX is OFF and\

    O0\nB : S(i) =\nn\nh1s1(i) + n(i)\n{H01} ,\nSB,\n(7)\nO1\nB : S(i) =\nn\nh1s1(i)\
    \ + g1s2(i) + n(i)\n{H11} ,\nSB,\n(8)\nwhere O0\nB denotes the non-availability\
    \ of spatialâtemporal spectral holes during HD sensing slots\nbecause of H01 and\
    \ FD-SU TX is present in R1 (SB). Similarly, O1\nB denotes the non-availability\n\
    of spatialâtemporal spectral holes during FD sensing slots because of H11 and\
    \ FD-SU TX\nis present in R1 (SB).\nIt can be observed that the availability/non-availability\
    \ of spatialâtemporal spectral holes (during\nHD and FD sensing slots) in Equations\
    \ (5)â(8) is a combination of availability/non-availability of\npure temporal\
    \ and spatial spectral holes in Equations (1)â(4). However, spatialâtemporal spectral\n\
    hole-sensing model incorporates the trafï¬c variations of the PU in both domains\
    \ (time and space) for\nthe FD-SU TXs present at different spatial positions.\n\
    4. Performance Metric for SpatialâTemporal Spectral Hole-Sensing Model\nIn this\
    \ section, we introduce the performance metric to guide the spatialâtemporal spectral\n\
    hole-sensing model. Closed-form expressions of sensing probabilities are proposed.\
    \ The sensing\nprobabilities are: (i) the probability of ï¬nding the non-availability\
    \ of spatialâtemporal spectral holes\nand (ii) the probability of missing the\
    \ availability of spatialâtemporal spectral holes.\nThe probabilities of ï¬nding\
    \ the non-availability of spatialâtemporal spectral holes during HD and\nFD sensing\
    \ slots are respectively expressed as\nP0\nF.nST\nâ= Pr\nn\nÎ¨0\nST = O0\nB | O0\n\

    ST and Î¨1\nST denote the decision functions for spatialâtemporal spectral holes\
    \ during HD and\nFD sensing-slots, respectively.\nBased on the detail derivation\
    \ in [29] and extending it separately for HD and FD sensing slots,\nthe probabilities\
    \ of ï¬nding the non-availability of spatialâtemporal spectral holes are expressed\
    \ by the\ntemporal states of the PU and the spatial positions of FD-SU TX as\n\
    P0\nF.nST = Pr {T(S) > Ï1 | H01} ,\nSB\n(11)\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n9 of 18\n\
    P1\nF.nST = Pr {T(S) > Ï2 | H11} ,\nSB,\n(12)\nwhere P0\nF.nST and P1\nF.nST denote\
    \ the probabilities of ï¬nding the non-availability of spatialâtemporal\nspectral\
    \ holes during HD and FD sensing-slots, respectively.\nÏ1 and Ï2 are the detection\n\
    thresholds during HD and FD sensing slots, respectively.\nT(S) denotes the test\
    \ statistics,\nand is expressed as 1\nN\nNâ1\nâ\ni=0\n|S(i)|2.\nSimilarly, the\
    \ probabilities of missing the availability of spatialâtemporal spectral holes\
    \ during\nHD and FD sensing slots are respectively expressed as\nP0\nMi.ST\nâ=\
    \ Pr\nn\nÎ¨0\nST = O0\nB | O0\nA\no\n(13)\nP1\nMi.ST\nâ= Pr\nn\nÎ¨1\nST = O1\nB\
    \ | O1\nA\no\n.\n(14)\nIn a similar fashion, extending the derivation in [29]\
    \ separately for HD and FD sensing slots,\nthe probabilities of missing the availability\
    \ of spatialâtemporal spectral holes are also expressed by the\ntemporal states\
    \ of the PU and spatial positions of the FD-SU TX as\nP0\nMi.ST =\n(\nPr {T(S)\
    \ > Ï1 | H00} POFF,\nSB\nPr {T(S) > Ï1 | H00} POFF + Pr {T(S) > Ï1 | H01} PON,\n\
    SA\n(15)\nP1\nMi.ST =\n(\nPr {T(S) > Ï2 | H10} POFF,\nSB\nPr {T(S) > Ï2 | H10}\
    \ POFF + Pr {T(S) > Ï2 | H11} PON,\nSA.\n(16)\nIt can be observed that the probabilities\
    \ of ï¬nding the non-availability of spatialâtemporal spectral\nholes (P0\nF.nST,\
    \ and P1\nF.nST) are related to the FD-SU TXs in R1 only, because the FD-SU TXs\
    \ in R2 have\nspatial spectral holes, i.e., can access the channel anytime. The\
    \ probabilities of missing the availability\nof spatialâtemporal spectral holes\
    \ (P0\nMi.ST, and P1\nMi.ST) for the FD-SU TXs in R1 are determined by the\nOFF\
    \ state of the PU, and are represented with an event that the FD-SU TX detects\
    \ the presence of the\nPU when the PU is in OFF state, i.e., temporal false alarms.\
    \ Furthermore, P0\nMi.ST, and P1\nMi.ST for the\nFD-SU TXs in R2 are determined\
    \ by each state of the PU, i.e., ON, and OFF states, and are represented\nwith\
    \ the following two events; (i) FD-SU TX determines the presence of PU when PU\
    \ is in the OFF\nstate, i.e., temporal false alarms, and (ii) FD-SU TX determines\
    \ the presence of the PU when the PU is\nin the ON state, i.e., spatial false\
    \ alarms.\nGiven S(i) in Equation (1), and Equation (2) as i.i.d., the mean and\
    \ variance of T(S) can be\nexpressed as,\nE [T(S)] = E\nh\n|S(i)|2i\n,\nE [T(S)]\

    \ X â [0, 1]. X represents the ratio between the residual\nself-interference and\

    completely suppress its residual self-interference. Substituting the statistical\

    \ during HD and FD sensing slots can be formulated either under the QoS\nconstraint\
    \ for the PU, i.e., guaranteed protection level to the PU, or the QoS constraint\
    \ for the FD-SU TX,\ni.e., guaranteed usability rate of spatialâtemporal spectral\
    \ holes [5]. In the proposed work, we consider\nthe QoS constraint for the PU,\

    Based on the proposed spatialâtemporal spectral hole-sensing model in Section\
    \ 3, we present an\nanalytical formulation and evaluation of the UoS scheme for\
    \ the FD-SU TXs deployed at different\nspatial positions in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous\
    \ environment.\nThe UoS performance was\nevaluated by determining the average\
    \ number of sensing slots, (Ï), used for the successful secondary\ncommunication\
    \ in each time-slotted frame. Because a dense small-cell scenario is considered,\
    \ i.e.,\nr0 << D1, the UoS performance was evaluated for two possible cases, as\
    \ shown in Figure 5. The cases\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n11 of 18\nare: (i) the\
    \ FD-SU TX is present in R1 (FD-SU pair is completely inside the transmission\
    \ range of PU)\nand (ii) the FD-SU TX is present in R2 (FD-SU pair is completely\
    \ outside the transmission range of\nPU). As explained earlier, the ï¬rst sensing\
    \ slot in each time-slotted frame is always HD, i.e., FD-SU\nTX only performs\
    \ the sensing procedure. If the PU is not detected at the end of HD sensing slot,\n\
    the FD-SU TX initiates its transmission and sensing simultaneously. If the PU\
    \ is detected at the end of\nHD (or any FD) sensing slot, the FD-SU TX do not\
    \ transmit (or stops transmission) until the next cycle\n(time-slotted frame).\n\
    Figure 5. Considered cases of FD-SU TXs.\nThe probability of detecting the spatialâtemporal\
    \ spectral holes during HD and FD sensing slots\ndepends on the sensing outcome,\
    \ the PU activity, and the spatial position of FD-SU TX. The probability\nof detecting\
    \ the spatialâtemporal spectral holes in only ï¬rst k number of sensing slots in\
    \ each\ntime-slotted frame can be deï¬ned as\nPSTâh (k) = PA (k) â PB (k + 1) .\n\
    (28)\nHere, PA (k) refers to the possible scenarios where spatialâtemporal spectral\
    \ holes are detected\nin greater or equal to k number of sensing slots. Similarly,\
    \ PB (k + 1) refers to the possible scenarios\nwhere spatialâtemporal spectral\
    \ holes are detected in greater or equal to k + 1 number of sensing slots.\nHence,\
    \ PA (k) can be expressed as\nPA (k) =\n\x10\n1 â P0\nMi.ST\n\x11\nk\nâ\nj=1\n\
    \x10\n1 â P1\nMi.ST\n\x11j\n.\n(29)\nThe probabilities of missing the availability\
    \ of spatialâtemporal spectral holes (P0\nMi.ST, and P1\nMi.ST)\nfor FD-SU TX\
    \ in R2 are determined by each state of the PU, and involve both temporal and\
    \ spatial\n(excessive) false alarms. Conversely, P0\nMi.ST and P1\nMi.ST for FD-SU\
    \ TX in R1 involve only temporal false\nalarms. It is assumed that all FD-SU TXs\
    \ are synchronous to their corresponding receivers, and initiates\ntransmission\
    \ and reception at the same time.\nA channel error occurs when the received SNR,\
    \ because of path loss or deep fading, falls below\nthe considered threshold [5,13].\
    \ We consider the same bit error rate (BER) in each time-slotted frame.\nHence,\
    \ the number of transmitted bits is adjusted as per the k number of sensing slots\
    \ in each\ntime-slotted frame. The probability of obtaining an errored secondary\
    \ packet, owing to channel errors,\ncan be expressed as [5]\nPE = 1 â\nh\n(1 â\
    \ BER (Î³s))kPSi\n,\n(30)\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n12 of 18\nwhere kPS is the packet\
    \ size, i.e., transmitted number of bits in k number of sensing-slots, Î³s is the\n\
    SNR of the secondary transmission, and BER is the bit error rate for the considered\
    \ secondary channel,\nand can be expressed as [5]\nBER (Î³s) =\n1\n4Î³s\n.\n(31)\n\
    In our work, we assume that the UoS is contributed to only during the sensing\
    \ slots during which\nFD-SU TXs detect the state of the considered channel correctly.\
    \ Moreover, the access contention for the\nFD-SU TXs is also not considered.\n\
    From Equations (28)â(30), the average number of sensing slots used for a successful\
    \ secondary\ncommunication in each time-slotted frame can be deï¬ned as\nÏ =\n\

    \ Setup\nIn this section, numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance\
    \ of proposed\nspatialâtemporal spectral hole-sensing model and UoS scheme for\
    \ FD-SU TXs with different temporal\nstates and spatial positions. In our simulation\
    \ setup, the transmission range of the PU node and\nsensing range of the FD-SU\
    \ TXs were varied to allow different values of probabilities and sensing\nparameters.\
    \ To obtain the numerical results, the key parameters were chosen as follows:\
    \ kPS = 1000 bits\nfor k = 1 and BER = 0.00025. The power of the primary and secondary\
    \ transmissions was set to be\n20 dB and 10 dB, respectively. The variance of\
    \ the sensing channel was set to Ï2\nh1 = 0.001, and hence,\nthe instantaneous\
    \ sensing SNR was â10 dB. The values of the SIS factor (X) were considered to\
    \ be in\nthe range 0.001â0.3. To provide the desired protection level to the PU,\
    \ the probabilities of ï¬nding the\nnon-availability of spatialâtemporal spectral\
    \ holes during HD and FD sensing slots (\nP0 Â¯\nF.nST, and\nP1 Â¯\nF.nST)\nwere\
    \ considered to be in the range 0.7â0.9. Unless otherwise stated, a fair model\
    \ of PU the status, i.e.,\nPON = POFF = 0.5 was considered. The values of these\
    \ parameters were set accordingly to validate the\nchannels characteristics and\
    \ network behavior.\n6.2. Simulation Results\nFigures 6 and 7 show the sensing\
    \ performance during HD and FD sensing slots, respectively,\nin term of the probabilities\
    \ of ï¬nding the non-availability of spatialâtemporal spectral holes,\nand the\
    \ probabilities of missing the availability of spatialâtemporal spectral holes.\
    \ There was no\nself-interference signal during HD sensing slots. However, the\
    \ sensed signal during FD sensing\nslots was corrupted with the self-interference\
    \ signal as FD-SU TX was transmitting simultaneously.\nThe results indicate the\
    \ existence of different spatial and temporal spectral opportunities for FD-SU\n\
    TXs present at different spatial positions in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous environment.\
    \ It can be\nobserved that the probabilities of missing the availability of spatialâtemporal\
    \ spectral holes during\nHD and FD sensing slots (P0\nMi.ST, and P1\nMi.ST) was\
    \ always greater for FD-SU TXs in R2 than those\nin R1. This is because the P0\n\
    Mi.ST, and P1\nMi.ST for FD-SU TX in R2 involves spatial (excessive) false\nalarms,\
    \ determined by ON state of the PU. In detail, temporal false alarms for FD-SU\
    \ TXs (R1 and\nR2) arose because of the miss-detection of the absence of a PU.\
    \ The spatial false alarms for FD-SU\nTXs in R2 arose because of the detection\
    \ of presence of a PU despite the fact that the FD-SU TX\nis outside the transmission\
    \ region. The spatial and temporal false alarms depend on the usage\nof channel\
    \ by the PU, and number of sensing samples, respectively. It can be observed that\
    \ the\nreduced use of channel by the PU and a greater number of sensing samples\
    \ result in fewer spatial and\ntemporal false alarms, respectively, and results\
    \ in the improved spatialâtemporal spectral hole-sensing\nperformance. The inï¬uence\
    \ of different INRs in terms of SIS factors (X) over the spatialâtemporal\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1441\n13 of 18\nspectral hole-sensing performance is shown in Figure\
    \ 7. The temporal false alarms increased with\nX, which is intuitive because X\
    \ increases the interference power. Thus, our results illustrate the\nrequirement\
    \ for identifying the optimal range of the secondary transmit power to obtain\
    \ the desired\nspatialâtemporal spectral hole-sensing performance.\nFigure 6.\
    \ Sensing performance of spatialâtemporal spectral holes during the half duplex\
    \ (HD) sensing slots.\nFigure 7. Sensing performance of spatialâtemporal spectral\
    \ holes during the full duplex (FD) sensing slots.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n14\
    \ of 18\nFigures 8 and 9 illustrate the performance of the UoS scheme, and show\
    \ the average number\nof sensing slots used for the successful secondary communication\
    \ (in each time-slotted frame).\nThe performance of the UoS scheme was investigated\
    \ for different PU active state probabilities\n(PON), SIS factors, and QoS constraints\
    \ (\nP0 Â¯\nF.nST, and\nP1 Â¯\nF.nST). In Figures 8 and 9, the QoS constraints\n\
    (during HD and FD sensing-slots) were set to 0.9, and 0.7, respectively. Reduced\
    \ QoS constraints\nmeans less protection to the PU and more spectral opportunities\
    \ for FD-SU TXs (R1 and R2), and hence,\naverage number of sensing slots used\
    \ for the successful secondary communication increases. In detail,\nthe results\
    \ show the reduction in the average number of successful secondary communicating\
    \ sensing\nslots with the usage of channel by the PU node, considering a ï¬xed\
    \ PU mean OFF duration (R).\nThe reason is that the spectral opportunities (spatial\
    \ and temporal) decrease under the considered\nscenario. The average number of\
    \ successful secondary communicating sensing slots also reduced\nwith the SIS\
    \ factors owing to the increase in temporal and spatial false alarms. The results\
    \ validate\nthe existence of different spectral opportunities in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous\
    \ environment by\ndemonstrating different average number of communicating sensing\
    \ slots for R1 and R2. Importantly,\nthe average number of successful secondary\
    \ communicating sensing slots for FD-SU TX in R1 was less\nthan that of R2. This\
    \ is because FD-SU TX in R2 can continue to avail the spatial spectral opportunities\n\
    even when PU is in ON state, which is not the case for FD-SU TX in R1. Hence,\
    \ our results validate the\nrequirements for the optimal performance of the UoS\
    \ in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous environment.\nFigure 8. Average number of secondary\
    \ communicating sensing slots with different PU active state\nprobabilities and\

    \ secondary communicating sensing slots with different PU active state\nprobabilities\
    \ and SIS factors (at different quality of service (QoS) constraint).\nIn Figure\
    \ 10, the performance of the UoS scheme, in terms of average number of sensing\
    \ slots\nused for the successful secondary communication (in each time-slotted\
    \ frame), is investigated under\ndifferent PU mean inactive durations (R) and\
    \ SIS factors. The QoS constraints for the probability of\nï¬nding the non-availability\
    \ of spatialâtemporal spectral holes (during HD and FD sensing-slots) were\nset\
    \ to 0.9. The PU active state probability was considered to be 0.1. The results\
    \ again demonstrate\nthe existence of different spectral opportunities in CR-IoT\
    \ spectrum-heterogeneous environment,\nand validate the average number of successful\
    \ secondary communicating sensing slots for temporal\nand spatial spectral holes.\
    \ Importantly, it can be observed that the average number of sensing slots\nused\
    \ for the successful secondary communication for all FD-SU TXs (R1 and R2) increased\
    \ as R\nincreased. The reason is that the increase in R at ï¬xed PU states probabilities\
    \ (PON and POFF) and\nduration of sensing slots means more sensing slots with\
    \ temporal and spatial spectral holes. Hence,\nthe average number of successful\
    \ secondary communicating sensing slots increased. Our results help\nto identify\
    \ the ranges of PU mean durations and SIS factors, subject to the spatial positions\
    \ of FD-SU\nTXs, for the required sensing performance in spatial and temporal\
    \ domains.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1441\n16 of 18\nFigure 10. Average number of secondary\

    7. Conclusions\nCRNs are designed to manage radio resources efï¬ciently by utilizing\
    \ the spectral holes in\nlicensed frequency bands. The in-band FD technology,\
    \ a new paradigm for CRNs, allows SUs to\nsimultaneously sense and access the\
    \ spectral holes. However, the efï¬cient sharing of spectrum\nbetween the dynamic\
    \ PU and FD-enabled SU transmitters (FD-SU TXs), in dense small-cell IoT\nscenarios,\
    \ presents challenges that must be addressed. The random and dense distribution\
    \ of FD-SU\nTXs with sensing capabilities creates heterogeneous environments with\
    \ temporal and spatial spectral\nopportunities. In this regard, we considered\
    \ the trafï¬c variations of the PU both in time and space\ndomains, and proposed\
    \ a two-dimensional spatial and temporal spectral hole-sensing model for the\n\
    FD-SU TXs deployed in CR-IoT spectrum-heterogeneous environment. Incorporating\
    \ the proposed\nsensing model, an analytical formulation and evaluation of the\
    \ UoS scheme was proposed for\ndifferent FD-SU TXs. The performance of the UoS\
    \ scheme was investigated in terms of average\nnumber of sensing slots used for\
    \ the successful secondary communication in each time-slotted frame.\nThe numerical\
    \ results validated the inï¬uence of different network and sensing parameters over\
    \ the\nproposed spatialâtemporal spectral hole-sensing model and UoS scheme. In\

    Abstract: The problem of cooperative spectrum leasing to unlicensed Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices is studied to account for potential selfish behavior of these
    devices. A distributed game theoretic framework for spectrum leasing is proposed
    where the licensed users can willingly lease a portion of their spectrum access
    to unlicensed IoT devices, and in return the IoT devices provide cooperative services,
    firstly to enhance information secrecy of licensed users via adding intentional
    jamming to protect them from potential eavesdroppers, and secondly to enhance
    the quality of communication through cooperative relaying. The cooperative behavior
    of the potentially selfish IoT devices is monitored using a reputation-based mechanism
    to enable the primary users to only interact with the reliable IoT devices. The
    simulation results show that using the proposed reputation-based method enhances
    the secrecy rate of the primary users by reducing the possibility of attacks from
    selfish IoT devices. Hence, this model can offer a practical solution for spectrum
    leasing with mobile IoT devices when assuring the required quality of communication
    and information secrecy for the spectrum owners 1 . Published in: IEEE INFOCOM

    HI, USA SECTION I. Introduction Development of new wireless communication technologies
    and skyrocketing demand for new data services, in particular growing Internet
    of Things (IoT) with potentially billions of wireless devices, motivated many
    dynamic spectrum allocation technologies to enhance the spectrum utilization efficiency.
    While current research efforts focus on common spectrum sharing mechanisms where
    the licensed users are unaware of unlicensed users'' presence (e.g. database control
    and spectrum sensing mechanisms), these methods may not be the best choice for
    spectrum sharing with IoT devices. Energy constraint and limited spectrum mobility
    at these often tiny devices restrict their performance in spectrum sensing mechanisms.
    Moreover, having a central controller or enabler to keep a record of licensed
    users'' spectrum usage and allowable interference range as required in database
    control technologies (e.g. TV White Spaces) may not be practical in such large-scale
    IoT networks. Another drawback of the majority of common spectrum sharing models
    is their overly conservative approach to protect the incumbent users against malicious
    and selfish unlicensed entities. Hence, such approaches that enforce a low level
    of transmission power for unlicensed users, or allocate a wide and static protection
    zone around the incumbents, are unable to address the increasing demand for radio
    spectrum from IoT networks. Furthermore, in common model paradigm, the licensed
    users do not usually benefit from allowing the unlicensed users to share their
    spectrum, but even they can suffer due to interference from Secondary Users (SUs).
    That being said, flexible spectrum right models in which the Primary Users (PUs)
    can willingly lease a portion of their spectrum access to unlicensed users (e.g.
    IoT devices) in exchange for remuneration or some sort of compensation (e.g. energy
    harvesting or cooperative relaying service) can offer a win-win solution for both
    parties [1]â[6]. However, one main concern toward enabling shared access techniques
    to the radio spectrum, particularly the federal bands, is security. In addition
    to traditional security threats in wireless networks such as concerns related
    to privacy of the users, authentication, and confidentiality of communications
    among the users in the presence of eavesdroppers, networks with dynamic spectrum
    allocation mechanism are also vulnerable to unauthorized access to the spectrum
    as well as potential selfish behavior of users taking advantage of the ad hoc
    nature of such networks [7]â[9]. Therefore, the cognitive radio networks are prone
    to suffer from various exogenous, malicious, and selfish attacks. Some of these
    attacks are Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to deny the unlicensed users from
    spectrum access, sensing data falsification attacks, and primary user emulation
    attacks, only to name a few [10], [11]. Different security mechanisms have been
    proposed to address these attacks, which among these information theoretic secrecy
    methods aim to secure the communication of the nodes from potential eavesdroppers
    by exploiting the physical characteristics of wireless channels [12]. This can
    be achieved by adding artificial noise, using beamforming techniques, or employing
    MIMO techniques [13], [14]. Despite conventional cryptographic methods, information
    theoretic secrecy-based techniques do not rely on encryption keys, and hence do
    not involve key distribution and key management complexities. Cooperative jamming
    in cognitive radio networks has been implemented by employing the SUs to create
    artificial noise [15], or transmit structured codewords to reduce the eavesdropper''s
    capability in decoding the PU''s information. The potentially non-cooperative
    SUs can be encouraged to provide such a service if they are granted with a chance
    of spectrum access for their own transmission, as introduced in [15]. Providing
    cooperative jamming for the primary users, in addition to other previously studied
    compensation techniques such as cooperative relaying and energy harvesting, can
    offer a practical solution for implementation of property-right cognitive radio
    networks without involving money exchange among the parties or other regulatory
    issues [15]. In [14], a Stackelberg game model is defined to model the interactions
    between a legitimate source node and a non-altruistic secondary user in presence
    of an eavesdropper. The secondary user can be compensated with a fraction of the
    legitimate source node''s access time to radio spectrum if it provides cooperative
    jamming to enhance the secrecy rate of the source node. This model is further
    extended to a scenario with multiple potential cooperative jammers where the competition
    among them is modeled as an inner Vickrey auction. The proposed model [14] favors
    the primary user by defining the game in such a way that the time allocation to
    access the spectrum as well as the ratio of the power, which the secondary users
    spend on cooperative jamming and the one they utilize for their own transmission,
    are determined by the primary user. Although the primary user deserves more benefits
    as the spectrum owner, in reality there is no guarantee that the secondary users
    will follow the power allocation ratio requested by the primary user after being
    granted with spectrum access. The authors in [16] study a similar model with the
    objective of enhancing the secrecy rate of both the primary and secondary nodes,
    where the secondary nodes are assumed to be fully trustable. While cooperative
    jamming provided by the SUs can potentially enhance the secrecy rate of the licensed
    users, it involves the assumption of having unconditionally cooperative and trustable
    SUs, as considered in the majority of previously reported studies [14]â[17]. However,
    this assumption is far too optimistic in communication networks, noting the nonaltruistic
    nature of cognitive secondary users (e.g. IoT devices). This frequent assumption
    has been revisited in some work considering different aspects of potential selfish
    or malicious behavior by SUs. The authors in [18], [19] discussed a scenario where
    the relay nodes can potentially act as eavesdroppers and study whether cooperation
    can still improve the secrecy. In this paper, we consider a scenario where the
    secondary users can be selfish but not malicious and propose a reputation-based
    mechanism to identify the untrustable users. It is assumed that the SUs are pre-authenticated
    and the problem of dealing with authenticating intruding/malicious secondary nodes
    is out of the scope of this work. In the majority of previously proposed reputation-based
    methods to enforce cooperation, the users (e.g. relay nodes) self-report their
    reputation [20], [21]. Therefore, such methods are prone to the security and reliability
    of communication channels to report these reputations. Another vulnerability of
    such methods is the possibility of reporting false reputations by selfish/malicious
    nodes that requires an audit unit to identify such misbehaving users [22], [23].
    Also, authors in [24] proposed a weighted cooperative spectrum sensing framework
    for infrastructure-based networks which requires a base station to receive reports
    and updates from secondary users. But, our model does not need any base station,
    so it is compatible with any infrastructureless or ad hoc networks. In [25], a
    reputation-based secure method is proposed for distributed networks that involves
    a heavy overhead for update messages from neighbor nodes. However, in our proposed
    model, the reputation of the potential relay nodes is directly observed by the
    source node (e.g. primary node), hence it can prevent the impact of false reports.
    If such a first-hand reputation of a relay node was not available to a primary
    user, it can inquire this reputation from other primary users in the neighborhood
    (second-hand reputation) as further explained in Section III. Fig. 1. An example
    of spectrum leasing to secondary iot devices in exchange for cooperative jamming
    and cooperative relaying. In this example, S T 4 is the selected trustable secondary
    iot. Show All Let us consider the problem of spectrum leasing to secondary IoT
    devices in the presence of a passive eavesdropper, in which these IoT devices
    provide cooperative relaying and cooperative jamming services to enhance the secrecy
    rate and quality of service of the primary user in exchange for spectrum access.
    Since the IoT devices often have a limited energy, the natural tendency of such
    non-altruistic users can often lead to selfish attacks where they violate their
    commitments to the primary users after they are granted the spectrum access. In
    this paper, we propose a reputation-based method to monitor the cooperative behavior
    of these IoT SUs in terms of the power they dedicate to requested services from
    the primary user including cooperative jamming and cooperative relaying to prevent
    potential selfish behavior. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In
    Section II, the system model is described. The formulation of the proposed reputation-based
    Stackelberg game is defined in Section III. The simulation results are presented
    in Section IV, followed by concluding remarks in Section V. SECTION II. System
    Model In this paper, we consider a cognitive radio network consists of a single
    primary user (PU), and N secondary IoT users (SUs) who are seeking to obtain spectrum
    access. There also exists a passive malicious eavesdropper, ED , who attempts
    to decode the PU''s message, as depicted in Fig. 1. The PU''s transmitter, PT
    , intends to send a secure message to its receiver, denoted by PR . The transmitter
    and receiver of SU i are denoted by S T i , and S R i , respectively. All transmitters
    and receivers are assumed to have a single antenna. It is assumed that channels
    between the nodes are slow Rayleigh fading with constant coefficients over one
    time slot. These channel coefficients are defined as follows: i) h P S i refers
    to channel coefficients between the PU''s transmitter and i th SU''s transmitter;
    ii) h S i P , h S i , and h S i E denote the channel coefficients between i th
    SU transmitter and the PU''s receiver, the i th SU receiver, and the eavesdropper,
    respectively. We assume that there is no direct link between PT and PR . A common
    assumption of availability of Channel State Information (CSI) at the transmitters
    using standard channel state estimation techniques is followed here [14]â[16].
    The noise sources at the receivers are complex and circularly symmetric, i.e.
    nâ¼CN(0, Ï 2 ) . A constant power P P is assumed at the PU, while the maximum available
    energy for each time slot at SU i is E max i . Each time slot of PU''s access
    to the radio spectrum, T , is divided to three phases, as depicted in Fig. 2.
    During Phase I, (1âÎ±)T , the PU broadcasts its message to the available secondary
    users. It is assumed that the eavesdropper is out of the range of direct communication
    from the PU''s transmitter.2 If the transmitted signal at PT is denoted by S ,
    the received signal at SU i th transmitter during the first phase is X ST i =
    P P â â â â h P S i S+ n ST (1) View Source where n ST â¼CN(0, Ï 2 ) denotes the
    noise at S T i . During Phase Î ,Î±Î²T , the selected trustable secondary user (as
    defined in Section III) participates in cooperative relaying and jamming. If secondary
    user i is selected by the PU, it forwards the PU''s message to PR with power P
    i C , and also adds artificial noise z with power P i j to confuse the eavesdropper.
    A Decode-and-Forward (DF) relaying scheme is deployed at the secondary users where
    the received message is fully decoded. We assume that a secure information transmission
    mechanism is in place where the PU''s receiver can obtain a priori knowledge of
    the added artificial noise by the secondary user [16], [26], [27]. One practical
    method to obtain this a priori knowledge of artificial noise is using a pseudo-random
    generator with finite states at the relay and legitimate primary receiver, while
    the state of the pseudorandom generator is sent to the PR via a secure control
    channel. While this mechanism only involves a small amount of overhead, it results
    in enhancing the secrecy of the PU''s transmission since the artificial noise
    creates interference at the eavesdropper but it can be fully removed at the PR
    . Hence, the received signal at PR can be written as X PR = P i C â â â â h S
    i P S ^ + n PR (2) View Source where S ^ denotes the re-encoded signal transmitted
    by S T i after DF, and n PR â¼CN(0, Ï 2 ) is noise at PR . The received message
    at the eavesdropper during Phase II is: X ED = P i C â â â â h S i E S ^ + P i
    J â â â â h S i E z+ n ED (3) View Source where zâ¼CN(0,1) is the artificial noise
    added by S T i . During Phase III, the selected secondary user transmits its own
    message to its corresponding destination with power P i S . If the transmitted
    signal by S T i is denoted S ^ i , the received signal at S R i , X S i R can
    be written as X S i R = P i S â â â â h S i S ^ i + n S i R View Source n S i
    Râ¼CN(0, Ï 2 ) is the noise at S R i . Fig. 2. System model of proposed spectrum
    leasing scheme between the PU and the selected trustable secondary user. Show
    All Based on this model, if the codewords at the PU are Gaussian inputs, the achievable
    secrecy rate of the primary user, R P SEC , defined as the communication rate
    at which no information is revealed to the eavesdropper can be written as R P
    SEC =[ R P â R E ] + (4) View Source where R P is the accumulated rate at the
    PU''s receiver and R E is the accumulated rate at the eavesdropper (information
    leakage), and [x ] + denotes max(x,0) . For simplicity of notation, we remove
    [. ] + sign from now on. The rate at the PU''s receiver is defined as R P =min(
    R P S i , R S i P ) noting the DF relaying scheme at the selected secondary user
    i [28], hence the secrecy rate at PR can be calculated as: R P SEC =min((1âÎ±)T
    log 2 (1+ P P | h P S i | 2 Ï 2 ), Î±Î²T log 2 (1+ P i C | h S i P | 2 Ï 2 )) âÎ±Î²T
    log 2 (1+ P i C | h S i E | 2 Ï 2 + P i J | h S i E | 2 )) (5) View Source It
    is worth mentioning that to achieve nonzero secrecy rate for the primary user,
    the conditions of | h P S i | 2 >| h S i E | 2 ,| h S i P | 2 >| h S i E | 2 should
    be satisfied for the CSIs, where there is no direct link between the primary users
    and eavesdropper [29]. SECTION III. Proposed Reputation-Based Stackelberg Game
    Model Here, we define a Stackelberg game model to describe the interactions between
    the primary and secondary users in the proposed spectrum leasing scenario. The
    objective of the PU is to enhance its secrecy rate through utilizing the reliable
    secondary nodes while the secondary IoT users aim to obtaining the chance of spectrum
    leasing from the PU and maximize their transmission rate considering the power
    cost of cooperation with the PU. Such cost refers to the consumed power for forwarding
    the PU''s message and adding a jamming signal to it. Despite the previously reported
    works, where the SUs were forced to utilize an equal amount of power for their
    own transmission and service for the PU [14]â[16] we account for the selfish nature
    of the SU''s behavior to allocate a small portion of their power ( P i J + P i
    C ) to the PU''s requested services, in order to maximize their own transmission
    rate by having a larger remained power to themselves, ( P i S ) . It is worth
    mentioning that both services requested by the PU (jamming and relaying) occur
    during the second phase (Î±Î²T) , hence the selected SU does not benefit from changing
    the ratio of the power spent on relaying or jamming since its overall cost of
    service to the PU remains as ( P i J + P i C )Î±Î²T . Therefore, it is reasonable
    to assume that the ratio of power for jamming and relaying denoted by Ï= P i j
    P i C is requested by the PU and the selected SU has no incentive to change this
    ratio. In the proposed Stackelberg game, the PU as the spectrum owner is defined
    as the game leader to declare its strategies first, and the SUs are the game followers.
    The strategy set of the PU is to: i) select the most reliable secondary user;
    and ii) determine the optimal time allocation among the three phases, i.e parameters
    Î± and Î² . A reputation value is assigned to each SU that keeps track of their
    performance in terms of power allocation between their own transmission and requested
    services by the PU. The reputation value of each SU is monitored and maintained
    by the PU, and increases when the SU allocates enough power for cooperation and
    jamming. Let us define R k (n)=( r 1 (n),  r 2 (n), â¦,  r N (n)) as the reputation
    vector stored at the k th PU at time n , where r k i (n)â(0,1] denotes the reputation
    of SU i observed by k th PU at time n for iâ{1,2, â¦, N} . Here, we define first-hard
    reputation and second-hand reputation based on the existence of prior interactions
    between a primary and secondary pair. If PU k has a history of direct interaction
    with candidate SU i , the first-hand reputation at time n, r k i (n) is defined
    as r k i (n)=min( r k i (nâ1)+ Î· 3 ln( Ïµ n i ),1) (6) View Source where Î· 3 is
    the pre-defined factor and Ïµ n i is a function of power for individual transmission
    of user i , the power for requested services by the PU , and the channel conditions
    at time n , i.e. ( Ïµ n i = P i J | h S i E | 2 + P i C | h S i P | 2 P i S | h
    2 | 2 ) . The reason behind considering the CSIs in this definition is to assign
    a change of reputation proportional to actual channel condition that a secondary
    user is experiencing. With this definition, the reputation of misbehaving secondary
    users declines rapidly due to the characteristic of In function while it would
    take a fairly long time to restore the reputation in case of misbehaving. This
    mechanism can potentially prevent the secondary users from oscillating between
    good behavior and misbehavior due to the long period of time required to restore
    their reputation. If a user recently moves to a proximity of a primary user or
    there does not exist a prior record of interactions between a primary and secondary
    pair, then the primary user can inquire the SU''s reputation from its neighbor.
    In these cases, the second-hand reputation is defined as r k i (n)= Î£ jâ P k i
    r j i (n) | P k i | (7) View Source where P k i is the set of primary users in
    proximity of k th PU. If a secondary user is new in the network and there is no
    prior information about its reputation, then the reputation of this unit will
    be set to the lower bound of reputation range. The utility function of secondary
    user i is defined as: U S i ( P i S , P i C , P i J )=Î±(1âÎ²)Tlo g 2 (1+SN R i
    ) â Î· 1 Î±(1âÎ²)T P i S â Î· 2 Î±Î²T( P i C + P i J ) +ln( P i J | h S i E | 2 + P
    i C | h S i P | 2 â P i S | h S i | 2 +1) (8) View Source where SN R i denotes
    the signal-to-noise ratio at i th SU receiver. The last term in (8) is proportional
    to the change of reputation. Therefore, decision making at secondary user i involves
    a trade-off to increase its own transmission power P i S to obtain a higher transmission
    rate; while it needs to dedicate enough power to cooperation, P ic and jamming,
    P ij to maintain a good reputation in order to be chosen for the next rounds.
    The condition related to limited energy at SU i can be written: Î±Î²T P i C +Î±Î²T
    P i J +Î±(1âÎ²)T P i S â¤Î±T P i max (9) View Source where P i max denotes the maximum
    power available at SU i . Since these secondary IoT users are self-interested,
    they exhaust their available energy that results in Î² P i C +Î² P i J +(1âÎ²) P
    i S = P i max . Noting this equality and the requested ratio of power for jamming
    and cooperation by the PU, Ï= P i J P i C , the utility of SU i can be written
    as a function of one of the three power strategies of this user, (e.g. P i S )
    as U S i ( P i S )=Î±(1âÎ²)Tlo g 2 (1+ P i S | h s i | 2 Ï 2 ) â Î· 1 Î±(1âÎ²)T P i
    S â Î· 2 Î±Î²T P i max â P i S (1âÎ²) Î²(1+Ï) â Î· 2 Î±Î²TÏ P i max â P i S (1âÎ²) Î²(1+Ï)
    +ln( P i J | h S i E | 2 + P i C | h S i P | 2 â P i S | h s i | 2 +1) (10) View
    Source where Î· 1 and Î· 2 are predefined normalizing coefficients for energy to
    form it similar to transmission rate. The hierarchical interactions between the
    Stakelberg game players are summarized in Fig 3. The PU''s optimum parameters
    ( Î± â , Î² â , k), and the corresponding power choice of the SU ( P i S ) , are
    cooperatively considered as the Stackelberg solution that can be obtained through
    a backward induction algorithm. In each iteration of the game, the selected SU
    observed the selected strategy of the PU (i.e. Î±,Î² ), and responded to this by
    selecting its optimum power allocation to maximize its utility. Fig. 3. Stackelberg
    game model. Show All Lemma 1 The utility of secondary user, (10) is concave in
    term of P i S . Proof To prove the concavity of secondary utility, the second
    derivative of (10) with respect to P i S is driven as: â 2 U s ( P i S ) â 2 P
    i S = âÎ±(1âÎ²)T ln(2) ( | h s i | 3 Ï 2 ) 2 (1+ P i S | h s i | 2 Ï 3 ) 2 + â A
    2 ( F i C | h S i P |+ P i J | h S i E |â P i S | h s i |+1 ) 2 <0 (11) View Source
    where A 2 is equal to (â( (1âÎ²) Î²(1+Ï) )| h S i P |â(Ï (1âÎ²) Î²(1+Ï) )| h S i E
    |â| h s i | ) 2 . As seen in (11), U S i is strictly concave in terms of P i S
    for given values of Î± , and Î² . Theorem 1 The Stackelberg solution of the proposed
    game is the unique Nash equilibrium. Proof During the backward induction process
    to obtain the Stackelberg solution, the strategy of the PU is selected by maximizing
    (5) as Î± â , Î² â =argmax R PSEC (Î±, Î²) . Then the selected SU observes this strategy
    and selects its optimum power allocation set. According to lemma 1, the utility
    of the selected SU is strictly concave in terms of P i S for any given value of
    the PU''s strategy set, therefore the response of the selected SU is unique. It
    is obvious that the proposed single-leader single-follower Stackelberg game converges
    to the obtained solution as the follower is rational and the PU can fully predict
    the optimal strategy of the selected SU. Moreover, since the strategy of each
    user is obtained through finding the best response to the strategy of the other
    one, the obtained Stackelberg solution is a Nash equilibrium. Fig. 4. Primary
    secrecy rate versus distance of eavesdropper and st Show All SECTION IV. Simulation
    Results In this section, we present the simulation results to evaluate the performance
    of the proposed reputation-based game model in enhancing the secrecy rate of the
    primary user through two scenarios. The channels between nodes i and j are obtained
    from h_{i,j}\sim CN(0,d_{i,j}^{-2}) where d_{i,j} is the distance between nodes
    i and j . The duration of one time slot, T , is assumed to be equal to 1. The
    values of \eta_{1} and \eta_{2} are set to 0.004 and 0.0005, respectively. To
    have a more strict penalization for selfish behavior of the SUs, we assume that
    \eta_{1} is higher than \eta_{2} . The variance of noise (\sigma^{2}) is equal
    to 1mw, \rho is 0.7, and the primary transmitter uses 3mw power for sending its
    packet to the secondary user, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Scenario 1:Single
    Secondary UserIn this scenario, there exists only one SU in the neighborhood of
    the PU. Fig. 4 illustrates the primary secrecy rate for different distances of
    eavesdropper with the relay. As shown in this figure, increasing the distance
    between the relay and eavesdropper results in increasing the PU''s secrecy rate.
    It also results in decreasing the jamming power of the secondary transmitter as
    the communication will be less vulnerable to the presence of the eavesdropper,
    as depicted in Fig 5. Scenario 2:Multiple Selfish and Reliable Secondary UsersIn
    this scenario, we consider 10 mobile SUs, in which 70% of them are selfish in
    the sense that they may assign all their energy to their own transmission if granted
    with the spectrum, and the rest of the SUs are fully reliable. It is assumed that
    the location of SUs changes in every time slot to evaluate the performance of
    the proposed method in a more practical scenario. The SUs are uniformly distributed
    in the neighborhood around the PU. The performance of our proposed reputation-based
    method is compared with random relay selection, and best CSI relay selection methods.
    In all three methods, Stackelberg solution is found as the solution of the mechanism.
    In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method related to existing techniques,
    we considered an extreme case where the selfish secondary nodes are closer to
    the PU compared to the reliable ones. Also, it is assumed that selfish SUs show
    selfish behavior in 20% of time slots, hence it is less likely for the PU to identify
    all selfish nodes using alternative techniques. Fig. 6 demonstrates the probability
    of selecting unreliable nodes for different selection methods. As seen in this
    figure, the best CSI-selection method, which is widely used in many relay selection
    applications, has the worst performance in this scenario because it chooses the
    nearest SUs. For random selection method, the probability of selecting the unreliable
    SUs is close to 70% and does not change over time, as expected. However, our proposed
    reputation-based model is capable of filtering the selfish users over the course
    of time. Fig. 5. Jamming power of secondary versus distance of eavesdropper Show
    All Fig. 7 shows the allocated time to cooperative services, \alpha\beta , determined
    by the PU versus the distance between the eavesdropper and selected SU. The PU
    is encouraged to assign more time to cooperative services when the cooperative
    link is less vulnerable to eavesdropping in order to enhance its quality of communication
    through relaying services provided by the SU. Fig. 6. Probability of selecting
    unreliable nodes over time Show All Fig. 7. Cooperation phase (\alpha\beta) versus
    the distance between eavesdropper and the selected SU for different values of
    \rho Show All SECTION V. Conclusion In this paper, we proposed a practical solution
    for spectrum leasing to unlicensed IoT devices, in which the spectrum incumbents
    are motivated to lease their spectrum through receiving cooperative service from
    the IoT devices as well as enhancing their secrecy rate via a cooperative jamming
    mechanism. The key contribution of this model is to develop a reputation-based
    mechanism that enables the spectrum owners to monitor the behavior of potentially
    selfish IoT devices in terms of their willingness and efforts to participate in
    cooperative services. In the majority of existing spectrum sharing solutions,
    the secondary users are assumed to be fully reliable, hence the spectrum owners
    can often suffer from the selfish attacks performed with self-interested unlicensed
    users. However, our proposed spectrum leasing method gives the spectrum owners
    the possibility of only interacting with the reliable IoT devices and prevents
    the chance of degradation in quality of service due to selfish attacks, as confirmed
    by the simulation results. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF SUPPORT AND DISCLAIMER The authors

  explanation: To train an efficient CR scheme, a dataset containing the transmission
    patterns of a primary user and its class is needed. The dataset can be used by
    a machine learning algorithm to learn the relationship between the input features
    and the class labels. Once the algorithm is trained, it can be used to predict
    the class label of a new input signal based on its features. This information
    can be used to make decisions about spectrum allocation and interference mitigation.
  extract_1: In building machine learning models for spectrum sensing, several features
    are used, including energy statistic, probability vector, and occupancy over time.
  extract_2: Obviously, the accuracy of detecting the primary users may be affected
    by the selected features.

    \ spectrum represents a scarce and finite \nresource that is used for transmitting\
    \ information in the radio \nenvironment. This resource is used by several services,\
    \ \nincluding radiocommunication, radio broadcasting, maritime \nradio, and satellite\
    \ communications. \nAt the national level, the assignment of this spectrum to\
    \ \nthese services is managed and regulated by local authorities \n(governmental\
    \ agencies) that are responsible for determining \nthe appropriate frequency band,\
    \ the geographical extent of the \nuse of this band, the maximum transmission\
    \ power, etc. One of \nthe fundamental purposes of these agencies is to ensure\
    \ a \nminimum interference level between the different radio \ntechnologies. \n\
    At the global level, the International Telecommunication \nUnion (ITU) organizes,\
    \ every three to four years, the world \nradiocommunication conferences (WRC)\
    \ 1so as to examine and \nrevise the treaties governing the use of the radio frequency\
    \ \nspectrum. \nNevertheless, the static spectrum allocation strategy \nadopted,\
    \ where spectral frequency bands allocated to a wireless \ncommunication system\
    \ can only be used by that system, has \ncaused the shortage of frequencies. This\
    \ shortage is confronted \nwith a strong demand for spectrum resulting from the\
    \ \nemergence and abundance of wireless technologies and the \nextremely rapid\
    \ proliferation of radio applications developed in \nthe scope of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT). \nIn addition, while unlicensed bands like ISM (Industrial,\
    \ \nScientific, and Medical) bands can be freely used by all radios \nrespecting\
    \ a specific set of rules, such as a shared channel \naccess mechanism and a maximum\
    \ power per Hertz , they have \nbecome very crowded and canât accommodate more\
    \ wireless \napplications [1]. \nOn the other hand, the already assigned spectrum\
    \ is \ninefficiently used in all domains, such as the time domain, the \nspace\
    \ domain, and the frequency domain, as shown in Fig. 1. \nThis was confirmed by\
    \ the Federal Communications \nCommission (FCC), which reported in 2002 that the\
    \ radio \nspectrum, in most of the time, was from 15% up to 85% \nunderutilized\
    \ [2]. \nAs a result, it has been found that while some bands are \novercrowded,\
    \ such as those bands used by cellular base \nstations, many other bands are not\
    \ in use or are used only for \nshort periods [2]. \nCognitive Radio (CR) technology\
    \ has been commonly \nregarded as an efficient solution to address the above-\n\
    mentioned issues by enabling the opportunistic usage of the \nfrequency bands\
    \ that are not heavily occupied by licensed users \n[3,4]. \n1 https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/wrc-19\

    \ not to cause them \nharmful interference. Unlicensed users, which use Cognitive\
    \ \nRadio to access the spectrum, are referred to as secondary users \n(SUs).\
    \ \nFurthermore, the transition from analog to digital television \nhas released\
    \ many frequencies, known as TV white spaces, \nwhich have too high propagation\
    \ and penetration qualities [6]. \nFor this reason, the FCC authorized in 2008\
    \ the use of these \nfrequencies by non-licensed users following a list of rules\
    \ like \nusing the geo-location capability to obtain the available TV \nbands,\
    \ from White Space DataBase (WSDB), before operating \n[7â9]. That has created\
    \ a lot of opportunities for Cognitive \nradio users. \nThe remarkable contribution\
    \ of this promising technology \nto the efficient use of spectrum, the minimization\
    \ of \ninterference, the reduction of cost, etc., has pushed its use in \nseveral\
    \ areas, namely the Internet of Things (IoT). \nThe main objective of this paper\
    \ is to provide a \ncomprehensive survey of Cognitive radio with a particular\
    \ \nfocus given to: \nâ¢ Software Defined Radio, as it is the building block of\
    \ \nCognitive Radio system; \nâ¢ Spectrum sensing, as one of the most important\
    \ pillars \nto set up a Cognitive Radio system; \nâ¢ CR-Based IoT, given that Cognitive\
    \ Radio is one of the \nimportant enabler technologies of IoT. \nTo the best of\
    \ our knowledge, in the literature, there is no \nsuch work that gives a comprehensive\
    \ survey of the three \naforementioned aspects, highlights the relation between\
    \ them, \nand exhibits the future research directions to handle their \nchallenges\
    \ in a single paper. The existing surveys dealt only \nwith a particular aspect.\
    \ \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: \nSection II gives the\
    \ fundamentals of Cognitive Radio \ntechnology. Section III exhibits an overview\
    \ of Software \nDefined Radio and its different challenges. Section IV provides\
    \ \na detailed view of spectrum sensing and its challenges. Section \nV highlights\
    \ the use of Cognitive Radio in IoT. Finally, this \narticle is concluded in Section\
    \ VI. \nII. COGNITIVE RADIO FUNDAMENTALS \nCognitive Radio technology was first\
    \ introduced by Joseph \nMitola in 1999 to depict an intelligent radio system\
    \ capable of \nreconfiguring dynamically its radio parameters according to its\
    \ \noperational environment and to the userâs QoS requirements \n[4]. Afterward,\
    \ Cognitive Radio has been defined in many \nways by different entities and researchers.\
    \ The Federal \nCommunications Commission defined CR as follows: \nâCognitive\
    \ radio: A radio or system that senses its operational \nelectromagnetic environment\
    \ and can dynamically and \nautonomously adjust its radio operating parameters\
    \ to modify \nsystem operation, such as maximize throughput, mitigate \ninterference,\
    \ facilitate interoperability, access secondary \nmarkets.â [10]. \nMoreover,\
    \ Simon Haykin defined CR as âan intelligent \nwireless communication system,\
    \ capable of being aware of its \nenvironment, learning, and adaptively changing\
    \ its operating \nparameters (e.g., transmit-power, carrier-frequency, and \n\
    modulation strategy) in real-time for providing reliable \ncommunication (anytime\
    \ and anywhere) and efficient \nutilization of the radio spectrumâ [11]. \nAs\
    \ mentioned in the above definitions, the main \ncharacteristics of Cognitive\
    \ Radio are cognitive capability and \nreconfigurability [3,11]. \nThanks to the\
    \ cognitive capability feature, the CR user can \nsense and collect information\
    \ related to its radio environment \nand choose the best channel to use. The collected\
    \ information \nmainly involves transmission frequency, power, bandwidth, \nmodulation,\
    \ etc. \nThe reconfigurability feature allows CR users to adjust \nautomatically\
    \ its operating parameters (transmission frequency, \nmodulation, power, etc.)\
    \ based on the gathered information and \nwithout the need to change the hardware.\
    \ Hence an efficient \nand effective Cognitive Radio system is imperatively built\
    \ on \nSoftware Defined Radio platform. The latter will be briefly \nreviewed\
    \ in the next section. \nA. Dynamic Spectrum Access \nBy means of Dynamic Spectrum\
    \ Access (DSA) techniques, \nCognitive Radio enables secondary users to use the\
    \ unoccupied \nportions of licensed spectrum which are known as spectrum \nholes\
    \ or white spaces. When a primary user appears, the \nsecondary user vacates the\
    \ current band and moves to another \nspectrum hole or keeps transmitting on the\
    \ same band and \nadjusting its transmission power level or modulation scheme\
    \ in \norder not to cause any harmful interference to the licensed user \nor affect\
    \ its QoS as illustrated in Fig. 2 [3]. \n101 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 2. Spectrum Hole Concept [3]. \nThere are three\
    \ DSA approaches that the SUs can use to \ndynamically access the available spectral\
    \ opportunities: \nunderlay, interweave, and overlay [12]. \n1) Spectrum underlay:\
    \ In the underlay transmission mode, \nthe SU can coexist with the PU as long\
    \ as the SU operates \nbelow the noise floor of the PU. In other words, the \n\
    coexistence between the SU and the PU may occur if only the \ninterference caused\
    \ by the SU at the PU receiver remains \nunder a predefined threshold, known as\
    \ the âinterference \ntemperatureâ [13,14]. To meet the interference threshold\
    \ \nrequirement, SU can use some techniques such as spreading \nits signal over\
    \ a wide bandwidth below the noise floor of the \nPU or using multiple antennas\
    \ to direct its signals away from \nthe PU receiver [15]. \nMoreover, in the case\
    \ of the underlay approach, the \nspectrum sensing process is not required and\
    \ the SUs can \ntransmit the data over the spectrum even if it is occupied all\
    \ the \ntime by the PUs. Therefore, this paradigm is more appropriate \nto use\
    \ in situations when the spectrum usage status of PUs \nchanges rapidly [12].\
    \ \nNevertheless, meeting the interference constraint forces the \nSU to limit\
    \ its transmission power and consequently to operate \nover a small coverage.\
    \ \n2) Spectrum interweave: As regards the interweave \ntransmission mode, it\
    \ stands for the opportunistic usage of the \navailable spectrum holes which was\
    \ the major motivation \nbehind the introduction of the Cognitive Radio technology\
    \ \n[16]. This paradigm mandates that SUs should have only \naccess to the unoccupied\
    \ spectrum resources. Thus, spectrum \nsensing is needed to identify the vacant\
    \ spectrum bands that \nare not currently occupied by the PUs. \nFurthermore,\
    \ in this case, harmful interferences to PUs are \navoided due to the fact that\
    \ SUs do not transmit concurrently \nwith the PUs. Whereas, the constant tracking\
    \ of spectrum \nopportunities is a challenging task, especially in rapidly \n\
    changing environments in terms of spectrum occupancy. \nHence, this approach is\
    \ more adequate for slowly changing \nenvironments [12,17]. \nConcerning power\
    \ resources, they are only limited by the \nrange of the identified spectrum holes.\
    \ \nIt is also worth noting that this class of dynamic spectrum \naccess is also\
    \ referred to as opportunistic spectrum access [18]. \n3) Spectrum \noverlay:\
    \ \nIn \nrespect \nto \nthe \noverlay \ntransmission mode, it is like the underlay\
    \ approach in that \nboth approaches allow SUs to simultaneously transmit with\
    \ \nPUs. However, in the overlay mode, SUs can transmit at any \npower without\
    \ a predefined interference threshold constraint. \nMoreover, in this paradigm,\
    \ the performance of the PU \nshouldn't be negatively affected by the presence\
    \ of the SU. To \nmeet this requirement, SUs use a variety of techniques that\
    \ \nrequire prior knowledge about PUs' codebooks and messages \n[19]. For instance,\
    \ SUs can divide their power into two parts: \none is assigned to transmit their\
    \ packets and the other is \nallocated to support the PUsâ transmissions. In that\
    \ way, the \ninterference caused by the SU at the PU receiver can be \ncompensated\
    \ by the enhancement of the PUâs signal-to-noise \npower ratio (SNR), by dint\
    \ of the part of SUâs power that is \nused to relay the PU packets. \nAdditionally,\
    \ SUs can exploit knowledge about PUs' \ncodebooks and messages to cancel the\
    \ interference caused by \nPUs, using techniques such as dirty paper coding [19].\
    \ \nFinally, hybrid schemes that combine these transmission \nmodes can be conceived\
    \ to increase the overall throughput of \nthe wireless networks [20]. \nB. Cognitive\
    \ Radio Functions \nThe various tasks performed by a Cognitive Radio, \nincluding\
    \ detecting spectrum holes, selecting the best available \nchannel, determining\
    \ the transmission parameters, sharing \nspectrum with other users, and moving\
    \ to another frequency \nband when a licensed user appears are referred to as\
    \ the \ncognitive cycle (See Fig. 3) [21]. \nIn general, the cognitive cycle can\
    \ be divided into three \nfunctional steps, namely spectrum sensing and analysis,\
    \ \nspectrum management and handoff, and spectrum allocation \nand sharing [21]:\
    \ \nâ¢ Spectrum sensing and analysis: in this phase, CR \nmonitors the radio environment,\
    \ detects the spectrum \nholes, and estimates its different characteristics. \n\
    â¢ Spectrum management and handoff: at this stage, CR \nchooses the best spectrum\
    \ white space, determines the \ntransmission parameters, and hops among different\
    \ \nbands based on the channel characteristics and user \nrequirements [3,21].\
    \ \nâ¢ Spectrum allocation and sharing: through these \nfunctions, CR can share\
    \ and coordinate the spectrum \naccess with other users. The coexistence with\
    \ licensed \nusers is restricted by their allowable interference level. \nThus,\
    \ secondary users should adjust their transmission \nparameters accordingly. As\
    \ for sharing spectrum access \nwith CR users, efficient spectrum access coordination\
    \ is \nrequired so as to avoid collisions and interferences [21]. \n102 | P a\
    \ g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 3. Cognitive Cycle\
    \ [21]. \nWith respect to the layer they are in, the aforesaid functions \ncan\
    \ be classified into three groups namely physical layer \n(PHY) functions, the\
    \ medium access control layer (MAC) \nfunctions, and network layer functions as\
    \ shown in Fig. 4 [22]: \n \nFig. 4. Key Functions of the PHY, MAC, and Network\
    \ Layers in a CR [22]. \n1) Physical layer functions: CR PHY layer is responsible\
    \ \nfor many tasks, including, but not limited to, identifying \nspectrum holes\
    \ through spectrum sensing and acquiring \nadvanced radio environment knowledge,\
    \ such as the channel \ngain from the CR transmitter to the primary receiver and\
    \ \nchannel-state information (CSI), via environmental learning \n[22]. Based\
    \ on the gathered information, cognitive spectrum \naccess is performed by using\
    \ transceiver optimization and \nreconfiguration. \n2) Medium access control layer\
    \ functions: CR MAC layer \nincorporates two key functions that allow to control\
    \ and \nmanage spectrum sensing operations as well as access to the \nidentified\
    \ spectrum opportunities. The first function is known \nas sensing scheduling,\
    \ whereas the second is referred to as \nspectrum-aware access control. The operations\
    \ of these \nfunctions are controlled by the sensing-access coordinator, on \n\
    a time basis, by taking into consideration the compromise \nbetween the sensing\
    \ requirement and the availability of the \nspectrum access opportunity. \nIn\
    \ \ncomparison \nwith \nthe \nconventional \nwireless \ncommunications MAC layer,\
    \ the CR MAC layer is more \ncomplicated to implement because of the dynamic nature\
    \ of the \nradio environment and the constant adaptation process that the \nCR\
    \ should perform. More detailed information about the CR \nMAC layer can be found\
    \ in [23,24]. \n3) Network layer functions: CR network layer provides \nthree\
    \ main functions: network tomography, quality of service \n(QoS) and error control,\
    \ and spectrum-aware routing [22]. \nNetwork tomography refers to the operation\
    \ by which the \nCR nodes sense the traffic patterns of the primary and the \n\
    coexisting networks. The output of this operation provides \nimportant baseline\
    \ data that allows a better understanding of \nthe routing design and the network\
    \ utilization at the packet \nlevel. \nQuality of service (QoS) control and error\
    \ control are of \nparamount importance to build a successful CR network. \nStatistical\
    \ control can be used to address these tasks over \nCRNs that are characterized\
    \ by opportunistic links. \nFurthermore, In CR networks, data routing is a challenging\
    \ \nproblem due to varying link quality, frequent topology \nchanges, and sporadic\
    \ connectivity caused by the movement of \nPUs in the network [25]. In such a\
    \ changing environment, the \nspectrum-aware routing function should be enabled\
    \ in order to \nfind optimal routes and paths while avoiding PUs. This \nfunction\
    \ has two problems to handle [21]: the first problem \nrelates to the fact that\
    \ routing algorithms and protocols should \nbe aware of the various network characteristics\
    \ such as \nspectrum availability, PU activity, channel switching delay, \nand\
    \ link qualities and take them into consideration while \nexecuting their different\
    \ operations. The second problem deals \nwith the setting up of interaction between\
    \ routing algorithms \nand dynamic spectrum allocation routines so as to select\
    \ \nrouting paths with minimum interferences. \nMoreover, the optimization of\
    \ the energy consumption, the \ndesired QoS, and the spectrum management should\
    \ be \nconsidered while designing routing algorithms and protocols \nfor CR networks.\
    \ Routing protocols are further detailed in [26]. \nFinally, the spectrum manager\
    \ serves as the means of \nestablishing a connection between the three aforementioned\
    \ \nlayers and ensuring dynamic and efficient access to the \navailable spectrum.\
    \ \nC. Cognitive Radio Networks \nA Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) consists of\
    \ a number of \nCR nodes with or without a secondary base station. \nBased on\
    \ the presence of infrastructure support, CRNs can \nbe classified as either an\
    \ Infrastructure-based network \n(centralized) or an Ad-Hoc network (distributed).\
    \ Moreover, \nCRNs can be also deployed in another architecture known as \nMesh\
    \ architecture that combines Infrastructure-based and Ad-\nHoc modes. A brief\
    \ description of these architectures is given \nbelow. \n1) Infrastructure-based\
    \ CR network: It is a centralized \narchitecture which contains a CR base station\
    \ that is \nresponsible for controlling and coordinating the transmission \nactivities\
    \ of the CR nodes. In this architecture, the CR base \nstation retrieves the spectrum\
    \ related information from all the \nSUs in the network and on the basis of the\
    \ gathered \ninformation, it makes decisions on spectrum access and \nsharing\
    \ for all CR nodes. \n103 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021\
    \ \nCompared to Ad-hoc network, infrastructure-based network \nprovides many advantages\
    \ including, the reliability of the \nsensing process, collision avoidance, and\
    \ a high data right for \nSUs. However, an infrastructure is required to build\
    \ such a \nnetwork. \nSome examples of centralized networks include: \nâ¢ The IEEE\
    \ 802.22 network: it is the first wireless \nregional \narea \nnetwork \nstandard\
    \ \nthat \ndefines \nspecifications for broadband wireless access using CR \n\
    technology in TVWS bands [27]; \nâ¢ Spectrum Efficient Uni and Multi-cast Services\
    \ Over \nDynamic Radio Network in Vehicular Environments \n(Over DRiVE) [28];\
    \ \nâ¢ European Dynamic Radio for IP services in Vehicular \nEnvironment (DRiVE)\
    \ [29]; \nâ¢ Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) [30]. \n2) Ad-hoc mode CR network: In Ad-hoc CRNs,\
    \ there is no \nneed for base stations or access points to coordinate the SUs.\
    \ \nThus, in the absence of a central controlling entity, SUs in \nsuch a distributed\
    \ network, make independent decisions \nconcerning spectrum access and transmission\
    \ parameters. \nAdditionally, SUs must use distributed DSA protocols so as to\
    \ \nmanage the spectrum access operation. Designing distributed \nDSA protocols\
    \ for Ad-hoc CRNs is a challenging task because \nof the absence of central control\
    \ entities and the completely \ndistributed networking architecture [12]. These\
    \ protocols \nshould support a set of functions including, transparency for \n\
    PUs, collision avoidance, accurate spectrum sensing, and \nefficient dynamic spectrum\
    \ allocation [12]. \nIII. SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO: OVERVIEW \nGiven that SDR is\
    \ considered as an enabling technology \nthat handles the implementation of Cognitive\
    \ Radio, this \nsection will be dedicated to a brief overview of SDR. \nA. Definition\
    \ of SDR \nSoftware Defined Radio [31,32] is referred to as a \nprogrammable radio\
    \ transceiver where digital signal processing \nfunctions, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ coding/decoding, \nerror \ncontrol, \ninterleaving/deinterleaving, \nand \n\
    scrambling/descrambling are implemented by means of \nsoftware instead of hardware\
    \ as it has been used in traditional \nradio \ncommunication \nsystems. \nThat\
    \ \nenables \nthe \nimplementation of different waveform standards in a single\
    \ \nplatform and switching between them without any change in \nthe hardware components.\
    \ In some cases, there is just the need \nof a simple software upgrade to support\
    \ other modes, bands, \nand functions. \nMany hardware platforms are used to implement\
    \ the \nsoftware part of SDR, mainly, General Purpose Processor \n(GPP), Digital\
    \ Signal Processor (DSP), Field Programmable \nGate Arrays (FPGA), and Application\
    \ Specific Integrated \nCircuit (ASIC) [33]. \nEach of the above-mentioned platforms\
    \ has its own \nchallenges, limitations, and strengths in terms of computational\
    \ \npower, power consumption, implementation cost, flexibility \nand reconfigurability,\
    \ and complexity of design (See Table I). \nB. SDR Architecture \nJoseph Mitola\
    \ proposed the architecture of an ideal \nsoftware radio transceiver that includes\
    \ three components, \nnamely an antenna, a Digital-to-Analog/Analog-to-Digital\
    \ \nconverter, and a processing unit as illustrated in Fig. 5. The \nprocessing\
    \ unit allows performing, in software, all the digital \nsignal \nprocessing \n\
    functions, \nincluding \nmodulation/demodulation, coding/decoding, and error control\
    \ \n[3]. \n \nFig. 5. Ideal Software Radio [16]. \nMany factors impede the real\
    \ implementation of this \nproposed architecture such as the technology limitations,\
    \ more \nparticularly those related to ADCâs performance, computing \npower, and\
    \ power consumption of the processing unit. \nUnlike the ideal software radio\
    \ transceiver, the SDR \ntransceiver is feasible. Indeed, the general architecture\
    \ of SDRs \ncontains more components that make its real implementation \npossible.\
    \ \nAs shown in Fig. 6, the SDR transceiver includes mainly \nfour parts which\
    \ are an antenna, an analog RF front end, a \ndigital RF front end, and the signal\
    \ processing unit. \n1) Antenna: One of the main tasks expected from an SDR \n\
    platform is its ability to cover multiple frequency bands. Thus, \nSDR platforms\
    \ often use Intelligent/Smart antennas so as to \nfulfill the aforementioned task.\
    \ \nA smart antenna consists of an antenna array combined \nwith signal processing\
    \ blocks that allow to smartly exploit the \nspatial diversity in order to select\
    \ the appropriate frequency \nband and adapt with interference nulling, and mobile\
    \ tracking \n[34,35]. \nAn antenna for SDR should ideally integrate some features\
    \ \nsuch as self-adaptation, self-alignment and self-healing [35]. \nThese characteristics\
    \ can be defined as follows: \nâ¢ Self-adaptation: it is the capability of an antenna\
    \ to \nadapt its parameters according to the selected band and \nthe system requirements\
    \ (gainâ¦); \nâ¢ Self-alignment: it is the capability of an antenna to \ncontrol\
    \ its radiation pattern; \nâ¢ Self-healing: it is the capability of an antenna\
    \ to avoid \ninterferences. \n104 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \n2) Analog RF front end: The RF front end part [34] \nrepresents\
    \ an analog circuitry where the following operations \nare performed: \nIn the\
    \ transmission path, Digital-to-Analogue Converter \n(DAC) converts digital samples\
    \ into an analog signal which \nrepresents the input of the RF Front End. After\
    \ that, the analog \nsignal is mixed with high frequency carriers, modulated to\
    \ a \npreset RF frequency, and then transmitted. \nIn the receiving path, the\
    \ RF signal captured by the antenna \nis fed to the RF Front end section through\
    \ a matching circuitry \nwhich allows achieving an optimum signal power transfer.\
    \ \nThen, in order to amplify very low-power signals while \nguaranteeing a minimum\
    \ noise level, the RF signal passes \nthrough a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) which\
    \ is often mounted \nvery close to the antenna. Afterward, the output of the LNA\
    \ is \nmixed with a signal from the Local Oscillator (LO) so as to \nshift to\
    \ a lower fixed frequency known as intermediate \nfrequency (IF). \nThe frequency\
    \ generated by the Local Oscillator is \nadjustable to ensure that the mixer produces\
    \ a lower fixed \nintermediate frequency independent of the incoming RF signal.\
    \ \nThe intermediate frequency presents several advantages: it \nimproves the\
    \ selectivity due to the fact of being fixed and it \nincreases the performance\
    \ of the processing unit and the global \ngain of the receiver owing to be lower\
    \ than the incoming \nfrequency. \n3) Digital front end: The Digital Front end\
    \ section [34] \ncontains a set of blocks that are responsible for performing\
    \ all \nof the succeeding functions: \nIn the transmission path, the digital baseband\
    \ signal (near-\nzero frequency range) is shifted into the IF frequency by the\
    \ \nDigital Up Converter (DUC) then it passes through the Digital \nAnalog Converter\
    \ (DAC) that converts it to the analog IF \nsignal. The analog IF signal is later\
    \ up-converted to RF signal. \nIn the receiving path, the analog IF signal is\
    \ converted to \ndigital IF samples by the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).\
    \ \nNext, the Digital Down Converter (DDC) changes the IF \nsamples to a baseband\
    \ signal which is then resampled and \nfiltered before being processed by the\
    \ signal processing unit. \nThese above-mentioned tasks can be divided into two\
    \ \nprincipal functions which are Resampling and Channelization. \nResampling\
    \ or Sample Rate Conversion (SRC) is the process \nof converting samples from\
    \ one sample rate to another. As for \nChannelization, it involves up/down conversion\
    \ and channel \nfiltering. \n4) Signal processing unit: This block is regarded\
    \ as the \nmain part of SDR architecture which is designed to perform \nDigital\
    \ \nSignal \nProcessing \nfunctions \nsuch \nas \nmodulation/demodulation and\
    \ encoding/decoding. \nAs already mentioned in this paper many hardware \nplatforms\
    \ are used to implement this section, namely DSP, \nGPP, GPU, ASIC, and FPGA [36â39].\
    \ The real challenge is \ndetermining which of these platforms is best to achieve\
    \ SDR \ngoals and which design approach is appropriate to meet the \nrequested\
    \ quality of service. \nTable I shows the strengths and weaknesses of some \n\
    hardware platforms and highlights certain techniques used to \nimprove their performance.\

    \ \nadaptability, cost, and complexity. \nTo exploit the advantages of each platform,\
    \ researchers \nhave proposed the co-design (hybrid) approach as a solution. \n\
    This approach consists of regrouping design schemes that \nemploy hardware techniques,\
    \ such as FPGAs and ASICs, and \nthose that use software solutions including GPPs,\
    \ into one \nplatform. \nThis approach presents some issues, the most known are\
    \ \nthe problem related to the shared access of the internal memory \nby different\
    \ units (FPGAs, Processors ...) and the very \nexpensive cost of the whole implementation.\
    \ \nOne of the interesting readings that give a detailed review \nof the aforementioned\
    \ platforms, can be found in [35]. \nC. SDR Advantages \nSoftware Defined Radio\
    \ technology has brought a lot of \nadvantages to the world of wireless communications,\
    \ such as \nreconfigurability and flexibility, interoperability, and cost \nreduction\
    \ [34,37]: \nâ¢ Reconfigurability and Flexibility: The main feature of \nSDR is\
    \ its capacity to handle wireless standards newly \ndeveloped by simply changing\
    \ or upgrading the \nreconfigurable software instead of replacing the \nhardware\
    \ platform or its analog components. \nâ¢ Interoperability: One of the most important\
    \ benefits of \nSDR is its ability to resolve interoperability problems \nbetween\
    \ incompatible radios that work with different \nwireless standards. \nâ¢ Cost\
    \ \nreduction: \nSeveral \nexpensive \nhardware \ncomponents disappeared due to\
    \ the fact that in SDR \nmany \ndigital \nsignal \nprocessing \nfunctions \nare\
    \ \nimplemented by means of software. \nIn addition to the forenamed benefits,\
    \ SDR allows to test \nand study several communication standards by using the\
    \ same \nplatform. Furthermore, SDR is regarded as the block building \nof a Cognitive\
    \ Radio system and as already mentioned in this \npaper, SDR enables the reconfigurability\
    \ of Cognitive Radio. \nD. SDR Tools \nThere are different commercial and open-source\
    \ tools that \ncan be used for SDR development. Choosing the more \nappropriate\
    \ \ndevelopment \ntool \nfor \na \nspecific \ndesign \nmethodology requires prior\
    \ knowledge of the available toolsâ \nfeatures. Examples of these tools include\
    \ GNU Radio, \nUniversal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), MATLAB, \nLabVIEW,\
    \ and CUDA. \nGNU Radio and USRP are the most widely used tools to \ndevelop SDR\
    \ systems [40]. A brief description of these two \ntools is given below: \nGNU\
    \ Radio: GNU Radio is a free & open-source software \ntoolkit for building software\
    \ radios [35]. It runs on host \n106 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \ncomputers and it provides many signal processing blocks such\
    \ \nas filters, decoders, and demodulators which are required to \nimplement software\
    \ radios. These blocks are programmed in \nC++ and they are often connected using\
    \ Python script that has \nthe advantage of allowing the data flow to be at the\
    \ maximum \nrate, without being interpreted [41]. In addition, this tool offers\
    \ \nthe possibility of easily programming and adding new blocks \nfor supporting\
    \ unavailable functions. GNU Radio can be used \njointly with Universal Software\
    \ Radio Peripheral systems or \nother alternatives to set up complete SDR platforms.\
    \ \nUSRP: Universal Software Radio Peripheral is the most \ncommonly used transceiver\
    \ for SDR platforms, developed by \nEttus2 Research under GPL license. USRPs are\
    \ available in \nseveral series and versions, differentiated by their hardware\
    \ \nperformances and their connection method to a host computer. \nGenerally,\
    \ USRP is a board that integrates the following \ncomponents: ADC/ DAC, an FPGA\
    \ board, an RF front end, \nand a PC host interface [42]. Based on the USRP series,\
    \ a \ncertain number of daughterboards can also be held. \nDaughterboards perform\
    \ functions such as filtering and \nconversion between RF and baseband signals\
    \ (up/down \nconversions) and may support applications operating up to 6 \nGHz\
    \ due to being modular. Concerning the other signal \nprocessing functions, the\
    \ majority of them are performed at the \nhost machine and only some operations\
    \ are processed by the \nFPGA board [42]. USRP platforms offer several advantages,\
    \ \nincluding ease-of-use, affordability, and flexibility. However, \nbandwidth\
    \ limitations of USRP components have an impact on \nsystem throughput. That makes\
    \ USRP platforms only suitable \nfor research experiments and rapid prototyping\
    \ [35,42]. \nE. SDR Challenges \nIn this subsection, the challenges that still\
    \ remain to be \naddressed for implementing efficient and practical SDR \nsystems\
    \ are presented. \n1) Security and attack issues: Although SDR has brought \n\
    many powerful advantages to the field of wireless \ncommunication, it has introduced\
    \ new types of security threats \nand attack issues. Indeed, in addition to the\
    \ known threats that \nexist in conventional wireless communication systems such\
    \ as \ndenial of service attacks, misconfiguration issues, listening \nand capturing\
    \ data that can be used to perform malicious \nactions, there are several threats\
    \ that are specific to SDR, \nincluding downloading and running malicious software.\
    \ \nIn the absence of authentication and verification \ntechniques, unauthorized\
    \ software can easily be installed and \nactivated on SDR terminals. The challenge\
    \ of implementing \nprotection techniques and security mechanisms, to prevent\
    \ this \nissue, has been addressed by many researchers. For instance, in \n[43]\
    \ a framework for establishing secure download for SDR is \npresented. This framework\
    \ uses a public/private key scheme to \nverify the authenticity of the software.\
    \ The digital signature is \nconsidered as a good solution to keep malicious and\
    \ \nunauthorized software from being activated on SDR nodes, \nnevertheless, it\
    \ greatly increases the complexity of the \n2 https://www.ettus.com/ \nframework\
    \ due to the fact that for each combination of \nwaveform and terminal, a digital\
    \ signature should be created. \nFurthermore, the data configuration of SDR components\
    \ \ncan be prone to extraction, alteration, or destruction. Those \nissues can\
    \ be prevented by guaranteeing the integrity of the \nsecurity administrative\
    \ module (SAM) and implementing data \nintegrity and protection techniques [44].\
    \ \n2) Energy efficiency: Addressing the power consumption \nissue is of primary\
    \ importance especially when designing \nsolutions that are intended for battery-powered\
    \ devices and \nlow power objects in an IoT network. Several reasons are \nbehind\
    \ the importance of addressing power consumption \nmanagement, including limited\
    \ size and battery, ensuring a \nlonger lifetime of IoT objects, and enabling\
    \ Green Computing \n[17,45]. In SDR, many factors contribute to the loss of energy\
    \ \nefficiency, namely signal processing complexity and the \nincreased hardware\
    \ requirements. To alleviate this loss, the \nauthors of [46] proposed a cooperative\
    \ wireless network \nscheme that is based on resource sharing (Battery, processing\
    \ \nunit, memoryâ¦). \n3) Antenna requirements for SDR: One of the major \nchallenges\
    \ in SDR is to design wideband antennas that support \ndifferent technologies\
    \ and standards. Although smart and \nreconfigurable antennas are used to resolve\
    \ this concern, \nseveral constraints still hamper the SDR implementation in \n\
    portable handsets and other systems, such as bandwidth and \ngain limitations,\
    \ which are imposed by the antenna size, and \nthe complexity of a design that\
    \ meets all the antenna \nrequirements for SDR [47]. \n4) Hybrid design: Implementing\
    \ an optimal SDR design, \nthat meets the real-time requirements at low power\
    \ and cost \nwhile maintaining flexibility and programmability, represents \n\
    a great challenge. Researchers address this issue by using the \nhybrid approach\
    \ which enables the use of hardware schemes \n(ASICsâ¦) along with software schemes\
    \ (GPP...) in the same \nplatform in order to take advantage of their different\
    \ benefits. \nThe hybrid design has also its own challenges in both \nphysical\
    \ and MAC layers, including partitioning and \nscheduling problems [35]. \n5)\
    \ ADC and DAC limitations: The concept of an ideal \nsoftware defined radio transceiver\
    \ consists in placing the \nADC/DAC as close as possible to the antenna. That\
    \ requires a \nvery high-speed ADC/DAC with sampling capability up to \nGiga Samples\
    \ per second which is actually not feasible. To \novercome this issue, an RF front\
    \ end block is placed right after \nthe antenna so as to shift the incoming frequency\
    \ to an \nintermediate frequency that can be supported by the currently \navailable\
    \ ADC/DAC. \nIV. SPECTRUM SENSING \nSensing is considered as the most important\
    \ and critical \nphase in the Cognitive Radio cycle. It refers to the operation\
    \ by \nwhich the CR users can be aware of the channel occupancy, the \npresence\
    \ of the primary user, the quality of the radio channel, \n107 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n                                                           \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021\
    \ \nand other parameters such as transmission power, bandwidth, \nmodulation,\
    \ etc. Based on this gathered information, the CR \nusers can determine the vacant\
    \ portion of the spectrum and \nchoose the white spaces which meet its QoS. \n\
    This section gives a detailed view of sensing spectrum \nfunction in Cognitive\
    \ Radio Networks. \nA. Multi-dimensional Spectrum Sensing \nThrough the sensing\
    \ function, Cognitive radio can identify \nthe existing spectrum opportunities\
    \ in its surrounding \nenvironment by using different sensing techniques. Spectrum\
    \ \nopportunity is conventionally defined as âa band of frequencies \nthat are\
    \ not being used by the primary user of that band at a \nparticular time in a\
    \ particular geographic areaâ [48,49]. This \ndefinition takes into consideration\
    \ only three dimensions, \nnamely frequency, time, and space. However, there are\
    \ other \ndimensions that can be exploited to create new opportunities \nsuch\
    \ as code dimension and angle dimension. Developing \nsensing algorithms that\
    \ take into account all those dimensions \nencounters more complex and challenging\
    \ issues. \nA radio environment in which all the aforementioned \ndimensions are\
    \ exploited to share spectrum access among \nmultiple users is known by several\
    \ names including, \nhyperspace, electro space, and radio spectrum space. Table\
    \ II \nshows parameters that are needed to be sensed for each \ndimension and\
    \ highlights its main idea [49]. \nB. Types of Spectrum Sensing \nSpectrum sensing\
    \ approaches can be divided into several \ntypes on the basis of specific aspects,\
    \ including the cooperation \nbetween secondary users, the bands of interest,\
    \ the sensing \nexecution time, and the number of sensed channels at a time \n\
    (See Fig. 7) [50]: \nBased on the bands of interest for the Cognitive Radio \n\
    system, spectrum sensing falls into two groups: in-band \nsensing and out-of-band\
    \ sensing. In-band sensing consists in \nsensing the channel that is already transmitting,\
    \ in the aim of \ndetecting primary user signals and avoiding harmful \ninterferences\
    \ [51,52]. As to out-of-band sensing, CR senses \nbands other than the band on\
    \ which it is transmitting so as to \ndiscover new spectrum holes [51]. \nBased\
    \ on the sensing execution time, two classes of \nspectrum sensing can be distinguished:\
    \ reactive (on-demand) \nand proactive(periodic) sensing. The reactive sensing\
    \ takes \nplace when the secondary user intends to transmit or as a result \n\
    of radio environmental changes. In proactive sensing, CR users \nsense the radio\
    \ environment persistently so as to detect \nspectrum opportunities. Reactive\
    \ sensing is more energy \nefficient but the time to identify an unoccupied channel\
    \ may be \nlonger than proactive sensing. \nAmong the types of spectrum sensing,\
    \ we also find \nsynchronous \nsensing \nand \nasynchronous \nsensing. \nIn \n\
    synchronous sensing, all CRs respect the same schedule to \nsense a frequency\
    \ band. In that case, a high synchronization \nbetween CRs represents a challenging\
    \ task. \nTABLE II. \nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL SPECTRUM SENSING \nDimension \nParameters\
    \ to sense \nIdea and remarks \nFrequency \nAvailable frequency bands \nThe available\
    \ frequency band is segmented into disjoint sub-\nbands. Identifying opportunities\
    \ in the frequency domain consists \nin determining the unoccupied sub-bands.\
    \ It is unlikely that all the \nbands can be used concurrently at the same time.\
    \  \nTime \nAvailable time slots in a specific band \nFor a given frequency band,\
    \ there will be times when it is \nunoccupied and available for opportunistic\
    \ usage.  \nGeographic Space \nPUâs location (latitude, longitude, an elevation)\
    \ \nDistance of primary users \nAt a specific time, certain channels may be available\
    \ for \nopportunistic usage in some geographical zones while being \nentirely\
    \ occupied in other zones. The path loss in space enables \nsecondary users to\
    \ identify the presence or the absence of a \nprimary user in a given local area\
    \ by just looking at the \ninterference level. If there is no interference, then\
    \ the primary \nuser is absent otherwise it is present. However, the risk of creating\
    \ \nharmful interferences to a hidden primary user is possible. This \nissue is\
    \ discussed later in this article. \nAngle \nPUâs beam directions (azimuth and\
    \ elevation angle). \nPUâs location. \nBy leveraging advanced antenna technologies\
    \ (e.g., Beamforming \ntechnology), identifying PUâs location, and determining\
    \ PUâs \nbeam directions, new spectrum holes in the angle domain might \nbe available\
    \ for opportunistic usage. Indeed, the secondary user \ncan transmit in the same\
    \ frequency band along with the primary \nuser at the same time in the same location\
    \ by choosing a different \ndirection without causing interferences to the licensed\
    \ user. \nCode \nPUâs spreading code, time hopping (TH), or frequency hopping\
    \ \n(FH) sequences. \nAwareness of timing information is needed so that SU can\
    \ \nsynchronize its transmission with PU. \nBy being aware of code sequences that\
    \ primary users are using at \na given time, secondary users can transmit simultaneously\
    \ along \nwith primary users over the available spectrum by choosing \ndifferent\
    \ code sequences in such a way as to avoid creating \ninterferences on primary\
    \ users. It is important to note that \nsimultaneous transmission is possible\
    \ by using orthogonal codes. \n108 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\

    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \nIn the case of asynchronous sensing, each CR has its own \n\
    schedule to sense a frequency band. Distinguishing between \nSU signals and PU\
    \ signals is a challenging problem. \nIn respect to the cooperation aspect, there\
    \ are two classes of \nspectrum sensing: cooperative and non-cooperative (local)\
    \ \nSensing. In non-cooperative sensing, each CR settles for its \nown sensing\
    \ data and independently decides on the channel \nstate, i.e. the presence or\
    \ the absence of the primary user. \nDecisions that are made through this sensing\
    \ type are \nunreliable and error prone under bad channel conditions, \nmultipath\
    \ fading and shadowing effects, and hidden node \nissues [53]. \nThe aforementioned\
    \ issues can be avoided by using \ncooperative sensing [21,53]. Indeed, when cooperative\
    \ sensing \nis enabled, CR users share their local observations and sensing \n\
    data with others and exploit the shared sensing outcomes of \nother users to decide\
    \ on the presence or absence of the primary \nuser. Several works have been carried\
    \ out on this topic and it \nhas been shown that cooperative sensing contributes\
    \ to the \nimprovement of detection accuracy and reliability on the cost \nof\
    \ increased latency and traffic overhead. It has also been \nproven that cooperation\
    \ between secondary users can solve \nhidden primary user problem and decrease\
    \ sensing time [53]. \nThere are two types of cooperative sensing: centralized\
    \ \nsensing and distributed sensing [3,54]. In centralized sensing \n[55], a central\
    \ unit gathers local sensing information from CR \nusers through a control channel,\
    \ fuses them by means of one of \nthe fusion decision rules [56], identifies spectrum\
    \ holes by \nperforming binary hypothesis testing algorithm such as \nNeyman-Pearson\
    \ test or Bayesian test, and shares the result \namong other cognitive users or\
    \ directly controls the cognitive \nradio traffic. In distributed sensing [54],\
    \ cognitive nodes \nexchange their local observations among each other and make\
    \ \ntheir own decisions on channel state. Distributed sensing \ndoesnât require\
    \ a backbone infrastructure or a centralized base \nstation. \nOn the basis of\
    \ interference detection, spectrum sensing is \ncategorized as primary transmitter\
    \ detection, primary receiver \ndetection, and interference temperature [51].\
    \ In primary \ntransmitter detection approaches, spectrum holes are identified\
    \ \nby processing received signals at the PU receiver. This class \nincludes several\
    \ techniques such as energy detection and \nmatched filter detection. In primary\
    \ receiver detection, the \nstatus of primary channels is detected based on the\
    \ local \noscillator leakage power of the PU receiver [57]. This power is \nemitted\
    \ by the PU receiverâs RF front end while receiving the \ndata from the PU transmitter\
    \ [58]. As for interference \ntemperature, secondary users transmit simultaneously\
    \ with \nprimary users as long as the interference caused by the SU at \nthe PU\
    \ receiver remains under a specified interference limit. In \nthis case, the underlay\
    \ DSA model is considered. \nIn regard to the requirement of the PUâs information,\
    \ \nspectrum sensing schemes can be categorized into two classes: \nblind and\
    \ feature detection techniques [50]. The blind detection \ntechniques serve to\
    \ blindly determine the channel state without \nany prior knowledge about the\
    \ primary user signals. This type \nincludes, among others, energy detection and\
    \ Higher-Order-\nStatistics detection. The feature detection techniques allow\
    \ \nperforming signal classification to the detected signal. They are \nmore advantageous\
    \ than blind detection techniques in the sense \nthat it is possible to distinguish\
    \ between PU and SU signals and \nto characterize the different types of PU and\
    \ SU signals. \nMatched filter and cyclostationarity detection techniques are\
    \ \nexamples of feature detection techniques. \nDepending on the bandwidth (number\
    \ of sensed channels at \na time), spectrum sensing schemes are classified into\
    \ two broad \ngroups which are narrowband and wideband sensing \ntechniques [59]:\
    \ in the narrowband sensing, only one channel \nis analyzed at a time to detect\
    \ available opportunities. The most \nwidely and commonly known narrowband methods\
    \ are energy \ndetection, matched filter detection, cyclostationary feature \n\
    detection, covariance-based detection, and waveform detection \n[59]. \nAs for\
    \ wideband sensing, multiple frequency bands are \nexplored at a time so as to\
    \ discover spectrum holes. In this \ncase, the available spectrum is usually divided\
    \ into narrower \nsub-bands which are sensed either concurrently or sequentially\
    \ \nby using narrowband sensing techniques. Wideband sensing \ntechniques contain\
    \ two groups: Nyquist-based and Sub-\nNyquist wideband sensing. The former type\
    \ processes digital \nsignals at the rate equal to or greater than the Nyquist\
    \ rate, \nwhereas the latter type processes the signals with a sampling \nrate\
    \ lower than the Nyquist rate [59]. \nWideband sensing allows to exploit the available\
    \ spectrum \nmore efficiently but it brings about new challenges related to \n\
    its implementation. \nOn the basis of the latest mentioned classification of \n\
    spectrum sensing schemes (Narrowband sensing/ Wideband \nsensing), the next subsection\
    \ will review some of the most \ncommon spectrum sensing methods as well as the\
    \ recent \nadvanced spectrum sensing techniques. \n \nFig. 7. Types of Spectrum\
    \ Sensing. \n109 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal\
    \ of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nC. Spectrum\
    \ Sensing Techniques \nBefore reviewing in detail spectrum sensing techniques,\
    \ \nmore particularly narrowband sensing techniques, the system \nmodel for spectrum\
    \ sensing is given below. \n1) System Model for spectrum sensing: The fundamental\
    \ \nobjective of spectrum sensing is to make a choice between two \nhypotheses:\
    \ \nâ¢ H0: Channel is temporarily available for opportunistic \nusage i.e. no primary\
    \ user signal is present; \nâ¢ H1: Channel is occupied i.e. a primary user signal\
    \ is \npresent. \nThese hypotheses can be expressed as under: \nH0: Y(n)= N(n)\
    \ when PUâs signal is absent  \n         (1) \nH1: Y(n)= h.X(n)+ N(n) when PUâs\
    \ signal is present          (2) \nWhere Y(n) represents the received signal by\
    \ SU, X(n) \nrepresents the transmitted PU signal, N(n) denotes Additive \nWhite\
    \ Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with mean zero and variance \n\U0001D70E\U0001D70E2.h\
    \ represents the channel gain, n= 1,2,3â¦N where n is the \nsample index, and N\
    \ is the number of samples. \nGenerally, a test statistic of Y(n) is compared\
    \ against a \ndecision threshold value \U0001D706\U0001D706 in order to decide\
    \ between the two \nhypotheses. If the test statistic is greater than the threshold,\
    \ H1 \nis assumed to be true and thus PUâs signal is declared present. \nin contrast,\
    \ if the test statistic is less than the threshold, H0 is \nassumed to be true\
    \ and then PUâs signal is declared absent. Fig. \n8 presents the general model\
    \ of spectrum detection. \n \nFig. 8. Spectrum Sensing Model. \nSensing accuracy\
    \ is typically evaluated using the Receiver \nOperating Characteristic (ROC) curves.\
    \ These curves are the \nplot of the detection probability versus the false alarm\
    \ \nprobability or plot of the probability of miss detection against \nthe probability\
    \ of false alarm [60,61]. These probabilities are \ndefined as: \nProbability\
    \ of detection (Pd): It is the probability that the \nSU declares the presence\
    \ of PU signal when it is actually \npresent. \nPd = Pr(H1/H1)   \n \n \n \n \
    \        (3) \nA \nhigh \nProbability \nof \ndetection \nallows \navoiding \n\
    interference impact on primary receivers. Hence a high Pd is \neminently desirable.\
    \ \nProbability of false alarm (Pfa): It is the probability that the \nSU declares\
    \ the presence of PU signal when it doesnât truly \nexist. \nPfa= Pr(H1/H0)  \
    \ \n \n \n \n         (4) \nA high Probability of false alarm decreases the efficiency\
    \ \nspectral due to the loss of spectrum access opportunities. In \naddition,\
    \ the QoS may be negatively affected as a result of this \nloss. Thus, Pfa should\
    \ be low to avoid the under-use of \npotential spectrum holes. \nProbability of\
    \ miss detection (Pm): It is the probability of \nmissing a PU signal when it\
    \ is present. \nPm= Pr(H0/H1)   \n \n \n \n         (5) \nA high Probability of\
    \ miss detection causes a harmful \ninterference on primary users because, in\
    \ the case of a miss \ndetection, SUs may transmit simultaneously with PUs in\
    \ the \nsame band. So, to avoid interference to and from license holder \nusers,\
    \ Pm should be low. \n2) Narrowband sensing techniques: In this subsection, we\
    \ \ndiscuss several narrowband sensing techniques, focusing on \ntheir \nfunctions,\
    \ \nmathematical \nmodels, \nstrengths, \nand \ndrawbacks. \na) Energy detection\
    \ scheme: Energy detection [1,62â64] \ncalled also Radiometry or Periodogram,\
    \ is the most widely \nused sensing scheme due to its low computational complexity,\
    \ \nthe simplicity of its implementation, and the absence of need \nfor PU signal\
    \ information. \nIn this sensing technique, the received signal energy is \ncomputed\
    \ and compared with a threshold value. If the \nmeasured energy is higher than\
    \ the threshold, the target \nfrequency band is considered to be occupied by a\
    \ PU; \notherwise, the target frequency band is considered to be vacant. \nThe\
    \ block diagram of the energy detection method is illustrated \nin Fig. 9 and\
    \ its decision metric can be written as: \nT= \n1\nN â\n(Y(n))\nN\nn=1\nâ¿  \n\
    \ \n \n \n         (6) \nDespite its aforementioned advantages, energy detection\
    \ \nhas several drawbacks, including the degradation of detection \naccuracy as\
    \ a result of noise uncertainty (NU). The latter refers \nto the noise power fluctuations\
    \ with time caused by the effects \nof various factors such as thermal noise,\
    \ filtering effects, radio-\nfrequency circuits, and interference from other signals\
    \ [65]. \nAuthors of [65] analyzed the impact of NU on energy detection \nperformance\
    \ using different OFDM system designs. The \nresults of their analyses show that,\
    \ for all OFDM system \ndesigns, the probability of detection is higher for signals,\
    \ with \nlower NU and higher SNR, which are transmitted at higher PU \ntransmit\
    \ power and detected with a higher number of samples. \nMoreover, energy detection\
    \ is unreliable at low SNR values \n[66], ineffective in detecting spread signals\
    \ [60], and unable to \ndistinguish between PU signals from other signals. \n\
    To enhance the performance and the accuracy of energy \ndetection, several methods\
    \ based on the use of dynamics \nthresholds are investigated in [67â70]. \n \n\

    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nb) Matched filter detection: The matched filter detection\
    \ \ntechnique is viewed as the best method for identifying the \nunutilized bands\
    \ when the PU transmission characteristics are \nknown a priori, e.g., bandwidth,\
    \ operating frequency, the \nmodulation type and order, packet format, and pulse\
    \ shaping \n[70â72]. In this technique, the received signal is correlated \nwith\
    \ the known PU signal and the result is compared with a \nthreshold to decide\
    \ on the presence of the PU. The block \ndiagram of matched filter detection is\
    \ shown in Fig. 10 and its \ntest statistic is given by: \nT=â\nY(n)Xâ(n)\nN\n\
    n=1\n23T \n \n \n \n         (7) \n \nFig. 10. Block Diagram of Matched Filter\
    \ Detection [70â73]. \nThe main advantage of this sensing scheme is that it \n\
    requires only a small number of samples and thus less sensing \ntime to achieve\
    \ good detection performance due to its \nresilience against noise uncertainty\
    \ [73]. Nevertheless, it has \nseveral drawbacks. First, there is a need for precise\
    \ and \naccurate prior information about the primary user signal, which \nmay\
    \ not always be available [65]. Second, the performance of \nthe matched filter\
    \ technique drops when the prior information \nis incorrect. Third, to detect\
    \ different types of PUs, a dedicated \nmatched filter structure for each type\
    \ must be used, which \nincreases the complexity of the system. \nc) Cyclostationary\
    \ Feature Detection: Cyclostationary \nFeature Detection [74â76] depends on cyclostationary\
    \ \ncharacteristics of the received signals. Indeed, in wireless \ncommunications,\
    \ the transmitted signals are typically \ncharacterized by the periodicity of\
    \ some of their statistics such \nas mean and autocorrelation[76,77].This periodicity\
    \ results \nfrom the fact that signals are modulated and coupled with \ncyclic\
    \ prefixes, hopping sequences, pulse trains, sinusoidal \nwave carrier, and other\
    \ features before being transmitted \n[76,77]. Furthermore, additive noise signals\
    \ are stationary \nwith no correlation. Therefore, Cyclostationary Feature \n\
    Detection schemes are very robust to noise uncertainties and \ncan distinguish\
    \ between the signal and noise by calculating \nand analyzing the cyclic autocorrelation\
    \ of the received \nsignals. \nThe periodicity of the mean and the autocorrelation,\
    \ of a \ncyclostationary signal y(t), can be expressed mathematically \nby: \n\
    my(t) = E[y(t)] = my(t + T0) \n \n \n         (8) \nRy(t, Ï) = Ry(t + T0, Ï) \n\
    \ \n \n \n         (9) \nWhere T0 represents the period of the signal \U0001D466\
    \U0001D466 (\U0001D461\U0001D461), \U0001D70F\U0001D70F \nrepresents the time\
    \ offset, \U0001D438\U0001D438 denotes the expectation operator, \nand \U0001D445\
    \U0001D445\U0001D466\U0001D466 is the autocorrelation function of \U0001D466\U0001D466\
    \ (\U0001D461\U0001D461) and it is given \nby: \nR\U0001D466\U0001D466 (\U0001D70F\

    \U0001D6FC\U0001D461\U0001D461]  \n \n       (10) \nThe block diagram of Cyclostationary\
    \ Detection scheme is \nillustrated in Fig. 11, in which The Analog-to-Digital\
    \ \nConverter (ADC) digitizes the received analog signal y(t) into \ndigital samples\
    \ and then it is fed into the N-point FFT block \nwhich computes its Fast Fourier\
    \ Transform. Next, these FFT \nvalues are correlated with themselves and then\
    \ averaged over \nthe number of samples. Finally, in the feature detection block,\
    \ \nthe sensing decision is obtained by detecting the features of the \naverage\
    \ outcome. \nThis scheme has also the advantage of being able to \ndistinguish\
    \ between various types of PU signals that are \ncharacterized by different transmit\
    \ features [78]. \nHowever, this detector also presents some limitations such\
    \ \nas the need for a large number of samples and high sampling \nrate which results\
    \ in an increase in sensing time, power \nconsumption, and complexity [76,78].\
    \ \nIn order to reduce computation complexity while \nmaintaining sufficient detection\
    \ sensitivity, authors of [79] \nproposed an improved Cyclostationary Detector\
    \ with SLC \nDiversity over Nakagami-m Fading channels, where the test \nstatistic\
    \ of conventional Cyclostationary detector is reliably \nsimplified. For the same\
    \ purpose, in [80], an improved \nCyclostationary Feature Detection Algorithm\
    \ is presented, in \nwhich authors proved that the cyclic spectrum is conjugate\
    \ \nsymmetry about the relevant axis, which decreases the \ncomputational complexity.\

    d) Covariance Based Detection: Covariance-based \ndetection methods exploit the\
    \ correlation structure inherent in \nthe received data and the noticeable differences\
    \ between the \nstatistical covariances of signal and noise to decide on the \n\
    presence of primary signals in background noise without the \nneed for prior knowledge\
    \ about signal, channel, or noise \npower [81]. \nDifferent statistical tests\
    \ can be extracted from the \ncovariance matrix of the received signal and used\
    \ to detect the \npresence of the signal like the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue\
    \ \nto minimum eigenvalue in the case of Eigenvalue-Based \nDetection Method [82].\
    \ The steps of the latter can be \nsummarized as follows: First, the sample covariance\
    \ matrix of \nthe received signal is built from the received signal samples. \n\
    Then, the eigenvalues of this matrix are computed using \ntechniques such as singular\
    \ value decomposition (SVD). \nFinally, a decision on the presence of the signal\
    \ is taken by \ncomparing the ratio between the maximum eigenvalue and the \n\
    minimum eigenvalue with a threshold. The block diagram of \nthis method is shown\
    \ in Fig. 12. \n \nFig. 12. Block Diagram of Covariance-Based Detection [82].\

    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nThe sample\
    \ covariance matrix of the received signal can be \nexpressed as [82]: \nRy (Ns)=\n\
    1\nNâ â\nLâ2+Nâ Å·(n) Å·H(n) \nn=Lâ1\n \n \n \n       (11) \nWhere Ns is the number\
    \ of collected samples, L is a \npositive integer called âsmoothing factor\",\
    \ Å·(n) is the received \nsignal vector at sampling instance n, and Å·H(n) is its\
    \ conjugate-\ntranspose. \nThe test statistic can be written as: \nT= \nÎ»\U0001D45A\
    \U0001D456\U0001D45B\nÎ»\U0001D45A\U0001D44E\U0001D465  \n \n \n \n \n       (12)\
    \ \nWhere \U0001D706\U0001D706max and \U0001D706\U0001D706min are respectively\
    \ the maximum and \nminimum eigenvalues of Ry (Ns); \nUsing a predefined threshold\
    \ \U0001D706\U0001D706, the decision can be made as \nfollows: if T> \U0001D706\
    \U0001D706, H1 is considered to be true, otherwise, H0 is \nconsidered to be true.\
    \ \nIt is noteworthy that, despite the robustness of covariance \ntechniques against\
    \ noise uncertainty, they have a high \ncomputational complexity due to two factors,\
    \ namely \ncovariance matrix computation and eigenvalue decomposition \n[82].\
    \ \ne) Waveform-based \ndetection: \nWaveform-based \ndetection method, also known\
    \ as coherent detection [49], can \nbe considered as a simplified version of the\
    \ matched filter \nscheme. Although, unlike the latter, this method doesnât need\
    \ \ncomplete information about the PU signals. It simply exploits \nknown patterns,\
    \ that are used in wireless communication \nsystems to support many functions\
    \ such as synchronization, \ncontrol, and equalization so as to execute coherent\
    \ detection. \nThese patterns involve but not limited to the following: \nâ¢ Preambles:\
    \ a preamble is a known sequence that is sent \nbefore each burst; \nâ¢ Midambles:\
    \ a midamble is a known sequence that is \nsent in the middle of a slot or burst;\
    \ \nâ¢ Pilot symbols: pilot symbols are an extra overhead \nadded to the transmitted\
    \ signal. \nWhen such patterns are available, the received signal is \ncorrelated\
    \ with a known copy of itself to perform signal \ndetection. As such, the test\
    \ statistic can be expressed as: \nT=R [â\ny(n)x(n)â\nN\nn=1\n] \n \n \n \n  \
    \     (13) \nwhere R[.] denotes the real part, y(n) is the received signal \n\
    by SU, x(n)* is the complex conjugate of the signal transmitted \nby PU, and n=\
    \ [1,2â¦. N] is the sample index. \nIn the absence of the primary userâs signal,\
    \ the given \nexpression can be written as follows: \nT=R [â\nn(n)x(n)â\nN\nn=1\n\
    ] \n \n \n \n       (14) \nWhereas in the presence of the primary user, the test\
    \ static \ncan be simplified as under: \nT= â\n(|x[n]|)2\n\U0001D441\n\U0001D45B\
    =1\n+R [â\nn(n)x(n)â\n\U0001D441\n\U0001D45B=1\n] \n \n       (15) \nWhere n(n)\
    \ denotes Additive White Gaussian Noise \n(AWGN) with mean zero and variance \U0001D70E\
    \U0001D70E2. \nThe value of the test statistic T is compared to a fixed \nthreshold\
    \ \U0001D706\U0001D706 in order to decide on the presence of a primary user \n\
    signal. H1 is considered to be true if T > \U0001D706\U0001D706, and H0 is \n\
    considered to be true otherwise. \nIt is noteworthy that the waveform-based sensing\
    \ scheme \ncan only be applied to wireless systems having known signal \npatterns,\
    \ such as Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11b) [83] and WIMAX [84]. \nIn [85], it is demonstrated\
    \ that compared to energy detector \ntechnique, this method is more reliable and\
    \ has less sensing \ntime. In addition, it is demonstrated that the accuracy of\
    \ this \nsensing scheme increases with the length of the known primary \nsignal\
    \ pattern. \nIn [86], the authors have opted for waveform-based sensing \nscheme\
    \ to analyze the sensing performance of the simultaneous \ntransmission-and-sensing\
    \ (TS) mode, which has proven its \neffectiveness under imperfect self-interference\
    \ signal (SIS), \nunlike energy detection that cannot differentiate between a\
    \ PU \nsignal and a residual SIS. \nIn spite of the aforementioned advantages,\
    \ there are some \ndownsides to this scheme, mainly the need for complete and\
    \ \naccurate information concerning waveform patterns as well as \nhigh synchronization\
    \ between PU and SU, which is not always \npossible to attain. \nConcerning the\
    \ implementation complexity, coherent \ndetection is more complex than Energy\
    \ detection method and \nhas a lower complexity compared to match filter detection\
    \ \ntechnique. \nTable III provides a performance comparison of the \npreviously\
    \ described narrowband sensing methods based on a \nset of performance criteria,\
    \ namely detection accuracy, \ncomplexity, need for prior information about the\
    \ primary user, \nrobustness against noise uncertainty, and sensing time required\
    \ \nto achieve a good performance. \n3) Wideband sensing techniques: Wideband\
    \ spectrum \nsensing enables detecting spectral opportunities that lie within\
    \ \nfrequency bands greater than the coherence bandwidth of the \nchannel. One\
    \ application of this class of sensing is to exploit \nthe available spectrum\
    \ holes in the UHF (ultra-high-\nfrequency) TV band ranging from 300 MHz to 3\
    \ GHz. \nAs have been discussed earlier, narrowband sensing \nschemes make a single\
    \ binary decision for the whole frequency \nband. That makes these schemes incapable\
    \ to perform directly \nwideband sensing, since the latter intends to determine\
    \ the \noccupancy of several sub-channels that are involved in a given \nwideband\
    \ spectrum at a time. \nThe two types of wideband sensing techniques (Nyquist\
    \ / \nSub-Nyquist) will be briefly reviewed in this subsection. \n \n \n112 |\

    \ \nwideband \nsensing: \nNyquist \nwideband \nsensing is carried out using a\
    \ standard ADC operating at \nNyquist rate to digitize the wideband signal and\
    \ digital signal \nprocessing methods to detect spectral opportunities. It \n\
    includes, among other, wavelet-based detection, multi-band \njoint detection,\
    \ and filter bank detection: \nWavelet-based detection [87] determines spectrum\
    \ holes \nover a wide frequency band, which is assumed to be composed \nof a multitude\
    \ of sub-bands whose locations and power spectral \ndensities are unknown, by\
    \ using the wavelet transform. The \nlatter serves to identify discontinuities\
    \ that are located at the \nboundaries (edges) of each sub-band. The discontinuous\
    \ \nchanges on the edges correspond to irregularities in power \nspectral density.\
    \ As such, information about the locations and \nintensities of the sub-bands\
    \ can be retrieved through the \nwavelet transform and then their status (occupied\
    \ or \nunoccupied) can be deduced. \nConcerning the multiband joint detection\
    \ algorithm [88], it \nsenses the primary signal over multiple frequency channels\
    \ by \nperforming the following procedures: first, sampling the \nwideband signal\
    \ using a high sampling rate analog to digital \nconverter. Second, dividing the\
    \ sampled data into parallel data \nstreams by a serial-to-parallel converter.\
    \ Third, computing the \nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the digital signal. Fourth,\
    \ \ndividing the wideband spectrum into multiple sub-bands that \nare occupied\
    \ by narrowband signals. Finally, detecting \nspectrum opportunities over each\
    \ sub-band by using a \nnarrowband sensing scheme such as energy detection. \n\
    Furthermore, this technique allows to jointly determine the \noptimal threshold,\
    \ that maximizes the accuracy of sensing for \nall the sub-channels, by formulating\
    \ an optimization problem. \nAs for filter bank detection [89], a filter bank,\
    \ consisting of \na set of bandpass filters, is used to separate the wideband\
    \ signal \ninto multiple sub-bands. The bandpass filters are realized \nthrough\
    \ modulation (Poly-phase decomposition) of a prototype \nfilter. The prototype\
    \ filter is a lowpass filter that is used to \nimplement the zeroth band of the\
    \ filter bank. The obtained sub-\nbands are then sensed separately via a narrowband\
    \ sensing \nscheme. In this type of sensing, the sub-bands can be down-\nconverted\
    \ and consequently re-sampled at a lower sampling \nrate. However, a large number\
    \ of RF components will be \nadded, resulting in a high implementation complexity\
    \ [90]. \nWhile Nyquist wideband sensing allows to exploit \nefficiently the available\
    \ spectrum, it has certain limitations, \nincluding the requirement of a high\
    \ sampling rate (Wavelet-\nbased detection and multiband joint detection) and\
    \ the high \nimplementation complexity (Filter bank). \nb) Sub-Nyquist \nwideband\
    \ \nsensing: \nSub-Nyquist \nwideband sensing offers solutions to the challenges\
    \ facing \nNyquist-based sensing, more particularly high sampling rate \nand high\
    \ implementation complexity concerns. Sub-Nyquist \napproaches aim to identify\
    \ spectral opportunities by exploiting \nonly a few measurements derived from\
    \ processing wideband \nsignals at sampling rates less than the Nyquist rate.\
    \ \nAmong the most important Sub-Nyquist wideband sensing \ntypes is compressive-based\
    \ sensing [91â93]. The latter refers to \nthe process of recovering a sparse signal\
    \ from a few \nmeasurements by following a three-step procedure (sparse \nrepresentation,\
    \ measurement, and sparse recovery). In the first \nstep, the sparsity of the\
    \ signal is derived by projecting the \nsignal on an appropriate basis. In second,\
    \ only a reduced \nnumber of measurements are retrieved by multiplying the \n\
    sparse signal by a measurement matrix. In third, the signal is \nrecovered by\
    \ using the few collected measurements. Finally, \nthe sensing operation is performed\
    \ to identify the spectral \nopportunities. \nIt is noteworthy that the use of\
    \ comprehensive sensing, in \nthe context of wideband sensing, is enabled due\
    \ to the sparsity \nfeature that characterizes the wideband signal in the frequency\
    \ \ndomain. \nFurthermore, the reliability of sub-Nyquist wideband \nsensing schemes\
    \ depends largely on the accuracy of sparsity \nlevel estimation. Although, the\
    \ latter suffers from uncertainty \nbecause of various factors, mainly the dynamic\
    \ nature of PUs \ntransmission activities as well as wireless channel impairments.\
    \ \nD. Machine Learning for Spectrum Sensing \nAs pointed out earlier, CR is an\
    \ intelligent radio system that \nincorporates the three main components which\
    \ any intelligent \nsystem should have, namely perception, learning, and \nreasoning\
    \ [94]. Perception refers to the ability of the system to \nsense its radio environment\
    \ and it can be realized by means of \nsensing measurements of the spectrum. Learning\
    \ refers to the \nability of the system to convert the gathered information into\
    \ \nknowledge and it can be achieved through classification and \n113 | P a g\

    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \ngeneralization algorithms.\
    \ Finally, knowledge is exploited by \nthe system to attain its objectives via\
    \ reasoning ability \n[94].Considering this intelligent design, machine learning\
    \ \nbased spectrum sensing presents itself as a good alternative to \ndetermine\
    \ the channel occupancy in Cognitive Radio Networks \nby addressing two main issues\
    \ which are classification and \ndecision making [94]. \nMachine learning algorithms\
    \ can be classified into two \nbroad groups: supervised learning and unsupervised\
    \ learning. \nIn supervised learning, a classifier learns from a training \ndataset\
    \ to make predictions on unforeseen data. According to \nthe training dataset,\
    \ supervised machine learning problems can \nbe further grouped into classification\
    \ and regression problems. \nIf the input variables are mapped to discrete output\
    \ values \n(categories, labels, classesâ¦), then it is a classification \nproblem.\
    \ If the input variables are mapped to continuous \noutput values, then it is\
    \ a regression problem. Some examples \nof supervised algorithms include support\
    \ vector machines \n(SVM), Random forest, and naive Bayesian classifier (NBC).\
    \ \nAs for unsupervised learning, its main function consists in \nfinding patterns\
    \ in a set of untagged data. K-means is one of \nthe simplest and most widely\
    \ used unsupervised machine \nlearning algorithms. \nIn the context of Cognitive\
    \ Radio Networks, several papers \nhave dealt with the use of machine learning\
    \ algorithms to \npredict the availability of frequency channels. For instance,\
    \ in \n[95], the authors performed a comparative analysis of different \nsupervised\
    \ and unsupervised machine learning algorithms \nbased on computational time and\
    \ classification accuracy. They \nalso proposed a new method that combines support\
    \ vector \nmachines with the firefly algorithm. The authors of [96] \nproposed\
    \ a deep learning approach to learn channel activities \nand predict its availability\
    \ in future time slots. The ability to \npredict the channel occupancy in the\
    \ next time slots may \nincrease the efficiency of selecting the more appropriate\
    \ \nchannel at the instant t (For example, choosing the channel \nhaving the highest\
    \ probability of being unoccupied in the next \ntime slots). \nGenerally, in the\
    \ case of spectrum sensing, researchers \nadopt a two-phase machine learning approach\
    \ [95,97]. In the \nfirst phase, an unsupervised learning technique, such as K-\n\
    means algorithm, is applied to discover the transmission \npatterns of primary\
    \ users. In the second phase, the discovered \nclusters (channel busy or free)\
    \ are used to train supervised \nlearning classifiers like support vector machine\
    \ (SVM) and \nthen to assign the new input data to the suitable cluster. it is\
    \ \nworth mentioning that in several works, the sensing clusters are \nassumed\
    \ to be known and thus the first phase is omitted. In this \ncase, the researchers\
    \ adopt a one-phase machine learning \napproach in which supervised learning techniques\
    \ are trained \nwith the already known clusters [98,99]. \nIn building machine\
    \ learning models for spectrum sensing, \nseveral features are used, including\
    \ energy statistic, probability \nvector, and occupancy over time. Obviously,\
    \ the accuracy of \ndetecting the primary users may be affected by the selected\
    \ \nfeatures. \nFinally, to evaluate the performance of a given model, a set \n\
    of metrics can be used mainly, probability of detection, \nprobability of false\
    \ alarm, total error rate, sensing time, and \naccuracy. \nE. Sensing Challenges\
    \ \nThis subsection is devoted to discussing the various \nchallenges related\
    \ to the spectrum sensing process in Cognitive \nRadio Networks as well as highlighting\
    \ some possible future \nresearch directions in this field. \n1) Hidden PU problem:\
    \ As the Carrier Sense Multiple \nAccessing (CSMA), which is characterized by\
    \ the presence of \nhidden node problem, spectrum sensing suffers also from \n\
    hidden primary user problem. The latter refers to the situation \nin which the\
    \ secondary user misses the primary user presence \ndue to many issues, including\
    \ severe multipath fading and \nshadowing effects experienced by primary signals,\
    \ during \npropagation from PU transmitter to SU receiver. As such, the \nsecondary\
    \ user may induce undesirable interference to \nprimary user receivers. In several\
    \ research papers, cooperative \nsensing has been proposed as a successful approach\
    \ to handle \nthis issue by exploiting spatial diversity [49,100]. \n2) Challenges\
    \ related to cooperative sensing: Cooperative \nsensing has proven to be effective\
    \ in improving the reliability \nand accuracy of detection, especially in the\
    \ case of the \npresence of channel impairments. Moreover, it has also been \n\
    shown to be useful in decreasing individual sensing durations \nand local processing\
    \ requirements [21,53]. \nDespite its different advantages, cooperation among\
    \ CR \nusers also brought many challenges and invoked significant \nresearches.\
    \ One of these challenges is mitigating the additional \nsignaling overhead and\
    \ reducing delays that are induced by the \ncooperation process [101]. \nAnother\
    \ challenge is to find a tradeoff between the number \nof users participating\
    \ in cooperation and additional processing \nrequirements. Indeed, a large number\
    \ of cooperative nodes can \nensure a high probability of detection, even in the\
    \ presence of \nchannel uncertainties and detectors with less sensitivity, but\
    \ it \nintroduces a considerable amount of extra overhead which \nleads to an\
    \ increase in the sensing time and processing. Hence, \nthere exists a compromise.\
    \ \nAnother challenge consists in developing asynchronous \ncooperative spectrum\
    \ sensing algorithms [102,103]. In fact, CR \nnodes are located at different positions\
    \ and may perform \nspectrum sensing at different times [104]. Therefore, CR nodes\
    \ \ncannot report their local sensing results to the fusion center at \nthe same\
    \ time and thus some of the reported information may \nnot be up to date [103].\
    \ Furthermore, there is always a time \noffset between the local observation and\
    \ the final decision \nwhich may incur performance degradation. In addition, \n\
    reporting channel uncertainties may impact negatively the \nsensing accuracy.\
    \ \n3) Spectrum sensing duration: Admittedly, a long sensing \nduration can guarantee\
    \ a higher accuracy for spectrum sensing \nresults, but it can compromise with\
    \ interference avoidance, \nenergy efficiency, and throughput. \n114 | P a g e\
    \  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nRegarding interference avoidance,\
    \ secondary users must be \naware promptly of the presence of the primary user\
    \ and vacate \nthe frequency band rapidly when the incumbent user resumes \nits\
    \ transmission in that band. Thus, a real trade-off arises \nbetween the quickness\
    \ with which the secondary user must \nperform the aforementioned tasks and the\
    \ required sensing \nduration to ensure more reliable results. \nConcerning energy\
    \ efficiency, the gain in accuracy \nachieved by a long sensing duration comes\
    \ at the expense of \nenergy. Hence, sensing duration and energy efficiency should\
    \ \nbe optimized. \nAs for throughput, it is inversely related to sensing time.\
    \ \nTherefore, there is a compromise between longer sensing \nduration for higher\
    \ performance and lower sensing duration for \ngood throughput. \nThese trade-offs\
    \ should be addressed jointly to find an \noptimum solution that ensure a higher\
    \ performance under \ncertain constraints. \n4) Noise \nuncertainty: \nSeveral\
    \ \nspectrum \nsensing \ntechniques rely on a threshold value to decide on the\
    \ presence \nof primary user signals. Hence, selecting the optimum \nthreshold\
    \ is crucial and important to ensure high accuracy of \nsensing results. To determine\
    \ the best threshold value, many \nparameters should be taken into consideration\
    \ such as noise \npower. The latter is uncertain and developing techniques that\
    \ \nare robust to noise uncertainty is still a challenging task. Some \nresearch\
    \ papers have addressed this issue using different \napproaches. For instance,\
    \ in [105] a blind spectrum sensing \ntechnique based on goodness of fit testing\
    \ of tâdistribution \nhas been proposed to cope with the noise uncertainty problem.\
    \ \n5) Complexity and hardware requirements: Several issues \nneed to be addressed\
    \ to bridge the gap between the theory and \nthe hardware implementation realities\
    \ of spectrum sensing \nschemes from both types, narrowband and wideband sensing.\
    \ \nThese include the complexity of narrowband sensing \ntechniques, mainly covariance-based\
    \ and cyclostationary \nfeature detection schemes, which require large processing\
    \ \npower that is unsuitable for portable devices. Hence, \nAdditional efforts\
    \ are required to reduce the complexity of \nthese techniques and take advantage\
    \ of their various benefits \nin real-life application. Besides, meeting the hardware\
    \ \nrequirements of wideband sensing schemes, like high-\nresolution ADCs and\
    \ high-speed signal processors, while \nmaintaining acceptable complexity and\
    \ moderate computation \npower, is a challenging task. \n6) Sparsity level uncertainty:\
    \ In wideband compressive \nsensing, estimating the accurate sparsity level is\
    \ of paramount \nimportance, since it is a prerequisite for determining the \n\
    optimal number of measurements. However, achieving this \nresult is very difficult,\
    \ especially in rapidly changing \nenvironments, due to random changes in spectrum\
    \ activities \nand time-varying fading channels. That may lead to calculate \n\
    the number of measurements using the worst-case sparsity \nlevel assumption, resulting\
    \ in high energy consumption and \ninefficient use of sub-Nyquist sampling technologies.\
    \ \nTherefore, developing blind sub-Nyquist wideband sensing \nschemes, in which\
    \ the estimation of sparsity level isnât \nneeded, still a challenging task [90].\
    \ \nIn the literature, only a few papers have dealt with the issue \nof sparsity\
    \ level uncertainty. For instance, the authors of [106] \nproposed an algorithm\
    \ for estimating the sparsity level of the \nchannel over a learned dictionary\
    \ using Machine Learning \nalgorithms. \n7) Security: As with any wireless network,\
    \ Cognitive \nRadio Networks are vulnerable to various cybersecurity \nattacks\
    \ that can be performed by selfish or malicious users and \ninduce disruptive\
    \ effects on network operation. Selfish users \nexploit network facilities for\
    \ their interests, namely \nmonopolizing the use of available spectrum opportunities\
    \ and \nthus depriving legitimate Secondary users of their fair share of \nspectrum.\
    \ As for malicious users, they abuse network facilities \nby exploiting the existing\
    \ vulnerabilities and thereby \nhindering legitimate SUs from using the spectrum.\
    \ \nSome of the cybersecurity attacks in Cognitive Radio \nNetworks include most\
    \ active band (MAB), primary user \nemulation (PUE), and spectrum sensing data\
    \ falsification \n(SSDF) attacks. \nMost active band (MAB) attack aims at detecting\
    \ and \nmaking the most active band, in a multi-band CR network, \nunavailable\
    \ by targeting it via a denial of service (DoS) attack \nand consequently preventing\
    \ the other users (PU and SU) from \nusing it. The authors of [107] proposed a\
    \ coordinated \nconcealment strategy to counter this attack. In this strategy,\
    \ a \nset of SUs cooperate and transmit useless data in a free band to \nmake\
    \ it the most active and therefore the attacker's target. \nPrimary user emulation\
    \ (PUE) attack is an attack where a \nselfish or malicious node adjusts its air\
    \ interface to emulate \nprimary user characteristics and thus mislead secondary\
    \ users \nconcerning the availability of the spectrum holes [108]. During \nthe\
    \ sensing process, SUs, under this attack, may detect attacker \nsignals as primary\
    \ user signals and then refrain from using the \nspectrum. A range of countermeasures\
    \ against PUE attack has \nbeen \ninvestigated \nin \nthe \nliterature \n[109].\
    \ \nThese \ncountermeasures can be categorized into four types: \ncountermeasures\
    \ based on cryptography, countermeasures \nbased on fingerprint, countermeasures\
    \ based on game theory, \nand hybrid countermeasures that combine the three other\
    \ types \n[109]. \nSpectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack, also \n\
    known as Byzantine attack, specially targets cooperative \nspectrum sensing and\
    \ consists in compromising the fusion \ncenter with false spectrum sensing results\
    \ to deceive decision-\nmaking. In [110], a reputation-based approach, in which\
    \ the \nfusion center recognizes the malicious attackers and eliminates \nthem\
    \ from the data fusion process, was proposed to counter \nSSDF attack. \nWhile\
    \ significant efforts have been carried out to detect and \ncope with cybersecurity\
    \ issues, there are still several challenges \nthat need to be addressed, including\
    \ developing advanced \ntechniques that do not need prior knowledge about PU location\
    \ \n115 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of\
    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n, as this\
    \ is not always available in real-world scenarios, \ndeveloping detection and\
    \ counter-measures methods based on \ncryptography that take into account resource\
    \ constraint (e.g., \npower and bandwidth), and developing spectrum sensing \n\
    techniques capable of differentiating between PU signals and \nmalicious user\
    \ signals. \nV. CR-BASED IOT \nThe wide variety of IoT technologies have led to\
    \ a rapidly \nincreasing number of networked devices that are expected to \nreach\
    \ 51.11 billion by 2023, according to research from Cisco \nstates (See Fig. 13).\
    \ Such devices involve daily tech gadgets \nsuch as smartphones and smart home\
    \ devices, as well as \nindustrial devices like smart machines and robots. These\
    \ smart \nconnected devices are capable of gathering, sharing, and \nanalyzing\
    \ information and creating actions accordingly. By \n2023, global spending on\
    \ IoT will reach 1.1 trillion U.S. dollar \n[111]. This puts IoT at the core of\
    \ current and future social and \neconomic transformation. \nFurthermore, with\
    \ the massive proliferation of these \nconnected objects, there is an increased\
    \ demand for spectrum \nresources. Cognitive Radio proves to be a promising \n\
    technology to cater to current and future IoT devices in terms \nof spectrum access.\
    \ In this section, the integration of the \nInternet of Things and Cognitive Radio\
    \ is explored. \n \nFig. 13. IoT Connected Devices Installed base Worldwide from\
    \ 2015 to 2025 \n(in billions)3. \nA. Definition of IoT \nThe term \"Internet\
    \ of Things\" was coined by Kevin Ashton \nto depict âa system in which the Internet\
    \ is connected to the \nphysical world by ubiquitous sensorsâ4. \nInternet of\
    \ Things (IoT) can be defined as a network of \nobjects connected to the Internet\
    \ and can communicate with \neach other using different communication technologies.\
    \ These \nobjects are equipped with sensors, that allow interaction with \nthe\
    \ environment, and communication modules [112â114]. \nSome of those sensors include\
    \ temperature sensors, pressure \nsensors, proximity sensors, and humidity sensors.\
    \ \nToday, the IoT enables the real world and the virtual/or \ndigital world interconnection.\
    \ Thanks to IoT, things will \n3 https://www.statista.com/statistics/668996/worldwide-expenditures-for-\n\
    the-internet-of-things/ \n4 https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3411\
    \ \ncommunicate with each other and develop their own \nintelligence. Televisions,\
    \ cars, kitchen appliances, surveillance \ncameras, smartphones, utility meters,\
    \ cardiac monitors, \nthermostats, and almost anything that we can imagine will\
    \ be \nconnected every day, everywhere and every time. \nThe idea of the IoT dates\
    \ back to 1999 [115] and became a \nreality due to several technologies and protocols,\
    \ including \nMachine to Machine (M2M), Wireless Sensor Networks \n(WSN), Radio\
    \ frequency Dentification (RFID), Internet \nProtocol version 6 (IPv6), IPv6 Low\
    \ power Wireless Personal \nArea Networks (6LoWPAN), Routing Protocol for Low-Power\
    \ \nand \nLossy \nNetworks \n(RPL), \nConstrained \nApplication \nProtocol(CoAP),\
    \ and Cognitive Radio that comes to empower \nthe IoT revolution. This revolution\
    \ gives birth to the \nproliferation of small devices such as sensors and actuators,\
    \ \nwith low consumption at lower cost, and a large number of \nplatforms allowing\
    \ users to develop their own applications. \nThus, the number of connected Â« things\
    \ Â» is increasing \nexponentially in the world (See Fig. 13). \nB. Motivations\
    \ behind the use of Cognitive Radio in the IoT \nCognitive Radio has a great potential\
    \ to address several \nissues and challenges related to the deployment of IoT\
    \ \nnetworks, namely, resource scarcity, interferences problem, \nlimited communication\
    \ range, purchasing license, storing and \nanalyzing the data generated by IoT\
    \ objects, heterogeneity, and \nreconfigurability and autonomicity. Dealing with\
    \ these issues \npresents the prime motivation behind the use of Cognitive \n\
    Radio in IoT. \nRegarding spectrum resources, it is difficult to allocate \nfrequency\
    \ bands to all the ever-increasing number of IoT \nobjects. CR address this issue\
    \ by enabling frequency reuse. \n As for the interference problem, most IoT technologies\
    \ \nsuch as RFID, IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) operates in UHF and \nISM frequency bands\
    \ which are already saturated and canât \naccommodate more applications. Thus,\
    \ sharing these bands \nbetween a large number of objects creates inevitable \n\
    interferences. CR deal with this issue by enabling dynamic \nspectrum access to\
    \ interference-free channels. \nConcerning communication range, ISM unlicensed\
    \ bands \nallow wireless technologies to operate only over a limited \nrange.\
    \ Acquiring a frequency spectrum, that ensures \ncommunications over long distances,\
    \ requires the purchase of \nlicenses which generates superfluous expenses. CR\
    \ avoids the \npurchase of license and allows the opportunistic usage of \nunoccupied\
    \ bands that enables long-distance communications. \nIn terms of storing and analyzing\
    \ the data generated by IoT \nobjects, the objects must find communication links\
    \ to transmit \nthe generated information to numerous servers (Cloud servers).\
    \ \nCR is a proper solution to resolve this issue. \nWith respect to heterogeneity\
    \ problems, IoT applications \nrepresent a wide range of design options (resources,\
    \ \ndeployment, connectivity, energy, communication modality, \ninfrastructure,\
    \ network size, network topology...). Thus, new \ncommunication paradigms should\
    \ be designed to support this \nheterogeneity by providing environmental discovery,\
    \ self-\norganization, and self-management capabilities [116]. CR is \n116 | P\
    \ a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n                                          \
    \                 \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \none of these paradigms that can be\
    \ used to tackle heterogeneity \nissues. \nAnother reason is related to reconfigurability\
    \ and \nautonomicity. In fact, smart objects are expected to have the \ncapacity\
    \ to reconfigure. themselves without any external \naction. Thus, objects need\
    \ to be able to recognize and analyze \ntheir environment, detect neighboring\
    \ objects, and then \nreconfigure. themselves. CR proves to be a suitable solution\
    \ to \nfit these circumstances. \nTaking into account all of the above, it can\
    \ be concluded \nthat Cognitive Radio is genuinely a promising enabler \ntechnology\
    \ for IoT. \nC. IoT Applications and CR \nThe deployment of IoT products and services\
    \ will be \npresent in all sectors and industries, from the smart home to the\
    \ \nsmart city, education, health care, manufacturing, energy, \nutilities, commerce,\
    \ transportation, monitoring, supply chain, \nand logistics as illustrated in\
    \ Fig. 14. In general, the \nopportunities offered by IoT are unlimited and its\
    \ full impact \nand potential will be realized in the near future as more and\
    \ \nmore devices connect to the Internet. At present, there are few \nworks in\
    \ the literature dealing with potential applications of \nCR technology for IoT,\
    \ including military applications, \ncognitive radio-vehicular ad hoc networks\
    \ (CR-VANET), \nemergency networks, smart grids, smart metering, and medical \n\
    applications [117â123]. Table IV describes some IoT \napplications while demonstrating\
    \ how CR can be used to \naddress a number of their concerns. \nD. Open Research\
    \ Issues in CR-Based IoT \nSeveral open research issues need to be addressed in\
    \ order \nto take advantage of the full potential of Cognitive Radio for \nIoT\
    \ networks. In this subsection, some of these issues will be \ndiscussed. \n1)\
    \ Optimization of network resources: Efficient spectrum \nutilization, in the\
    \ context of a network composed of CR IoT \nnodes, requires the joint optimization\
    \ of a set of parameters \nsuch as transmission power, energy efficiency, transmission\
    \ \ndelay, and transmission data rate, which is a challenging task. \nThe authors\
    \ of [125] formulated an optimization problem to \nconverge to an optimal solution,\
    \ in a constrained environment, \nby taking into account three variables namely;\
    \ transmission \npower, transmission rate, and transmission delay. To solve this\
    \ \nproblem, they applied a branch-and-cut polyhedral approach. \nThe results\
    \ show that an increase in network and packet size \nleads to an increase in transmission\
    \ delay, power, rate, and \ninterference. \nFormulating and solving multi-objective\
    \ optimization \nproblems, considering a large number of factors, still need to\
    \ \nbe addressed. \n2) Energy efficiency: One of the main challenges that \nneed\
    \ to be addressed in CR-based IoT networks is energy \nefficiency. IoT objects\
    \ with cognitive radio capabilities \nconsume more energy due to performing additional\
    \ functions \nmainly spectrum sensing, which intensifies the power \nconsumption\
    \ issue, especially for energy-constrained nodes \nand battery-powered devices.\
    \ \n \nFig. 14. Applications of IoT. \nTABLE IV. \nCR CONTRIBUTION IN IOT APPLICATIONS\
    \ \nIoT application \nDescription and CR contribution \nSmart Grids [120,121]\
    \ \nSmart Grid is an electricity distribution network that allows the flow of\
    \ information between producers and consumers in order to \ncontrol and regulate\
    \ the flow of electricity in real time and enable more efficient management of\
    \ the electricity grid. The major \nchallenge of this technology is the transmission\
    \ of data through long distances without investing in the purchase of licenses\
    \ or the \ninstallation of cable trays. Cognitive radio offers a good solution\
    \ to this problem. \nSmart Homes [117] \nHomes will be equipped with smart objects,\
    \ allowing to carry out all daily task, such as smart lamps and smart fridges.\
    \ These \nobjects will integrate sensors endowed with cognitive capabilities that\
    \ help to avoid interference in the ISM band. \nHealthcare and Medical \nApplications\
    \ [122,123] \nSmart sensors are deployed to monitor critical data like blood pressure,\
    \ glucose levels, and temperature. With Cognitive Radio \nthis information can\
    \ be transmitted to medical staff in real time, over long distances without worrying\
    \ about spectrum availability. \nSmart Cities [119] \nThe smart city is a paradigm\
    \ of urban development which integrates information and communication technology\
    \ (ICT) and IoT \nsystems. In this paradigm, continuous connectivity should be\
    \ maintained. CRNs can be a good solution to support this \nrequirement. \nInternet\
    \ of Vehicles (IoV) \n[124] \nToday, the trends toward less dependence on human\
    \ beings have led us to the IoV paradigm in which vehicle control is achieved\
    \ \nthrough the integration of communications and embedded systems. The IoV is\
    \ supposed to be an autonomous travel decision-\nmaker. Safe navigation may be\
    \ possible in the future through vehicle-to-vehicle information exchange, vehicle-mounted\
    \ sensors, \nand user intentions. The challenge in IoVs is the availability of\
    \ spectrum for mobile vehicles. CRNs may be a good solution \nbecause of their\
    \ long-range and interference-free spectrum sensing. \n \n117 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\

    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nAmong the solutions that have been introduced to deal\
    \ with \nenergy efficiency concerns are energy harvesting or scavenging \nand\
    \ Cooperative Wireless Networks. Energy harvesting is \ndefined as the process\
    \ through which energy is extracted from \nexternal sources, such as wind and\
    \ solar energies, and then \nstored so as to be used as a source of power [126].\
    \ Energy \nharvesting is considered as one of the most enabling \ntechnologies\
    \ \nfor \nGreen \nComputing \nand \nreal-world \nimplementation of IoT. In [127]\
    \ a differential game model has \nbeen proposed to resolve the resource allocation\
    \ problem in \ncognitive WSN using energy harvesting. Optimal resource \nallocation\
    \ strategies for all SUs are obtained by determining \nthe loop Nash equilibrium\
    \ and the feedback Nash equilibrium \nsolutions of the proposed model. In [128],\
    \ a CR-based energy \nharvesting approach has been used to extend the batteryâs\
    \ \nlifetime for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under reliability \nand secrecy\
    \ constraints. To reduce energy consumption, the \nenergy harvested is maximized\
    \ and the transmission energy \nconsumption \nis \nminimized \nby \nsolving \n\
    a \nformulated \noptimization problem. \nCurrently, Cognitive Radio networks based\
    \ on energy \nefficiency approaches are considered an important research \ndirection.\
    \ \n3) Security: Addressing security issues in CR-Based IoT \nnetworks is a prime\
    \ concern and a challenging task as most \nIoT objects are inherently heterogeneous\
    \ and have their proper \nuniform security standards. These standards are not\
    \ adequate \nfor all heterogeneous networks. Several privacy and security \naspects\
    \ should be taken into account in designing IoT systems, \nincluding authentication,\
    \ security assurance, and intrusion \nsoft-ware [117]. Worthy efforts have been\
    \ done to tackle \nsecurity issues in some IoT applications with cognitive radio\
    \ \ncapabilities. For instance, the authors of [129] proposed a \ndistributed\
    \ cooperative spectrum sensing approach to deal \nwith the security problem in\
    \ CR-VANETs. This approach uses \na weighted consensus-based spectrum sensing\
    \ technique with \ntrust assistance to ensure the reliability of spectrum sensing\
    \ \noperation in a hostile CR-VANET. The validity of the \nproposed approach was\
    \ approved by extensive simulations. In \n[128], the proposed CR-Based energy\
    \ management scheme for \nUAVs has been designed in such a way that the secrecy\
    \ and \nreliability of the system are ensured. This is illustrated by \nconsidering\
    \ the scenario for the eavesdroppers. \nSecurity remains an open issue to be addressed\
    \ as \ncybersecurity attacks and threats are emerging and increasing \nin parallel\
    \ with new technologies. Therefore, developing \ninnovative countermeasures is\
    \ demanded. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nNowadays, wireless network devices are emerging\
    \ at an \nunprecedented rate, which will further exacerbate spectrum \nshortages.\
    \ Therefore, addressing the spectrum scarcity problem \nbecomes more urgent. Cognitive\
    \ Radio is a promising \ntechnology to overcome this issue for futuristic networks\
    \ (IoT \nand 5G) by enabling an efficient, flexible, and opportunistic \nusage\
    \ of the scarce frequency spectrum. This paper provides a \nreview of Cognitive\
    \ Radio with emphasis is put on SDR, \nspectrum sensing, and CR-Based IoT. Concerning\
    \ SDR, this \narticle highlights its architecture, tools, advantages, and some\
    \ \nof its ongoing challenges. As for spectrum sensing, it is \nextensively reviewed:\
    \ spectrum opportunities considering \nmultiple dimensions are discussed, classification\
    \ of spectrum \nsensing based on several aspects is presented, Narrowband and\
    \ \nWideband sensing techniques are analyzed, ML-based \nspectrum sensing is studied,\
    \ and challenges and open research \ndirections are reviewed. Regarding CR-Based\
    \ IoT, the focus \nwas on explaining the motivations behind the use of CR in IoT\
    \ \nnetworks and reviewing some of the open issues related to CR-\nBased IoT.\

  explanation: The literature review focuses on the use of cognitive radio networks
    to enhance the capabilities of IoT systems, with a particular focus on automated
    irrigation management systems. The review discusses the potential of using cognitive
    radio technology to address issues such as interference and congestion in wireless
    communication networks. The authors propose a novel method for optimizing the
    positions of secondary information gathering stations (SIGSs) and their operating
    channels in IoT sensor networks. This method aims to maximize secondary system
    capacity while guaranteeing an interference threshold for primary users.

    \ the interconnection of diï¬erent objects through the internet using diï¬erent\
    \ communication\ntechnologies. Te objects are equipped with sensors and communications\
    \ modules. Te cognitive radio network is a key technique\nfor the IoT and can\
    \ eï¬ectively address spectrum-related issues for IoT applications. In our paper,\
    \ a novel method for IoT sensor\nnetworks is proposed to obtain the optimal positions\

    \ matrix for secondary IoTdevices (SIDs) to maximize the supportable number of\
    \ SIDs that can\nbe installed in a car, in wearable devices, or for other monitoring\
    \ devices, based on optimal deployment and probability. We derive\nï¬tness functions\
    \ based on the above objectives and also consider signal to interference-plus-noise\
    \ ratio (SINR) and position\nconstraints. Te particle swarm optimization (PSO)\
    \ technique is used to ï¬nd the best position and operating channel for the\nSIGSs.\
    \ In a simulation study, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated and\
    \ compared with a random resources\nallocation algorithm (parts of this paper\
    \ were presented at the ICTC2017 conference (Wen et al., 2017)).\n1. Introduction\n\
    Te Internet of Tings (IoT) is expected to oï¬er advanced\nconnectivity of devices,\
    \ systems, and services that go beyond\nmachine-to-machine communications and\
    \ covers a variety\nof protocols, domains, and applications [1, 2]. It is believed\n\
    that the IoTparadigm will have a strong impact on everyday\nlife in the future\
    \ for assisted living, automation, improved\nlearning, industrial manufacturing,\
    \ logistics, process man-\nagement, intelligent transportation of people/materials,\
    \ real-\ntime monitoring of industrial processes, e-health facilities,\nand more\
    \ [3]. Te IoT has been attracting a great deal of\nattention because of its functions\
    \ to enhance usersâ everyday\nlives and behavior. However, there are still a lot\
    \ of challenges\nfor IoT applications. Te large number of IoT objects also\ncreates\
    \ massive amounts of data in a network; the crux of the\nproblem lies in how to\
    \ solve the problem of interference\nbetween diï¬erent IoTdevices. In addition,\
    \ spectrum scarcity\nis also a big issue. IoTobjects are expected to grow into\
    \ large\nnumbers, and it will be very diï¬cult to allocate spectrum\nbands to all\
    \ these objects [4]. To address the above problems,\nrecent trends in research\
    \ are shifting to cognitive radio\nnetworks (CRNs), viewing them as a potential\
    \ solution for\nIoT applications. Tus, a new paradigm of IoT networks\nbased on\
    \ the cognitive radio (CR) system has been proposed.\nCognitive radio can sense,\
    \ learn, and adapt to the sur-\nrounding environment according to inner and outer\
    \ stimuli.\nGenerally, a cognitive radio network is based on a dynamic\nspectrum\
    \ allocation procedure, and licensed primary users\n(PUs) or unlicensed secondary\
    \ users (SUs) have the right to\nshare the spectrum provided they do not cause\
    \ intense in-\nterference. Te success of the network lies in enhancing\nspectrum\
    \ and resource allocation. As mentioned before, for\nsuch a large number of IoTobjects,\
    \ the current ï¬xed spectrum\nutilization policies cannot satisfy their needs,\
    \ and result in\nineï¬cient spectrum utilization. Besides, the cost-eï¬ectiveness\n\
    Hindawi\nMobile Information Systems\nVolume 2018, Article ID 4721956, 12 pages\n\
    https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/4721956\nissues with spectrum assignment are not\
    \ negligible. Tus,\nCRNs are gaining popularity for addressing these situations.\
    \ In\naddition, it is strongly believed that CR-based IoTframeworks\ncan alleviate\
    \ interference by looking for interference-free\nchannels through a dynamic spectrum\
    \ access capability [5].\nMany researchers have already addressed IoT resource\
    \ allo-\ncation problems by taking advantage of the mentioned\ncharacteristics\
    \ of CRNs. Salameh et al. [6] proposed a prob-\nabilistic spectrum assignment\
    \ algorithm in time-critical IoT-\nbased CRNs under proactive jamming attacks.\
    \ Tey aimed at\nminimizing the packet invalidity ratio of each CR trans-\nmission,\
    \ subject to delay constraints. Shigueta et al. [7] pre-\nsented a strategy for\
    \ channel assignment in IoT networks,\nwhich uses opportunistic spectrum access\
    \ via CR.\nWith the increasing interest in IoT sensor applications\n(e.g., smart\
    \ cities, industrial control, security, and emergencies),\nthe huge number of\
    \ interconnected sensors coupled with the\nincreasing demand and usage of wireless\
    \ spectrum (especially\nin the industrial, scientiï¬c, and medical band) challenges\
    \ the\ndeployment of real-life IoT [8]. Because of CRâs dynamic\nspectrum allocation\
    \ policy, it can provide huge spectrum\nopportunities and improve spectrum utilization\
    \ for IoT sen-\nsors, and this capability provides the possibility of deployment\n\
    for IoTdevices. By applying CR into densely deployed wireless\ndevices (e.g.,\
    \ sensor nodes), the corresponding sensor nodes are\nconsidered SUs. Tey can simultaneously\
    \ transmit data packets\nunder diï¬erent channels and release occupied channels\
    \ to PUs\nthrough a smart handoï¬. Terefore, this technology can reduce\nenergy\
    \ consumption suï¬ciently and greatly improves the ef-\nï¬ciency of transmission.\
    \ Li et al. [9] designed a transmission\nscheduling method in cognitive radio\
    \ sensor networks\n(CRSNs) with minimal occupation of channels and high\ntransmission\
    \ eï¬ciency, aimed at exploring the performance of\nCRSNs in the industrial IoT.\
    \ A new system that improves\nmultichannel IoT network environments and that could\
    \ be an\nexcellent candidate for low-power cognitive IoT sensor net-\nwork applications\
    \ was proposed by Hong et al. [10].\nAs can be clearly seen from the above research,\
    \ either in\nCR-based IoT networks or in IoT sensor networks, a lot of\nresearchers\
    \ fully use CRâs characteristics of dynamic spectrum\nallocation in order to utilize\
    \ the spectrum and resources to the\nmaximum extent possible. In fact, the CRN\
    \ has been widely\nused in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Bakhsh [11] proposed\n\
    an energy-eï¬cient distributed relay selection technique for\nmultihop WSNs. Energy\
    \ consumption was reduced by selecting\na stable relay and power allocation for\
    \ collaboration. Zhu et al.\n[12] proposed a novel channel access scheme for the\
    \ problem of\nhow to access multiple channels without environment in-\nformation\
    \ on the cognitive users. In an IoT sensor network,\nsensors can be viewed as\
    \ SUs, so the problem becomes how to\nallocate spectrum resources to SUs and reduce\
    \ interference\namong them, while taking full advantage of CRN character-\nistics.\
    \ In fact, how to improve resource allocation using a dy-\nnamic allocation policy\
    \ in a CRN has always been a hot research\narea. Yang and Zhao [13] proposed a\
    \ heuristic, robust, relay\nselection scheme and formulated robust power allocation\
    \ as\na semi-inï¬nite program to maximize capacity while ensuring\nthat interference\
    \ with primary users is below a predeï¬ned\ninterference threshold. Tiwari and\
    \ Saha [14] presented a particle\nswarm optimization- (PSO-) based, cochannel\
    \ interference-\nconstrained, eï¬cient, and low-complexity novel spectrum al-\n\
    location scheme with simultaneous power and network ca-\npacity optimization.\
    \ Taking into consideration the energy\nlimitations, many papers have studied\
    \ resource allocation\nschemes aimed at saving energy. For example, Denis et al.\
    \ [15]\ninvestigated the problem of SUsâ energy eï¬ciency maximiza-\ntion under\
    \ secondary total power and primary interference\nconstraints. In CRNs, utilizing\
    \ resources without subjecting\nPUs to harmful interference is a crucial problem;\
    \ this means\nthat any method used to assign the resources must guarantee\nthat\
    \ PU transmissions are always prioritized.\nIn a CR wireless network, due to the\
    \ dynamic spectrum\nallocation procedure, PUs can share the spectrum with SUs;\
    \ in\nthis scenario, the success of the network lies in enhancing\nspectrum and\
    \ resource allocation. Establishing methods that\ncan eï¬ectively assign resources\
    \ while also protecting PU\nperformance in CR networks is a hot topic in this\
    \ research\narea. Chabalala et al. [16] employed a Lagrangian framework to\nreformulate\
    \ the optimization problem and determine the\noptimal channel selection and power\
    \ distribution for SUs.\nBesides, more and more researchers have found that placing\n\
    the base station at an inappropriate location and/or selecting\nan incorrect channel\
    \ will increase the interference and directly\nminimize the quality of service\
    \ (QoS). Some papers have\ndiscussed minimizing power consumption by obtaining\
    \ op-\ntimal base station positions [17, 18]. Unlike previous in-\nvestigations\
    \ that accounted for positions of base stations in\norder to regulate interference,\
    \ focusing on interference\nmanagement among SUs and PUs can also play a key role\
    \ in\nresource allocation. Te positions of SUs and channel allo-\ncation in CR\
    \ systems have received a great deal of attention\nrecently. Xue et al. [19] presented\
    \ a general resource-allocation\nframework that optimizes power and channel allocation\
    \ for\nSUs; this depended on SUs being aware of their location. Tan\net al. [20]\
    \ proposed a scheduling algorithm to improve the\npriority of SUs for which bandwidths\
    \ are restricted by posi-\ntion. Ozcan and Gursoy [21] investigated channel selection\n\
    based on the lowest channel gain or the highest data channel\ngain. Khan and Yoo\
    \ [22] proposed a dynamic interference\ncontrol in OFDM-based cognitive radio\
    \ network using GA.\nEï¬ective resource allocation should satisfy the diï¬erent\n\
    QoS requirements of multiple PUs and SUs without inter-\nrupting higher priority\
    \ transmissions in a CR network, re-\ngardless of power, channel spectrum, PU/SU\
    \ or base station\nposition allocation. However, little attention has been paid\
    \ to\nmethods that combine base station positioning with channel\nselection. In\
    \ fact, these two factors directly impact the overall\ninterference and performance\
    \ of a system. While placing the\nbase stations or selecting the operating channel\
    \ randomly, the\nsubsequent interference among them will increase. Addi-\ntionally,\
    \ in a wireless sensor network (WSN), the base station\nlocation is closely related\
    \ to the lifetime of the sensor network.\nIn our paper, our method derives the\
    \ optimal locations\nof secondary information gathering stations (SIGSs) and\n\
    their operating channels and can be used in IoT sensor\nnetworks, which, to the\
    \ best of our knowledge, has not been\nstudied in the literature. We also consider\
    \ the appearance\nprobability of secondary IoT devices (SIDs) that can be\n2\n\
    Mobile Information Systems\ninstalled in cars, in wearable devices or for other\
    \ monitoring\ndevices. Tis work aims to maximize the secondary IoT\nsystem capacity\
    \ while also guaranteeing an interference\nthreshold for primary users, subject\
    \ to signal to interference-\nplus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, while maximizing\
    \ the\nsupportable number of SIDs. Te contributions of our\nproposed scheme can\
    \ be summarized as follows:\n(1) We propose a scheme that combines optimal posi-\n\
    tioning of the SIGSs with selection of the optimal\nchannel, which has not been\
    \ studied in the literature.\nTis method can improve spectrum utilization and\n\
    maximize system throughout, fundamentally en-\nhancing total system performance.\
    \ Additionally, the\nscheme can be used for IoT sensor networks.\n(2) We propose\
    \ an appearance probability for the SIDs\nthat may be installed in cars and in\
    \ wearable devices\nor for other monitoring devices. Tis can facilitate\nanalysis\
    \ and reduce the complexity of the problem.\nAt the same time, our method can\
    \ also maximize the\nnumber of SIDs in service based on the probability.\n(3)\
    \ We use a PSO algorithm to ï¬nd the optimal positions\nfor SIGSs and the operating\
    \ channel; this has rela-\ntively low complexity and can eï¬ectively address\n\
    problems.\nTe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section\n2, the system\
    \ model is described. In Section 3, the proposed\noptimal positions of the SIGSs\
    \ and the operating channel\nselection mechanism for IoT sensor networks are presented.\n\
    In Section 4, the PSO algorithm used to determine the\noptimal SIGS locations\
    \ and channel selection is explained. In\nSection 5, the performance of the proposed\
    \ method is\nevaluated and compared with the results of a random dis-\ntribution\
    \ case. Finally, Section 6 provides our conclusions.\n2. System Model\nTis paper\
    \ considers a scenario where multiple primary links\nand primary base station\
    \ (PBS) are receiving signals from\nPUs on the uplink channel, and SIDs are communicating\n\
    with SIGSs using primary uplink channels. In our scenario,\nwe do not know the\
    \ positions of the PUs, so we consider\nuplink channels for primary systems. We\
    \ also assume that\nsecondary systems already have information about the PBS\n\
    locations and the operating channel. In addition, they will\nuse the primary systemsâ\
    \ uplink channels. In our model,\nSIDs have information about the interference\
    \ they cause on\nthe primary systems, and they can directly access a part of\n\
    the licensed spectrum as long as the interference is below\na predeï¬ned threshold.\n\
    As shown in Figure 1, PBSs will receive interference\nfrom SIDs, SIGSs, and other\
    \ primary systems (including\nPBSs and PUs that use the same channel as the PBS).\
    \ In\nFigure 1, the black line denotes the interference suï¬ered by\nthe PBS. PUs\
    \ will receive interference from SIDs, SIGSs, and\nother primary systems that\
    \ use the same channel. Te dotted\nblack line in Figure 1 shows the interference\
    \ received by\na PU. Concerning the secondary systems, SIDs will receive\ninterference\
    \ from PBSs and PUs, as well as other secondary\nsystems (including SIGSs and\
    \ SIDs that use the same\nchannel as the initial SIDs). Similarly, SIGSs will\
    \ receive\ninterference from other SIGSs, SIDs, PBSs, and PUs that\nshare the\
    \ same channel.\nHowever, in our model, we ignore the interference from\nprimary\
    \ systems and assume that they are well controlled by\nthe primary operator; instead,\
    \ we are interested in the in-\nterference suï¬ered by SIDs and PBSs. Before determining\n\
    the SIGS positions and the matched channel, we assume that\nsecondary systems\
    \ have information about the PBS positions\nand operating channel. Every base\
    \ station has its own\ncoverage range, which is calculated by the Friis transmission\n\
    equation; this will be explained in detail in the next section.\n3. Optimal Position\
    \ of the Secondary Base\nStation and the Operating Channel Selection\nMechanism\
    \ for IoT Sensor Networks\nAs shown in Figure 2, we divide the whole space into\
    \ small\nequally sized boxes with a numeral in every unit area, which\nranges\
    \ from 0 to 1; this stands for the probability of SID\nappearance in this unit\
    \ area. We assume that no more than\none SID can exist in each unit site. We assume\
    \ that the SID\nPrimary base\nstation (PBS)\nPBS received\ninterference\nPrimary\
    \ user\nPU received\ninterference\nSecondary\nloT sensor\ndevice (SID)\nSID received\n\
    interference\nSecondary IoT\ninformation\ngathering base\nstation (SIGS)\nSIGS\
    \ received\ninterference\nFigure 1: System model.\nMobile Information Systems\n\
    3\nappearance probability at each unit area is known before\ndeploying the SIGS,\
    \ and the probabilities in every unit area\nare independent of each other.\nEvery\
    \ SIGS has its own coverage range, which is cal-\nculated by the Friis transmission\
    \ equation:\nPr\nPt\n\x1F GtGr\nÎ»\n\x1F4Ïd\n\x1E\n2\n,\n(1)\nwhere Pr is the receiving\
    \ power available on input at the\nreceiving antenna; Pt is the output power to\
    \ the transmitting\nantenna; Gt and Gr are antenna gains of the transmitting and\n\
    receiving antennas, respectively; Î» is the wavelength; and d is\nthe distance\
    \ between the transmitting and receiving antennas.\nWe need to obtain R, which\
    \ is the radius of the base stationâs\ncoverage. Tis can be derived by rearranging\
    \ (1):\nR \x1F Î»\n4Ï\n\x1D\x1D\x1D\x1D\x1D\x1D\nPtGtGr\nPmin\nr\n\x1C\n,\n(2)\n\
    where Pmin\nr\nis the minimum decodable receiving power.\nEvery base station has\
    \ its own coverage radius, which is\nreferred to as its service range. From (2),\
    \ it is clear that the\nradius of the coverage range depends on the transmitter\n\
    power when the other factors are fxed; thus, if the transmitter\npower of SIGSs\
    \ and PBSs are fxed, we can assume that every\nSIGS has the same coverage range\
    \ in the same way that every\nPBS has the same coverage range. However, it is\
    \ difcult to\navoid the situation where some SIGSs cover the same area.\nTis means\
    \ that there will be some inevitable overlap between\nthe service ranges of SIGSs.\
    \ For this situation, we put forward\na policy that can efectively solve this\
    \ kind of problem.\nFigure 3 shows the situation where the coverage areas of\n\
    SIGSs overlap. It is clear that SIGS1 and SIGS2 have the same\nuser in their service\
    \ area: SID1. To determine which SIGS\nwill be selected to communicate with SID1,\
    \ two factors will\ninfuence the result: one depends on distance and the other\n\
    on the ID number. For example, if the distance between\nSIGS1 and SID1, referred\
    \ to as D11, is greater than the\ndistance from SIGS2 to SID1 (D21), then SID1\
    \ will choose\nSIGS1 for communication. When D11 is equal to D21, the\nselection\
    \ will be based on the ID number; here, SID1 will\nconnect to SIGS1 because its\
    \ ID is 1.\nTe performance objectives of the CR system are de-\nscribed in terms\
    \ of ftness function or objective function. Te\nresults should consider the balance\
    \ between the ftness and\nobjective functions to meet the QoS requirement while\n\
    enhancing system performance. Te ftness functions are\napplied to fnd the optimal\
    \ solution in the defned search\nspace. We assume that signal propagation is dominated\
    \ by\npath loss efects. Table 1 shows the summary of notations\nused in this paper.\n\
    As mentioned in Section 2, signifcant interference exists\nin CR systems. Since\
    \ secondary systems only use the uplink\nchannel of the primary system, we will\
    \ consider the in-\nterference that PBS and SIDs will sufer. We can calculate\
    \ the\naverage SINR at the ith unit area (SID) on the jth channel\nbelonging to\
    \ the kth SIGS as given in (3).\nS_ESINRj\nk,i \x1F\nPsb hj\n\e\e\e\e\e k,i\n\e\

    Part A of (3) is the average interference from PUs, and\npart\nof (3) represents\
    \ the average interference from other\nsecondary systems that use the jth channel.\

    \ secondary user\nshould satisfy the primary and SID SINR thresholds, re-\nspectively.\
    \ Additionally, in order to protect primary sys-\ntems, if (12) cannot be satisï¬ed,\
    \ the distributional plan for\nthe SIGSs and operating channel selection should\
    \ be\ndiscarded.\n4. Optimal Location and Operating Channel\nSelection of a Secondary\
    \ Information\nGathering Base Station Using Particle\nSwarm Optimization\nIn this\
    \ work, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algo-\nrithm is invoked to obtain\
    \ an optimized solution; this\nachieves our multiple objectives. PSO is a population-based,\n\
    stochastic optimization technique that is modelled after the\nï¬ocking and swarming\
    \ behavior in birds and animals. In\nPSO, the potential solutions are called particles,\
    \ and these\ncandidate solutions are referred to as swarms of particles.\nEach\
    \ of these is characterized by its position and velocity\nbased on its own best\
    \ value (pbest), as well as the best value\nin the whole search space (gbest).\
    \ Ten, every particle ad-\njusts its value (position) toward its pbest and gbest\
    \ at each\niteration. Tis movement is governed by the following\nequations:\n\
    V(t + 1) \x88 wV(t) + C1r1(pbest â X(t))\n+ C2r2(gbest â X(t)),\n(13)\nX(t + 1)\
    \ \x88 X(t) + V(t + 1),\n(14)\nwhere w is the weight inertia; C1 and C2 are the\
    \ learning\nfactors that determines the relative inï¬uence of cognitive\nand social\
    \ component, respectively, in search space; and\nr1 and r2\nare\ntwo\nindependently\n\
    generated\nrandom\nnumbers from [0, 1]; and X(t) and V(t) are the position\nand\
    \ velocity of t second particles, respectively. Te ob-\njective functions described\
    \ in the previous section are\nthen used in the ï¬tness function and optimized\
    \ by the PSO\nalgorithm. For each iteration, every particle is evaluated\nand\
    \ compared with the values of pbest and gbest, and\nevery particle updates its\
    \ velocity and position based on\nthe above equations until a termination condition\
    \ is\nreached.\nFigure 5 shows the particle structure in the proposed\nalgorithm,\
    \ including the SIGS position and operating\nchannel. Te range of the search space\
    \ is composed of two\nparts: the ranges of position and the channel. Each particle\n\
    should search within this range in every iteration. If we\ndivide the total area\
    \ into N Ã N unit areas and set the\nchannel number to n, then the range of the\
    \ search space for\nthe ï¬rst particle component is from 1 to N Ã N, and the\n\
    second particle component search space is 1, 2, . . . , n\n{\n}. As\nFigure 6\
    \ shows, the practical implementation of classical\nPSO mainly involves the following\
    \ steps. (1) Parameter\ninitialization: initialize all required particle positions\
    \ and\nvelocities randomly, and then deï¬ne the range, number of\nparticles, and\
    \ population size. (2) Evaluate the desired\nobjective function of each particle.\
    \ (3) Compare each\nparticleâs current ï¬tness value with the previous pbest; if\n\
    this value is greater than the previous one, set the pbest\nvalue to the current\
    \ value. (4) Determine gbest of the\nswarm from the total pbest value. (5) Update\

    \ we evaluate the performance of the pro-\nposed SIGS location and operating channel\
    \ selection al-\ngorithm. Simulations were carried out using MATLAB\nsoftware.\
    \ Te best results of the optimal topology of SIGS\npositions and the matched channel\
    \ that were found via PSO\nare shown. In addition, the capacities of the primary\
    \ and\nsecondary systems, the supportable number of SIDs, and\nthe average result\
    \ of the ï¬tness functions for multiple\ntopologies are all compared with the result\
    \ of a random\ntopology. Te parameters used for simulations are given in\nTable\
    \ 2. Gt and Gr are both equal to 1 dBi, and the frequency\nis 10 GHz.\nIn the\
    \ proposed method, which uses the PSO algorithm\nto ï¬nd the best topology for\
    \ the location of SIGSs and\nmatched channel, each candidate solution is referred\
    \ to as a\nswarm of particles. We then divide the total area into 50 Ã 50\nunit\
    \ areas, so the ï¬rst particleâs (i.e., the position of SIGSs)\nrange is from 1\
    \ to N Ã N. Here, the range is from 1 to 2500;\nevery number stands for a position\
    \ and will be mapped to the\ncorresponding coordinates. We set ï¬ve channels, and\
    \ the\nselection space is C \x88 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n{\n}. Tis means that the\nsecond\
    \ particle (i.e., the channel) only has ï¬ve cases from C.\nFrom Table 2, we can\
    \ see that the topology is created by 10\nsecondary systems and 5 primary systems\
    \ that share ï¬ve\nchannels, which are generated in cell areas with radii of\n\
    Rs \x88 40 m and Rp \x88 130 m, respectively. Te transmitting\npower of the secondary\
    \ systems is set to 0.2 W, and the PU\ntransmitter power is 2 W [23]. Te population\
    \ size in PSO is\n70, the weight inertia is 0.99, and the learning factors of\
    \ c1, c2\nis 2. We set that SID SINR threshold is 10 dB and PBS SINR\nthreshold\
    \ is 5 dB [24]. Figure 7 shows the multiple objective\nresults that were determined\

    \ 1: Te proposed PSO-based resource allocation algorithm.\nMobile Information\
    \ Systems\n7\nTe fgure shows that PSO found the best result after around\n650\
    \ iterations.\nFigure 8 show the optimal topology for the optimal SIGS\nlocations\
    \ and matched channels. As mentioned in Section 2,\nthe secondary systems already\
    \ have the positions of the PBS\nand the operating channels before they are distributed;\n\
    therefore, we fxed the PBS positions and operating channels\nin the simulation.\
    \ Te red color stands for the PBS position,\nand blue represents the SIGS. We\
    \ obtained a result after 1000\niterations using PSO. As can be seen from the\
    \ fgures, each\nsmall box has four unit areas. In our model, we assumed that\n\
    each base station is located in the center of the unit site, and\nwe obtain the\
    \ base stationâs coordinates by combining its\nlocations of x and y axes. Because\
    \ the PBS service range is\nbigger than that of the SIGS, the optimal deployment\
    \ of the\nSIGS position and channel selection should consider\nthe interference\
    \ experienced by the PBS and should protect\nthe PBS as much as possible. Additionally,\
    \ other factors\nshould be taken into account to decrease the interference\namong\
    \ SIGSs and maximize the supportable number of SIDs.\nWe set PBS positions to\
    \ possibly cover most of the entire\narea, and each PBS uses a diferent channel\
    \ in an attempt to\ndecrease interference among primary systems. Additionally,\n\
    channel gain is related to the distances between base stations\nand users so that\
    \ SIGSs that share the same channel with the\nPBS should consider the distances\
    \ between SIGS and PBS.\nFor example, if the PBS is using channel 5, and other\
    \ SIGSs\nwant to share this channel, they must be far from the PBS in\norder to\
    \ avoid causing intense interference to the PBS.\nTerefore, they are deployed\
    \ at locations that are farthest\nfrom this PBS. Te same situation also needs\
    \ to be con-\nsidered among SIGSs that use the same channel.\nIn order to verify\
    \ that our scheme is efective, we\ncompared our proposed algorithm to a random\
    \ resource\nallocation (RRA) algorithm. In the RRA algorithm, each\nSIGS is randomly\
    \ distributed in the area, and the oper-\nating channel is randomly selected without\
    \ considering\nneighboring PBSs or SIGSs; however, it still needs to\n2\n(Ã1010)\n\

    \ protect\nprimary system. It is worth noting that the appearance\nprobability\
    \ matrix for SIDs should be the same, regardless\nof whether the RRA algorithm\
    \ or the proposed algorithm\nis used. From Figure 7, we can see that PSO found\
    \ the\noptimal result after around 650 iterations. For the RRA\nalgorithm, in\
    \ order to ensure fairness, we also set 650\ncirculations and used the same topology\
    \ as the PBS. After\neach loop, we recorded related data, and then found the\n\
    best result of the multiple-objectives function from all of\nthe recorded results.\
    \ We also recorded the best capacity\nand greatest number of supportable SIDs\
    \ in order to\ncompare them with our algorithm. Figure 9 shows the best\ntopologies\
    \ of the SIGS locations and matched channel for\nthe RRA algorithm.\nDue to the\
    \ fact that the RRA algorithm distributes the\nSIGS positions and the operating\
    \ channel randomly (it is\nonly concerned with satisfying the SINR threshold for\
    \ the\nPBS), some SIGSs can be allocated near the SIGSs or the\nPBSs that use\
    \ the same channel, as shown in Figure 9. Tis\ncauses severe interference between\
    \ SIGSs. In Figure 9, we\ncan see that the positions of SIGSs are more centralized\
    \ than\nthe optimal deployment in Figure 8. Figure 9 shows the\ntopology of the\
    \ best result from all of the recorded results\nafter 650 iterations. To compare\
    \ the two methods in detail,\nwe also compared the capacity, supportable number\
    \ of SIDs,\nand topologies.\nFigure 10(a) shows the eï¬ect of diï¬erent number of\n\
    particles on multiobjectives result. In the PSO algorithm,\npopulation size can\
    \ aï¬ect the speed and optimal value of the\nsearch results. In this experiment,\
    \ we set diï¬erent population\nsizes and concentrate on exploring their inï¬uence\
    \ on results.\nAs we can see, the multiobjectives result calculated by PSO\nbecomes\
    \ larger when we increase the population size. Figure\n10(b) shows the eï¬ect of\
    \ diï¬erent number of SIGSs on\nmultiobjectives result. In this experiment, we\
    \ change the\nnumber\nof\nSIGSs\nbut\nï¬x\nthe\nnumber\nof\nchannels\n(i.e., number\
    \ of channels \x88 5) and population size (\x8870). Te\nmultiobjectives result\
    \ keeps increasing when the number of\nSIGSs increases. Because when we increase\
    \ SIGSs, the sec-\nondary throughput and the supportable number of SIDs are\n\
    also increasing. It should be noted that the increasing slope is\nnot linear because\
    \ the more SIGSs results in possible col-\nlisions between SIGSs to share channels.\
    \ Figure 10(c) shows\nthe eï¬ect on diï¬erent number of channels on multiobjectives\n\
    result. It is shown that multiobjectives result is increasing\nwhile increasing\
    \ the number of channels because increasing\nthe number of channels expands the\
    \ available channel select\nrange and also reduces the interference with PBSs\
    \ and other\nSIGSs. It should be also noted that when the number of\nchannels\
    \ is larger than 5, most of SIGS systems already\nutilized available channels\
    \ successfully so that even though\nwe increase the number of channels, the performance\
    \ is\nsaturated.\nFigure 11 presents the capacity comparison between our\nalgorithm\
    \ and the RRA algorithm. Te red lines stand for the\ncapacity of the primary systems,\
    \ reï¬ected on the right y-axis.\nTe steady, dashed red line is the PBS capacity\
    \ from the best\nresult of the RRA algorithm, which we previously recorded.\n\
    From this ï¬gure, we see that the primary systemâs capacity\nincreased by 26%,\
    \ compared with the RRA algorithm,\nwhereas the secondary systemâs capacity increased\
    \ by 43%.\nIn Figure 11, we can see that the capacity of PBSs (red solid\nline)\
    \ decreased from the 200th to 250th iterations. In\ngeneral, the capacity should\
    \ always increase in our algo-\nrithm, but our multiple-objectives ï¬tness function\
    \ is com-\nposed of two parts, as shown in (10). One part is the total\ncapacity\
    \ (including the secondary and primary capacities),\nand the other is the supportable\
    \ number of SIDs. Because the\nsecondary capacity is always greater than that\
    \ of the PBSs\n(because the number of SIGSs is 10, while there are ï¬ve\nPBSs),\
    \ we can say that the main factor that inï¬uences the\nwhole capacity function\
    \ is the secondary capacity. Tus, it is\npossible that the whole capacity result\
    \ still keeps increasing,\n1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 29 31 33 35 37\

    \ this situation also satisfes our requirements and\nachieves the goal.\nIn Figure\
    \ 12, the supportable number of SIDs is com-\npared. Similarly, the dashed line\
    \ that remains steady is the\nresult corresponding to the highest number of supportable\n\
    SIDs for the RRA algorithm, while the other solid line shows\nthe result from\

    10\nMobile Information Systems\nï¬ve, and we execute 20 topologies, we need to\
    \ change the\nPBS positions and SID appearance probability matrix 20\ntimes. We\
    \ can use our algorithm to ï¬nd the optimal results\nfor total capacity and the\
    \ number of supportable users for\neach topology. Tey are added together, and\
    \ the results are\naveraged. Next, when the number of SIGSs is changed, the 20\n\
    topologies and SID appearance probability matrix should be\nkept the same with\
    \ last time, in order to allow for a better\ncomparison. We analyzed the same\
    \ topologies with the RRA\nalgorithm, and then obtained results and averaged our\n\
    ï¬ndings after changing the topology 20 times. Next time\nwhen the number of SIGS\
    \ changed, we executed the same\nsteps. However, for RRA algorithm, we do not\
    \ need to\ncirculate and ï¬nd the best one this time because we only\nneed the\
    \ average results.\nFor this comparison, we looked at multiple topologies\nwhere\
    \ the number of SIGSs was 5, 7, 9, and 11. As mentioned\nbefore, for each time,\
    \ we changed the PBS positions and SID\nappearance probability 20 times. We then\
    \ obtained the av-\nerage results while performing the same steps using the RRA\n\
    algorithm. In Figure 13, we can see that the average ï¬tness\nresults continue\
    \ to increase as more SIGSs are added, re-\ngardless of the algorithm used. However,\
    \ it is clear that our\nalgorithmâs result has higher growth than the RRA algorithm.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we proposed a distributed scheme that de-\ntermines\
    \ the optimal location and operating channel of\nSIGSs to manage the interference\
    \ and the resource allocation\nin cognitive radio networks for IoT sensor networks.\
    \ Te\nproposed algorithm can maximize the secondary systemâs\ncapacity while guaranteeing\
    \ primary systemâs required\nperformance. Meanwhile, it maximizes the supportable\n\
    number of SIDs based on the proposed probability of\nSID appearance. In addition,\
    \ the distributed scheme has\nlower complexity and fundamentally improves total\
    \ system\nperformance. Te simulation results show that the proposed\nalgorithm\
    \ works well to achieve our multiple objectives.\nFurthermore, when compared with\
    \ the RRA algorithm, the\nproposed algorithm is always at least 20% better, whether\
    \ it\nis about the secondary capacity or the number of supportable\nSIDs. Additionally,\
    \ our algorithm showed better eï¬ciency\nthrough the last comparison, which compared\
    \ the average\nresults in multiple topologies.\nConflicts of Interest\nTe authors\

    Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected objects,
    in which every object in the world seeks to communicate and exchange information
    actively. This exponential growth of interconnected objects increases the demand
    for wireless spectrum. However, providing wireless channel access to every communicating
    object while ensuring its guaranteed quality of service (QoS) requirements is
    challenging and has not yet been explored, especially for IoT-enabled mission-critical
    applications and services. Meanwhile, Cognitive Radio-enabled Internet of Things
    (CR-IoT) is an emerging field that is considered the future of IoT. The combination
    of CR technology and IoT can better handle the increasing demands of various applications
    such as manufacturing, logistics, retail, environment, public safety, healthcare,
    food, and drugs. However, due to the limited and dynamic resource availability,
    CR-IoT cannot accommodate all types of users. In this paper, we first examine
    the availability of a licensed channel on the basis of its primary users'' activities
    (e.g., traffic patterns). Second, we propose a priority-based secondary user (SU)
    call admission and channel allocation scheme, which is further based on a priority-based
    dynamic channel reservation scheme. The objective of our study is to reduce the
    blocking probability of higher-priority SU calls while maintaining a sufficient
    level of channel utilization. The arrival rates of SU calls of all priority classes
    are estimated using a Markov chain model, and further channels for each priority
    class are reserved based on this analysis. We compare the performance of the proposed
    scheme with the greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes in terms of the
    SU call-blocking probability, SU call-dropping probability, channel utilization,
    and throughput. Numerical results show that the proposed priority scheme outperforms
    the greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes. Published in: IEEE Transactions

    In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a new computing paradigm,
    in which heterogeneous devices with interesting services and applications are
    connecting to each other at an unprecedented rate [1]. These applications include
    patient monitoring, real-time health status, remote personnel monitoring, cardiac
    monitors, surveillance cameras, disaster management, response planning, resource
    management and distribution, real-time traffic monitoring, smartphones, utility
    meters, kitchen appliances, televisions, cars, thermostats, industry monitoring,
    noise monitoring, air pollution, waterways, banking, security, and almost anything
    imaginable [2], [3]. According to Gartner research findings, by 2020 approximately
    63 million of IoT devices will connect to the enterprise networks per second [4].
    McKinsey predicted that IoT has great potential for creating a large economic
    impact of 2.7â6.2 trillion dollars annually by 2025 [5]. Thus, in accordance with
    these statistics, it is expected that in the next decade Cisco will make approximately
    14.4 trillion dollars profits from IoT projects worldwide [6]. Similarly, GSMA
    predicted approximately 1.3 trillion dollars profit for mobile network operators
    from the IoT industry [3]. However, accommodating exponentially increasing new
    applications and services over limited available spectrum band poses new communications
    challenges [7]. Due to recent advancements in cognitive radio networks (CRN) and
    IoT, it has been visualized that the junction of cognitive radio (CR) and IoT
    will become the vital need of future communications. IoT devices would be equipped
    with CR technology to enable them to think, learn, and make decisions via awareness
    of both physical and social environments. Additional specifications include the
    perception action cycle, intelligent decision making, semantic derivation, on-demand
    service provisioning, knowledge discovery, and massive data analytics. According
    to Khan and Rehmani, all versions of IoT (e.g., Internet-oriented, semantic-oriented,
    and things-oriented) are insignificant without the CR facility [8], [9]. Hence,
    CR technology has emerged as a key enabling technology for IoT. Since the beginning
    of spectrum regulation, static and fixed spectrum allocation schemes have been
    adopted to allocate wireless spectrum bands. However, statistics prove that most
    of the allotted wireless resources remain unused most of the time all around the
    world [10]. Therefore, if the free slot/white space of already-allocated spectrum
    bands can be used opportunistically, the spectrum scarcity issue can be resolved,
    and new emerging IoT services and applications can be accommodated [11]. CR technology
    has emerged as a promising technique that identifies and utilizes spectrum opportunities
    opportunistically. In CR-enabled IoT networks, two types of spectrum users exist:
    1) primary users (PUs) or legitimate users, who actually own the spectrum bands
    and have exclusive rights to use them for specific wireless applications, and
    2) secondary users (SUs) or CR-empowered IoT users, who identify spectrum opportunities
    and utilize them. Why do we Need Differentiated Priority for Multi-Class Traffic?
    The recent trends in IoT communication systems have introduced a variety of IoT
    services and applications. Hence, it is a challenging task to allocate the wireless
    spectrum to the enormous number of CR-IoT users [8], [9]. However, among a variety
    of IoT services and applications, a few classes of traffic (e.g., traffic related
    to disaster management, response planning, banking, healthcare, and security)
    are more important than others. However, if all the SU calls are considered equal
    in priority under a heavy traffic load and dynamic channel availability, then
    a high blocking rate of more important SU calls occurs, resulting in low performance
    for CR-IoT networks. Therefore, the priorities of all the traffic classes are
    not considered to be equal due to their corresponding traffic profile and quality
    of service (QoS) requirements. Moreover, important traffic classes should be given
    higher-priority than other traffic classes. Hence, it is preferable to block the
    low-priority traffic calls rather than high-priority traffic calls under dynamic
    resource availability and high-traffic-load scenarios. What are the Challenges
    to Enable Differentiated Priority in Multi-Class CR-IoT Networks? With a high
    traffic load of diverse IoT services and applications, because the number of available
    resources is limited in CR-IoT networks (e.g., licensed channels), there are two
    challenges to enable differentiated priority for SUsâ multi-class traffic: 1)
    First, how to design an efficient call admission control scheme that ensures low-blocking
    probability to high-priority traffic? 2) How to combine the priority-differentiated
    admission control with a channel allocation scheme without sacrificing the channel
    utilization? Our Contributions. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we introduce
    a priority-based call admission and channel allocation scheme using traffic-aware
    dynamic channel reservation to lower the higher-priority SU call-blocking probability
    with efficient channel utilization. To ensure guaranteed SU transmissions, we
    estimated licensed channels using two important factors: 1) PU idle probability
    during SU transmission and 2) receipt of ACK at the transmitter SU. The SU calls
    are classified into multi-priority classes. We allocate channels from the pool
    of available channels to a particular prioritized SU based on the call arrival
    rate of specific types of SU requests, which changes with the variation in arriving
    requests. The number of allocated channels from the pool of available channels
    for each priority class is computed based on the traffic arrival rate estimation,
    which is based on queuing analysis and the Markov chain model. Our main contributions
    are summarized below. First, we propose a priority-based traffic-aware dynamic
    channel reservation scheme using queuing analysis and estimation of SU arrival
    rates of all priority classes. Second, we propose a priority-based SU call admission
    and channel allocation scheme, which is further based on a dynamic channel reservation
    scheme for lowering the higher-priority SUs call-blocking probabilities while
    maintaining a sufficient level of channel utilization. Third, we analyze the performance
    of the proposed scheme and compared it with other proposed greedy non-priority
    and fair proportion schemes. The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated
    in terms of the SU call-dropping probability, SU call-blocking probability, channel
    utilization, and throughput. The rest of the article is organized as follows.
    In Section 2, we discuss the existing state of the art. Then, we present the system
    model including the traffic and primary channel selection models in Section 3.
    In Section 4, we describe the proposed priority-based dynamic channel reservation
    scheme, which further based on queuing analysis and SU call arrival rate estimation.
    In Section 5, we present the proposed priority-based SU call admission and channel
    allocation scheme that is based on a priority-based dynamic channel reservation
    method. In Section 6, we present the performance evaluation. Finally, we propose
    some applications of our proposed scheme and conclude the paper in Sections 7
    and 8, respectively. SECTION 2 Related Work Among a variety of IoT services and
    applications, a few classes are critical and more important than others. Therefore,
    these important traffic classes should be given higher-priority than other traffic
    classes while allocating channel resources. Hence, it is preferable to block the
    low-priority traffic calls rather than high-priority traffic calls under dynamic
    resource availability and high-traffic-load scenarios. Hence, the issue of dynamic
    spectrum allocation and call admission control for heterogeneous IoT services
    and applications in accordance with their traffic profiles in cellular CR-IoT
    networks is an important research topic. In the following, we discuss the existing
    state of the art on dynamic channel allocation and call admission control techniques
    in CR-IoT, and conventional CRNs in brief. In [12], the authors proposed an âenergy-centered
    and QoS-aware service selection algorithm (WQSA)â for IoT applications. In the
    WQSA scheme, QoS satisfaction for IoT applications is ensured by using a lexicographic
    optimization technique. Moreover, to reduce energy consumption, the best service
    is selected from the set of services based on QoS attributes, such as the user''s
    preference and energy profile. Similarly, a unifying architecture for energy-efficient
    scheduling and optimization for IoT-based smart cities was presented in [13].
    The authors proposed a new energy-harvesting-based framework for increasing the
    lifetime of IoT-based low-power devices. In [14], another wireless energy harvesting
    scheme was proposed for CR-IoT. In the proposed scheme, CR-IoT devices sense the
    licensed spectrum before using it and also harvest the wireless energy transmitted
    by the nearby access point (AP). The main objective of the study was to optimize
    the energy efficiency on the basis of parameters, such as PU interference, energy
    causality, data rate fairness, and buffer occupancy of IoT devices. In [15], Debroy
    et al. proposed a multi-hop routing technique called âSpEED-IoT: Spectrum aware
    Energy-Efficient multi-hop multi-channel routing scheme for D2D communication
    in IoT mesh network.â The proposed scheme finds the best routing path, optimizes
    transmission power, and selects the best available channel for each hop by using
    the radio environment map. In order to improve the throughput and to optimize
    the energy for CR-IoT, Qureshi et al. used the concept of reliable channel selection
    [16]. The reliability of licensed channels is measured, and channels are ranked
    based on free/used time tracking method proposed in [17]. In [18], Zhu et al.
    proposed a Q-learning algorithm by using deep learning technique for improving
    the throughput of cooperative CR-IoT networks. The authors used the âMarkov decision
    process (MDP)â model to formulate the packet transmission strategy from various
    CR-IoT devices under multi-channel CR environment. Another solution to increase
    the end-to-end throughput for multi-hop CR-IoT was proposed in [19]. In the proposed
    scheme, a concurrent transmission model was introduced, in which a link channel
    allocation problem was formulated with the help of a genetic algorithm. Similarly,
    in [20], Salameh et al. proposed a probabilistic channel allocation scheme to
    maximize packet transmission rate for CR-IoT networks under reactive and proactive
    jamming attacks. The proposed scheme selects the secure licensed channel for delay-sensitive
    IoT device based on the channel fading conditions and information on PU activities.
    In order to improve QoS degradation for IoT networks an autonomic QoS-aware middleware
    was introduced in [21]. In [22], an adaptive and QoS-aware architecture was introduced
    for wireless sensors networks based IoT by using a modular approach. This architecture
    helps in implementing QoS models for various IoT applications by using historical
    data captured in physical network. In [23], C. S. Shih et al. proposed a QoS-aware
    meta-routing protocol for cyber physical system-based IoT applications. The proposed
    routing scheme determines the best routing paths for IoT applications based on
    QoS parameters, such as reliability and timeliness. Moreover, node mobility and
    link failure parameters were also considered to ensure the better quality of transmissions.
    In order to optimize energy cost, a âdiscontinuous reception/transmission (DRX/DTX)â
    scheme for IoT applications was proposed in [24]. This scheme studied various
    sleeping patterns for IoT devices to save energy while ensuring QoS in terms of
    the packet delay, bit rate, and packet loss rate. Several prior research efforts
    [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33] deal with different schemes
    for call admission control (CAC) and channel allocation while guaranteeing QoS
    to SUs. An auction-based SU admission control and channel allocation scheme for
    CRN-based hotspots has been studied in [25]. Spectral resources for different
    SUs have been allocated according to their advertised pricing policy. In [26],
    Alshamrani et al. studied the channel assignment and CAC scheme for two different
    types of SUs: 1) non real-time, and 2) real-time. In the proposed scheme, first,
    the licensed channels are sensed based on the statistical information and then
    detected idle channels are assigned to both types of SUs for maintaining QoS between
    them in terms of call dropping and call blocking probabilities. In [27], He et
    al. proposed a channel assignment method with prime objective to maximize the
    overall user satisfaction by considering various types of SU''s applications and
    services. In [28], Tran et al. introduced an auction theory-based spectrum allocation
    scheme for delay-sensitive SUs. Li et al. investigated the impact of dynamic channel
    availability on smooth video delivery under the CRN environment [29]. The authors
    primarily focused on channel allocation optimization while minimizing playback
    frozen probability. Moreover, they used the receiving buffer state information
    for analyzing the video quality. In [30], a spectrum access regulatory framework
    was proposed to regulate wireless spectrum access among SUs based on time slotted
    medium access control (MAC) structure and dynamic IDs. Huang et al. proposed a
    CAC scheme with soft-QoS based spectrum handoff for CRNs [31]. The proposed scheme
    mainly focuses on improving spectrum utilization and balancing the tradeoff between
    SUs call-blocking and call-dropping probabilities. Similarly, Jiang et al. also
    proposed a CAC scheme for CRNs called âguard channels and restricted channels
    (GC&RC) â in [32]. In the GC&RC scheme, licensed channels are classified into
    three categories, such as guard, restricted, and shared. Moreover, another CAC
    scheme for CRNs was introduced in [33]. In this scheme, a random access method
    called âVX (virtual-xmit-if-busy)â was used for channel allocation. Moreover,
    the SU collision probability, and channel capacity parameters were observed by
    the PU. To the best of our knowledge, there is no algorithm that jointly considers
    QoS provisioning of heterogeneous multimedia applications and services in accordance
    with their traffic profiles (e.g., priorities), spectrum sensing that is based
    on PU activities (e.g., traffic patterns), spectrum access decision, channel allocation,
    and CAC in cellular CR-IoT networks. Moreover, the objective of our study is to
    reduce the blocking probability of higher-priority SU calls while maintaining
    a sufficient level of channel utilization. SECTION 3 System Model In this section,
    we first present our network and traffic models, and then discuss our PU-traffic-pattern-based
    primary channel selection model. Network Model. Spectrum sensing is an essential
    function in CR-IoT networks to utilize licensed channels by avoiding interference
    with the PUs. Traditionally, the SUs sense and utilize the PU channels by assuming
    a predefined idle time distribution [34], [35]. However, in practice, the idle
    time distribution of licensed channels is PU-traffic-specific [36], [41]. For
    example, two different channels with different PU traffic patterns (i.e., PU activities)
    may have the same channel occupancy probabilities, but they still may have different
    idle/busy frequencies. Therefore, spectrum opportunity identification based on
    PU activities is an efficient way to exploit the licensed spectrum. In this study,
    we consider an infrastructural CR-IoT network with one secondary base station
    (SBS) and M SUs. As shown in Fig. 1, each SU generates different applications,
    which are categorized into P different priority classes. Each SU requests channel
    allocation from the SBS for its transmission. The SBS decides either to assign
    the channel or block the requesting SU based on its priority class and total number
    of channel accessible by that specific priority class SU. The SBS also detects
    the K idle channels from the total available licensed channels N , and orders
    the K available idle channels (i.e., 1â¤Kâ¤N ) based on PU idle probability at the
    time of SU transmission. The Key notations and symbols are presented in Table
    1. Fig. 1. Cognitive radio-enabled cellular IoT architecture. Multiple CR-empowered
    IoT users with heterogeneous applications accessing the primary channels opportunistically.
    Show All TABLE 1 Key Notations SUsâ Traffic Model. We assume that there are two
    major categories of radio users: 1) PUs and 2) SUs or CR-empowered IoT users,
    which are further classified into P different priority classes based on their
    applications. We make the following assumptions: A.1: PUs always have the highest
    priority to use the licensed channels and can occupy licensed channels being used
    by any SU. A.2: Each SU can allocate a maximum of one channel at a time for its
    service. A.3: The arrivals of each priority class p (1â¤pâ¤P) SU call requests follow
    the Poisson process with Î» p rate, where the priority class 1 SU calls have the
    highest priority, and SU calls of priority class P have the lowest priority in
    terms of their running applications. A.4: The call holding time of each priority
    class is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with expectation of 1 Ï
    p . Assumptions A.1âA.3 are standard technological assumptions in CR-IoT networks
    [17], [37], [38]. A.4 is widely used to model the service rate in communication
    networks [39], [40]. In this study, we assume that an SBS knows the licensed channel
    traffic patterns, which are computed based on Bayesian nonparametric traffic clustering
    approaches given in [36], [42]. Primary Channel Selection-Based on PU Traffic
    Patterns. We discuss our licensed channel selection criteria, which is based on
    the PU traffic patterns. Suppose t is the time required for a PU to switch its
    state from busy to idle. The probability of interference with the PU when the
    SU senses the licensed channel at time t under traffic pattern Îº is given by [42]
    as follows: Ï S t = 1â F x (t+ Î S ) 1â F x (t) . (1) View Source Similarly, Ï
    T t represents the probability of PU interference during the SU transmissions
    at time t under traffic pattern Îº , which is as below: Ï T t = 1â F x (t+ Î T
    ) 1â F x (t) , (2) View Source where F X (.) is a cumulative distribution function
    of the PU idle time, and Î S and Î T are the SU sensing and transmission times,
    respectively. Let Î³ 0 and Î³ 1 represent the probabilities of receiving Negative
    ACKnowledgment (NACK) due to channel conditions (e.g., fading, multi-path loss,
    etc.) and receiving NACK due to the PU collision, respectively. Let Î¸ t represent
    the SU action space, such as Î¸ t â{1:transmit, 0:sense} . The sensing observation
    denoted by o S t â{idle, busy} , and similarly o T t â{ACK, NACK} , represents
    the transmission observation. Let Ï t denote the conditional probability that
    a PU is idle at time t , given action-observation o t based on the history for
    a traffic pattern Îº . The licensed channel''s idle probability Ï (t+ Î o S S )
    and transmission probability Ï (t+ Î o T T ) at Î¸ t =0 given in [35] are updated
    using observation o t , which is obtained from Î¸ t as follows: Ï (t+ Î o S S )
    = â§ â© â¨ âª âª âª âª Ï t Ï S t (1â P f ) Ï t Ï S t (1â P f )+(1â Ï t Ï S t )(1â P d
    ) , Ï t Ï S t P f Ï t Ï S t P f +(1â Ï t Ï S t ) P d , if   o S =idle; if   o
    S =busy, (3) View Source Ï (t+ Î o T T ) = â§ â© â¨ âª âª Ï t Ï T t (1â Î³ 0 ) Ï t Ï
    T t (1â Î³ 0 )+(1â Ï t Ï T t )(1â Î³ 1 ) , Ï t Ï T t Î³ 0 Ï t Ï T t Î³ 0 +(1â Ï t
    Ï T t ) Î³ 1 , if   o T =ACK; if   o T =NACK. (4) View Source PU detection cannot
    be guaranteed 100 percent through sensing. Therefore, sensing error is included
    in (3). P d and P f are the detection and the false alarm probabilities, respectively.
    Similarly, successful SU transmission is based on the fact that the channel must
    remain idle for the duration of transmission and ACK is received at the SU transmitter,
    which is dependent on Î³ 0 and Î³ 1 , respectively. SECTION 4 Priority-Based Dynamic
    Channel Reservation Scheme In this section, we propose a priority-based dynamic
    channel reservation scheme that is based on queuing analysis and the SU calls
    arrival rate estimation. Priority-Based Dynamic Channel Reservation Scheme. The
    radio resource management module in CR-IoT networks ensures efficient utilization
    of licensed channels while guaranteeing the required QoS to various type of SUs
    in accordance with their traffic profiles. Therefore, in a non-QoS adaptive CR-IoT
    network environment, where spectrum channels are time and PU activity dependent,
    it is crucial to give the higher-priority to more important classes of traffic
    calls. Thus, we exploit a QoS-provisioning-based dynamic channel reservation scheme
    for QoS adaptive CR-IoT networks for reducing the call-blocking probability of
    higher-priority CR-IoT calls and ensuring efficient utilization of licensed channels.
    In this scheme, the number of total licensed channels available to accept the
    SU traffic call of any priority-class p changes with the variation in call arrival
    rates; this concept is shown in Fig. 2. We consider P different SU traffic priority-classes,
    where Î» p represents the arrival rate of calls with priority class p . The total
    arrival rate of all SU traffic calls is as follows: Î» T = â i=1 P Î» i . (5) View
    Source N represents the number of total licensed channels in the vicinity of the
    SBS from which K channels are available to an SBS at time t for SU reservation.
    The number of reserved channels for priority class p is computed as follows: Y
    p (t)= Î» p Î» T ÃK, p=1,â¦,P. (6) View Source Hence, K can be alternatively represented
    as follows: K= â i=1 P Y i (t). (7) View Source Consequently, the total number
    of accessible channels for the p th priority class from K vacant channels is calculated
    as below: K p =â â i=p P Y i (t)â, (8) View Source Fig. 2. System model for traffic-aware
    dynamic channel reservation for CR-enabled IoT network. Show All In the proposed
    scheme, if the priority of the SU traffic is high, then it is allocated a greater
    number of licensed channels to minimize its call-blocking probability. However,
    a traffic call of any priority class p is only accepted if reserved channels for
    that class are not already occupied. Moreover, we use a queuing analysis model
    to compute the SU call-blocking probability with the help of traffic arrival estimation
    of SUs. Queuing Analysis Using Markov Model. The SBS calculates the number of
    accessible channels for any priority class p based on its traffic arrival rate.
    The traffic queue of the SBS is modeled as M/M/K/K queuing system [43], which
    we analyzed based the Markov chain method. The SBS blocks any traffic call of
    priority p when the request''s queue is in the K p state. The SU of any priority
    class p can hold an allocated channel only for the duration 1 Ï p . The probability
    that the scheduler queue is in state i is denoted by Î² i and is computed as follows[45]:
    â§ â© â¨ âª âª âª âª âª âª âª âª âª âª âª âª âª âª i Î² i Ï= Î» T Î² iâ1 , i Î² i Ï=( Î» T â Î» P ) Î²

    <iâ¤ K 1 . (9) View Source Thus, any new highest-priority SU call will only be
    blocked if all the available channels (i.e., K 1 ) are already occupied. The call
    blocking probability Î· 1 of priority class 1 SUs can be computed by using queuing
    analysis as follows: Î· 1 = Î² 1 = Î» K P T Ï K K! Î² 0 â j=1 Pâ1 â i=1 Pâj ( Î» i
    ) K (Pâj) â K (Pâj+1) , p=1. (10) View Source Similarly, the call-blocking probability
    of priority classes 2 and higher is as below: Î· p = â i= K p K Î² i = Î· pâ1 + Î²
    0 â i= K p K (pâ1) â1 Î» K P T Ï i i! â i=1 pâ1 ( Î» i ) iâ( K p ) â j=p Mâ1 â i=1

    as Î² 0 =[(1+ â i=1 K P Î» i T Ï i i! + â j=2 P â k= K j +1 K j â1 ( Î» K P T â jâ1

    . (12) View Source Interestingly, we observe that the proposed Markov chain model
    can be effectively applied for any number of priority classes for queuing analysis.
    Arrival Rate Estimation of SU Calls.To estimate the call arrival rate, we observe
    the last n+1 calls of all priority classes and measure the inter-arrival time
    Î t p i between two successive calls, (iâ1) and i , of any priority class p .
    Hence, to calculate the average inter-arrival time denoted by Î t p Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯
    Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ , between two successive calls, we take n samples of each priority class
    and compute Î t p Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ as follows: Î t p Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ = 1 n â i=1
    n Î t p i . (13) View Source For unbiased estimation, we take the expectation
    with respect to Î t p Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ , given in [44] as follows: E[ Î t p Â¯ Â¯
    Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ ]=E[ 1 n â i=1 n Î t p i ]=Î t p , (14) View Source where Î t p denotes
    the true value and proves that the Î t p Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ is an unbiased estimation.
    Thus, the average call arrival rate of priority class p , Î» p , is computed based
    on the last n+1 observations as follows: Î» p = 1 Î t p Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ Â¯ = 1 1 n
    â n i=1 Î t p i . (15) View Source Therefore, Î» p is an unbiased estimation that
    helps in estimating the arrival rate of priority class p traffic calls. SECTION
    5 SU Call Admission and Channel Allocation Schemes This section first describes
    our proposed priority-based SU call admission and channel assignment scheme. It
    then presents the performance analysis of our proposed scheme and compared it
    with the proposed greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes. 5.1 Priority-Based
    SU Call Admission and Channel Allocation Scheme In the proposed priority-based
    SU call admission and channel allocation scheme, the SBS will admit and assign
    the channel to the SU based on its priority class and the corresponding number
    of reserve channels. To provide a certain QoS level to SU calls according to their
    traffic profile, we employ two mechanisms in the SBS: 1) SU resource allocation
    and admission control, and 2) scheduling, as depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Call
    admission control and resource allocation architecture for CR-IoT networks. Show
    All SUsâ Resource Allocation and Admission Control. Upon arrival of a new SU call
    request of priority class p , the resource allocation module computes the number
    of channels to be reserved for this priority class to ensure its QoS; then, based
    on the reserved resources, the admission control module decides whether to accept
    this new SU call request or reject it. The SBS establishes a buffer, for each
    admitted SU, if required. Moreover, the resource allocation module also estimates
    the channel availability and pools the idle detected channels. Thus, Algorithm
    1 lies in the resource allocation module. Algorithm 1. Primary Channel Estimation
    Procedure input : Global channel set N output : Sorted Set of available channel
    K 1 Initialize channel list with Kâ null 2 for C h i â1 to N do 3 /* Estimate
    C h i using Eq. (3)*/ 4 if C h i is Idle then 5 Add C h i to the list of available
    channels K 6 else 7 Ignore C h i 8 for C h i â1 to K do 9 /* Sort C h i based
    on PU idle probability using Eq. (2)*/ Scheduling. The scheduler schedules the
    admitted SU m over its allocated channel k for the duration 1 Ï p . Moreover,
    when a PU arrives on any SU-allocated channel k , the scheduler immediately stops
    the transmission of the SU that was using channel k and finds an alternative channel
    from the list of its accessible channels to reschedule it. If no channel is found,
    the SBS puts the suspended SU into the waiting queue. The SUs appended in the
    waiting queue have higher-priority for being assigned a channel based on their
    priority class when a channel is available to the SBS. Because the PU has the
    highest priority, therefore, when a PU is detected, its corresponding channel
    will be vacated immediately, and the SBS terminates the respective SU. Algorithm
    1 illustrates a concise procedure for maintaining a pool of K idle detected licensed
    channels. Algorithm 2 explains the procedure for the priority-based SU call admission
    and channel allocation method. Algorithm 1 (Primary Channel Estimation Procedure).
    First, the SBS evaluates/estimates all of the licensed channels and identifies
    idle channels (lines 2â3). If a channel is found to be idle, it should be pooled
    into the set of available channels (lines 4â5); otherwise, it is ignored (lines
    6â7). Finally, all the detected idle channels are sorted based on their corresponding
    PU idle probabilities (lines 8â9). Thus, the final set of K available channels
    is sorted, where (1â¤Kâ¤N) . Algorithm 2. Priority-Based Call Admission and Channel

    12 Stop immediately S U m p and find some alternative channel 13 if O c p < K
    p then 14 Reallocate channel C h k 15 update residual channel list O c p âO c
    p +1 16 else 17 Drop S U m p 18 /* Append S U m p into waiting queue */ Algorithm
    2 (Priority-based Call Admission and Channel Allocation Procedure). From lines
    1â4, upon the arrival of an SU call request of any priority class p , the SBS
    estimates the traffic arrival rate Î» p for each priority class. At line 5 it computes
    K p , the number of accessible channels by each priority class p . A call of priority
    class p is accepted if the number of already occupied channels, O c p , is less
    than K p (lines 6â8); otherwise, it is rejected. After the SU is admitted the
    SBS reserves the buffer for the admitted SU if required and updates the occupied
    channel index. When the SBS detects a PU arrival on any channel used by an SU,
    the SBS immediately suspends the transmission of the respective SUs and looks
    for an alternative. If an alternative channel is found, the SBS reschedules the
    suspended SU; otherwise, it is dropped and appended to the waiting queue (lines
    11â18). 5.2 Greedy Non-Priority SU Call Admission and Channel Allocation Scheme
    In this section, we discuss our proposed greedy non-priority admission and channel
    allocation scheme. The greedy non-priority call admission and channel allocation
    scheme admits the SU on the basis of First-In, First-Out (FIFO). This scheme does
    not consider the priorities of the arriving SUs. Algorithm 3 represents the concise
    procedures for greedy non-priority call admission and channel allocation for SUs.
    However, similar to Algorithm 2, Algorithm 3 also relies on Algorithm 1 for idle
    channel identification. Algorithm 3. Greedy Non-Priority Based Call Admission
    and Channel Allocation Procedure input : Set of available channels K output :
    Channel allocation to SU 1 for mâ1 to M do 2 if !Empty(K) then 3 Allocate C h

    if PU Detection on C h k == True then 8 Stop immediately S U m and find some alternative
    channel 9 if !Empty(K) then 10 Reallocate channel C h k and update residual channel
    list KâKâ1 11 else 12 /* Drop S U m */ Algorithm 3 (Greedy Non-priority-Based
    Call Admission and Channel Allocation Procedure). The SBS accepts the incoming
    SU connection requests based on the total available channel resources in a FIFO
    manner. If a channel is available, the SBS will admit the requesting SU m and
    allocate the available channel to that newly admitted SU; otherwise, the requesting
    SU is rejected (lines 1â6). Similar to the priority scheme, the SBS immediately
    suspends the ongoing transmission of an SU in case a PU arrival is detected on
    the any channel. If an alternative channel is available, the SBS reschedules the
    suspended SU; otherwise, it drops it (lines 7â12). 5.3 Fair Proportion-Based SU
    Call Admission and Channel Allocation Scheme In this section, we discuss our proposed
    fair proportion SU admission and channel allocation scheme. The fair proportion
    scheme reserves an equal number of channels for each priority class p based on
    the total number of priority classes. Algorithm 4 also relies on Algorithm 1 for
    channel estimation and pooling of the available K channels. Algorithm 4 (Fair
    Proportion Call Admission and Channel Allocation Procedure). First, the SBS computes
    an equal number of channels for all priority classes based on the fair proportion
    (line 1). The SBS admits the requesting SU connection based on the available channels
    reserved for that SU priority class. If any channel is available for requesting
    SUs, then the SBS admits the requesting SU call; otherwise, the SBS rejects it
    (lines 2â8). Similar to the other two approaches, in this approach, the SBS also
    immediately suspends the ongoing transmission of the SU in case a PU arrival is
    detected on the same channel and reschedules the suspended SU if any alternative
    channels are available for that SU based on its priority class; otherwise, the
    SBS drops it (lines 9â14). Algorithm 4. Fair Proportion Call Admission and Channel

    then 10 Stop immediately S U m p and find some alternative channel 11 if O c p
    <F P p then 12 Reallocate channel C h k and update residual channel list O c p
    âO c p +1 13 else 14 /* Drop S U m p */ 5.4 Complexity Analysis In this section,
    we analyze the complexity of the proposed algorithms. Algorithm 1. The time complexity
    from lines 2â7 is â N i=1 C o = C o ÃN , and the complexity from lines 8â9 is
    K 2 according to the selection sort algorithm. Thus, the total time complexity
    of Algorithm 1 is calculated as follows: â i=1 N C o + K 2 = C o ÃN+ K 2 , (16)
    View Source where C o is a constant that denotes the computing cost of instructions
    from lines 3â7. Priority Scheme. In order to compute the time complexity of the
    proposed priority scheme, we first compute the time complexity of Algorithm 2.
    The time complexity of Algorithm 2 from lines 1â18 is as follows: 1+( â i=1 P
    1)+ C 1 =1+P+ C 1 , (17) View Source Where, C 1 is a constant that denotes the
    computing cost of instructions from lines 6â18. Hence, the final time complexity
    of the proposed priority scheme (T C 0 ) is computed as follows: T C 0 =( C o
    ÃN+ K 2 )(1+P+ C 1 ) =( C o ÃN+ K 2 )+P( C o ÃN+ K 2 )+ C 1 ( C o ÃN+ K 2 ). (18)
    View Source We are only interested in computing the worst-case complexity. Therefore,
    we exclude the least significant terms and only count the most significant terms,
    those mainly contribute in the worst-case time complexity of the proposed priority
    scheme. Hence, the Big O time complexity of the proposed priority scheme is O(
    K 2 ) . Greed Non-Priority Scheme. The time complexity of the greedy non-priority
    scheme is also based on the time complexity of Algorithms 3 and 1. The time complexity
    of Algorithm 3 from lines 1â12 is computed as below: ( â m=1 M C 2 )+ C 3 = C
    2 ÃM+ C 3 , (19) View Source where C 2 and C 3 are constants denoting the computing
    costs from lines 2â6 and lines 7â12, respectively. Thus, the Big O time complexity
    of the greedy non-priority scheme (T C 1 ) is given as below: T C 1 =( C o ÃN+
    K 2 )Ã( C 2 ÃM+ C 3 ). (20) View Source As discussed previously, for the Big O
    time complexity, the least significant values do not play a major role; therefore,
    the final time complexity of the greedy non-priority scheme is O( K 2 ) . Fair
    Proportion Scheme. The time complexity of the fair proportion scheme is also based
    on Algorithms 1 and 4. The time complexity of Algorithm 4 from lines 1â14 is a
    constant value C 4 . However, the Big O time complexity of the fair proportion
    scheme (T C 2 ) is computed as follows: T C 2 = C 4 Ã( C o ÃN+ K 2 ). (21) View
    Source The Big O time complexity of the fair proportion scheme is O( K 2 ) . Thus,
    the worst-case time complexity of our proposed schemes is linear. SECTION 6 Performance
    Analysis In this section, we first present our selected parameters for performance
    evaluation. We then present and discuss the simulation results. 6.1 Performance
    Evaluation Criteria We define the following metrics to evaluate the performance
    of the proposed call admission and channel allocation schemes. Call-Blocking Probability
    of SUs. A call request of any particular priority class p is blocked when all
    the reserved channels for that particular priority class p are occupied. Thus,
    the call-blocking probability of priority class p (1â¤pâ¤P) is given by (10) and
    (11). Call-Dropping Probability of SUs. When a PU arrives with the intention of
    reusing its licensed channel, then the SU must vacate that licensed channel immediately
    and look for an alternative available channel in the list of its accessible channels
    to resume its service. If no channel remains in the list of its accessible channels,
    then the SU service will be suspended (dropped). Generally, the dropping probability
    is computed by dividing the total number of terminated SUs by the sum of the completed
    and terminated SUs [39]. The dropping probability of SUs is given as follows:
    Ï D = â Î´( o s t ), i o s t =0, o s t âS â K P j=1 (Kâ K P ) Î» j Ï o s t â P i=1
    (1â Î· i ) Î» i , (22) View Source where i o s t â{idle,busy} represents the sensing
    observation state of channel i at time t , Ï o s t is its steady state probability,
    and Î´( o s t ) is the conditional limitation for the given state S( 1 o s t ,
    2 o s t ,â¦, K o s t ) , which follows K <  K P . Kâ K P represents the number
    of dropped SUs under K< K P . Thus, the call-dropping probability of priority
    class p is as follows: Ï D p = â Î´(S), i o s t =0, o s t âS â K p j=1 Ï(p) Î» j
    Ï o s t (1â Î· p ) Î» p ,âp, (23) View Source where Ï(p) is the number of dropped
    SUs of priority class p of state S when PUs arrive. Total Channel Utilization.
    Radio spectrum is a scarce resource; therefore, its efficient utilization is an
    important performance parameter. In the proposed scheme, we reserve a specific
    number of channels for each priority class to minimize its call-blocking probability.
    Thus, the total channel utilization U is measured as the ratio of the total number
    of channels assigned to SUs to the total number of available channels, which is
    computed as follows: U= Î S K , (24) View Source where Î S and K denote the number
    of total SUs admitted (i.e., assigned channels for their services) and the number
    of total available channels, respectively. Similarly, the channel utilization
    by any priority class p is measured as the ratio of the total number of channels
    assigned to the SUs of priority class p and the total number of channels reserved
    for that priority class, which is computed as below: U p = Î S p K p , (25) View
    Source where Î S p and K p represent the number of total SUs of priority class
    p assigned to the channel for their service and the number of total channels reserved
    for priority class p , respectively. Throughput of SUs. In CR-IoT networks, the
    PU arrival affects the ongoing SU, as upon the arrival of a PU, the SU has to
    vacate the channel immediately and look for some other available channel from
    the list of its accessible channels to complete its service. Thus, the overall
    throughput of CR-IoT network, denoted by Î© , is measured as the average of the
    successful SU services per second, given below: Î©= â j=1, o s t âS P Îµ j Ï o s
    t , (26) View Source where Ï o s t and Îµ j denote the steady state probability
    and the transition rate, respectively. Similarly, the throughput of priority class
    p SU, denoted by Î© p , is measured as the total number of successful SUs of priority
    class p per unit time (i.e., second), given as Î© p = â o s t âS Îµ p Ï o s t .
    (27) View Source 6.2 Simulation Results This section presents the performance
    evaluation of the proposed priority-based SU call admission and channel allocation
    scheme with the greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes. The performance
    of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of the SU call-blocking probability,
    the SU call-dropping probability, channel utilization, and throughput. We consider
    a CR-IoT-based cellular network, in which an SBS is responsible for spectrum sensing
    based on the knowledge of the PUsâ activity, such as PUsâ traffic patterns, spectrum
    access decision, CAC, and channel allocation. The SBS receives heterogeneous multimedia
    SU call requests. We divide all the SU call requests into four different classes
    based on their importance and criticality. Table 2 presents the details of the
    different priority classes for SU call requests. According to our traffic assumptions,
    presented in Section 2.2, every SU call arrival process follows a Poisson distribution
    with an exponentially distributed call holding time, which is 120 s on average.
    The availability of the number of licensed channels is dependent on the PU activity.
    TABLE 2 Priority Classes Hence, we assume that on average 16 licensed channels
    are available to the SBS at any time t for SU reservation. Similar channel availability
    assumptions were made in various previous works in the literature (e.g., [46],
    [47], [48], [49]. Moreover, our channel reservation scheme is dynamic and can
    adapt to any number of available channels. For the SU call arrival rate estimation,
    we use a total of 100 samples for each priority class. In order to fully analyze
    the performance of the proposed schemes from different aspects, we evaluate our
    performance metrics presented in Section 6.1 as follows: First, we analyze the
    performance of the proposed schemes in terms of SUsâ call-blocking probability
    and total channel utilization under three different call arrival ratios: 1) equal
    call arrival rates of all four priority classes, 2) high arrival rates of higher-priority
    class calls, and 3) high arrival rates of lower-priority class calls. Second,
    we analyze the performance of the proposed schemes in terms of SUsâ call-dropping
    probability and throughput under an increased rate of PUs and SUs. However, in
    these two cases, the arrival ratios of all priority classes are equal. Figs. 4a,
    4b, and 4c compares the SU call-blocking probability for the priority scheme with
    the greedy non-priority and the fair proportion schemes under three different
    calls arrival ratios such as (2:2:2:2), (4:3:2:1), and (1:2:3:4). Fig. 4a demonstrates
    that the proposed priority scheme provides a very low SU call-blocking probability
    for higher-priority classes under a light and equal traffic load. Our design,
    which relies on the arrival rate estimation and the maximum number of available
    channels for priority class p ( K p ), can help higher-priority SUs experience
    a better blocking/dropping probability. First, when a call of any priority class
    p arrives, the SBS estimates the call arrival rates of all the priority classes
    and calculates K p . If the number of already occupied channels is less than K
    p , the arrived call of priority class p is accepted. A call of priority class
    p is blocked or rejected if the state of the system calls is greater than or equal
    to K p . Thus, K P and K 1 denote the number of total channels available for the
    lowest and highest-priority classes P and 1, respectively. The priority class
    1 SU calls are blocked only when all available channels K 1 are already occupied.
    This concept is illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 4. Call-blocking probability for equal
    and unequal arrival rates: Priority scheme versus non-priority and fair proportion
    schemes. Show All The greedy non-priority scheme results in a high call-blocking
    probability for the higher-priority class calls. Moreover, the greedy non-priority
    scheme does not guarantee QoS in terms of the call-blocking probability. Similarly,
    the call-blocking probability for higher-priority SU calls is also high in the
    fair proportion scheme due to its static channel allocation mechanism. However,
    the fair proportion scheme provides a certain QoS level to all the priority classes
    by reserving a fix and an equal number of channels for all priority classes. Similarly,
    Fig. 4b demonstrates the higher-priority SU calls blocking probability values
    in a special scenario when a greater number of higher-priority calls arrive. The
    proposed priority scheme only blocks a slightly greater number of calls of the
    lower-priority class to reduce the call-blocking probability of the higher-priority
    class. However, the greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes result in
    a very high call-blocking probability for the higher-priority SU calls. Fig. 4c
    presents the higher-priority SU call-blocking probability values in a particular
    scenario when a fewer number of higher-priority SU calls arrive. In this special
    scenario, there are a slightly greater number of licensed channels available for
    lower-priority SU calls. Therefore, the proposed priority scheme only blocks a
    very few number of lower-priority SU calls, and consequently, the lower-priority
    SUs experience better blocking probability values. Under such scenario, the greedy
    non-priority and fair proportion schemes result in high call-blocking probabilities
    for the higher-priority SU calls. Fig. 5a compares the proposed priority, greedy
    non-priority, and fair proportion schemes in terms of call-dropping probability
    for the higher-priority SUs under an increased rate of PUs. The arrival ratios
    of all priority classes are equal. This figure shows that the priority class 1
    has a better call-dropping performance, and the dropping probability of the priority
    class 4 is the highest. This is because all four priority classes can access a
    different number of channels, so that priority class 1 can access the highest
    number of channels, and priority class 4 can access only the fewest number of
    channels. When PUs interrupt the priority class 1 SUs, the SUs try to find alternative
    channels to reschedule their affected connections. If they fail to find alternative
    channels, then the dropping probability of SUs of priority class 1 also increases,
    as shown in Fig. 5a. However, they have more options to reschedule their affected
    connections than the priority class 4 SUs, which have very limited options to
    reschedule their affected connections. Consequently, the dropping probability
    of priority class 4 SUs is higher than that of priority class 1. Fig. 5. Call-dropping
    probability: Priority scheme versus non-priority and fair proportion schemes.
    Show All The greedy non-priority and fair proportion schemes result in high call-dropping
    probabilities for the higher-priority SU calls due to their greedy and fixed natures,
    respectively. Similarly, Fig. 5b shows the comparison in terms of the call-dropping
    probability of all three schemes under an increased rate of SUs with equal call
    arrival ratios for all priority classes. The figure shows that with an increased
    rate of SUs, their call-dropping probability decreases. This is because the high
    arrival rate of SUs leads to a low rate of accepted calls due to the limited number
    of accessible channels for each priority class. We defined the SU call-dropping
    probability as the number of dropped SU calls divided by the number of accepted
    SU calls. The SUsâ dropping probability decreases as the number of accepted SU
    calls increases. We found that priority class 1 has the lowest call-dropping probability,
    and priority class 4 has the highest call-dropping probability. This is because
    each priority class has its own number of accessible channels. Priority class
    1 has a higher number of accessible channels, while priority class 4 has a lower
    number of accessible channels. The priority class 1 SUs achieve the best performance
    in terms of the call-dropping probability under increased rates of both PUs and
    SUs, which guarantees a better QoS. Figs. 6a and 6b shows the total throughput
    of all three schemes under an increased rate of PUs and SUs, respectively. Similarly,
    Figs. 7a and 7b shows the throughput of individual priority classes for the priority
    scheme under the same environment. The higher the arrival rate of the PUs, the
    higher the probability that the licensed channel is busy. Therefore, a higher
    SU call-dropping probability and fewer fully completed SU services result in a
    lower SU throughput. Fig. 6a shows that with an increase in the PU arrival rate,
    the total throughput of the SUs decreases. Fig. 6b shows that with an increase
    in SU call arrivals, the SU throughput increases under conditions of constant
    PU arrivals. This is due to the fact that a greater number of arrivals causes
    a greater number of SU call admissions and, consequently, a higher probability
    of successful SU call completions. Fig. 6. Throughput of priority, non-priority,
    and fair proportion schemes. Show All Fig. 7. Throughput of individual SU priority
    classes for the priority scheme. Show All Figs. 7a and 7b presents the throughput
    of each individual SU priority class under an increased rate of PUs and SUs for
    the priority scheme. Fig. 7a shows that an increased rate of PUs, the call-blocking
    probability of all priority classes is affected; however, due to the higher-priority
    of class 1, the SUs belongings to priority class 1 have more opportunities to
    access the available channels and to be rescheduled to complete their services.
    As the priority class 1 SUs have permission to access almost all of the available
    channels, their throughput is not effected much. However, priority class 4 has
    lower priority and can access only very few channels. Moreover, if their calls
    are dropped, they have very few opportunities to gain access to the channel again.
    Therefore, their throughput seriously affected. Similarly, Fig. 7b shows that
    with the increased rate of SUs, priority class 1 achieves a higher throughput,
    and lower-priority classes achieve a lower throughput. Figs. 8a and 8b presents
    a comparison of SU channel utilization for all three schemes under an equal call
    arrival ratio for all priority classes and a higher call arrival ratio of higher-priority
    classes (e.g., [2:2:2:2] and [4:3:2:1]). These figures show that the proposed
    priority scheme performs well and improves the channel utilization significantly.
    Moreover, it significantly reduces higher-priority class SUsâ call-blocking and
    call-dropping probabilities with the help of the dynamic channel reservation method.
    The priority scheme increases the number of reserved channels for the higher-priority
    class if the arrival rate of that class increases. However, if the call arrival
    rate of the higher-priority class SU calls is low compared to that of the lower-priority
    classes of SU calls, then the priority scheme reserves fewer channels for the
    higher-priority class of SUs and maintains efficient channel utilization. It is
    clear from the figures that the greedy non-priority scheme is outperformed, because
    it admits and assigns available channels to the first incoming SU of any priority
    class; therefore, this scheme does not guarantee QoS. The performance of the fair
    proportion scheme is better under equal call arrival ratios, but it does not perform
    well under different call arrival ratios of different priority classes, and it
    also causes channel underutilization due to its fixed and static channel reservation
    method. Fig. 8. SU channel utilization. Show All SECTION 7 Applications Among
    the variety of wireless multimedia applications, a few traffic classes are more
    important than others. However, if all the traffic classes are considered equal
    in priority under a heavy traffic load and dynamic channel availability, then
    there is a high blocking rate of more important traffic calls, resulting in low-performance
    CR-IoT networks. Therefore, the priority of all of the traffic classes is not
    as equal due to their corresponding traffic profile and QoS requirements. Thus,
    the proposed priority-based call admission and channel allocation scheme can be
    directly applied in future for real implementation of the SBS that will provide
    heterogeneous wireless applications and services to cellular CR-IoT networks.
    Similarly, the proposed study can also be successfully applied to other emerging
    communication systems where resources are allocated to multiple traffic classes
    based on their traffic profiles. A few of the promising application areas are
    as follows. CR-IoT-Based Smart Vehicular Networks. This is an emerging communication
    paradigm that is promising for providing various types of multimedia applications
    and services for safe driving, mobile health, and entertainment. Hence, the CR-IoT
    paradigm is of great significance for smart vehicular networks. CR-IoT-Based Smart
    Grid. This term represents the next-generation power grid, which is considered
    a promising technology for providing a multi-class of applications and services,
    such as fault diagnosis, remote home and industry monitoring, equipment and remote
    customer site monitoring, and automatic meter reading. Thus, there is a vital
    need for CR-IoT in the smart grid. CR-IoT-Based Smart Cities. The CR-IoT-based
    smart city is an urban development paradigm that integrates CR-IoT with information
    and communication technology systems. The key objective of the CR-IoT-based smart
    city is to provide e-services, such as smart traffic management, intelligent energy
    management, home automation, mobile healthcare, medical aids, elderly assistance,
    smart gym, smart parks, and smart parking systems and playgrounds to all of its
    inhabitants for their improved quality of life in an eco-friendly style. However,
    in order to provide this facility, continuous connectivity is necessary, which
    is provided through CR-IoT. Moreover, CR-IoT technology plays a key role in user
    interaction and data gathering in smart cities. SECTION 8 Conclusion This paper
    introduced a linear time traffic-aware priority-based call admission and channel
    allocation scheme for cognitive radio-enabled Internet of Things (CR-IoT) by using
    the dynamic channel reservation method. First, we estimate the availability of
    each licensed channel based on its PU activity (e.g., traffic patterns) for optimized
    and guaranteed CR-IoT transmissions. Second, for minimizing the call-blocking
    probability of higher-priority traffic and efficient channel utilization, we divided
    the entire IoT traffic into different priority classes based on their QoS requirements
    in terms of priority and reserved a dynamic number of licensed channels for each
    priority class on the basis of its real-time traffic estimation. Finally, all
    three proposed schemes are evaluated in terms of the call-blocking probability,
    call-dropping probability, channel utilization, and throughput. Simulation results
    show that the proposed priority scheme outperforms the proposed greedy non-priority
    and fair proportion schemes. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by National

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: The evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and
    their adoption in new generation intelligent systems has generated a huge demand
    for wireless bandwidth. This bandwidth problem is further exacerbated by another
    characteristics of IoT applications, i.e., IoT devices are usually deployed in
    massive number, thus leading to an awkward scenario that many bandwidth-hungry
    devices are chasing after the very limited wireless bandwidth within a small geographic
    area. As such, cognitive radio has received much attention of the research community
    as an important means for addressing the bandwidth needs of IoT applications.
    When enabling IoT devices with cognitive functionalities including spectrum sensing,
    dynamic spectrum accessing, circumstantial perceiving, and self-learning, one
    will also need to fully study other critical issues such as standardization, privacy
    protection, and heterogeneous coexistence. In this article, we investigate the
    structural frameworks and potential applications of cognitive IoT. We further
    discuss the spectrum-based functionalities and heterogeneity for cognitive IoT.
    Security and privacy issues involved in cognitive IoT are also investigated. Finally,
    we present the key challenges and future direction of research on cognitive-radio-based
    IoT networks. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics ( Volume:

    SECTION I. Introduction The pervasive adoption of Internet-of-Things (IoT) is
    made possible due to the rapid development of enabling technologies such as consumer
    electronics, cloud computing, big data analytics, and wireless communications.
    In recent years, research advancement in cognitive radio network [1] also allowed
    the massive deployment of bandwidth-hungry IoT devices in remote and isolated
    areas. The world has witnessed an explosive growth in adoption of IoT in various
    sectors such as smart cities, smart manufacturing, and many other kinds of cyber-physical
    systems [2]. Such IoT applications typically involve a massive number of IoT devices
    being deployed in field environment, which access some cloud platforms for big
    data analytics or intelligent decision making via a variety of wired and wireless
    networks. The most commonly used IoT devices include video cameras, environment
    sensors, motion sensors, and actuators for mechanical control in the physical
    environment. At the same time, the varieties and capabilities of IoT devices have
    also increased dramatically in recent years. Nowadays, it is very common to see
    high capacity IoT devices which capture high-precision data (or high resolution
    images) in very frequent intervals and upload the data to some cloud computing
    platform via wireless communication networks. In this regard, the evolution of
    IoT devices has generated huge demand for wireless bandwidth in order to meet
    the operational needs of new generation IoT applications. Hence, future IoT networks
    are required to support massive node access and big data transmission, which calls
    for more available communication bandwidth. This bandwidth problem is further
    exacerbated by another characteristics of IoT applications, that is IoT devices
    are usually deployed in massive number, thus leading to an awkward situation that
    many bandwidth-hungry devices are chasing after the very limited wireless bandwidth
    within a small geographic area. At present, IoT can only use very limited authorized
    spectrum, which is likely to be occupied by WiFi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee devices.
    Thus, the constraint of spectrum resource has become a significant bottleneck
    for IoT deployment. By enabling IoT devices with cognitive radio technology, IoT
    devices will be capable of sharing licensed spectrum resource of 4G and 5G, hence
    substantially expands the IoTâs transmission capacity. As such, cognitive radio
    has received much attention of the research community as an important means for
    addressing the bandwidth needs of IoT applications. Specifically, sensing and
    dynamic access of spectrum holes have received much research attention. When enabling
    IoT devices with cognitive functionalities, including spectrum sensing, dynamic
    spectrum accessing, circumstantial perceiving, and self-learning, one will also
    need to fully study other critical issues such as standardization, privacy protection,
    and heterogeneous coexistence. In [3], the authors investigated the use of distributed
    compressive sensing method to realize broadband spectrum sharing in cognitive-radio-based
    IoT. In [4], the authors proposed multibands cooperative spectrum sensing which
    efficiently improves the access probability of IoT. Ejaz and Ibnkahla [5] utilized
    genetic-algorithm-based dynamical spectrum allocation solution to increase the
    capacity of IoT. Han et al. [6] adopted interference technology to combat the
    interference caused by IoT users to primary users. Liang et al. [7] investigated
    the coallocation of time slot and transmit power. Besides, [8] presented an optimization
    method for spectrum sensing in cognitive IoT. In addition, other critical issues
    such as the structural framework for designing IoT application, network topology,
    and applications of cognitive IoT also need to be addressed. In [9], the authors
    discussed the need for cognitive-radio-based IoT and analyzed the desired cognitive
    radio functionalities of IoT, especially spectrum sensing and optimization. Khan
    et al. [10] investigated approaches for enhancing IoT by cognition functionality,
    and proposed an operational framework for cognitive-radio-based IoT systems. Wu
    et al. [11] investigated some applications of cognitive radio networks for IoT,
    and practical solutions for addressing some of the challenges of cognitive IoT.
    Shah et al. [12] discussed how to devise and model the cognitive process in cognitive
    IoT, where cognitive functionalities are designed to autonomously improve IoT
    network performance. Zhang et al. [13] studied the structural framework for designing
    cognitive IoT, which featured minimally a perception layer, a network layer as
    well as an application layer. Shigueta et al. [14] proposed an IoT-based cognitive
    traffic management system. At present, research on cognitive IoT mainly focuses
    on spectrum sensing, transmission resource allocation, and interference mitigation,
    etc [15]. Yet, these research topics are being addressed in a relatively independent
    manner and there is a lack of a optimized approach to address sensing, transmission
    and interference at the same time [16]. Besides, with the rapid development of
    cognitive capability of IoT devices, there is an urging need to study mechanisms
    that integrate artificial intelligence, signal processing, and other cutting edge
    features such as caching networks and flog computing into cognitive IoT. In this
    article, we present the rationale and recent development of cognitive radio technology
    in IoT. We focus on how cognitive-radio-based functionalities, especially spectrum-related
    functionalities, will be helpful for IoT. We also discuss standardization efforts,
    practical applications, security, and cognitive capability of mobile terminals
    in IoT networks. We also consider the extension of traditional cognitive ability
    of spectrum sensing to more sophisticated features such as cognition of scenario
    and environment in IoT networks. Thus motivating further interests in social and
    cognitive mobility modeling, routing protocol, energy allocation, mobile computing,
    cognitive computing, etc. in the IoT environment especially with stochastic layout
    shapes. Therefore, the fusion of cognitive IoT and other new technologies is also
    presented in this article. The rest of this article is organized as follows. In
    Section II, we first discuss the motivation of using cognitive radio in IoT. Then,
    basic framework, standardization efforts, and new applications for cognitive IoT
    are presented in Section III. We investigate techniques for spectrum-related functionalities
    in cognitive IoT in Section III. In Section IV, we present the issues of information
    fusion of cognitive IoT and other emerging technologies. Section V concludes this
    article. SECTION II. Cognitive IoT Architecture and Application International
    Telecommunication Union (ITU) documented a four-stage program for future IoT development
    [2], as shown in Fig. 1. Based on further in-depth research in this field, the
    desired functionalities and service characteristics of IoT have become clearer,
    and suggested that future IoT is expected to own key capabilities in service sensing,
    data sensing, environment sensing, and even intelligent cognition ability in order
    to realize the vision of real smart IoT; thus, raising the target achievement
    of IoT from âPerceptionâ to âCognitionâ i.e. cognitive IoT. Fig. 1. IoT development
    trend. Show All A. Cognitive Capabilities Current research on cognitive IoTâs
    framework mainly concentrates on userâs demand on IoT services with autonomous
    and intelligent characteristics by introducing cognitive elements. a three-layer
    cognitive cycle structure is integrated with information sharing mechanism and
    heterogeneous circumstantial sensing interaction to constitute the structure of
    autonomously cognitive IoT [17]. This article offers a basic framework and data
    provision for cognitive decision and optimal learning mechanism in IoT. As shown
    in Fig. 2, we give the architecture framework of cognitive IoT which is based
    on traditional IoT architecture. Wherein, four layers consisting of information
    sensing, network interconnecting, cognitive decision-making, and intelligent service
    define the cognitive IoT. Fig. 2. Architecture framework of cognitive IoT. Show
    All From the perspective of functionality, cognitive IoT can be divided into object
    demand description layer, cognitive decision-making layer, ubiquitous access layer,
    and physical networks layer. The definitions of the four layers do not directly
    correspond to the layers of traditional network protocol. The framework presented
    in Fig. 2 should provide QoS guarantee for D2D usersâ various demands. The main
    functionality involved in this framework is to sense QoS requirement and network
    performance objective for users from various cells. Then, properly model the network
    behavior and make corresponding decision according to cognition, feedback, and
    network status in self-learning. At the end, finally identifying the required
    behavior of cognitive IoT in future, while adjusting and allocating network resources
    of physical networks so as to meet userâs real-time demand. In cognitive IoT,
    it is essential to adopt the approach of a cognitive dynamic system as shown in
    Fig. 3, which is a goal-driven autonomous system with a cognitive controller as
    the core to sense and predict external environment. The cognitive dynamic system
    is mainly structured by probabilistic computing, perception, and cognitive controller
    blocks, wherein interaction is performed in a closed loop, noted by perception-action
    cycle. In Fig. 3, the short interval or long interval is the time buffer preserved
    by the system in order to handle time delay caused by cognitive processing. Fig.
    3. Conceptual blocks of cognitive dynamic system and their interaction, adopted
    in [18]. Show All In addition, in the cognitive decision layer, the functionality
    of cognitive decision is one of the key factors that contribute to the intelligence
    of cognitive IoT. It is mainly based on the structure of the three-layer cognitive
    cycle [19]. The structure can be shown in Fig. 4. Through exploring internal framework
    structure, operation mechanism, and cooperative relationship within the IoT, the
    structure aims to achieve massive heterogeneous sensing information with regard
    to network performance objective. It should be noted that the objective needs
    to be unfolded from the perspectives of detecting network environment and sensing
    surrounding information. Meanwhile, use the interconnection mechanism of various
    networks to release and share the sensing information. And, adopt data fusion
    method to perform information analyzing and integrating. The intelligent cognitive
    decision-making is completed on the basis of information fusion and decision knowledge
    base optimum improved by machine learning theory. At last, proper network adjustment
    will be carried out. Three-layers cognitive cycle structure provides strong theoretical
    support for the internal framework, relationship, and cooperative mechanism of
    cognitive IoT. Fig. 4. Three-layers cognitive cycle structure of cognitive IoT.
    Show All B. Applications and Standardization Efforts for Cognitive IoT With the
    capabilities of performing dynamic sensing and cognition of surrounding environment,
    many potential applications and services can benefit from cognitive radio technology.
    In health care domain, cognitive IoT can assist in a smoother real-time monitoring
    in long ranges without any worry of spectrum availability [13]. In social activity
    domain, cognitive IoT has drawn attention recently as cognitive IoT objects for
    commercial purposes can improve smart traffic management. For environment related
    applications, with cognitive radio technology, IoT can be a real potential solution
    for dealing with congested or spectrum scarce network areas [20]. For smart home
    applications, cognitive-radio-equipped sensors can handle potential heterogeneous
    network interference [21]. In smart grid domain, cognitive IoT can realize the
    goal of enabling consumers to know their energy consumption at any time and any
    place [22]. In smart cities, user data gathering and interaction are critical
    which can be supported by cognitive-radio-based IoT [23]. Besides, for Internet
    of Vehicles (IoV), a significant challenge is the availability of spectrum for
    mobile vehicles wherein cognitive radio networks will play a key role to solve
    the issue [24]. Enormous efforts have been conducted by academia and the industry
    to bring IoT and cognitive radio into real commercial deployment. Numbers of technical
    committees, working groups as well as standardization organizations are working
    to enhance or expand the applications of IoT and cognitive radio. For IoT standardization,
    communication protocols, interference control and data storage services are normalized
    by EPC Global and ITU SG 13, SG 16 technical committee. Information security,
    personal data privacy, and other data protection issues are concerned by STF 396
    and CEN TC 225 working group. The standardization of Spectrum usage and RFID domain
    are performed by ISO and ECMA committees. Besides, IEEE, 3GPP, IP for smart objects
    (IPSO), near field communication forum (NFC), and European Telecommunications
    Standards Institute (ETSI), etc., committees all participated in the related work.
    Cognitive radio is regarded as a promising solution to solve the problem of scarce
    spectrum in the era of blooming wireless applications. Almost every kind of wireless
    application or networks can benefit from cognitive radio to refine its spectrum
    availability and many international organizations or groups have involved in its
    standardization. Specifically, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is considering
    dynamic spectrum access over unlicensed very high frequency (VHF) and ultra high
    frequency (UHF) TV bands in the US. IEEE 802.11af technical committee is working
    on the modifications of physical and MAC layer during dynamic channel access and
    coexistence. 3GPP is considering the combination of new licensed bands consisting
    of higher frequencies and currently unlicensed bands. The spectrum operation of
    MAC and PHY layers in TVWS band is investigated by ECMA 392. Besides, IEEE institute
    is working on the standardization of dynamic spectrum access networks. ITU, ETSI,
    and ANDSF working groups are also paying efforts on the standardization of cognitive
    radio. At present, cognitive-radio-based IoT framework is still underinvestigated
    and related summary of research works need to be forwarded. It is worthy of consideration
    that the long-range IoT applications can benefit from cognitive radio by introducing
    dynamic spectrum access to meet the spectrum demands of massive IoT devices. In
    addition, short-range or urban IoT applications can better their integration in
    the environment of heterogeneous spectrum by adopting cognitive radio. SECTION
    III. Spectrum-Related Functionalities Spectrum sensing is a fundamental and critical
    functionality for cognitive IoT. IoT objects equipped with cognitive radio module
    should sense spectrum hole in dynamic spectrum environment and detect the presence
    of authorized user. As the cognitive IoT users frequently work in distributed
    networks and heterogeneous spectrum scenario, joint sensing strategy appears significant
    to guarantee sensing accuracy. Besides, compared with other functionalities, the
    time and energy consumed by spectrum sensing block need to be concerned. Thus,
    in the energy-limited IoT objects, fast and efficient sensing solution is called
    for. Many promising spectrum sensing methods including alliance-based sensing,
    clustering-based sensing, and self-learning-based sensing have been investigated
    in cognitive IoT. Dynamic spectrum access is a key point in the process of spectrum
    sharing and optimization for cognitive IoT. Dynamic spectrum access allows IoT
    users to opportunistically access and utilize idle channels authorized to other
    primary users. In a distributed IoT network environment with imperfect sensing
    capability, techniques to decrease access collision and improve spectrum efficiency
    deserve full investigation. In fact, many critical cognitive functionalities including
    spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access, etc., make use of deep learning methods
    to increase sensing or access probabilities. When IoT terminals dynamically access
    the idle spectrum especially in distributed mode, they should often record and
    judge the channel status. Deep learning methods can assist them to better identify
    the optimal channel to access. To combat the limited sensing capability, enforced
    self-learning method has been adopted to smooth the dynamic spectrum access [25].
    From the perspective of whole networks, fully using spectrum reuse to enhance
    spectrum efficiency has drawn extensive attention [26]. Number of mathematical
    tools including graph theory, game theory, and intelligent optimization algorithm
    have been utilized to optimize dynamic spectrum access and allocation [27]. In
    addition, due to the mobility of IoT terminals and the coexistence of various
    kinds of networks, heterogenous spectrum environment as shown in Fig. 5, is a
    main characteristic for the dynamic spectrum access in IoT. In the other specific
    IoT application circumstance, such as IoV as shown in Fig. 6, the strong characteristics
    of IoT terminalsâ movement will lead to a very complex spectrum circumstance to
    be addressed. It can be envisioned that traditional methods should be refined
    to better fit in the IoT scenario. Fig. 5. Heterogeneous spectrum environment.
    Show All Fig. 6. Architecture of IoV. Show All Besides, substantial research efforts
    have been spent in enhancing the efficiency of dynamic spectrum access for IoT
    devices. As dynamic spectrum access consists of several significant processes
    including spectrum sharing, spectrum allocation, power control along with spectrum
    switch, many techniques and mathematical tools are adopted to improve its efficiency.
    Due to space constraints, this article will not give full account of the efficiency
    enhancement of dynamic spectrum access. SECTION IV. Information Security and Fusion
    To meet the stringent requirements of anytime, anywhere wireless services, the
    fusion of IoT, Internet, communication networks, satellite networks, etc., becomes
    essential [28]. When the other wireless networks encounter massive IoT terminalsâ
    access, enhanced capabilities including information processing, security, and
    privacy-preserving are called for wherein cognitive functionalities will be critical
    to smooth the information fusion and guarantee the transmission capacity for IoT
    nodes. A. Information Security and Data Privacy Cognitive IoT devices can sense
    spectrum âholesâ and dynamically access the holes to transmit information. During
    the course, sensing spectrum may become a detecting or monitoring behavior for
    other users in local networks. Then, when cognitive IoT devices complete the spectrum
    accessing, it may be considered as an âintruderâ and a potential safety flaw for
    authorized wireless networks. On the other side, for the overlay spectrum accessing
    mode in which the cognitive IoT users are authorized to use the idle spectrum
    temporarily, spectrum trading is always performed to efficiently share the band
    and improve the usage. To realize efficient spectrum trading, proper information
    sharing and a cognitive agent are essential. Frequent information exchanging and
    sharing may result in the potential issue in privacy preserving. It is envisioned
    that a full discussion and practical protocol on information security in cognitive-radio-based
    IoT should be conducted so as to constraint the unordered behaviors of cognitive
    IoT users and secure authorized usersâ security. In the perspective of privacy-preserving,
    personal privacy is likely to be leaked by the behavior of embedded tagging. The
    data tracking with radio frequency identification will lead to the damage of user
    privacy as well. Also, the information in the progress of sharing and broadcasting
    easily incurs attacking and leaking. Meanwhile, traditional wireless channels
    cannot meet the user requirement of privacy protection and the stream data in
    IoT could be totally stolen if the invasion succeeds. In this condition, it is
    necessary to build a mechanism in IoT to secure a powerful privacy protection
    of IoT data. In cognitive-radio-equipped IoT, cognitive engine can automatically
    detect related system information and network behaviors, then perform self-learning
    process to adapt to the environment and identify malicious attack and invasion.
    It can be envisioned that blockchain technique, trust computation mechanism, enforced
    self-learning, and big-data-mining, will be adopted to upgrade privacy protection
    level. B. Fusion of Heterogeneous Networks When IoT coexists with other wireless
    networks, it requires cognitive capability to sense surrounding spectrum circumstance,
    detect other networksâ conditions. The more elements an IoT user can perceive,
    the more suitable choice it can make. Current cognitive functionalities mainly
    focus on the spectrum sensing and forced self-learning, thus more extensive cognitive
    capabilities are needed to adapt to future complex heterogeneous networks. Many
    specific research works have been conducted to investigate the fusion of cognitive
    IoT and other wireless networks. In [28], the authors raised a novel parallel
    cooperative spectrum sensing solution in heterogeneous IoT environment in which
    the cognitive usersâ sensing abilities are always affected by heterogeneous channel
    condition. In [29], the authors proposed a method to enhance the spectrum efficiency
    based on the nonorthogonal multiple access technique for heterogeneous IoT. The
    imperfect interference cancelation and heterogeneous secondary users are mainly
    considered in this article. In [30], a spatial and temporal idle spectrum sensing
    framework was proposed for heterogeneous spectrum IoT. In [31], the authors devised
    an asymmetric asynchronous spectrum selecting mechanism in heterogeneous IoT where
    various cognitive users have different available channels to choose. When cognitive
    radio technology is applied in various IoT environments, it should support different
    kinds of sensing, sharing, or access methods. In ad hoc networks, the fast sensing
    or spectrum switching approaches need to be addressed. In traditional wireless
    sensor networks, distributed spectrum access solutions without any broadcasting
    information should be raised. In IoV, it can be envisioned that the efficient
    spectrum optimization method on the basis of mobility prediction will need to
    be addressed. C. Information Fusion and Mobile Cognition The cognitive and learning
    feature of cognitive IoT endow it some significant capabilities that traditional
    networks do not have. Cognitive IoT can merge various heterogeneous networks,
    shield details of underlaying networks, and provide multiservice transparent transmission
    to users. On the other hand, in current network circumstance, it lacks reliable
    and effective information interaction among various terminals or networks. Inefficient
    communication and cooperation within different nodes will inevitably lead to the
    waste resource or irrational resource allocation in the whole networks, meanwhile
    decreasing network efficiency. The cognitive process not only senses surrounding
    network conditions but also detects other networksâ information, which can change
    the previous selfish and uncooperative behaviors caused by isolated status of
    traditional nodes. Through extensively recognizing the whole networksâ environment
    and elements and building corresponding cooperative relationship, the wireless
    resource between nodes can be shared in an effective way. IoT can be considered
    as an extension of pervasive computing, cyber-physical-systems, and machine-to-machine
    communications from a macro perspective. With constant improvement of perception
    devices in IoT, the ability and approach of achieving sensor nodesâ information
    can be obviously improved by using smart devices such as mobile phone and personal
    digital assistant, etc. The social-relation-based cognitive model and human-oriented
    mobile perception have been investigated and applied to strengthen the basis of
    mobile sensing services in IoT. Many researches have been conducted to reason
    and evaluate the complexity and uncertainty of social relation from various angles
    so as to summarize the social characteristics of mobile nodes [19]. The human-oriented
    mobile perception services can enhance the range of perception and reduce perception
    hole by introducing social computing or mobile computing theory and analyzing
    perception data. Rea et al. devised an embedded action-identified system on the
    basis of mobile perception mechanism, so as to further promote the applications
    of mobile perception in smart circumstance, monitoring, crisis response, and military
    field [32]. In addition, the combination of cognitive radio and other cutting
    edges such as intelligent artificial and Blockchain has drawn growing attention
    from industria to academia [33]â[36]. Even the IoT has been involved into our
    real life from smart city to environment monitoring, the IoT without artificial
    intelligence and cognitive functionality will have limited capability. To achieve
    the actual and full benefits of IoT, it should be intelligent and automatic in
    various environments. Furthermore, in distributed IoT, the promising technology
    of Blockchain can take effect in terms of information security and decentralized
    computing. SECTION V. Research Challenges and Open Issues The full utilization
    of cognitive radio technology in IoT still calls for extensive research and development
    in hardware design, standardization, spectrum optimization, privacy protection,
    and heterogeneous network fusion, etc. This section will summarize the potential
    research challenges and open issues involved in cognitive IoT. A. Standardization
    Challenges Standardization is a key step for the constant and extensive development
    of cognitive IoT networks while providing integral foundation for security-preserving,
    application extension, dynamic spectrum access, and fusion of heterogeneous networks.
    Currently, many standardization efforts have been paid by academia and industria
    in the direction of IoT and cognitive radio, respectively. How to integrate the
    related works from technical committees and working groups together efficiently
    to promote cognitive IoT deserves full intention. On the other hand, a more practical
    way to accelerate the standardization of cognitive IoT is to enrich or refine
    current IoT structure and protocol to enable and standardize the functionality
    of dynamic spectrum access for IoT nodes. B. Spectrum Efficiency Enhancing spectrum
    efficiency is the original intention of introducing cognitive radio to IoT which
    means spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum access will be adopted to realize
    the dynamic utilization of idle spectrum. However, in the circumstance of distributed
    IoT networks, how to perform effective spectrum sharing without high overhead
    and energy consumption still needs more investigations. Besides, when the IoT
    is combined with other promising network technologies or modes such as caching
    networks, fog computing, satellite networks, how to refine current techniques
    of dynamic spectrum sharing for IoT to adaptively fit in the new circumstances
    lacks full studies until now. C. Security and Privacy The network heterogeneity
    accompanied by dynamic spectrum access for IoT nodes incurs security problem wherein
    we cannot apply traditional security mode to address the issue. Especially with
    the wider application fields of IoT, when the IoT nodes are equipped with cognitive
    functionalities to sense âspectrum holeâ and detect network elements, new security,
    and privacy problems will emerge. More interactions within IoT networks will be
    performed to fully understand the circumstance. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this
    article, we presented the need for IoT to be equipped with cognitive radio functionality.
    Cognitive IoT is a new and promising paradigm to benefit IoT networks in enhancing
    spectrum efficiency and empowering more heterogeneous and intelligent networks.
    This article focuses on the investigation and discussion of applications, standardization,
    spectrum-related functions as well as security-oriented issues of cognitive IoT.
    We also summarized the spectrum-function-related cognitive technology in IoT,
    including intelligent spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access as well as efficient
    spectrum sharing. Besides, the fusion of cognitive radio with other cutting edge
    techniques such as caching networks, flog computing, and social networks are also
    discussed. Finally, this article challenges and potential applications for cognitive
    IoT were analyzed further. Currently, research on cognitive IoT should put more
    emphasis on designing structure framework and standard protocol to realize the
    vision of large-scale IoT applications in important domains such as smart cities,
    smart manufacturing, and cyber-physical systems. Authors Figures References Citations

  explanation: 'In this paper, the authors present a cooperative, distributed spectrum
    sensing approach for use in a cognitive radio network (CRN) with varying conditions.
    They take a parameter estimation approach to the spectrum sensing problem and
    use the Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) method based on the diffusion strategy under
    multiple frequency bands and investigate its efï¬ciency and robustness in the presence
    of changes in the sensing environment, including interference and congestion.


    The main objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of the ATC diffusion-based
    method in more challenging and practical scenarios, where some frequency bands
    stop being utilized by some primary users (PUs), or where there is a mobile SU
    node in the network. The authors consider a network of three static PUs with overlapping
    power spectrums and a set of K = 11 geographically distributed SUs that communicate
    via a connected network. The network is divided into different frequency zones,
    and each SU is interested in a subset of these zones. The PUs cease to use some
    of the frequent zones during different time intervals, and one of the SUs becomes
    mobile and changes position and frequency bands of interest over time.


    The authors analyze the performance of the ATC method by monitoring the estimation
    error of the involved parameters that approximate the total power spectrum. They
    evaluate the convergence and accuracy of the ATC method in estimating the global
    and common interest parameter vectors and compare its performance with a non-cooperative
    LMS algorithm. Their results show that the ATC method outperforms the non-cooperative
    LMS algorithm, and that the use of adaptive combination weights further improves
    the estimation accuracy.


    The work presented in this paper is relevant to the review intention as it provides
    a detailed analysis of the performance of a cooperative, distributed spectrum
    sensing approach under realistic and challenging conditions. The authors have
    conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach
    and have provided insights into its behavior under different scenarios.'

    \ rapid growth in wireless communications, coupled with insufï¬cient utilization\
    \ of the\nspectrum, led to the development of new wireless services and the promising\
    \ technology of cognitive\nradio (CR) networks, which facilitate periodic access\
    \ to the unoccupied spectrum bands and thus\nincreases spectral efï¬ciency. A fundamental\
    \ task in CR networks is spectrum sensing, through which\nunauthorized secondary\
    \ users (SUs) detect unoccupied bands in the spectrum. To achieve this, an\naccurate\
    \ estimate of the power spectrum is necessary. From this perspective, and given\
    \ that many\nother factors can affect individual detection, such as pathloss and\
    \ receiver uncertainty, we aim to\nimprove its estimate by exploiting the spatial\
    \ diversity in the SUsâ observations. Spectrum sensing\nis treated as a parameters\
    \ estimation problem, assuming that the parametersâ vector of each SU\nconsists\
    \ of some global and partially common parameters. To exploit this modeling, distributed\n\

    1. Introduction\nThe radio frequency spectrum is an inherently limited resource.\
    \ Many services pro-\nvided to users every day are based on the broadcast of radio\
    \ signals (radio, television,\ntelephony, broadband internet, defense applications\
    \ (e.g., radar), scientiï¬c uses such as\nmeteorology, positioning (GPS), etc.).\
    \ New technologies, such as the Internet of Things\nand Machine-to-Machine communication,\
    \ appear that rely on the use of wireless radio\nsystems (UMTS, Wi-Fi, WiMax,\
    \ Digital TV, 5G, and B5G). Additionally, the transition to\nmultimedia applications,\
    \ and in general, the rapid growth in wireless communications\nhave contributed\
    \ to a great demand for the development of new wireless services for both\nthe\
    \ authorized and unauthorized frequency spectrums [1].\nAt the same time, the\
    \ electromagnetic spectrum, because of greater and greater in-\ncreases in demand,\
    \ is in short supply. Most of it is occupied by already existing services\nand\
    \ applications. Therefore, to assign a part of the electromagnetic spectrum to\
    \ a new\nservice, an existing one should be replaced, cease its operation, and\
    \ thus free the requested\nspectrum band. However, the electromagnetic spectrum\
    \ will still be fully occupied. On the\nother hand, a signiï¬cant part of the already\
    \ allocated spectrum has limited or sporadic\nusage, thus leading to its underuse.\n\

    Sensors 2022, 22, 6692\n2 of 20\nAll of the above create the requirement for continuously\
    \ available spectrum frequen-\ncies without interference. Recent studies have\
    \ shown that the current ï¬xed spectrum\nassignment policy has imposed insufï¬cient\
    \ use of the spectrum. In recent years, dynamic\nspectrum management in 5G networks\
    \ is more necessary, due to the increasing demand for\nfree frequencies solving\
    \ the problem of spectral inadequacy [2]. To address this problem,\nCognitive\
    \ Radio Networks have been brought to the foreground as a promising technology\n\
    that facilitates periodic access to unoccupied frequency bands, contributing to\
    \ the increase\nin spectrum efï¬ciency [3].\nAccording to the Federal Communications\
    \ Commission (FCC), cognitive radio is\na system that senses its operating electromagnetic\
    \ environment and can dynamically\nand autonomously adjust its radio operating\
    \ parameters to modify the operation of the\nsystem, such as to maximize the throughput,\
    \ mitigate interference, facilitate interoperability\nand access the secondary\
    \ networks. Hence, one main purpose of cognitive radio is the\nautonomous exploitation\
    \ of the locally unused part of the spectrum (spectrum holes) with\nthe aim of\
    \ providing new access paths to it [4].\nThe main functions of the cognitive radio\
    \ networks (spectrum sensing, management,\nmobility, sharing) are represented\
    \ in a cycle called the cognitive radio cycle [5]. Cognitive\nNetworks manage\
    \ the problem of congestion frequencies by introducing the occasional use\nof\
    \ frequency bands that are not occupied by authorized users and are known as spectrum\n\
    holes. The CR network users can share the spectrum with primary users. Primary\
    \ users\nhave higher priority or authorization in the use of an available piece\
    \ of the spectrum, and\nuse the service to which the speciï¬c bandwidth is assigned,\
    \ thus maximizing the degree of\nspectrum utilization [6]. Secondary users of\
    \ the cognitive network have a lower priority\nand exploit the available spectrum\
    \ in such a way that they do not create interference with\nprimary users. The\
    \ fundamental work of each of the SUs is to detect and identify the\npresence\
    \ or absence of authorized users, known as primary users. It is usually achieved\n\
    by sensing the RF environment through a process called spectrum sensing. The way\
    \ of\nmeasuring and exploiting the spectral space is called spectrum coverage,\
    \ which is stated\nas being a frequency band that is not used by its PU, at a\
    \ speciï¬c time, in a speciï¬c\ngeographic area [7]. CR networks, along with device-to-device\
    \ communication, are two key\ntechnologies for efï¬cient spectrum sharing, especially\
    \ in next-generation networks [8,9].\nIn the current study, we will be concerned\
    \ with cooperative sensing, and especially\ndistributed learning and distributed\
    \ estimation methods about intelligent wireless sensor\nnetworks similar to [10].\
    \ Speciï¬cally, our aim is to estimate the total spectrum of three PUs\nwith overlapping\
    \ frequency bands. Capitalizing on the relevant literature, the problem has\n\
    been previously studied for either independent [11] or overlapping spectrums among\
    \ two\nPUs [12]. Additionally, the main contribution of the presented analysis\
    \ is the evaluation\nof the ATC diffusion-based method in more challenging and\
    \ practical scenarios, where\nsome frequency bands stop being utilized by some\
    \ PUs, or where there is a mobile SU\nnode in the network. The experimental results\
    \ verify the efï¬ciency of the method in such\nchallenging conditions.\nThe rest\
    \ of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the relevant spectrum\n\
    sensing works with the subject under consideration. Furthermore, in Section 3,\
    \ an analysis\nof the system model and the adopted methodology followed are made.\
    \ In addition,\nin Section 4, we discuss the acquired research results. Finally,\
    \ conclusions and future\ndirections are outlined in Section 5.\nThe following\

    2. Spectrum Sensing Methods\nIn this section, we will present the most common\
    \ spectrum detection techniques where\neach user individually decides if some\
    \ frequency band in the spectrum is available for\nuse. In particular, we will\
    \ focus on the most popular in wireless communications, such as\nEnergy Detector\
    \ (ED), Cyclo-stationary Feature Detection (CFD), Compressive Detection\n(CD),\
    \ and Matched Filter and Waveform-based technique [13,14]. Furthermore, we will\n\
    present recent works on spectrum sensing exploiting the capabilities of machine/deep\n\
    learning. Additionally, the section concludes with cooperative approaches.\n2.1.\
    \ Traditional Methods\nAn energy detector is a non-coherent method that identiï¬es\
    \ the primary signal based\non the detected energy. It is the most common method\
    \ due to its low computational\nand implementation complexity. Because of its\
    \ simplicity and non-requirements for prior\nknowledge of the primary signals,\
    \ the energy detector is the most popular technique in\ncooperatives spectrum\
    \ sensing. The signal is detected by comparing the output of the\ndetector to\
    \ a threshold, which depends on the noise level [15]. However, the detection\n\
    time to achieve a speciï¬c detection probability may be high. In addition to, the\
    \ detection\nperformance is subject to noise power uncertainty. An energy detector\
    \ cannot be used to\ndistinguish between the primary and CR signals. As a result,\
    \ CR users need to be strongly\nsynchronized and not transmit to the quiet period\
    \ [6,16].\nCyclo-stationary Feature Detection (CFD) exploits the periodicity of\
    \ the received\nPU signal to identify its presence. It is a detection method that\
    \ takes advantage of the\ncyclo-stationary characteristics of the received signal,\
    \ which is usually integrated into\n(i) sinusoidal carrier frequencies, (ii) pulse\
    \ sequences, (iii) signal periodicity, or (iv) its\nstatistical properties, such\
    \ as mean value and autocorrelation [17]. Thus, CFD can dis-\ntinguish between\
    \ a telecommunication signal and the noise due to robustness at noise\nuncertainty,\
    \ and performs better than the energy detector at low SNR. Although this re-\n\
    quires prior knowledge of the signal characteristics, CFD can distinguish CR transmissions\n\
    from various PU signals. It eliminates the requirement to synchronize the energy\
    \ detector\nin cooperative detection. A weakness of this method is the high computational\
    \ cost and\nlong detection time. Because of these issues, it is less common than\
    \ energy detectors in\ncooperative detection.\nIn the case of spectrum underutilization,\
    \ compressive sensing techniques for cognitive\nradio networks can be used to\
    \ approximate and recover the detected spectrum, which\nfacilitates the detection\
    \ of sparse primary signals in the wideband spectrum [18]. Hence,\nthe compressive\
    \ detection techniques provide promising solutions for the fast recovery of\n\
    wideband signals and facilitate wideband detection with acceptable computational\
    \ com-\nplexity. In wideband cooperative compressive detection, SU nodes individually\
    \ perform\ncompressive detection and cooperatively estimate the wideband spectrum\
    \ by exchang-\ning spectrum estimates, and iteratively reach a collective decision\
    \ by exchanging local\ndecisions [19].\nMatched Filter [20] is the optimal method\
    \ of detecting PUs signals when the transmit-\nted signal is known. The main advantage\
    \ is the short required time for achieving a certain\nprobability compared to\
    \ other methods that are discussed. The required number of samples\nincreases\
    \ with O(1/SNR) for a given false alarm probability Pf a to low SNR. However,\
    \ this\nrequires the SU to modulate the received signals. Therefore, this requires\
    \ perfect knowledge\nof the signal characteristics of PUs, such as bandwidth,\
    \ operating frequency, modulation\ntype, pulse shape, and format framework [21].\n\
    Waveform-based is usually used in wireless systems with known standards to help\n\
    synchronization, or for other purposes. Such standards include preambles, midambles,\n\
    spread-out sequences, etc. The preamble is a sequence transmitted before each\
    \ burst.\nSensors 2022, 22, 6692\n4 of 20\nThe midamble is transmitted in the\
    \ middle of a burst or a time slot. It uses the same model\nas the energy detector.\
    \ In the presence of a known pattern, detection can be performed\nby correlating\
    \ the received signal with a known copy of it. This method only applies to\nsystems\
    \ with known signal patterns and is called coherent detection. This method is\
    \ more\nreliable, has a better time convergence, and the performance of the algorithm\
    \ increases\nwith the length of the standard signal [21].\n2.2. Recent Methods\
    \ and Motivation\nApart from traditional spectrum sensing methods, researchers\
    \ have turned to ma-\nchine/deep learning [22], and Reinforcement and Federated\
    \ Learning for efï¬cient spectrum\nsensing. A reliable machine learning-based spectrum\
    \ sensing in CR networks is presented\nin [23]. Wang et al. surveyed dynamic spectrum\
    \ allocation based on reinforcement learning\nalgorithms in cognitive radio networks\
    \ [24]. Additionally, in [25], it is suggested that a\nmachine-learning-based\
    \ opportunistic spectrum access approach exploits multi-armed\nbandit (a powerful\
    \ reinforcement learning tool) and matching theory. In [26], machine\nlearning\
    \ techniques (support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest\n\
    neighbors (KNN)) are used to detect a PU in Mobile CR networks.\nClassical local\
    \ techniques can also be part of a cooperative framework for spectrum\nsensing,\
    \ which is usually employed to increase the detection reliability in either a\
    \ cen-\ntralized (e.g., Fusion Center), decentralized, or relay-assisted manner\
    \ [27â29]. In [30,31],\ncooperative spectrum sensing methods are suggested based\
    \ on an energy detector. Alter-\nnative methods perform spectrum sensing in CR\
    \ networks based on adaptive LMS-based\ndistributed cooperative methods [12,32,33].\
    \ Recently, in [34], spectrum sensing is solved\nvia federated learning, which\
    \ is exploited for data distribution and model training over\nmany devices. The\
    \ proposed method creates a common deep learning model for each user\ngroup in\
    \ the iterative process.\nIn the era of 5G networks, a high trend toward distributed\
    \ and cooperative schemes\nhas emerged for important operations in the physical\
    \ layer, with some remarkable examples\nbeing spectrum sensing [35], beamforming\
    \ [36], and channel estimation in the mmWave\nspectrum [37,38]. Due to the persistent\
    \ increase in smart devices, and the need for high\ndata rates with low latency,\
    \ 5G and beyond networks have become more important than\never. Essential technology\
    \ for its successful implementation is direct Device-to-Device\n(D2D) communication\
    \ (e.g., for extending capacity and enabling scalability) with Internet-\nof-Things\
    \ (IoT) being a characteristic short-range application that will highly beneï¬t\
    \ from\nthe capabilities of 5G networks. Focusing on spectrum sensing in a 5G\
    \ IoT network,\ngeographically distributed SUs can sense multiple channels owned\
    \ by PUs and decide via\ncooperation on available spectrum holes using learning\
    \ algorithms (i.e., centralized and\ndistributed).\nIn this study, distributed\
    \ cooperative spectrum sensing will concern us, since such\nschemes are adaptable\
    \ and more robust against changes in topology, especially in mobile\nand scalable\
    \ IoT systems [39]. Focusing on a mobile CR network with overlapping spec-\ntrum\
    \ PUs, a Bayesian machine learning approach for collaborative spectrum sensing\
    \ has\nbeen suggested in [40]. In a more recent study [41], the authors, considering\
    \ clusters of\nunmanned aerial vehicles, elaborated a diffusion-based distributed\
    \ cooperative spectrum\nsensing approach with adaptive weights, assuming a binary\
    \ state model to describe channel\noccupancy.\nIn the same direction, this study\
    \ focuses on the problem of multi-task [42] parameter\nestimation, assuming varying\
    \ spectrum sensing and adopting a distributed diffusion-based\napproach from a\
    \ well-established family of techniques, which are preferable in wireless\nsensor\
    \ networks due to lower communication overhead and more improved performance,\n\
    compared with the centralized and non-cooperative strategies. In particular, we\
    \ exploit\nthe distributed diffusion method ATC to cooperatively estimate the\
    \ aggregated spectrum,\nassuming a more complex scenario of three PUs with overlapping\
    \ spectrums. Hence,\nmultiple clusters of users are derived, each of which relates\
    \ to a common interest frequency\nSensors 2022, 22, 6692\n5 of 20\nband. According\
    \ to [11], a multi-task CR network is formulated. Initially, we evaluate the\n\
    efï¬ciency of ATC, assuming that the spectrum of PUs is varying (i.e., we cease\
    \ the use of\nsome frequency bands) and that secondary users are static. Finally,\
    \ an interesting aspect of\nthis work constitutes the performance evaluation of\
    \ the same method in the case where\none SU node is mobile.\n3. Materials and\
    \ Methods\nIn this section, we will present a description of the system model\
    \ that approximates\nthe total power spectrum in a speciï¬c SU node, the main aspects\
    \ of the adopted solution\nmethod, and the deï¬nition of the necessary structures\
    \ for the selected case study.\n3.1. System Model\nWe consider Q PUs and K SUs.\
    \ The power spectrum emitted by each PU can be\ncaptured as a linear combination\
    \ of some basis functions. Here, we choose Gaussian basis\nfunctions. Each SU,\
    \ through spectrum sensing, essentially detects the total spectrum from\nall of\
    \ the PUs of the area. The power spectrum from PU q is written as [43,44]\nSq\
    \ =\nB\nâ\nm=1\nbqm fm(ejÏ)\n= f Ïwq, q = 1, 2, . . . , Q\n(1)\nwhere fm(ejÏ)\
    \ = e\nâ (ÏâÏm)2\n2Ï2m\nand parameters Ïm, Ïm are the central frequency and stan-\n\
    dard deviation (these parameters are part of the system design and thus a priori\
    \ known),\nf Ï =\nh\nf1(ejÏ), f2(ejÏ), f3(ejÏ), . . . , fB(ejÏ)\ni\nis a vector\
    \ with the basis functions, scalars\n{bqm} denote the coefï¬cients of the basis\
    \ expansion for user q, and wq = [bq1, bq2, . . . , bqB]T\nis the vector with\
    \ the factors involved in the linear combination of the basis functions. The\n\
    representation in (1) can well approximate an essential part of the power spectrum\
    \ if B is\nsufï¬ciently large.\nThe power spectrum that a SU k detects by PU q\
    \ is subjected to attenuation due to\nthe propagation path loss denoted as pqk.\
    \ Path loss coefï¬cients are known and deï¬ned\nin advance in a training stage between\
    \ PUs with each SU. Training is usually repeated\nat regular intervals because\
    \ the coefï¬cients may change (slowly) in time due to node\nmovement. When the\
    \ transmitted spectrum travels from the PU to the SU, then the power\nspectrum\
    \ that is measured by the receiver of the SU k is pqkSq(ejÏ).\nHence, the total\
    \ power spectrum from all PUs at SU k is written as\nSt\nk =\nQ\nâ\nq=1\npqkSq(ejÏ)\
    \ + Ï2\nk\n=\nQ\nâ\nq=1\npqk f Ïwq + Ï2\nk\n= uk,Ïwo\nk + Ï2\nk\n(2)\nwhere wo\n\

    \ Â· B) and Ï2\nk the\nreceiver noise. Notice that wT\nq stands for the {bqm}s\
    \ involved in the power spectrum\ncomposition of PU q; thus, wo\nk concatenates\
    \ the {bqm}s of all PUs Q.\nAt each time instant i, the SU k observes the received\
    \ power spectrum in a discrete\nfrequency grid {Ïr}, in the interval [0, Ï] under\
    \ the measurement and/or model noise vk,r\nwith zero mean and covariance matrix\

    when all nodes want to estimate the same vector of parameters [12].\nEach vector\
    \ {wo\nk}K\nk=1 might consist of parameters of global interest to the whole net-\n\
    work, parameters of common interest to subsets of nodes including node k, and\

    3.3. Case Study: Cognitive Radio Network with Three PUs of Overlapping Frequency\
    \ Spectrum\nWe have considered a network of Q = 3 PUs with an overlapping power\
    \ spectrum,\nas illustrated in Figure 3, and a set of K = 11 geographically distributed\
    \ SUs that commu-\nnicate via a connected network, as shown in Figure 4. The nodes\
    \ are interconnected by a\ngraph G(V, E), where V = {1, 2, . . . , K} is the set\
    \ of nodes and E = {(i, j) : Node i â V is\nconnected with node j â V}.\nIn the\
    \ network, there is one global interest frequency band d and J = 6 common interest\n\
    frequency bands denoted as a, b, c, e, z, h, where PU1 = {a, b, c, d}, PU2 = {b,\
    \ d, e, h} and\nPU3 = {c, d, e, z}.\nEach of the following sets includes the nodes\
    \ interested in the corresponding frequency\nband, and thus, the parameters of\
    \ wo\nk involved in the spectrum approximation. Based on\nthis concept, we assume\
    \ that there are the following sets:\nâ¢\nFrequency zone a: C1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\

    \ = 6, we construct\na binary matrix whose columns refer to the number of global\
    \ and common frequency\nbands or interest parameter vectors, and its rows capture\

    \ bands of common interest,\na parametersâ vector of size Mcj Ã 1 should be estimated,\
    \ while for the global interest\nfrequency band, one parameters vector of size\
    \ Mg Ã 1 should be estimated. We create the\nmatrix Caug\nk\nof size L Ã (Mg +\
    \ âJ\nj=1 Mcj) based on the interests matrix C. At each row of the\nmatrix C,\
    \ the ï¬rst column element is duplicated Mg times, and each one of the rest elements\n\
    is duplicated Mcj times. Then, each row is duplicated L times. Hence, the augmented\n\
    matrix Caug\nk\nis created and the \"correct\" input matrix at ATC is Uaug = Caug\n\

    \ ATC method is based on Mean Square Deviation\n(MSD), assuming different combination\
    \ rules, i.e., a uniform clique and a relative variance\nwith adaptive weights.\

    \ the results of the ATC algorithm performance evalua-\ntion, which is used to\
    \ estimate the Q Â· B = Mk = Mg + âjâIk Mcj parameters that ap-\nproximate the\
    \ total power spectrum emitted by the three PUs. Here, we assume that\nM1 = M2\
    \ = . . . = MK = M. The problem is translated into a multiple interests (global\
    \ and\ncommon) parameter estimation problem.\nThe performance of the adopted method\
    \ was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations\nwith 50 independent runs [45].\
    \ We simulated a network consisting of Q = 3 PUs and\nK = 11 SUs, as illustrated\
    \ in Figure 3. Additionally, we have considered B = 16 Gaussian\nbasis functions\
    \ of amplitude normalized to one and standard deviation Ïm = 0.05. These\nfunctions\
    \ are involved in (2), and especially, in the creation of Uk,i in the linear model\
    \ of (6).\nFurthermore, each SU scans L = 50 channels over the normalized frequency\
    \ axis between 0\nand 1. The noise vk,i in (6) or (9) is zero-mean Gaussian with\
    \ a standard deviation varying\nbetween 0.04 and 0.16 for different k. Similarly,\
    \ the additive noise nk in path loss estimation\nis generated with Ïp â [0.03,\
    \ 1.25]. In Figure 5, we illustrate the noise power of each SU\nnode. The step-size\
    \ Âµk of the LMS adaptation at each node is equal to 0.02 âk. Additionally,\nwe\
    \ selected Mg = 10, Mc1 = 3, Mc2 = 5, Mc3 = 6, Mc4 = 7, Mc5 = 8, Mc6 = 9.\n1\n\

    \ 6692\n15 of 20\n4.1. Static SU Nodes and Varying Spectrum\nHere, the term varying\
    \ spectrum is utilized to capture the case where the PUs ceases to\nuse some of\
    \ the frequent zones a, b, c, d, e, z, h. In this case, we aim to examine the\
    \ behavior\nof the ATC algorithm by monitoring if the parametersâ estimation error\
    \ has the desired\nbehavior. SUs are not aware of these changes, but through the\
    \ measurements {dk,i, Uk,i}\nand the estimation error of the involved parameters\
    \ that approximate the total power\nspectrum, they learn of the changes that occur\
    \ in the broadcasting spectrum of the PUs.\nTo evaluate the above conditions,\
    \ we run the algorithm so that in different time intervals,\nthe use of a particular\
    \ frequency band is cancelled. The cancellation is achieved by setting\nzero values\
    \ to the corresponding optimal parameters in the augmented vector wk which is\n\
    used internally in the algorithm for estimating the MSD. Speciï¬cally, we selected\
    \ to cancel,\nin speciï¬c time intervals, the use of the following parameter vectors:\n\
    â¢\n15â20: Mg parameters of wg,\nâ¢\n60â70: Mc1 parameters of Ï1,\nâ¢\n110â120: Mc2\
    \ parameters of Ï2.\nIn Figure 6, we present the average performance of MSD error\
    \ for the aforementioned\ninterest vectors. As it is shown, the ATC method identiï¬es\
    \ this change in the sensing\nenvironment, which is captured in the MSD error\
    \ of these parameter vectors. For com-\nparison, we also plot the performance\
    \ of the non-cooperative LMS algorithm, setting the\nadjacent matrix as A = IK.\
    \ The results verify the importance of cooperation in relation\nto individual\
    \ estimation. Moreover, comparing the two methods for the estimation of the\n\
    combination weights, the superiority of adaptive ï¬ltering is veriï¬ed. The nodes\
    \ working\ntogether to achieve spectrum estimation do not know in advance which\
    \ neighboring nodes\nare affected by which model and which model affects their\
    \ own data. A node with different\ninterests may feed its neighbors with irrelevant\
    \ data, that is, with incorrect estimates that\nalter their own. The nodes gradually\
    \ adjust the weight they give to the estimates of that\nneighbor, which tends\
    \ to zero, so the effect of its estimate becomes negligible. That is,\nthe network\
    \ is divided into clusters-groups according to the interests of the nodes. As\
    \ we\nsee, the collaboration between members of a group with the same interest\
    \ leads to a better\nestimation of the parameters of interest. The weightsâ values\
    \ are a measure of trust that a\nnode gives to its neighboring node.\nFocusing\
    \ on the convergence of the ATC, we observe that in the case of the global\nparameters\
    \ vector, the algorithm starts to approach the steady state at iteration i = 1000.\n\
    However, much more iterations are needed in the case of the two common interest\
    \ parameter\nvectors for the MSD to attain a steady state. Additionally, an essential\

    \ Ï1, Ï2.\n4.2. Mobile CR Node\nIn this subsection, as a ï¬rst approach, we evaluate\
    \ the performance of ATC, assuming\nthat there is one mobile SU node in the network.\
    \ A moving SU changes position (x, y).\nHowever, this change may not necessarily\
    \ vary the frequency bands of interest and the\nneighbors. If changes occur, this\
    \ implies that the corresponding structures of the ATC\nalgorithm should be updated.\
    \ These structures relate to the path loss coefï¬cients between\nthe mobile SU\
    \ and the three PUs because it is location-dependent, the adjacency matrix\nA\
    \ and the interestsâ matrix C. To check the area in which the moving node is located,\n\
    we measure the nodeâs Euclidean distances from the three PUs and compare them\
    \ with\nthe corresponding transmission range of the PUs. Letâs assume that the\
    \ distances are\nd1, d2, and d3, respectively, and the transmission ranges are\
    \ R1, R2, and R3. For the speciï¬c\nexperiment, we considered R1 = 150, R2 = 165,\
    \ and R3 = 170. Based on Figure 3, we\nformulated the rules presented in Table\
    \ 2, which helps us to update the interestsâ matrix C\nand the structures that\
    \ depend on it. Moreover, in Table 3, we assume the characteristic\npoints of\
    \ the SU1 trajectory and the corresponding frequency zones of interest derived\
    \ from\nTable 2 under the selected values for the parameters R1, R2, R3.\nTable\
    \ 2. Rules to determine the frequency zone of a mobile node.\nRules\nFrequency\
    \ Zone\nd1 < R1 & d2 > R2 & d3 > R3\na\nd1 < R1 & d2 < R2 & d3 > R3\nb\nd1 < R1\
    \ & d2 > R2 & d3 < R3\nc\nd1 < R1 & d2 < R2 & d3 < R3\nd\nd1 > R1 & d2 < R2 &\
    \ d3 < R3\ne\nd1 > R1 & d2 > R2 & d3 < R3\nz\nd1 > R1 & d2 < R2 & d3 > R3\nh\n\
    Now, let us focus on Figure 7, which captures the MSD curves of those parameter\n\
    vectors that correspond to the frequency zones (i.e., e, z, h) that started to\
    \ be in the interests of\nthe SU1 node and that relate to the common interest\
    \ vectors Ï4, Ï5, Ï6. Focusing on Ï4, Ï5, Ï6\nand the convergence of the ATC,\
    \ we see that in the case of Ï5, Ï6 the algorithm approaches\nthe steady state\
    \ earlier, at iteration i = 500. However, more iterations are needed (at least\n\
    i = 1000) in the case of Ï4 to attain the steady state. An essential performance\
    \ distance is\ncaptured between the adaptive and the uniform weighting methods,\
    \ where the adaptive\nweights win. Finally, we observe an abrupt fall in the MSD\
    \ in the time instants 19 and 59,\nas indicated in Table 3, which shows that the\
    \ algorithm identiï¬es the new parameters of\ninterest of SU1.\nSensors 2022, 22,\

    j=1.\nIn concluding the evaluation part of the adopted ATC method, we see that\
    \ the al-\ngorithm is able to identify the changes in the interests of a SU, which\
    \ is reï¬ected in the\nerror curves. In either case, its performance remains intact,\
    \ achieving low error values that\nattain zero.\n5. Conclusions\nIn conclusion,\
    \ the estimation of the total power spectrum of three PUs was investigated\nvia\
    \ the ATC diffusion algorithm, which was tackled as a multi-task problem, having\n\
    promising results in each of the considered scenarios. We examined its efï¬ciency\
    \ for two\ndifferent weighting rules for the coefï¬cients in the combination step\
    \ of the algorithm.\nIn the case of the relative variance rule combined with the\
    \ adaptive estimation ï¬lter, MSD\nachieved better performance than the uniform\
    \ one. This is due to the fact that the noise\nproï¬le of the nodes is derived\
    \ based on the instant estimates of the parameters vector, both\nof them and their\
    \ neighbors.\nAn open issue in the above scenarios could be the usage of more\
    \ overlapping primary\nusers, which would, however, eliminate the zone of global\
    \ interest, and nodes would only\nestimate various common interest parameters.\
    \ Additionally, a variation of the examined\nSensors 2022, 22, 6692\n19 of 20\n\
    scenarios could concern the movement of more than one node, since, in practical\
    \ scenarios,\nmore SUs may be mobile.\nAlternatively, we could determine the combination\
    \ weights, taking into account only\nthe variance of two communicating nodes and\
    \ not of the whole neighborhood, and evaluate\nits beneï¬ts in the per node and\
    \ network MSD in the adaptive combination weights. Our\naim is to see the improvements\
    \ to MSD by experimenting with the parameters involved\nin the ATC method and\
    \ especially the step size Âµ, which is an important parameter that\nimpacts on\
    \ the convergence of the algorithm. Finally, it would be interesting to re-evaluate\n\
    the above parameter estimation problem, if we were using the Combine-Then-Adapt\
    \ or\nLMS-type incremental methods.\nAuthor Contributions: E.D. and M.T. conceived\

  explanation: 'Developing an end-to-end IoT system involves several components, spanning
    data collection, transmission, processing, and storage. Recent research focuses
    on automating these components to reduce human intervention and power consumption.


    Wireless communication is a vital aspect of IoT, and there are several protocols
    available for different use cases. Among these, cognitive radio networks (CRNs)
    and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) techniques offer dynamic spectrum usage, allowing
    IoT devices to adapt to the available spectrum and avoid interference.


    Security is another critical concern in IoT, especially given the vast amount
    of data being collected and transmitted. Researchers have explored techniques
    such as physical-layer security and blockchain to enhance the security of IoT
    devices and networks.


    Researchers are also actively working on addressing the energy constraints of
    IoT devices. One approach is energy harvesting, which involves collecting energy
    from ambient sources like solar, RF, or thermal energy. This energy can be used
    to power sensors and other components, reducing the reliance on batteries and
    extending device lifespan.


    In summary, the research efforts in automated systems for real-time irrigation
    management focus on improving efficiency, security, and sustainability. These
    advancements contribute to the vision of a connected and intelligent irrigation
    system that can optimize water usage, reduce operational costs, and enhance crop

    interfaceWireless interfaceProcessing interface 1. Introduction The Internet of
    Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that provides ubiquitous and massive connectivity.
    It promises an unlimited possibility in improving the quality of life (e.g., smart
    homes, intelligent diagnostics systems, autonomous driving vehicles, smart irrigation,
    smart cities, and many more) of end-user [1]. The IoT device is vast and encompasses
    numerous features at different layers, which can be challenging to understand
    the significance of different devices from different layers based on the type
    of problem it addresses. These problems are broadly classified as social, environmental,
    and economic development to transform an existing physical infrastructure into
    cyberâphysical infrastructure. IoT has much potential to gather resources and
    assist individuals by offering efficient services with smart cyberâphysical solutions.
    Smart healthcare, smart grid, smart water supply management, and smart city are
    IoT-based solutions that influence social factors. In connection to healthcare,
    lately, the Internet of Medical Things has emerged as a pioneering platform. [2].
    The authors of [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] investigated the smart healthcare
    framework to monitor the physical and mental health of the patients, and human
    activity recognition. This technology performs timely detection of an anomaly
    in an individual by collecting data using different types of sensors. To improve
    quality of life, we need to design an IoT network that facilitates access to essential
    services, transportation, and better environmental conditions. Thus a smart city
    application emerged by employing a network of smart devices. Examples of such
    applications include parking, waste management, sanitation, lighting, traffic,
    buildings, and the energy sector. Similarly, the smart energy industries solve
    the problem of generation, distribution, consumption, and demand analysis by integrating
    IoT devices. A few examples are smart wind turbines, smart hydro-power systems,
    smart grids, etc. In general, IoT also helps to enhance energy efficiency (EE)
    in electrical devices. Moreover, we use highways and roads to move consumable
    goods from one place to another. Therefore, the existing road infrastructure can
    be made smart by creating warning messages regarding weather conditions, road
    congestion, impending accidents, etc. Several emerging technologies empower smart
    applications like vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), vehicle-to-everything
    (V2X) data exchange service, device-to-device (D2D) connectivity [9]. These applications
    can be leveraged to solve the problem of fast and hassle-free parking and efficient
    traffic management through optimal routing mechanisms using different IoT sensors.
    Such sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors.
    The literature in [10], [11], [12], [13] enables smart transportation in future
    cities by ensuring the safety of the driver and reducing traffic congestion. It
    is achieved by using the Mood-Fatigue Analyzer (MFA) and camera-based eye detection
    method that uses the viola-jones algorithm to ensure the safety of the driver
    and traveler in the car. In todayâs era, the business prerequisites of the industry
    are automation, interconnection, and real-time data collection. Industrial IoT
    (IIoT) [14], [15] is the driving force of Industry 4.0. The enormous data generated
    by smart tracking systems [16], smart factories [17], and smart asset management
    [18] are exploited to achieve an optimized performance of the supply chain. These
    networks include embedded systems, microcontrollers, sensors and actuator networks
    (SANET), communication modules, etc. In [19], the authors have reviewed the motivation
    to apply IoT for big data analysis and the technological and social challenges
    associated with it. This type of application requires a continuous flow of information.
    Hence, the devices require more power compared to other applications. IoT-based
    cellular, non-terrestrial, and wide-area network connections are predicted to
    approach 5.9 billion by 2026 [20]. These wide-area network connections include
    sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and a communication interface that require
    batteries to run their sensing, processing, and transmission interfaces. These
    batteries have a finite capacity. Frequently recharging/changing these batteries
    results in change-over downtime and incurs huge operational costs. Moreover, at
    the current rate of carbon dioxide emissions, global temperatures have risen substantially
    from pre-industrial levels. Hence, there is a compelling need to plan future cities
    to be sustainable [21], [22]. Harvesting energy from natural sources is a promising
    self-sustainable solution that prolongs battery life, eliminates maintenance costs,
    and aids in long-term deployment. Particularly, photo-voltaic (PV) cells [23],
    [24] and radio frequency (RF) [25], [26] have been identified as cost-effective
    energy sources that enable on-site charging of rechargeable batteries for sustainable
    IoT applications. It is necessary to have a thorough understanding of IoT devices
    in terms of power, cost, and critical features (sensing interface, actuation interface,
    processing interface, data-storage interface, data-management interface, and communication
    interface) at different layers to assemble the self-sustainable IoT system design.
    However, no such architecture collaborates the function of three-layer, four-layer,
    five-layer, and seven-layer architecture design for sustainable IoT applications.
    So, there is a need to establish a clean and streamlined cross-layer architecture
    to bridge the gap between application requirements and IoT system design. The
    widely researched, self-sustainable IoT-enabled layered architecture design, compatible
    with various IoT applications, has been effectively illustrated in Fig. 1. In
    a self-sustainable layered architecture design, Fig. 1 represents every possible
    IoT service, device, and application congruously. The layered architectural design
    begins with the energy harvesting interface, which includes energy sources, transducers,
    trackers, and storage interface. Additionally, it demonstrates various optimization
    strategies to reap the maximum benefit of the harvested energy. Various IoT devices
    that require power to perform data sensing, transmission, processing, and accumulation
    at different layers, are presented. Next, the power consumption and cost of the
    device, associated with the functionality of a particular layer, are mentioned.
    Then, depending on the use of any device in the most suitable IoT application,
    the sensing, processing, transmission, and actuation interfaces of the layered
    architecture design are categorized in terms of power requirement, cost, and other
    critical factors. Finally, the business layer of the proposed framework is presented.

    Motivation and contribution Based on the state-of-art, we conclude that several
    studies have been conducted on EH-IoT networks (see Table 1), and a tutorial on
    EH-IoT networks based on the layered architecture design is missing. Moreover,
    no substantial survey has ever been performed to develop a self-sustainable IoT
    device based on application requirements by following a sequential set of IoT
    reference layer models as shown in Fig. 1. For energy harvesting, it is necessary
    to have a clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT
    devices. The framework involves generation process, storage mechanism, tracking
    energy consumption, and managing the supply of harvested energy. We have designed
    a framework for EH-IoT by dividing it into energy sources, energy transducers,
    energy trackers, energy management, and energy consumption interfaces. The proposed
    mapping of EH-IoT, along with the design framework, will help researchers and
    practitioners of this domain to reduce the time to collate knowledge and create
    a road map for their specific needs. The contributions of this survey are summarized
    as follows: â¢ We have classified IoT modules based on their applications. Next,
    each class has been divided into IoT device based layered architecture to study
    layer-specific power requirements (or demand) versus the sources (or supply).
    â¢ This is followed by a discussion on energy harvesting from several sources,
    which will act as an enabler of power source for EH-IoT. Also, the method to harvest
    and store that harvested energy is outlined by highlighting the currently available
    and emerging energy storage interfaces. â¢ We proposed a balanced and well-researched
    layers architecture design of self-sustainable IoT device for various IoT applications.
    We developed a single overview of all layersâ architecture and their relations
    with energy harvesting interfaces. â¢ The energy-saving and resource-optimization
    method for self-sustainable IoT design is discussed in terms of power and data
    optimization. Moreover, various methods to maintain balance among bandwidth, range,
    power consumption, and time constraints of IoT sensing, processing, and transmission
    interfaces are discussed by following a common framework of the EH interface.
    â¢ Insights on IoT-based energy harvesting interfaces that contribute to interoperability
    and the interfacing units such as sensing, processing, communication, and energy
    harvesting are discussed in IoT layered design. â¢ Finally, based on state-of-art
    literature, we highlight several open research issues and future possibilities
    for self-sustainable IoT device based on the layered architecture design. Table

    Table 1 indicates a complete summary of the existing survey papers based on different
    functionalities of devices. The functionalities of the device are shown based
    on different IoT interfaces from the cross-layer architecture design by considering
    their use in specific IoT applications. The different functionalities mainly incorporates
    the sensing & actuation, processing, EH, energy storage, data management and storage
    and wireless interfaces. 43% of the literature covers any four layers (mostly
    sensing and actuation, processing, EH, and wireless interface are covered under
    review). But most of the time these articles omit discussion on data management,
    and energy storage interfaces. We have covered all six interfaces. In contrast
    to the other surveys, our survey provides a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated
    overview of the proposed self-sustainable IoT device for diverse IoT applications.
    It is achieved by covering all the IoT interfaces from the cross-layer architecture
    design. Each interfacing region operates in the different layers of IoT device.
    The description of different interfaces is as follows: â¢ The sensing and actuation
    interface is a part of the physical layer and deals with different sensing and
    actuating devices for IoT applications. Moreover, the processing interface is
    also a part of the physical layer, which focuses on the number of micro-controllers
    and microprocessors used in different IoT applications. â¢ Once the data has been
    sensed and processed by sensing and processing interface of the physical layer
    architecture design, it needs to be sent among different devices for the exchange
    of information. This data transmission is carried out by a wireless interface
    unit which is a part of network layer in the IoT device based layer architecture
    design. â¢ The data management and storage interface is part of the processing
    layer. It is responsible for handling and organizing large amounts of data. This
    interface also includes certain protocols used at the application layer, like
    MQTT, AMPQP, and XMPP, which are the methods used for managing the data at the
    remote server. â¢ Finally, we need an energy-harvesting (EH) and energy storage
    interface to power the IoT devices. These interfacing units manage and store the
    power supply of IoT devices. For energy harvesting, it is necessary to have a
    clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT devices.
    The framework involves the generation process, storage mechanism, tracking energy
    consumption, and managing the supply of harvested energy. We have designed a framework
    for self-sustainable IoT device by dividing it into energy source units, energy
    transducers, energy tracker units, energy management units, and energy consumption
    units. The proposed mapping of self-sustainable IoT device, along with the design
    framework, will help researchers and practitioners of this domain to reduce the
    time to collate knowledge and create a road map for their specific needs. Some
    of the available research papers based on the above interfacing layers are discussed
    below. In [27], the authors describe the overview of IoT in terms of wireless,
    sensing, and actuation interfaces by considering the middleware layer. This layer
    enables interoperability across various IoT devices, applications, and platforms.
    They define the suitability of the sensors, actuators, and different communication
    protocols such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, and WiFi for IoT applications in a variety
    of applications, including healthcare, transportation, and smart cities. The authors
    of [28] described the cloud-centric/Internet-centric architecture for the IoT
    networking, sensing, and processing interface. The intention is to offer an integrated
    platform for developing analytics tools, computer graphic designers, specialists
    in artificial intelligence, and sensing service units. Therefore, a single platform
    can combine storage, computation, and visualization paradigms to improve IoT performance
    for various applications. Apart from this, authors in [29] focused on providing
    a promising approach to build a smart industrial system by using the four-layered
    architecture design. Authors in [30] focused on handling the security and privacy
    issue of the IoT paradigm at the perception and processing layers. IoT sensors
    generate massive data to make it applicable at the application interface. But
    unauthorized users generate several attacks, such as brute force, phishing, man-in-the-middle
    attack, spoofing, and denial of service attacks in the lower layers of IoT system
    design to steal valuable data. To address this issue, authors paved forward various
    technologies such as blockchain and physical layer security to secure the data.
    Authors in [31] discussed the state-of-the-art protocols and applications in the
    emerging era of IoT networks. They consolidate most IoT applications, including
    smart wearables, brain-sensing headphones, and embedded skin patches, by concentrating
    on the taxonomy of three- and five-layered architectural designs. The architecture
    section of this paper also considers fog computing, which has never been considered
    earlier but lacks a discussion on data management and power interfaces. Despite
    the advancement in IoT technology, work on sensing, processing, and actuation
    interfaces are still underway in terms of power requirement. To overcome the power
    interface units, authors in [32], [33] covered a thorough review of energy harvesting
    sources, energy storage devices, and associated topologies of energy harvesting
    systems for energy-constrained IoT networks. It mainly focused on distribution
    approaches, conversion modules, storage devices, and control units to minimize
    circuit losses. Similarly, authors in [1] examine several strategies that facilitate
    the efficient use of energy harvesting as a proxy for different IoT devices in
    an efficient manner. It also investigates the effective checkpointing and timestamping
    methods to power IoT devices without depending on conventional power supplies.
    In addition to utilizing renewable energy sources to power IoT devices, new machine
    learning and wireless communication techniques for EH-IoTs are being researched.
    These include the backscatter communication technique, packet-less IoT communication,
    and reinforcement learning. The authors of [34] present energy harvesting solutions
    and energy efficient approaches for information and communication technology (ICT)
    by dividing the discussion of the paper into two parts: Green of ICT and Green
    by ICT. Green of ICTencompasses a wide range of topics, including green data center,
    network, and device approaches. Furthermore, Green by ICT provides energy harvesting
    strategies and resource-saving options for device-to-device communication. Further
    on, Narrow-Band IoT (NB-IoT) technology that increases battery life is also covered.
    A comprehensive analysis of the most recent energy harvesting technologies for
    IoT sensing devices is provided by the authors in [35], who also emphasize the
    IoT systemâs potential for energy autonomy. In addition, the authors describe
    two case studies of IoT systems that utilize energy harvesting via solar and RF
    energy sources to provide energy autonomy for sensing devices. Both systems employ
    Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons as sensors, which broadcast the sensed parameters
    to BLE-capable terminals like mobile devices. The mobile devices then transmit
    this data to the cloud via internet services. The authors of [36] focus on the
    wireless interface of the current and future IoT applications, including 5G cellular
    networks, wide-area networks, and unlicensed band communication. It is accomplished
    by utilizing grant-free access, channel coding for short-packet communication,
    non-orthogonal multiple access, and on-device intelligence to make the wireless
    unit energy-efficient, highly reliable, low latency, and scalable. In [37], the
    authors emphasized the data management unit by proposing a proportional trade-off
    between high security and reduced energy usage of IoT devices. It employs a context-aware
    technique to safeguard IoT data while consuming minimal energy. The authors also
    considered the scope of artificial intelligence and Software-Defined Networking
    (SDN) to deploy a secure, energy-efficient IoT network. Similarly, in [38], [39],
    the authors presented different approaches to predictive analysis and classification
    methods to secure the data at minimal power consumption. It shows that during
    data transmission, most of the power is consumed when data packet collisions occur,
    packet overheads are unaddressed, redundant data is present, and a longer distance
    exists between the transmitter and receiver. Additionally, they highlight a number
    of efficient ways to lower energy consumption in both single-hop and multi-hop
    communication networks. The existing studies involves shallow discussion on the
    interfacing units within the IoT context. However, it fails to provide detailed
    information about the specific types of sensing, processing, and communication
    devices involved, as well as their corresponding power consumption in the layer
    architecture design. From the state-of-art, it has been seen that there is no
    substantial survey has ever been performed to develop a self-sustainable IoT device
    based on application requirements by following a sequential set of IoT reference
    layer models. As a result, our proposed framework filling the gap by mapping the
    IoT applications to the devices and, subsequently, the devices to the energy harvesting
    (EH) interface. The first step in this process involves identifying the layer
    architecture design for self-sustainable IoT device. Each layer accommodates different
    devices for different IoT applications. These IoT devices require a ubiquitous
    supply of power for their operations. To fulfill the power requirement of different
    devices that fall into different layers of IoT applications, there is a need for
    energy harvesting sources, transducers and storage interfaces. So, this necessitate
    the development of the self-sustainable IoT device that establish a connection
    among IoT application, devices and energy-harvesting interface. Download : Download

    for effective utilizing the harvested energy are presented. Then, in Section 6,
    a comprehensive surveys is highlighted for various IoT applications based on the
    devices of different IoT layers and energy harvesting interfaces to establish
    the mapping between the IoT devices and the energy harvesting interfaces. Additionally,
    Section 7 discusses open issues and future trends. Finally, the paper is concluded
    in Section 8. 2. Standard layered architecture for IoT-enabled applications While
    designing an IoT system, it is essential to have an understanding of the devices
    and their organization. It is important to visualize the organization of different
    devices acting as a connected system. This Section describes the first step towards
    the strategic mapping between applications to layers and layers to devices. The
    designer has to take care of not only the functionality but also the coverage
    area, power requirements, architecture, and cost factors associated with the communication
    system. The standard functionalities are sensing, actuation, processing, data
    storage, and management. The cost factors include developmental, fabrication,
    and maintenance costs. This complex system model can be organized into a layered
    architecture. The design approach helps the system designer in two ways, namely,
    to create functional interactions and subsequently design communication strategies
    based on those interactions. In the first phase, the required functionalities
    are organized into different layers (e.g., starting from sensing any event to
    a final consumable product/application). The interfaces are laid down in the second
    phase to exchange information (intra and inter-layer communication). We have presented
    an example in Fig. 3. There are several position papers and surveys that deal
    with layer architecture design of IoT device [40], [41], [42]. Despite the refinement
    in IoT system design, the state-of-the-art has yet to have a single framework
    on layer architecture of IoT device that is widely accepted. While one group of
    researchers focused on the protocol, another group concentrated on the cloud-based
    architecture. In 2014, Rockwell Automation, Cisco, and IBM presented a seven-layer
    architectural model for IoT. However, the one proposed by the IoT world forum
    aimed to fulfill the space between application requirements and system design
    [43], [44]. The seven-layer architecture is an updated version of the five-layer
    architecture that introduced edge computing, fog computing, and big data processing.
    Fig. 3 depicts all the necessary functions and collaborative overview of several
    three-layer, four-layer, five-layer, and seven-layer architectural reference models.
    The role and requirements of each layer in the self-sustainable IoT devices, applications,
    and services is discussed in the following sections. In this work, the seven-layer
    interface has been consolidated into a five-layer architecture which is discussed
    below. A typical IoT application requirement can be connected to a self-sustainable
    system design by identifying the mapping between interfacing sub-layers [31].
    We shall use this layered architecture to review the power requirement of IoT
    devices. Next, we present a brief discussion on different layers covering the
    functionality, whereas an in-depth discussion on the IoT devices can be found
    in Section 3. Download : Download high-res image (753KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Different layer architecture designs for IoT device. 2.1. Business
    layer The main aim of the business layer is to handle the entire IoT system. It
    communicates with the application layer and consumes the information available
    at that layer. It can alter business operations and benefit the overall operation
    of the IoT network. 2.2. Application layer The application layer provides application-oriented
    services to the end users. A huge number of IoT applications have been developed
    that cater to different services such as smart home, smart transportation, smart
    infrastructure management, and many more sustainable IoT applications have been
    broadly categorized into three classes, namely, social, business and environmental.
    2.3. Processing layer This layer is referred to as the middleware layer, and it
    is responsible for storing, processing, and analyzing a large amount of information
    from the connectivity layer. It incorporates database management, cloud computing,
    and analytics of big data-based technologies. The processing layer encompasses
    two most important sub-layer interfaces that recreate a crucial part of IoT system
    design, e.g., (a) data storage/accumulation interface (b) data management/abstraction
    interface. 2.4. Connectivity layer The connectivity layer mainly deals with the
    transmission of useful information in an efficient and timely manner. The layer
    includes all networking elements of IoT. This layer includes wireless communication
    protocols such as Z-Wave, LoRa, Zigbee, Thread, Wi-Fi, SigFox, Bluetooth, and
    cellular communication. 2.5. Physical layer (Perception layer) The physical layer
    is the initial layer of the IoT reference model that deals with the things/devices
    of IoT. The âthingsâ in IoT refers to different end devices that transmit and
    receive data. The layer includes sensors, actuators, and controllers. The power
    supply is also managed through this layer. Multiple interfacing sub-layers exist
    between the physical and connection layer (as depicted in Fig. 3), namely, the
    sensing and actuation interface, power supply/monitoring interface, pre-processing
    interface, and temporary storage interface. Moreover, a detailed discussion on
    sensors and actuators, which are part of the layer, is discussed in Section 3.5.1
    The following Section goes through the power, cost, and critical features of IoT
    devices at different layers to assemble the self-sustainable IoT system design.
    3. Power and cost required for self-sustainable IoT devices in the layer architecture
    design This Section discusses the power or voltage and the associated cost of
    operating different IoT layers. IoT devicesâ power consumption is crucial in identifying
    suitable energy harvesting interfaces to make them sustainable. Moreover, different
    IoT devices consume power at different layers based on their functioning. However,
    business layers need not be mentioned in this Section, as this layer do not involve
    physical IoT devices that consume power. So, this layer mainly do not contribute
    towards the sustainable IoT device. Moreover, this layers deal with application-oriented
    services involving different groups and business processes. Above this, we look
    at the cost requirement and critical features of different types of microcontrollers,
    sensors and actuators network (SANET), and communication modules to make the architecture
    of IoT device self-sustainable in different smart applications as discussed below:
    3.1. Application layer The application layer protocols play a significant role
    in sustaining the IoT devices for different applications as it establishes the
    communication among things, devices, or objects with different application interfaces.
    Cloud-based communication protocols often improve connectivity rates to ensure
    stability, durability, and productivity through better information access. The
    most commonly used application layer protocols are Websocket, Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Extensible Messaging
    and Presence Protocol (XMPP), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), Representational
    State Transfer (RESTful Services) and Data Distribution Services (DDS). These
    protocols can be employed in different IoT applications for sustainable operations
    to provide a strategic mapping between the application layer with other layers.
    Below we mention different communication protocols to link a connection between
    IoT devices and the cloud. â¢ Advanced message queuing protocol (AMQP): It is an
    application layer protocol that facilitates clientâserver communications between
    cloud and IoT nodes. This open-access based protocol contains more message overheads
    and is not accepted widely [45]. â¢ Message queue telemetry transport (MQTT): MQTT
    is a lightweight communication protocol based on publishâsubscribe-based architecture
    [46], which allows the client device to subscribe to the broker for receiving
    data from the server (publisher) through the topic. In the existing literature,
    MQTT ensured the reliable reception of messages offering different quality of
    services (QoS) [47], [48], [49]. â¢ Constrained application protocol (CoAP): It
    is a web communication protocol with constrained nodes and a restricted network.
    It also facilitates a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) for smooth network integration.
    It mostly provides communication among machine-to-machine networks and uses the
    HTTP and publishâsubscribe architecture with various commands. In comparison to
    the MQTT, the centralized device in CoAP uses a universal resource identifier
    (URI) [50]. In comparison to available protocols, MQTT offers better QoS, throughput,
    data protection, low latency [51], low packet loss [52], low power consumption
    and restricted bandwidth usage [53], [54]. The widely available cloud service
    providers are xively, grove stream, carriots, things worx, things speak, plotty,
    amazon web services (AWS), microsoft azure and many more. 3.2. Processing layer
    In this subsection, we discuss the different computing platforms that is responsible
    for making the decision based on the data sensed from the sensor and communicated
    to the central server for analysis, computation, and storage. The power consumption
    of the processing layer services is very high, and the cost requirement is moderate
    and varies from different service providers such as Xively, Grove Stream, Carriots,
    Plotty, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services, and many more. Based on the intense
    survey, it is noticed that there is no criteria for selecting these data processing
    services for particular IoT applications based on the IoT device requirement.
    The processing layer mainly incorporated the hierarchical computing platforms
    for the data operation, as discussed below: â¢ Cloud computing: In a wide variety
    of IoT applications, storing, processing, and analyzing unstructured data in a
    well-manageable form is a significant challenge. Cloud services are the most common
    platform for monitoring, analyzing, and storing huge IoT data. However, as the
    number of IoT devices increases, processing a huge amount of data on a single-layer
    platform leads to network congestion and an increase in the loss of data packets.
    So processing data on a single layer for a longer interval is not feasible due
    to the high latency and limited bandwidth per user. As a result, Cloud-computing
    is considered as a non-optimal approach for distributed processing of IoT data
    generated by different sensors and other devices at lower layers. So, fog and
    edge computing came into existence to address this challenge and maintain highly
    responsive IoT applications with low latency [55]. â¢ Fog computing: To overcome
    the challenges in cloud computing, it is suggested to distribute data processing
    across the middle region of the processing layer rather than directly sending
    data to the cloud service (final region of processing layer). This process, known
    as Fog computing, involves handling data as close to the connectivity layer. It
    will reduce the latency and network congestion to a larger extent [56]. Fog computing
    is considered to be the best as it may link to the nearby edge device for analyzing
    and transformation that are later supported by the cloud services for storage
    and processing. â¢ Edge computing: Although the concept of Fog computing solves
    all the limitations of Cloud computing, the concept of Edge computing came into
    origination to further minimize the latency. The main aim of Edge computing is
    to bring a IoT device closer to the data processing, computation and accumulation
    layer rather than relying on the cloud server. So that it can preprocess data
    and only forward the metadata by reducing the bandwidth requirement per device.
    Fog and edge computing can be employed in various IoT applications, such as smart
    traffic systems to enable the warning system by generating real-time warnings
    using the edge service [57]. The smart metering system also uses fog, edge, and
    cloud services to analyze the energy consumption of different households, industries,
    hospitals, schools and many more. Such analysis generates more data and uses a
    larger bandwidth. To address this, a hierarchical fog service is proposed [44],
    [58] as a solution by interconnecting them with a different edge service employed
    on each meter to reduce latency. On the other hand latency-tolerant data may be
    sent directly to the cloud services platforms for processing and storage. Apart
    from this, it is also used in various other IoT applications, such as smart hospitals,
    smart homes, smart industries, smart cities, and many more [59], [60], [61] to
    process data with low latency and high responsiveness. 3.3. Connectivity layer
    In this subsection, we discuss the various types of wireless communication protocols
    for enables communication from the device-to-device and the device-to-access point.
    Additionally, the characteristics of a protocol in terms of its bandwidth, data
    rate, lifespan, and cost are provided. 3.3.1. Device to device/device to access
    point wireless protocol Communication via IoT devices involves data transfer from
    D2D and the device to the access point gateway. The IoT ecosystem incorporates
    billions of smart devices, but they have significant limitations e.g. processing
    speed, power, lifetime, and range. Since IoT devices mainly operate at low power,
    commercially available communication devices for device-device communication are
    Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), WiMAX, cellular, Bluetooth (IEEE 802.15.1), Z-Wave, Zigbee,
    6LowPAN (IEEE 802.15.4), BLE 5.0 (IEEE 802.15.6), SigFox, LoRa, RFID, Near field
    communication (NFC), etc. Classification of these devices based on coverage area
    is shown in Fig. 4. A comparative study on the above-discussed communication protocols
    is presented in Table 2. In 2016, a new standard for energy harvesting was launched
    as ZigBee green power (GP) for wireless sensor networks [84]. The ZigBee GP specifications
    and the IEEE 802.15.4 networking protocol are used in energy-harvesting ZigBee-based
    communication protocol applications that operate on a low-power microcontroller
    framework [85]. IEEE 802.11ah is another framework that achieves a lower data
    rate but has a greater coverage area than traditional Wi-Fi operating above 1
    GHz. In this frequency range, absorption by buildings and other objects increases
    significantly. Hence, 802.11ah is an ideal candidate to be used for IoT networks.
    The analytical expression of throughput for IEEE 802.11ah has been obtained in
    [86]. Download : Download high-res image (180KB) Download : Download full-size

    deals with a temporary and permanent memory device to store data. It also involves
    the collection and processing of data on virtual storage systems, such as cloud,
    fog, and edge, and how the data can be structured. The microcontroller board (temporary
    storage interface) can have two types of memory, i.e., volatile (RAM) and non-volatile
    (e.g., flash, EEPROM) memories. Volatile memory requires continuous power, while
    non-volatile memory requires power on demand. 3.5. Physical layer In this subsection,
    we discuss several types of sensing and actuating devices that are utilized in
    various IoT-based smart applications. The power utilization and the associated
    cost to fabricate each sensor are described in Table 3. The cost of sensors has
    been taken from amazon.com. The search keyword was âIoT sensorsâ and visited on
    5th January, . Sensors with the capability of harvesting energy can be reused.
    Thus the overall power consumed by the sensing system reduces significantly and,
    in effect, extends the operation time of an IoT device as discussed in [15], [87],
    [88], [89], [90], [91], [92]. In this Section, we examine different types of sensors
    and actuators and list out possible areas of application in connection to IoT
    system design. Table 3. Comparison of sensors employed in sustainable IoT designs.

    60 mA (AS), 2 mA (SS)/ V 18.99 3.5.1. Sensing interface A sensor is typically
    a device that senses or measures physical changes in the surrounding environment,
    such as thermistors, light-dependent resistors, magnetic field-based sensors.
    A response is created whenever there is any change in the physical or chemical
    state of objects in the vicinity of the sensor. This response is measured and
    analyzed by the sensors [93]. We specifically discuss a few sensors used for a
    particular IoT application. We also list out the associated parameters required
    to achieve specific design objectives. Velocity This type of sensor measures consecutive
    positions at known intervals and computes the rate at which the movable object
    position varies at different times. Based on the working principle, velocity sensors
    can be of two types, e.g., linear and angular. A linear sensor measures the rectilinear
    motion, and an angular sensor measures the spin rate of an entity. Examples of
    velocity sensors include doppler-effect sensors, accelerometers [11], and gyroscopes.
    Such sensors mainly find applications in smart vehicles, traffic monitoring systems,
    smart cities [93]. Proximity The proximity sensor detects the location of a neighboring
    object without making any physical contact [94]. It emits infrared waves and senses
    the presence of any object by measuring the difference of signal indicating return
    status [95]. Its use can be inductive, capacitive, ultrasonic, photoelectric,
    and magnetic [96]. Moreover, it is employed in several places to count the number
    of cars and objects in applications like smart parking and smart homes. Position
    The position sensor uses a motion detection mechanism to determine whether humans
    or other objects are within a specific region. Examples of position sensors are
    rotary encoders and hall effect sensors. This type of sensor is used in typical
    hospital surveillance systems that track patients, nurses, and doctors [97]. In
    [98], Bluetooth low energy (BLE) is also utilized to monitor the real-time location
    of people working in an underground mine. Temperature Temperature sensor calculates
    the heat intensity of a person to assess ambient conditions using non-contact-based
    or contact-based mechanisms. The contact-based sensor works when it is in physical
    touch with the object. However, the non-contact-based sensor measures the temperature
    using the convection and radiation method [99]. Typical examples of temperature
    sensors include thermocouples and thermistors. Such sensors are used in smart
    irrigation, smart healthcare, and environment monitoring [100]. Chemical Chemical
    sensors measure the chemical composition of the overall environment. It operates
    by detecting chemical reactions or a set of chemicals. Some examples of chemical
    sensors are breath analyzers, olfactometers, and smoke detectors. These sensors
    are typically employed in different IoT applications like smart cities, smart
    buildings, smart irrigation, air quality monitoring [101], etc. Force The Force
    sensor detects the amount of stress and converts it into an output signal. Examples
    of such a sensor include the strain gauge and pressure switch. These sensors are
    applied to numerous IoT applications, e.g., smart buildings, intelligent construction,
    medical monitoring [102], etc. Light The light sensor is a passive device that
    receives energy from light and transforms this energy into an electrical signal
    [103]. Hence an external power source is not needed in this case. Infrared sensors,
    photodetectors, and flame detectors are some of their examples. Biomolecular Biomolecular
    sensor translates metabolic reactions into electrical signals. These sensors monitor
    several biological factors, e.g., tissue, antigen, antibodies, hemoglobin level,
    glucose, and nucleic acid. Examples of such sensors are pulse oximeters, electrocardiographs,
    and various others that measure the physical and chemical changes in the human
    body. Humidity The humidity sensor first picks up the amount of water vapor in
    the air and then converts it into an equivalent electrical signal. The humidity
    level can be calculated in different ways, e.g., absolute, relative, and mass
    ratio. Hygrometer, soil moisture indicator, temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11),
    and so on are some of its examples. 3.5.2. Actuation interface An actuator is
    an element of a device that drives the system by converting the available energy
    into physical movement. An actuator needs a control signal and an energy source
    to operate. For IoT applications, actuators are mainly two types, i.e., continuous
    and binary actuators. A relay is an example of a binary actuation interface with
    two stable states, either latched (ON) or unlatched (OFF). Binary actuators consume
    full power or no power in the ON and OFF state, respectively. A motor is an example
    of a continuous actuator, as it can rotate through an angle of 360Â°. The speed
    and direction of a motor are governed by a microcontroller with pulse width modulation
    (PWM) signal pins. Next, we discuss the operation of some commonly used actuators.
    Servo motor A servo motor includes a direct current (DC) motor with two wires,
    a gear line, a potentiometer, an integrated microcontroller IC and a shaft (output
    spine). The shaft is mounted at a particular angular position by sending a control
    signal to the servo via a microcontroller. However, it can rotate up to 180Â° only.
    The servo motor consumes power only in position control mode. Servo motor is used
    in different IoT devices such as dual-axis solar panels (self-sustainable IoT),
    smart positioning, e.g., in an elevator (smart infrastructure), movement of a
    smart robot, computer numerical control (CNC) machine, and automatic production
    in smart industries. Relay The relay is a programmable electrical switch to energize
    (ON) or de-energize (OFF) devices that consume high voltage, current, or both.
    Hence it is an intermediate device that connects high-voltage devices and microcontrollers.
    It comes with two sets of pins. One set is used for a microcontroller or low-voltage
    device, and the other is used for a high-voltage device. Relays are part of most
    IoT applications to control the devices based on the controlling signals from
    interfaced microcontrollers. One of the examples is smart irrigation to energize
    and de-energize the water pump based on the controlling signals. Stepper motor
    The DC voltage drives a stepper motor, and it rotates in discrete steps. Such
    a motor consists of several coils organized in a group known as âphaseâ. Only
    a single series phase is energized at a time, and the motor rotates one step.
    Its rotating position, speed, acceleration, and deceleration can be precisely
    controlled. Like the servo motor, the stepper motor is not limited in rotation.
    It requires additional hardware and power supply to complete a single rotation.
    A stepper motor consumes power to lock in and remain in position command. Its
    application domain is limited to automation, robotics, 3-D printer, and X-Y plotter.
    Hydraulic actuator A hydraulic actuator consists of a fluid engine that utilizes
    hydraulic power to enable mechanical operation. The mechanical movement is then
    transformed into linear, rotating, or oscillatory motion. Its application domain
    is restricted to single-axis movement of any heavy load, braking system, heavy
    load lifting/balancing system, and radial engines DC motor DC motor is the most
    commonly used actuator in electronics projects. It is available in different sizes
    to handle various activities. It consists of permanent magnets and loops of wire.
    When the device is switched ON, the loops induce a magnetic field, which interacts
    against the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. Pneumatic actuator The pneumatic
    actuator transforms the energy shaped by vacuum or compressed air in linear or
    rotational movement at high pressure. It converts pressure into force. Pneumatic
    actuators can generate a large amount of force from relatively minor variations
    in pressure. 3.5.3. Processing interface In processing and controlling interface,
    we list out different types of microcontrollers boards. The widely used microcontrollers
    in this layer are Arduino UNO [104], Raspberry Pi [105], and NodeMCU ESP8266 [106].
    The microcontrollers along with their processing speed, operating voltage, characteristics
    and the cost are tabulated in Table 4. Depending on the energy consumed by a sensor
    node, the following operational states have been defined, namely, active state
    (AS), sleep state (SS), ultra low power active state (ULPAS), low power active
    state (LPAS) and low power state (LPS). The most commonly used processor is MSP432.
    There are typically four low power modes (LPM) in MSP432 processor. LPM 3, LPM
    4 refer to deep sleep states, while LPM 3.5 and LPM 4.5 refer to stop or shut
    down state. The operational, ADC states of a MSP432 processor along with the current
    rating and cost are depicted in Table 5. Table 4. Comparison among different microcontroller

    4. EH techniques: Different components required for self-sustainable IoT devices
    In this Section, commonly used sources of energy harvesting are discussed. Subsequently,
    EH transducers, standards and energy trackers are outlined. Next, we list the
    amount of power generated through harvesting, the cost of those harvesters, and
    the applications that utilize the effective harvested power. Frequent battery
    replacement in devices is a time-consuming and costly process, as it requires
    human intervention. Further, access to IoT devices is limited in remote locations.
    Additionally, many IoT devices are deployed in several IoT applications, making
    it difficult to run on battery throughout their life. To tackle these issues,
    harvesting energy is seen as a critical enabler technology that reduces dependence
    on batteries [35]. A battery life may be extended indefinitely subject to the
    fact that the converted electrical energy is more than the minimum energy requirement
    [107]. EH modules integrated with WSNs are referred to as energy-harvesting wireless
    sensor networks. These integrated modules collect energy by utilizing external
    sources, i.e., RF, solar, wind, vibration, and thermal. Since the harvested energy
    is stochastic and unstable, the transmission parameters of the WSN need dynamic
    adjustment to maintain a sustainable operation. The design methodology of energy-efficient
    IoT devices is explored in [108]. For energy harvesting, it is necessary to have
    a clear design framework to manage energy flow for self-sustainable IoT devices.
    The framework involves the generation process (source, transducer, and converter),
    storage mechanism, and managing the supply of harvested energy. The proposed mapping
    of EH-IoT and design framework are shown in Fig. 5. It will help the researchers
    and practitioners to build a system for a specific use case. Next, we discuss
    the different interfaces of Fig. 5 one by one. Download : Download high-res image

    interfaces, BW refers to bandwidth. 4.1. EH sources WSN is the fundamental building
    block of IoT. Moreover, considering the duty cycle, the battery life of WSN is
    lessened to just a few days as nodes remain active most of the time. Hence, battery
    life plays a significant role in overall energy consumption. Energy harvesting
    sources can be categorized into external and ambient. Further categorization and
    examples of these sources are shown in Fig. 6. The ambient sources are accessible
    within the surrounding region of energy harvesting objects. These sources can
    either be static or dynamic in nature [21]. A static source provides a predictable
    energy level, while a dynamic source generates energy randomly or periodically.
    The external sources emit energy to the nearby surroundings, such that the devices
    can harvest from this emission. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download

    Light The photovoltaic (PV) effect is the standard method of extracting electrical
    energy from light sources. Based on the composition, PV cells are of the following
    type [91]: â¢ Mono-crystalline: It offers 15%â24% efficiency, however, it is quite
    costly. â¢ Poly-crystalline: This cell offers 14%â20.4% efficiency, and it is less
    costly as compared to the mono-crystalline one. â¢ Thin-film: It is the cheapest
    cell and can absorb low-intensity light. However, it is less efficient 8%â13.2%.
    PV cells are commonly known as solar cells. Light energy can be harvested in the
    following IoT applications: environment monitoring, smart homes, and commercial
    buildings. There has been considerable research effort to power IoT networks using
    light energy in remote locations. The author in [109] employed an eco-sensing
    method that offers a wide range of light energy harvesting technology. It also
    shows that nodes in an IoT network react more to light energy than other sources,
    thus making the system highly efficient. To power a beacon node, the design methodology
    of a light-harvesting device is introduced in [110]. Similarly, in [111], a light-harvesting
    circuit has been proposed to provide sufficient power to the Bluetooth low-energy
    node. Although the aforementioned IoT network has good scope in terms of application,
    it cannot support an achievable information rate with high efficiency. In [112],
    a power controller is developed for a current-deprived voltage control oscillator
    (VCO). This controller generates a power of W, for a solar irradiance of lx. Light
    energy is stochastic and intermittent, which is very difficult to predict. So
    maintaining a continuous power flow using light energy requires adopting specific
    mechanisms or principles. The feedback principle is commonly employed in [112]
    to ensure a continuous power flow. For example, in [113], the authors achieved
    a continuous power flow with controlled voltage or current. An analytical connectivity
    model, a zero-energy IoT system, is proposed in [114], where the networking elements
    are solar-powered. Typically, at 25 Â°C ambient temperature, the solar panel can
    harvest about power. A solar panel has 15% conversion efficiency and converts
    the harvested power into 15 mW/cm2 power [115]. Only 70% of the harvested power
    is consumed at the PWM circuitâs output. The remaining harvested power leaks into
    the atmosphere. A cluster-based algorithm is proposed in [107], which enhances
    the utilization of harvested energy. Moreover, the different light intensity in
    indoor and outside environments results in different amount of harvested energy.
    The efficiency of harvested light in the indoor environment is of the one produced
    in the outdoor environment. Several authors have presented analytical and experimental
    models considering light harvesting for indoor and outdoor environments. A novel
    framework that generates power using PV cells is presented for the indoor environment
    in [116]. For indoor settings, [117] reported W power using an artificial source
    of light energy at different intensities. An EH framework for smart building using
    PV is developed in [24] that generates V output voltage with mA pulse current
    in an indoor environment. Apart from this, the authors in [118] proposed an energy
    estimation algorithm to analyze the random behavior of light intensity in the
    indoor environment. It generates a high-efficient end node harvesting device that
    produces 0.8% error while predicting energy availability in one day. Authors in
    [119] compared wireless power transfer (WPT) and solar energy sources. Interestingly,
    the authors proposed a hybrid source that combines the merits of the aforementioned
    sources. 4.1.2. Thermal Unlike solar energy, thermal energy is available indoors
    and outdoors. Thermal energy can be collected by an electrical and mechanical
    source and converted into consumable electrical energy. The heat from various
    sources, including sunlight, engine exhaustion, indoor temperature, temperature
    difference, and even body heat, can be counted as a source. The generation method
    is cost-effective and efficient as it generates electricity from the abovementioned
    sources. However, the energy produced using thermal sources needs better energy
    conversion efficiency [90]. It can be made possible using different harvesters,
    such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), biochip, nanomaterial, and cloth-printed
    harvesters, which are commercially available. Thermoelectric (TE) and pyroelectric
    (PE) methods are the most widely used thermal harvesters. For a thermoelectric
    generator, an -type junction is used. This junction is connected to the heating
    material. Aluminum oxide and silicon wafers [120] are the most widely used heating
    materials because of their high conductivity and low coefficient of thermal expansion.
    The transmission of carriers across the junction produces the necessary potential
    difference and is sent to the voltage controller and converter. The voltage thus
    obtained can be increased using a large number of junctions between heating materials.
    Finally, the increased DC voltage can be transmitted wirelessly to one or more
    IoT sensors. On the other hand, the pyroelectric solution uses a special crystal
    material that generates considerable energy under temperature fluctuation in the
    environment. The design of the thermal transducer is not simply restricted to
    the approaches of TE and PE. However, as with many other thermal harvesters, other
    proposed transducers are described in Table 6. Table 6. Comparison of different
    thermal transducers. Harvesting technology Characteristics Average power/efficiency

    the increasing energy demand of IoT networks, energy harvesting through RF signals
    (RF-EH) evolved as an alternative technique that offers reduced operational cost
    and attains a sustainable framework. Instead of using conventional energy sources
    (power grid), RF signals are employed to recharge the batteries of IoT devices.
    Typically, ambient EM sources like cellular, microwave, and infrared (IR) radiation
    harvest the RF energy using high-gain antennas. The harvested energy is processed,
    rectified, and stored for future use. Rectenna, voltage multiplier, and storage-control
    interfaces are the building blocks of an RF-EH module. The rectenna block consists
    of a dipole or a patch antenna, along with a rectifier (Schottky diodes) that
    performs AC-DC conversion. A reconfigurable rectifier integrated with double-stage
    controlled maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is proposed in [127] to have a
    highly efficient energy harvesting node at dB. The peak power conversion efficiency
    can be written as (1) where is the DC power at output of rectifier and is the
    harvested rectifierâs power at the input. An optimal dual-stage RF-EH circuit
    is fabricated in [128]. The work in [129] discusses an ambient ultrahigh-frequency
    (UHF) enabled energy harvesting technique. The energy density of RF-EH is very
    low in comparison to other sources, as investigated in [128], [129]. Hence a voltage
    multiplier is utilized for further enhancing the voltage level [130]. The storage
    and control interface is responsible for the persistent power flow to the endpoint
    devices [131]. Several RF harvesters are classified according to their efficiencies
    and are studied in [132]. In [133], the authors reported energy harvesting strategies
    using single and multiple sources. There has been considerable research on low
    power transfer to IoT end users in the past few years, specifically where replenishment
    of batteries is difficult [134]. With a focus on WPT, some recent literature enhanced
    performance and optimized design parameters to increase the energy efficiency
    of the harvested node [135], [136]. However, the WPT mechanism requires a fixed
    charging point, and there is a limit on power density as well. Recently, the utilization
    of RF signals to deliver energy and convey information signals has received considerable
    research attention. This technique is referred to as simultaneous wireless power
    and information transfer (SWIPT). The authors in [137], [138], [139] discussed
    resource allocation and performance analysis of different SWIPT-aided systems.
    Moreover, the authors in [140] discussed the time division strategy for power
    and information transfer (see Table 7). Table 7. Comparison of different RF transducers.

    networks, IoT has incorporated several sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, communication
    devices, and so on. These devices mostly remain operational, resulting in limited
    battery life for a few days. Therefore, batteries play a significant part in ensuring
    sustainability in smart applications. However, most of the harvested energy is
    wasted due to the losses in the circuits or not managing it properly. As a result,
    not all the harvested energy is stored in the batteries. It can be prevented by
    keeping track of the energy from the harvesting stage to the storage stage. In
    this context, authors in [145] employed various methods to disseminate the significance
    of energy trackers in energy harvesting systems. Some researchers focused on detecting
    the sunâs motion to improve the efficiency of harvested energy. In contrast, the
    authors of [146] presented an animal tracking-based thermal harvesting system
    based on the temperature differential between the animalâs body and the immediate
    surroundings. This survey paper focused on tracking the harvesting energy after
    the transducers stage so that the energy flow to the storage interface is efficiently
    managed. Some of the existing available energy trackers are depicted in Table
    8. 4.2.1. Solar charger controller The overall output voltage of the solar panel
    is typically quite low. As a result, researchers have proposed different charge
    control mechanisms to achieve an efficient harvesting framework, such as Pulse
    width modulation (PWM) and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) [152]. PWM controller
    can handle the flow of current from the solar panel with reduced efficiency due
    to the discontinuity in the harvested energy. It is frequently used for low-powered
    devices [153]. As a result, it can contribute to the sustainability of IoT devices
    with lower efficiency. On the other hand, MPPT has been identified as a charge
    controller circuit that optimally manages the harvested energy from solar panels
    to storage interfaces efficiently. It tracks voltage and maximum power using the
    most commonly used perturbation and observation (P&O) algorithm. In [154], the
    harvested energy is provided to a boost converter (DC-DC) using MPPT to improve
    the conversion efficiency. The authors obtained an analytical model for a harvester
    in [155] using MPPT and achieved 96% efficiency. A novel wearable fitness monitoring
    device powered by solar cells is developed in [156]. The harvesting efficiency
    of the system ( ) is computed as (2) where , are the efficiency of the conversion
    interface and MPPT respectively. Table 8. Comparison of different energy tracker

    4.2.2. Rectifier/voltage multiplier topology It has been noticed that RF energy
    received from ambient sources needs a better power density to make the IoT device
    sustainable. As a result, power converters or amplifier circuits are required
    to drive the low-powered DC load. It can be made feasible by incorporating the
    rectifiers with capacitors and diodes to form the multi-stage voltage multipliers
    circuits. So that voltage gain can be increased at the output of the RF energy
    harvester. In [157], authors designed multi-stage circuits such as Dickson and
    CockcroftâWalton voltage multipliers to obtain high-voltage at the output. These
    circuits mainly act as energy trackers or DC-DC converters to enhance the harvested
    voltage at the output. In this way, RF energy is properly managed from the transmitter
    end to the storage interface. 4.3. Storage interface This is a part of the power
    management system. After energy is harvested, it needs to be utilized at the end
    node application with the help of storage interface device. A number of storage
    interfaces are available, however, we list out only the most commonly used ones
    as follows. 4.3.1. Rechargeable batteries This type of battery contains a large
    number of capacitors and has high energy density. However, it is hardly used for
    storage as it has a low depth-of-discharge (DoD) rating. Moreover, there are numerous
    ways to select a battery for a self-sustainable IoT network, such as battery life
    expectancy, the necessity for rapid charging cycles, size, and weight, which are
    the most crucial factors influencing the decision [158]. Although rechargeable
    batteries/secondary batteries have less capacity and temperature stability than
    primary batteries, they do not require periodic maintenance and replacement at
    complete discharge. The most popular battery for EH-IoT is lithium-ion. Depending
    on the operating cycle, the total efficiency of battery storage ranges from 60%
    to 80%. These batteries do not operate well in low temperatures due to increased
    internal resistance, resulting in a self-discharge [159]. However, there are Alkaline
    MnO batteries available with a low self-discharge rate [160]. These batteries
    are used in the IoT applications, such as IoT monitoring applications that require
    data monitoring even for smaller intervals of time with high precision (smart
    healthcare, smart home, and smart industries) at a higher cost. Apart from this,
    Lead-Acid batteries are used in IoT applications that require data monitoring
    with larger sampling intervals and are mainly used in environmental monitoring
    applications. These batteries are inexpensive, highly reliable, and efficient,
    with limited cycle capacity and poor performance under adverse circumstances [161].
    4.3.2. Super-capacitors These are high-energy-density batteries with high DoD
    ratings. Supercapacitor discharges on its own, hence it cannot store energy for
    a longer duration [162]. Several studies revealed that the self-discharging nature
    of the supercapacitors is due to leakage and fast charging and can be compensated
    by charging it over a longer period of time [163]. The severity of the self-discharging
    problem is not only determined by the device capacity but also differs among manufacturers
    and even among specific production batches. This results from variations in the
    materials used, the manufacturing process, and production irregularities. As a
    result, selecting a reliable supercapacitor for appropriate IoT applications is
    still a significant issue [164]. It is mostly employed in applications requiring
    a power source with a shorter charging time and a wider operational temperature
    range and lacks involvement of toxic heavy metals, such as smart healthcare, smart
    irrigation, and smart agriculture. 4.3.3. Recent advancement in energy storage
    batteries The development of hybrid storage devices and novel materials enables
    a breakthrough in advancing energy storage interfaces. In [165], a hybrid storage
    system that increases operational duration is developed by integrating rechargeable
    batteries with supercapacitors. A unique ionic liquid combination is employed
    as an electrolyte for supercapacitor applications to enable IoT applications that
    demand a large working temperature range (60 to 80 ) and a low charging/discharging
    rate [166]. In addition, several IoT applications (smart factories, smart automobiles,
    etc.) need a high voltage than a large working temperature and life span. So,
    asymmetric capacitors were developed by fusing several conducting polymers (ECPs),
    amorphous manganese dioxide (a-MnO ), and activated carbon. These capacitors offer
    two times the power of conventional supercapacitors [167]. Additionally, the storage
    capacity of supercapacitors and sodium-ion batteries is increased by using graphene-based
    materials [168]. Furthermore, the energy density and safety of rechargeable batteries
    are improved by using Lithium-ion batteries with solid-state electrolytes at a
    higher cost. However, some IoT applications require high capacity, high voltage,
    and low cost. To achieve this, authors in [169] develop carbon monoxide-free layered
    cathode material. Apart from this, different types of inorganic materials such
    as lithium-polymer [170], lithium nitride [171], perovskite [172], and sulfide
    [173] have used in solid-state batteries to extend the lifetime of the storage
    interface. 5. The energy saving and resource constrained optimizers for sustainable
    IoT operations Trillions of sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and communication
    interfaces will be deployed in the atmosphere during the emerging IoT era. Such
    interfaces will be using power from energy harvesting sources via storage interfaces
    and energy trackers. So, once the energy is harvested and stored efficiently with
    the help of energy trackers, it needs to be used properly at IoT device to keep
    it sustainable for ubiquitous operations. The energy stored for sustainable IoT
    devices can be utilized effectively by energy-saving or resource-optimizer protocols.
    Energy saving and resource optimization in EH-IoT is a primary concern because
    it incorporates a large number of resource-constrained devices that come with
    diverse QoS requirements. Moreover, different researchers have designed different
    decision-making topologies, algorithms, standards, and conceptual designs for
    the optimal use of harvested and stored energy [174]. Here, we will discuss the
    current research trends and challenges associated with decision-making tasks in
    this process flow. 5.1. Optimizing device power Devices play a crucial role in
    managing the power of IoT networks. Depending on the flow of data, a typical node
    in an IoT network is of two types i.e., the source and the sink. IoT combines
    different sources and sinks that can communicate without human intervention [175].
    For example, when the source and sink devices are connected via an RF chain, the
    transmit power of the RF network should be minimized [176], [177], [178]. In addition,
    if the connectivity between the source and sink fails, the data packets are lost.
    Retransmission of the same packet consumes a considerable amount of power. Cognitive
    radio (CR) can overcome these challenges [113], [177]. This technology monitors
    the wireless spectrum and identifies the holes (unoccupied channels). Design and
    optimization of a CR-assisted framework that ensures spectrum efficiency can be
    found in [113], [178]. Joint optimization of computational tasks and the energy
    transfer parameters employed with the design objective of increasing the network
    lifetime is discussed in [179]. To adjust the deviceâs duty cycle and dynamic
    transmission power, an opportunistic routing policy is proposed in [180]. 5.2.
    Data optimization Research articles show that SANET, along with optimized data
    processors, would drive the next-generation technology in the renewable energy
    sector to make the existing technologies sustainable [181]. Data optimization
    is the most crucial aspect of the energy-saving process since the consolidated
    data requires a smaller setup for management. To optimize data rate and data collection
    in cognitive radio and D2D communication, different modulation and coding schemes
    are studied in [182], [183], [184]. This ensures energy-efficient communication
    from the data aggregator to other nodes. Instead of transmitting the original
    data, only the compressed data is communicated. Hadoop is another data-management
    framework that allows decentralized storage and processing of data at the bit
    level. This framework consists of clusters of systems utilizing simpler algorithms.
    Moreover, several authors have explored the compressive sensing method to analyze
    performance metrics, e.g., EE, security, reliability, etc. [185], [186]. These
    works explain how the data at the receiving end is extracted from the compressed
    data. Clustering is another method to efficiently transmit consolidated data to
    the central server [187]. There are many research studies where authors have discussed
    the clustering method for various sensors [188]. In [189], the authors have shown
    how to capture remote data using a battery-driven wireless IoT. IoT systems clock
    and log data are coordinated using network time protocol (NTP) and data logger,
    respectively. The authors in [189] has provided a statistical model to predict
    the batteryâs charging and discharging rate and analyze energy consumption at
    IoT nodes. The average current is obtained as follows (3) where , denote the instantaneous
    current and the number of data samples received through the entire time slot.
    Battery life, , can be subsequently calculated as (4) where denotes the battery
    capacity. 5.3. Time constrained power optimization In order to optimize power,
    time constraints play a vital role in the synchronization process, sleep mode,
    standby, and idle state of the sensing node. While the sensor is not in use, turning
    it off is better to save power. To manage energy, different time limits are set
    for different methods, namely, sleep timing, traffic monitoring [190], and appropriate
    duty cycle. In [191], [192], devices are put in sleep mode after completing their
    tasks, as sleep mode consumes negligible power. MAC duty cycling is another strategy
    that puts the device into idle mode until the next process cycle begins. This
    method is also energy efficient [193], [194]. 5.4. Trade-off among bandwidth,
    range and power consumption A typical IoT network must consider trade-offs on
    energy usage, bandwidth, and coverage area. The design objectives are to maximize
    the coverage area, minimize transmit power and improve the bandwidth [195]. A
    long-range (1.8 km), multi-hop, and self-powered IoT framework is proposed in
    [196] to be applied in agriculture. The network delivers an average power consumption
    of W at a -min interval for a sensor node [197]. In another work, Bluetooth is
    used to achieve long-range support, and the framework is built on BQ25570 IC.
    It has the following applications, e.g. battery charging and voltage conditioning
    [198]. 5.5. Standardization for EH-IoT This standardization is crucial for achieving
    interoperability and compatibility among self-sustainable IoT devices. It will
    help in optimizing the IoT resources by ensuring that they all follow the same
    set of rules and protocols by eradicating external peripheral interfaces. So,
    to incorporate all the EH-IoT under one platform, the International electrotechnical
    commission (IEC) has laid out standards for testing and evaluating different types
    of transducer and wireless protocols for green energy solutions. Some are discussed
    below for energy harvesting transducers and self-sustainable IoT communication
    protocols. 5.5.1. EH transducer Leading standardization development organizations
    (SDOs) have made the efforts to standardize EH transducers [199]. These standards
    are discussed in Table 9. Table 9. EH-IoT transducers standardization. Transducer

    5.5.2. Wireless protocol The international organization for standardization (ISO)
    introduced standards for wireless networking protocols to improve interoperability.
    Interoperable wireless protocols for low-power devices are studied in [200], [201].
    Table 10 mentions some of the standards released by ISO and IEC. These EH-IoT
    devices conform to short-packet systems using amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency

    Upon identifying the various sections (Section 1 to Section 5), it becomes apparent
    that different energy harvesting sources can power the IoT devices for various
    IoT applications as shown in Table 11. The introduction section has offered a
    brief discussion on IoT applications for readers with the scope of establishing
    the relation among IoT applications, devices and energy harvesting interfaces.
    In this section, we investigate the comprehensive discussion of the IoT applications
    based on the devices of different IoT layers and energy harvesting interfaces
    that can be utilized. â¢ Smart Agriculture: Smart agriculture plays a significant
    role in enhancing crop cultivation by incorporating different sensing and actuation
    interfaces, including temperature, humidity, chemicals, and many more. These sensors
    detect the physical changes in the surrounding environment of the crops, soils,
    flowers, and plants. Additionally, various chemical sensors are used to determine
    the potential of hydrogen (PH) level and nutrient properties of the soils to optimize
    agriculture practices. Some researchers also employed proximity and position sensors
    to detect the animalsâ movement in the fields [203]. The sensing data also requires
    actuation actions, which are usually carried out by solenoid valves, DC pumps,
    AC pumps, and relays. These actuation actions can be taken remotely with the help
    of communications protocols that can be operated up to a longer distance, i.e.,
    LoRa, Cellular, and SigFox [221], [222]. All these devices require significant
    power for their operations to run smoothly. Among all the sources, various researchers
    identified light energy as the most viable source to generate a considerable amount
    of electricity to be used in smart agriculture practices [202]. â¢ Smart city:
    The smart city is conceptualized as a network that incorporates many sensors,
    actuators, and communication devices. The utilization of the devices in smart
    city can vary significantly based on day-to-day requirements. In some scenarios,
    the focus of smartness may be ensuring safety during natural calamities and emergencies
    such as earthquakes, floods, or fires [223]. In other situations, proper management
    of parking, lighting, waste management, the smart grid, smart sanitation, and
    many more. So smart cities incorporate almost all ranges of sensors and actuators
    [202], [203], [224], as shown in Table 11. It also employs a wide range of communication
    protocols in most scenarios to exchange real-time data up to a distance of several
    kilometers (Kms). These communication modules and actuators require power. As
    a result, they are powered by solar energy by controlling the peak of electrical
    energy consumption in the hottest and coldest months [225]. On the other hand,
    sensors used in the indoor area of smart cities are powered by RF sources [226].
    â¢ Smart environment: Weather conditions significantly influence numerous applications,
    including agriculture, irrigation, and traffic monitoring. These applications
    mainly incorporate sensors that can measure physical and chemical changes in the
    environment. The light, temperature, humidity, biomolecules, and rain sensors
    are utilized to detect physical changes in the surroundings, such as rainfall,
    forest fires, solar irradiance, and air pollution levels. Additionally, sensors
    such as motion, gyroscopes, and accelerometers are used in the early detection
    of catastrophes in smart environments [227], [228], [229]. These sensed values
    typically trigger relays to manage external actions and DC motors using PWM signals
    to control the speed of devices like fire-avoidance robots to avoid catastrophe.
    The smart environment mainly employs communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX,
    Cellular, and LoRa to exchange information in metropolitan and wide-area networks.
    The energy from light and thermal sources provides adequate power to the sensors
    and communication devices employed in smart environments [206], [208]. Additionally,
    RF sources are usually used to power the sensors in highly populated locations
    using radio frequency generators for the deviceâs ubiquitous operations in a smart
    environment to prevent disaster [207]. â¢ Smart heath care: Smart health care,
    or the Internet of medical things, is the systematic implementation mode that
    links healthcare services to the IoT via various sensors, actuators, and acceptable
    communication protocols. Smart health care predominantly requires sensors such
    as heartbeat, biomolecular, chemical, and gyroscopes to monitor the physical and
    chemical changes in the human body, like heartbeat, muscle movement, blood pressure,
    hemoglobin content, oxygen level, and many more. On the other hand, the wearable
    sensors may also be mounted to the humanâs skin or tied to the clothes, which
    work by reading the values with RF signals. If sensor readings fall below safe
    limits or a personâs health enters a critical state, the nearby hospital authority
    is alerted using short-range communication protocols such as Bluetooth, BLE, and
    Zigbee [209], [210]. It is also notified at a longer distance using Cellular communication
    protocols [230]. Additional actuators, such as buzzers, also alert the individual
    to take precautions. This application mainly relies on short-range network communication
    protocols that operate by harvesting the energy from radio frequency [231], which
    usually has low bandwidth and does not harm the human body. â¢ Smart Industry:
    The idea of IoT has rapidly developed in the industrial sector over recent years
    to revolutionize it with Industry 4.0. Its presence is in almost all business,
    private, and government sectors, like smart schools, hospitals, shopping complexes,
    grids, offices, and retail outlets [211]. Due to the vast amount of IoT applications
    in smart industries, there is no limit to incorporating the sensing, actuation,
    and communication modules as shown in Table 11. It involves various sensors and
    actuators that can help monitor and automate the decision-making process, leading
    to more efficient, faster, and cost-effective production. Moreover, it incorporates
    short-range (BLE 5.0, Zigbee, RFID, Z-wave WiFi, and Zigbee) and wide-range communication
    devices (LoRa, SigFox, and Cellular) to provide interoperability within and between
    the different sectors by enabling smooth operations [212]. In order to power this
    extensive set of devices, all feasible energy sources are utilized to provide
    uninterrupted power to various devices at different layers. Solar, thermal, and
    electromagnetic (EM) sources are the most commonly employed sources in the industry.
    Authors in [232], [233] designed self-powered sensors using a thermally conductive
    pyroelectric block for industrial applications. Additionally, authors in [234],
    [235] have employed EM and solar sources to power the IoT devices used in the
    industry. Finally, authors in [236] focused on providing low power to the IoT
    devices in various industrial sectors using a microstrip patch antenna to regulate
    the operations of different IoT devices using the energy emitted by the mobile
    base station and the WiFi transmitter. â¢ Smart Security: In recent years, there
    has been a sudden exponential growth of security systems in our daily lives. These
    systems typically involve various sensors, such as an accelerometer, proximity,
    gyroscope, and infrared (IR) sensors, that can detect the presence of any unauthorized
    individual. It also employs other sensors that may detect chemical changes, such
    as harmful gas emissions, radiation levels increase, and leakages of deadly substances
    in the nearby region [237]. Based on these sensors, actuators such as a buzzer,
    pneumatic cylinders, and relays are most commonly employed to turn off the door
    and produce alarm sounds in case of a security breach. These applications necessitate
    using both short-range and long-range communications protocols for monitoring
    from remote locations and having connections among the devices with short-range
    communication devices. For seamless functionality in a smart security system,
    authors in [238] implemented a solar energy harvesting unit in a -storey building
    to detect the presence of any unauthorized individual. Apart from this, the authors
    in [239] implemented an RF energy harvesting source to establish the connection
    among the sensors using short-range communications protocols to detect the presence
    of any harmful gases in the surroundings. â¢ Smart transport: In recent times,
    advancements in communication modules and several devices at different IoT layers
    have significantly enhanced transportation, which aims to improve driver safety,
    reduce traffic congestion, etc. These advancements incorporate motion sensors,
    gyroscopes, infrared sensors, GPS, and camera sensors to monitor the location
    and behaviors of drivers and passengers [215]. In addition, continuous monitoring
    is ensured through the use of temperature, pressure, and oxygen sensors within
    the vehicle to safeguard the driver. In order to enhance the comfortable experience
    of the driver, hydraulic actuators are utilized in various parts of the vehicles.
    Moreover, the pneumatic cylinder in vehicles using the devices may avoid injuries
    in accidents or mishaps. The increasing number of vehicles on the road poses a
    collision risk, which mandates the requirement of communication devices among
    vehicles. It incorporates all long-range communication protocols to identify the
    traffic pattern on the road within certain distances. Moreover, it also incorporates
    BLE, Bluetooth, and Zigbee to establish communication among the different devices
    inside the vehicle [216]. Power management in smart transportation is still a
    significant issue for many researchers due to continuous battery replacement and
    fuel consumption. To address this, authors in [217] integrate the piezoelectric
    device into the tires of the vehicles, through which driving-induced mechanical
    energy is converted to electric energy. Apart from this, several studies [240],
    [241], [242] also focused on incorporating power into smart vehicles using the
    highly efficient solar cell module to increase the power supply by up to 30%.
    7. Future scope Considering the self-sustainable IoT device based on the layers
    architecture design for smart applications, we have emphasized the layer-wise
    issues of implementing sustainability. It is employed in sensing, actuation, processing,
    and a transmission interface by utilizing energy sources, energy transducers,
    energy management, energy tracking, energy storage, and energy optimizers. Based
    on that, we have outlined the potential areas for further study in developing
    self-sustaining IoT systems. 7.1. Sustainable smart network With the rapid deployment
    of IoT nodes, the data generated by such nodes are also anticipated to grow manifold.
    These data operations necessitated external hardware assistance for storage, which
    will be an expense for power and outlay. This extraneous requirement will pose
    a threat to sustainable IoT operations due to the increase in power consumption.
    Moreover, traditional data collection and processing techniques might fail to
    handle, analyze and extract information at that scale for a long time with a fixed
    energy storage device. Additional energy harvesting devices and storage interfaces
    must be included in the existing EH-IoT system design to address this issue. Further,
    different IoT devices generate heterogeneous data, which is difficult to be processed
    using an existing processing interface. An intelligent IoT network works on the
    premise of learning from the pattern of past data and predicting data for future
    instances. Thus the systemâs performance can be enhanced through better detection
    accuracy [243], [244]. Thus the cost of a storage interface and communication
    resources can be minimized by limiting the number of re-transmissions. However,
    machine algorithms to classify problems related to self-sustainable IoT devices
    are still in their infancy [245] to connect it to layered architecture design,
    and significant research scope exists in this area. In a large-scale self-sustainable
    IoT network, how to analyze collected data through deep learning techniques to
    obtain design insights is an emerging field. 7.2. Secure energy harvesting design
    A self-sustainable IoT device needs to collect energy from different available
    sources in close proximity for ubiquitous operations. However, this energy harvesting
    task can raise security concerns as attackers can produce unnecessary radiation
    as the malware energy in the processing system when extracting power from the
    RF source. So malware exposed to electricity generation data from unwanted radiation
    may cause significant privacy issues for users. It may sometimes damage the energy
    storage interface without proper protection. On the other hand, if an intruder
    knows the systemâs harvesting pattern, it might launch different types of attacks
    at the user-end, namely, time synchronization, replay, dynamic data injections,
    brute force attack, man in middle attack or can generate unwanted signals. On
    the other hand, communication among IoT devices may also raise privacy concerns
    for users. Extensive sensitive data is stored, processed, and transmitted by sustainable
    IoT nodes powered by the energy storage interface. If this harvested energy is
    continuously used to transmit information vulnerable to replay and denial of service
    attacks, the stored energy will drain more quickly. Although technologies like
    Physical layer security (PLS) and Blockchain [246], [247] are integrated with
    SWIPT to form an IoT-based cooperative energy harvesting network, the issue of
    energy outages still needs to be addressed effectively. 7.3. Trade-off among energy
    consumption, bandwidth and coverage area Certain IoT communication modules like
    LoRa, WiFi, SigFox, and cellular devices can communicate with each other at a
    long distance. Managing power for such long-distance IoT communication devices
    is crucial in EH. However, the process of storing harvested energy for a longer
    time duration is a challenge in itself. Hence providing the required energy to
    the module to cover a wide area while maintaining low power consumption is difficult.
    A decrease in bandwidth leads to a decrease in the data rate. Efficient power
    management involving a the trade-off among energy consumption, bandwidth, and
    coverage area poses a design challenge. 7.4. Energy supply design for sporadic
    source and hazardous material During the daytime, the solar power supply works
    effectively. However, it is not the case at night. Solar supply uses PV cells
    to convert light into energy. Nonetheless, solar supply requires more space. Energy-intensive
    devices like laptops and smart electric cars consume more power to perform for
    a long duration. Nevertheless, small-scale PVs play a significant role in calculators,
    watches, and small devices. A typical example is the monitoring and identifying
    faults in the power distribution system using solar panels [248]. Furthermore,
    solar irradiance is stochastic in nature, with seasonal and temporal variations.
    As a result, depending only on solar energy harvesting for self-sustaining IoT
    system design may result in energy outages, where energy harvested by the solar
    panel will be less than the energy consumed by IoT devices. On the other hand,
    EH can be achieved using an RF field with a certain signal frequency. The potential
    safety threats must be considered in case more RF fields are used. So it is challenging
    to design efficient PV cells and maintain a safe level of exposure to RF intensities.
    7.5. Storage unit 7.5.1. Data storage While designing the system for a specific
    IoT application, the main challenge lies in cleaning, processing, and interpreting
    the massive data collected by the sensors. Storing bulky data is another challenge.
    Depending on the self-sustainable IoT application, an extensive data acquisition
    system might be needed, which calls for a storage unit with a large capacity.
    The storage data of the IoT sensor for smart weather monitoring, intelligent transportation
    system, and many other smart applications require data to be sensed at small sampling
    intervals. When data is sensed continuously for a longer period of time with smaller
    sample intervals, a more significant amount of energy and storage is required.
    Some researchers have used big data storage systems as an enabling architecture.
    However, the problem of storing and sensing data over a longer period of time
    with a small sampling interval still needs to be addressed. 7.5.2. Power storage
    Due to the rapid charge or discharge cycles, a rechargeable battery is insufficient
    for energy storage. Also, a rechargeable battery is made up of a large number
    of capacitors, which occupies space. For example, a nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) battery
    has got higher energy capacity but a fast discharge rate. On the other hand, lithium-ion
    and nickel metal hybrid batteries come with higher energy density and a lower
    discharge rate. However, due to their highly combustible nature, they do not provide
    a viable choice for IoT applications. Solid-state batteries come with a minimum
    rate of self-discharge and are eco-friendly. However, their use in IoT could be
    improved, as they come at a high price. Since super-capacitors have a large energy
    capacity, they may be considered as one of the alternative possibilities for EH-IoT.
    However, because of its auto-draining rate, it is not an ideal fit for EH-IoT
    applications. A low-cost battery with a high energy consumption volume and low
    discharge rate poses a design challenge. Different storage units are outlined
    in Section 4.3. 7.6. Hardware assistance Hardware design in self-sustainable IoT
    devices needs to cope with many issues. The power harvested from the surrounding
    is often intermittent. This leads to heavy fluctuation in current at IoT node.
    Hence, small-sized hardware that yields stable performance for a wide range of
    power is required at the energy harvesting stage. The harvesting stage includes
    transducers, MPPT, DC-DC converters, AC-DC converters, and supercapacitors. Arranging
    all such components with sensors, actuators, and communication devices will result
    in a highly dense circuit. How many bulky circuits can coexist with nanomaterials
    poses a relevant research question. 7.7. Network congestion in EH-IoT network
    Previously data sensed by IoT devices were used to store in the cloud. Several
    IoT devices or platforms use the same cloud platform for data storage. However,
    accessing the required data from vast aggregated data available on the cloud takes
    time and effort. In case different IoT devices wish to access data from the same
    cloud simultaneously, it will increase incoming traffic in the network. Recently
    in [249], edge computing is proposed to optimize energy efficiency for medical
    devices using their inactive mode. Edge computing networks are dense and highly
    congested. In this technique, firstly, data is transferred to a storage unit near
    IoT device. After sorting and analyzing data, the local storage unit transfers
    some of the data to the cloud. Thus reducing both latencies and network congestion
    in this process at the cost of increased power consumption due to the dense network.
    As a result, the tradeoff between dense storage network deployment and power consumption
    in a sustainable IoT system still needs to be addressed. 8. Conclusion IoT is
    an effective solution to our day-to-day problems that open up numerous new opportunities
    worldwide. This is an interesting phenomenon in networking devices, where the
    reach of device connectivity increases every year. IoT incorporates billions of
    sensors, actuators, and communication devices in various IoT applications. This
    paper addresses several IoT applications and clarifies the necessitates of IoT
    devices, in particular smart applications. It is accomplished by incorporating
    five different interfaces such as sensing interface, energy harvesting interface,
    storage interface, microcontroller interface, and wireless interface. It focuses
    on bridging the gap between IoT application and IoT system design centered on
    layered architecture design. Besides, the study of various types of sensors, actuators,
    and communication protocols, this paper also discusses the various types of energy
    harvesting techniques to make the self-sustainable IoT system design. The primary
    task of EH-IoT is to guarantee smooth functioning using an uncontrolled and unpredicted
    power supply. This paper also investigates the comparison among the different
    layers architecture design of self-sustainable IoT device. While reviewing the
    different research articles, we also examined the effect of the stochastic source
    on the memory interface. This work is concluded with the potential research problems
    that will enable researchers to build a new paradigm for self-sustainable IoT
    system design. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they
    have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

  explanation: The paper introduces a novel medium access control (MAC) protocol called
    Handshake Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (HSMA/CA) for densely
    deployed cognitive radio networks (CR-based IoT networks). The proposed protocol
    resolves the hidden primary terminal problem and maintains sufficient priority
    rights to primary users (PUs) in a densely distributed network by using handshake-based
    mutual spectrum sensing in the transmitter and the receiver. The HSMA/CA protocol
    also optimizes the spectrum sensing period to maximize the system performance
    by maintaining peculiarities in the sensing operation like false alarm and misdetection.
    They analyze the protocol through a mathematical model in terms of throughput
    and verify its accuracy by simulations. Simulation results show that the HSMA/CA
    protocol outperforms existing schemes due to optimized spectrum sensing and is
    suitable for non-collaborative densely deployed CR-based IoT networks.
  extract_1: HSMA/CA enables mutual spectrum sensing operation in the midst of the
    two control frames named Notify-To-Sense (NTS) and Acknowledge-To-Sense (ATS),
    to avoid the hidden primary terminal problem.
  extract_2: In HSMA/CA, neighbor discovery and spectrum sensing are carried out through
    handshake-based mutual spectrum sensing in the transmitter and the receiver.

    \ technologies such as ZigBee, WiFi, 6LowPAN, RFID,\nMachine-to-Machine, LTE-Advanced,\
    \ etc. depend on the license-free Industrial Scientiï¬c and Medical\n(ISM) bands\
    \ for the Internet. The proliferation of IoT devices is not only anticipated to\
    \ create a\nhuge amount of congestion in the near future, but even now the unlicensed\
    \ spectrum is not enough\nin the ISM bands. Towards this end, Cognitive Radio\
    \ (CR) technology can resolve the spectrum\nshortage issue since CR users can\
    \ opportunistically exploit white spaces in licensed channels of\nthe adjacent\
    \ wireless systems. In CR networks, it is critical to coordinate spectrum access\
    \ among\nSecondary Users (SUs) while protecting priority rights of Primary Users\
    \ (PUs). Therein, SUs need to\ntake good care of hidden PUs in order to avoid\
    \ harmful interference. Further, a densely deployed\nCR network can compromise\
    \ spectrum sensing quality and certainty of the results when a large\nnumber of\
    \ SUs contends to access the same channel. Therefore, based on the vulnerable\
    \ sensing\nresults, SUs can cause interference to the PUs. In this paper, we ï¬rst\
    \ investigate the leading issues\nand then propose a novel Handshake Sense Multiple\
    \ Access with Collision Avoidance (HSMA/CA)\nprotocol for CR-based IoT networks.\
    \ Our proposed HSMA/CA scheme resolves hidden primary\nterminal problem and maintains\
    \ sufï¬cient priority rights to PUs in a densely distributed network.\nIn addition,\
    \ we optimize the spectrum sensing period to maximize the system performance by\n\
    maintaining peculiarities in the sensing operation like false alarm and misdetection.\
    \ To evaluate\nthe performance of HSMA/CA, we have analyzed the protocol through\
    \ the Markov chain model in\nterms of throughput and verify its accuracy by simulations.\
    \ Simulation results show that our scheme\nis suitable for non-collaborative densely\
    \ deployed CR-based IoT networks.\nKeywords: carrier sensing; CSMA/CA; dynamic\

    \ Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology has been sharply propelling into\nour daily\
    \ lives due to low-power and low-cost smart objects like sensors, controllers,\
    \ actuators,\netc. The widespread applications of IoT, including smart homes,\
    \ smart meter, smart cities, eHelth,\nconnected cars, and so on, require Internet\
    \ connectivity for anything, anywhere, and anytime [1].\nSensors 2019, 19, 241;\

    2 of 21\nIn one report, Cisco anticipates that the Internet-connected devices\
    \ will be 2.7% of the worldwide\nphysical objects by 2020, which is more than\
    \ that of 80% in 2012 [2]. From another recent report [3],\nwe have calculated\
    \ based on the United Nation world population prospects [4], that each person\
    \ will\nhave at least nine devices on the Internet in 2025, as shown in Figure\
    \ 1. On one hand, the leap in IoT\ngrowth can liberate humans from the old and\
    \ dump devices, while it requires enabling protocols and\nmore spectrum on the\
    \ other. Worse still, the available spectrum is scarce; especially in the Industrial,\n\
    Scientiï¬c, and Medical Bands (ISM). However, most of the IoT technologies (e.g.,\
    \ Bluetooth Low\nEnergy, WiFi, 6LoWPAN, ZigBee, etc.) depend on ISM bands that\
    \ are not really sufï¬cient to their needs\nfor spectrum.\nCognitive Radio (CR)\
    \ is considered as a cornerstone technology to resolve the spectrum shortage\n\
    issue through the dynamic spectrum allocation [5â7]. In CR networks, allocated\
    \ frequencies are often\nused by the Primary Users (PUs), which have higher priority\
    \ rights of spectrum use. Conversely,\nthe Secondary Users (SUs) do not have a\
    \ spectrum license, but they can dynamically occupy the\nunused frequencies (or\
    \ white spaces) in the absence of PUs [8,9]. However, the CR system may not\n\
    have the freedom to operate at the similar transmission parameters across the\
    \ existing spectrum bands\nin order to avoid interference to the PUs [10]. Further,\
    \ a CR system should accurately detect white\nspaces without generating a level\
    \ of harmful interference, which is what is not acceptable to the PUs.\nUnfortunately,\
    \ this is not always true because the accuracy of energy detector equipped with\
    \ the\nCR system for spectrum sensing is not perfect due to inevitable inefï¬ciencies\
    \ like the false alarm\nand misdetection [11,12]. The spectrum assignment through\
    \ dynamic access is, therefore, not trivial\nsince the radio transmissions can\
    \ interfere with each other unless separated enough in time, space or\nfrequency.\
    \ The dynamic spectrum access can be more aggressive as a channel can be used\
    \ by multiple\nusers simultaneously if only the channel satisï¬es a predeï¬ned quality\
    \ condition. This situation will get\nworse if IoT-enabled SUs are densely deployed\
    \ to act as competitors. Hence, the dynamic spectrum\nleasing, e.g., in [13,14],\
    \ can increase the transmission power density and subsequently the interference\n\
    level [15]. We need to consider the leaked powers from the adjacent SUs to the\
    \ PU receivers especially\nin the decentralized networks due to hidden primary\
    \ terminal problem [16â18].\n2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024\

    \ to the Internet.\nIn the existing literature, purpose-built Medium Access Control\
    \ (MAC) protocols for CR-based IoT\nnetworks have not been studied directly. However,\
    \ there exist several MAC protocols for CR networks\nas in [19â23], which always\
    \ consider a dedicated Common Control Channel (CCC) to schedule the\nSUsâ transmissions\
    \ in a sequential way. In [19], the authors proposed an opportunistic MAC protocol\n\
    that relies on an exclusive CCC for each frame. In this protocol, the channel\
    \ time is divided into two\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n3 of 21\nvirtual segments named\
    \ as report and negotiation phases. First, SUs report the sensing information\n\
    of the available channels in the report phase. Then, in the negotiation phase,\
    \ they compete to win\nthe access opportunity for the next frame using a p-persistent\
    \ CSMA/CA mechanism. To enable\nthis protocol, each SU necessarily equipped with\
    \ the two transceivers. That is, the one transceiver is\ntuned to the CCC, while\
    \ the other is dedicated to sense and occupy the identiï¬ed unused spectrum\nchannels.\
    \ In [22], the OMC-MAC is proposed, in which the CCC time is divided into non-overlapping\n\
    periods called beacon intervals. Therein, each beacon interval consists of three\
    \ phases called sensing,\ncontention, and transmission phases. According to this\
    \ protocol, SUs ï¬rst sense channels in the sensing\nphase, then contend to win\
    \ a transmission opportunity in the contention phase and they ï¬nally follow\n\
    a contention-free process in the transmission phase. However, CCC-based MAC protocols\
    \ are not\nmuch attractive due to denial of service attack, jamming, and single\
    \ point of failure [24â26].\nTo the best of the authorsâ knowledge, few of the\
    \ previous works have considered the random\naccess model that does not require\
    \ an exclusive CCC and so it is more suitable for the CR-based IoT\nnetwork. However,\
    \ SUsâ channel access, and PUsâ detection and protection become more challenging\n\
    in the absence of CCC. Furthermore, in distributed CR network the lack of centralized\
    \ control without\nCCC can cause many challenges like the hidden primary terminal\
    \ problem. We can ï¬nd various MAC\nprotocols for distributed CR network that based\
    \ on the random access model, as in [27â34]. In [27],\nthe VX, VAC, and KS schemes\
    \ are proposed, which enable two metrics, to protect the transmission\npriority\
    \ rights of the PUs, named collision probability and overlapping time in a random\
    \ access\nmechanism. In these sachems, collisions between the SUs due to the hidden\
    \ terminal problem are\nnot considered, which are not trivial in the densely deployed\
    \ secondary networks. Furthermore,\nthe assumed scenario of one PU band and one\
    \ SU is too simple, which is in fact an impractical\nassumption. In [29], the\
    \ O-CSMA/CA is proposed, in which the backoff algorithm of the IEEE\n802.11 standard\
    \ is revised to improve fairness and reduce collisions among the SUs. In this\
    \ protocol,\nSUs enable virtual carrier sensing to resolve the classical hidden\
    \ and exposed terminal problems.\nHowever, no mechanism is suggested to resolve\
    \ the hidden primary terminal problem to protect the\nPUsâ transmissions.\nIn\
    \ [31â33], the authors suggested a two-level opportunistic spectrum access strategy\
    \ in CR\nnetworks. In the ï¬rst level, SUs enable spectrum sensing with a given\
    \ probability to detect and protect\nthe PUs. In the second level, they compete\
    \ to access channel with one of the following random access\nmechanisms called\
    \ CR-ALOHA and CR-CSMA protocols. The CR-ALOHA is based on the classical\nSlotted\
    \ ALOHA scheme as that in [35], while the operation of CR-CSMA is inspired by\
    \ the traditional\ncarrier sense multiple access schemes as that in [36]. However,\
    \ the performance of these protocols\nis not very attractive because of the inability\
    \ to avoid packet collisions with nearby SUs. In [34],\nthe CR-CSMA/CA is proposed\
    \ to resolve the hidden primary terminal problem in distributed CR\nnetworks.\
    \ In this scheme, the transmitter sends a control packet, called PTS, to initiate\
    \ the mutual\nspectrum sensing with the receiver. When both the transmitter and\
    \ the receiver conï¬rm all the\nneighboring PUs to be silent, they can transmit\
    \ a data packet following the RTS/CTS handshaking\nprocedure as in the standard\
    \ CSMA/CA [37]. However, this scheme is not much attractive because\nmutual spectrum\
    \ sensing (a relatively long operation) is carried out before the RTS/CTS handshaking\n\
    procedure that can lead to increase the cost of transmission failure. We notice\
    \ that the event of\ntransmission failure is most likely happen in a densely deployed\
    \ network and so it should not\nhave unnecessary overhead to maintain the efï¬ciency\
    \ of the system. In our previous works [38â40],\nwe suggest different proposals\
    \ of random access MAC protocols inspired by the CR-CSMA/CA.\nIn [38], the CR-MEGA\
    \ is proposed, which adopts a dual sensing approach by enabling carrier\nsensing\
    \ with spectrum sensing in a sequential way so as to avoid packet collisions with\
    \ the nearby\nSUs and as well as the faraway PUs. This protocol performs well\
    \ even with the highly active PUs due\nto its proactive mechanism. However, the\
    \ advantage is achieved with the increased sensing overhead,\nwhich is what is\
    \ not acceptable in a densely distributed environment. In [39], hybrid-MAC is\
    \ proposed,\nwhich is based on the asynchronous and hybrid spectrum sensing techniques.\
    \ This scheme alternatively\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n4 of 21\nexploits two different\
    \ spectrum sensing approaches, i.e., fast sensing [41] and ï¬ne sensing [42],\n\
    in addition to the traditional carrier sensing of CSMA/CA. In [40], the adaptive-MAC\
    \ is proposed,\nwhich is the straightforward extension of the hybrid-MAC. In this\
    \ scheme, a purpose-built algorithm\nin SUs controls the adaptive spectrum sensing\
    \ time, depending on the packet transmission result and\nthe previous activity\
    \ of PUs, in order to maintain a balance between the system throughput and the\n\
    spectrum sensing overhead. However, the performance of both hybrid MAC and adaptive-MAC\
    \ are\nnot very optimistic due to the same reason as that in CR-CSMA/CA protocol.\n\
    In [43], a random access model called Mutual Sense Multiple Access with Collision\
    \ Avoidance\n(MSMA/CA) is proposed, which is based on cognitive radio network\
    \ to efï¬ciently utilize the\nbandwidth and spectrum resources in the IoT-enabled\
    \ environment. MSMA/CA enables mutual\nspectrum sensing operation in the midst\
    \ of the two control frames named Notify-To-Sense (NTS)\nand Acknowledge-To-Sense\
    \ (ATS), to avoid the hidden primary terminal problem. The operation of\nMSAM/CA\
    \ is rather smart and agile because it has merged the functionality of classical\
    \ RTS/CTS into\nNTS/ATS frames with the added advantage of spectrum sensing. We\
    \ notice that the long spectrum\nsensing period in the midst of NTS and ATS can\
    \ let the hidden SUs affect the transmission in densely\ndeployed networks. That\
    \ is, with the NTS and ATS frames SUs transmitter and receiver can only stop\n\
    the exposed and hidden SUs, respectively. However, if the gap between the sharing\
    \ of NTS and ATS\nframes is large due to the long spectrum sensing period, then\
    \ hidden SUs can also broadcast the NTS\nframe (followed by the secondary transmitter)\
    \ and hence cause collision over the secondary receiver.\nWe think that this phenomenon\
    \ can severely affect the system performance when SUs are placed in\nclose proximity\
    \ in a super dense environment. It is, therefore, the optimum selection of the\
    \ spectrum\nsensing period especially in the IoT environment is desirable. In\
    \ addition to the spectrum sensing\nperiod, the performance of the energy detector\
    \ is vulnerable by another factor, i.e., spectrum sensing\nthreshold, due to the\
    \ peculiarities of the energy detection sensing model.\nIn this paper, we design\
    \ a novel MAC protocol for densely deployed CR-based IoT networks\nby modifying\
    \ the prevalent CSMA/CA protocol. Our protocol is called Handshake Sense Multiple\n\
    Access with Collision Avoidance (HSMA/CA) mechanism since it purposefully features\
    \ the handshake\nbased mutual spectrum sensing in the transmitter and the receiver.\
    \ We tailored the Notify-To-Sense\n(NTS)/Clear-To-Sense (CTS)/Acknowledge-To-Sense\
    \ (ATS) procedure for the data transmission in\nplace of the NTS/ATS operation\
    \ in existing MSMA/CA in order to improve the SUsâ access operation in\na dense\
    \ environment. The NTS/CTS/ATS mechanism ï¬rst enables the handshaking operation\
    \ among\nthe SUs and then conduct the spectrum sensing operation in the transmitter\
    \ and in the receiver to avoid\nthe hidden secondary terminal and hidden primary\
    \ terminal problems simultaneously. Moreover,\nwe incorporate the optimization\
    \ of the spectrum sensing period considering the inefï¬ciencies of energy\ndetector\
    \ to improve the performance of the CR-based IoT networks.\nThe key contributions\
    \ of this work are summarized as follows:\nâ¢\nWe propose a new MAC protocol for\
    \ densely deployed CR-based IoT networks that resolves the\nhidden primary terminal\
    \ problem with the minimal possible overhead while effectively dealing\nwith the\
    \ classical hidden (secondary) terminal problem.\nâ¢\nWe develop an optimization\
    \ model to judicially adapt the spectrum sensing period considering\nthe incidences\
    \ of false alarm and misdetection and hidden primary terminal, in order to improve\n\
    the system efï¬ciency and reduce the interference to active PUs.\nâ¢\nWe analyze\
    \ the performance of our proposed protocol in terms of normalized throughput\n\
    with the Markov chain model and compare the results with that of existing CR-MEGA\
    \ and\nMSMA/CA protocols.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section\
    \ 2 covers the main issues in CR-based IoT\nnetworks that make them different\
    \ from the classical wireless networks. Section 3 takes an overview\nof the system\
    \ model. Section 4 describes the proposed MAC protocol. Section 5 analyzes the\
    \ proposed\nprotocol through a mathematical model. Section 6 validates our model\
    \ and discusses the obtained\nresults. In the last section, we summarize and conclude\
    \ the paper.\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n5 of 21\n2. Issues of CR-Based IoT Networks\n\
    There are a variety of reasons that can compromise the performance of the classical\
    \ wireless\nnetworks. However, we here only discuss the issues related to the\
    \ CR-based IoT networks as in\nthe following.\n2.1. Heterogeneous Environment\n\
    A CR system generally works in a multi-dimensional environment having coexistence\
    \ of PUs and\nSUs with variations of time, space and frequency. The coexistence\
    \ of non-cooperative users makes it\nvery hard to sense the signals from PUs reliably.\
    \ Moreover, the resulted interference induced from\nautonomous detection procedure\
    \ of multiple SUs in an independent sensing environment would also\nlead to confuse\
    \ the CR system by overestimation of signalâs power. Hence, the potential transmitter\
    \ is\nlikely to deceive by assuming the inactive status of PU to be active. This\
    \ phenomenon is more likely to\nhappen in dense networks.\n2.2. Tradeoff between\
    \ Sensing Schemes\nSpectrum sensing is to detect the signal from PUs possibly\
    \ under noisy environment. It is very\ncrucial to identify the PUâs signal for\
    \ the communication of SUs at the desired interference level.\nThere are two general\
    \ techniques on spectrum sensing i.e., fast sensing and ï¬ne sensing [44]. The\
    \ fast\nsensing measures the energy level of received signals while consuming\
    \ less than 1 ms. This approach\nhas the advantage of reporting results in a very\
    \ short time, but it cannot distinguish the source of\nsignals. On the other hand,\
    \ the ï¬ne sensing consumes several tens of milliseconds, and identiï¬es better\n\
    the signal source by using the matched ï¬lter or cyclostationary detection. Hence,\
    \ there exists a tradeoff\nbetween sensing time and sensing quality alternatively\
    \ in addition to the selection of an appropriate\nsensing scheme.\n2.3. Sensing\
    \ Performance\nThe perfect sensing is a big challenge in real environments. There\
    \ exists always a probability\nof misdetection and false alarm. We denote the\
    \ false alarm probability as Î± and the misdetection\nprobability as Î², respectively.\
    \ The false alarm means that an SU mistakenly detects an idle PU to be\nactive.\
    \ Then the SUs can miss the transmission opportunity. For SU i, the false alarm\
    \ probability, Î±i,\ncan be found in [45] as,\nÎ±i = Q\n\x10\x10 Î»\nÎ½2 â 1\n\x11\
    p\nT fs\n\x11\n,\n(1)\nwhere Î» is the detection (or spectrum sensing) threshold\
    \ of the sensor to decide the activity of PU,\nand Î½2 denotes the power of the\
    \ noise in the channel. On the other hand, misdetection indicates that\nan SU\
    \ recognizes active PUs as idle by mistake, which leads to the signiï¬cant interference\
    \ due to\nsubsequent transmissions of SUs. In [45], the detection probability\
    \ of an arbitrary SU i is derived as,\nâ¦i = Q\n\x10\n1\nâ2Î³ + 1Qâ1(Î±i) â\np\n\
    T fsÎ³\n\x11\n,\n(2)\nwhere T denotes the spectrum sensing time, fs indicates the\
    \ sampling rate of the channel, Î³ accounts\nfor the Signal-to-INoise-Ratio (SINR)\
    \ of the PUâs signal measured at the SU i, and Q(Â·) represents\nthe complementary\
    \ distribution function of a standard Gaussian variable. Hence, the misdetection\n\
    probability, Î²i, of an SU i can be written as,\nÎ²i = 1 â â¦i.\n(3)\nIn order to\
    \ adequately protect the PUs, we require the misdetection probability should be\
    \ bounded\nby a predeï¬ned value ËÎ² such that Î² â¤ ËÎ².\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n\
    6 of 21\n2.4. Hidden Primary Terminal Problem\nThe performance of an CR system\
    \ is signiï¬cantly affected by its sensing ability during the\ndetection process\
    \ of the active PUs. SUs may fail to detect the presence of PUs due to multipath\
    \ fading\naffects in wireless channels and temporal and spatial appearance of\
    \ the PUs. In that case, SUs can\ncause much interference to the PUs in their\
    \ successive transmissions.\nWe illustrate the scenario of the hidden primary\
    \ terminal problem in Figure 2, where the solid\nlines denote the Carrier Sensing\
    \ Range (CSR) and the dotted lines indicate the Spectrum Sensing Range\n(SSR),\
    \ respectively. We see that SUs i and j are respectively involved in a transmission\
    \ as a transmitter\nand as a receiver. We can also observe that PUs P and H are\
    \ respectively located outside the CSRs of\nthe SUs i and j. In carrier sensing,\
    \ SU i can only ensure the inactive status of PUs that are located inside\nits\
    \ CSR, when it senses the channel is idle for Data Interframe Space (DIFS) interval,\
    \ but not that of PU\nH. In spectrum sensing, the ability of SU i is, however,\
    \ only limited to evaluate when PU H is working\nas a transmitter but not when\
    \ it is performing as a receiver. The obvious reason is the inability of SU i\
    \ to\nreceive signals of the PU Pâs transmission to the hidden PU H. Hence, SU\
    \ iâs transmission to SU j can\nessentially affect the likely transmission of\
    \ PU P to the PU H. In such a scenario, a secondary network\ncan create harmful\
    \ interference when an PU e.g., H, is hidden from SU e.g., i. It is very desirable\
    \ that\nSU i should make sure of the silence of neighboring PUs when it involves\
    \ in transmission with SU j.\ni\nj\nH\nP\nSSR of user i\nSSR of user j\nCSR of\

    \ problem. CSR, Carrier Sensing Range; SSR,\nSpectrum Sensing Range; P, Primary\
    \ Terminal; H, Hidden Primary Terminal.\n3. System Model\nWe have considered one\
    \ secondary network with K SUs and one primary network with multiple\nPUs in the\
    \ system. The SUs and PUs both can coexist yet cannot communicate with each other\
    \ since\nthey lack collaboration. The secondary network is established in a decentralized\
    \ manner without\ngetting support from the centerlized server, in which SUsâ transmissions\
    \ are carried out through\npeer-to-peer communication setup. However, SUs, whenever\
    \ they act as IoT devices, can rely on\nthe server for Internet service. We have\
    \ assumed the single and shared channel model, therein SUs\ncan ï¬nd transmission\
    \ opportunities whenever the legitimate owners (or incumbent PUs) are inactive.\n\
    Once PUs are active, SUs are then liable to vacate the channel immediately. To\
    \ identify a transmission\nopportunity, the secondary transmitter and its corresponding\
    \ receiver, denoted as SU i and SU j,\ncan enable spectrum sensing using one of\
    \ the energy detection, autocorrelation-Based Sensing or\ncyclostationary feature\
    \ detection mechanisms [45â48].\nDuring a spectrum sensing operation, each SU\
    \ in its neighborhood can detect PUs either to be\nactive or inactive. The PUs\
    \ in the neighborhood of SU i can be found active with the probability of\nÏ1,i,\
    \ while the neighboring PUs can be observed as inactive with the probability of\
    \ Ï0,i. However,\nthe spectrum sensing operation is not ideal due to the imperfect\
    \ sensing environment. We hence\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n7 of 21\nconsider the\
    \ incidence of false alarm and misdetection in order to make the proposed system\
    \ more\nrealistic. Ultimately, SU i can conduct a data transmission operation\
    \ based on the sensing results,\nprovided that the channel is clear from the incumbent\
    \ PUs. For SU i, the clear-channel probability (R),\nwith which the channel is\
    \ free from the incumbent PUs, can be obtained as,\nRi = (1 â Î±i)Ï0,i + Î²iÏ1,i,\n\
    (4)\nwhere recall that Î±i and Î²i, respectively refer to the probabilities of false\
    \ alarm and misdetection for SU\ni, as deï¬ned in Equations (1) and (3). So, the\
    \ energy detector in SU i suggests declaring the activity or\ninactivity of incumbent\
    \ PUs with probability 1 â Ri and probability Ri, respectively.\n4. Proposed MAC\
    \ Protocol\nWe here discuss the proposed MAC protocol called Handshake Sense Multiple\
    \ Access with\nCollision Avoidance (HSMA/CA), which is designed for the densely\
    \ deployed cognitive radio-based\nIoT networks. In HSMA/CA, the system time is\
    \ divided into consecutive and multiple equal sized\ntime slots, therein SUs competing\
    \ at a moment follow a random access procedure over the shared\nchannel. The channel\
    \ is based on a single channel model, in which data and control packets both\n\
    are transmitted over the same channel. SUs contend at the beginning of each time\
    \ slot, denoted as\nÏ, and the winner SU thereafter transmits data packet according\
    \ to a deï¬ned mechanism outlined in\nthe following.\n4.1. NTS/CTS/ATS Access Mechanism\n\
    Our proposed protocol, HSMA/CA, is a tailor-made version of the standard CSMA/CA\n\
    (and MSMA/CA) for the densely distributed systems. In classical CSMA/CA, each\
    \ station must\nï¬rst identify the state of the channel as idle or busy through\
    \ the carrier sense before it enables collision\navoidance and data transmission\
    \ procedures. Therein, carrier sensing includes sensing of the physical\nmedium\
    \ by Clear Channel Assessment function to avoid a transmission overlap and the\
    \ Network\nAllocation Vector (NAV) function to reserve the channel for data packet\
    \ transmission. However,\ncarrier sensing in CSMA/CA is limited because it is\
    \ usually carried out at high SNR regime, and so\nvulnerable to the presence of\
    \ hidden primary terminal nodes in CR ad hoc networks. For example,\nif an PU\
    \ is positioned outside the carrier sensing range of an SU transmitter, it is\
    \ hard to identify the\nactivity status of this PU through the carrier sensing\
    \ mechanism. On the other hand, the spectrum\nsensing method such as energy detection,\
    \ autocorrelation-based sensing or cyclostationary feature\ndetection mechanisms\
    \ [45â48] can be carried out in low SNR regime, but requires signiï¬cant time\n\
    while introducing greater incidences of misdetection and false alarm. In HSMA/CA,\
    \ we have used\nNotify-to-Sense (NTS)/ Clear-to-Sense (CTS)/Acknowledge-to-Sense\
    \ (ATS) based handshake access\nmechanism in place of the classical RTS/CTS. The\
    \ NTS/CTS/ATS procedure is purposefully designed\nto complement carrier sensing\
    \ with spectrum sensing in order to avoid and protect the hidden\nsecondary and\
    \ hidden primary terminals, respectively. However, SUs under HSMA/CA adopt the\n\
    similar backoff procedure as that is used in CSMA/CA since both protocols are\
    \ based on the same\nrandom access model.\nWe illustrate the packet transmission\
    \ procedure in accordance to HSMA/CA in Figure 3, which is\ndescribed as follow.\
    \ The SU with packet to send ï¬rst chooses a backoff counter at random to avoid\n\
    collision. Then the SU conducts the carrier sensing for one DIFS interval to check\
    \ whether the channel\nis free or not and to avoid a transmission overlap. If\
    \ the channel is sensed as idle for the DIFS\ninterval, then SU decreases its\
    \ backoff counter one by one for each backoff slot time observed as idle.\nIn\
    \ Figure 3, the chosen backoff counter is 6. If no transmission by other SUs is\
    \ observed until the\nbackoff counter becomes 0, the transmitter broadcasts an\
    \ NTS packet to synchronize the spectrum\nsensing operation with the corresponding\
    \ receiver. The NTS packet keeps the neighboring SUs silent\nby updating their\
    \ NAVs until the spectrum sensing is done. If the receiver overhears the NTS packet,\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 241\n8 of 21\nit will then send an CTS packet to the transmitter.\
    \ The CTS packet makes the hidden SUs silent\nby updating their NAVs until the\
    \ packet transmission is over. Once the NTS and CTS packets are\nexchanged successfully,\
    \ the transmitter and receiver both can mutually conduct the spectrum sensing\n\
    operation to protect the PUs in their neighborhood. After the mutual septum sensing,\
    \ if there is no\nhidden PU active around the receiver, it returns the ATS packet\
    \ to the transmitter. If the hidden PU is\nactive otherwise, the receiver will\
    \ be blocked by spectrum sensing, and so it will hold the ATS packet.\nMeanwhile,\
    \ the transmitter will wait for the ATS packet assuming it is not blocked by the\
    \ active PUs in\nits neighborhood. The transmitter sends the DATA packet when\
    \ it decodes the ATS packet successfully,\nand the receiver returns the ACK packet\
    \ at the end. If there is an error-free environment the transmitter\ndecodes the\
    \ ACK packet correctly and completes one DATA packet transmission.\nDATA\nNTS\n\

    We mention that an PU can receive interference when it becomes active during the\
    \ exchange of\nNTS and CTS. However, such interference is acceptable in CR systems\
    \ because of the following two\nreasons. First, IEEE 802.22 standard requires\
    \ that SUs should necessarily vacate the channel within\n100 ms once PUs become\
    \ active [49]. For example, assuming the transmission rate of 1 Mbps and\nthe\
    \ packet size of 1000 bytes, the packet transmission time is 8 ms, much less than\
    \ â100 msâ. Hence,\nthe allowed time is good enough for the exchange of NTS and\
    \ CTS packets. Second, the activity rate of\nincumbent PUs for cognitive radio\
    \ networks is usually observed very low [50â52]. Hence, incumbent\nPUs are not\
    \ likely to remain active most of the time. Refer to the exchange of NTS and CTS\
    \ packets,\nit should be noticed that transmitter does not always receives the\
    \ CTS packet when there is a collision\namong multiple NTS packets. The detailed\
    \ operation under HSMA/CA is studied in Section 5.\n4.2. Spectrum Sensing Optimization\n\
    We now provide an analysis to demonstrate how the performance of the proposed\
    \ protocol could\nbe improved under the real environments while considering the\
    \ inefï¬ciencies of spectrum sensing.\nWe optimize the spectrum sensing period\
    \ and the sensing threshold because both of the parameters\ncan otherwise affect\
    \ the performance of the proposed protocol. To improve the system performance,\n\
    we can optimize both of the parameters by minimizing the incidence of false alarm\
    \ and misdetection\nwith a given activity rate of hidden primary terminals (or\
    \ hidden PUs). In our model, we assume N\nspectrum sensing slots in a spectrum\
    \ sensing period. We denote the duration of each sensing slot as Ts.\nHence, the\
    \ length of a spectrum sensing interval can be written as,\nT = N Ã Ts,\n(5)\n\
    which is our design parameter. From Equations (1) and (3), we can derive false\
    \ alarm and misdetection\nprobabilities at a given sensing interval, so as to\
    \ calculate the network throughput. Let the hidden PUs\nare activated with an\
    \ activity factor A at each sensing slot time. Let h be the number of hidden PUs.\n\
    We can ï¬nd the hidden PUsâ interference probability, Pi, as a function of N, A,\
    \ and h as,\nPi = 1 â\n\x02\01 â A\n\x01h\x03N,\n(6)\nwhere the second term refers\
    \ to the no-interference probability to the hidden PUs. We hence can derive\n\
    the throughput of the system as,\nËS = R(Î», N) Ã\n\01 â Pi\n\x01\nC,\n(7)\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 241\n9 of 21\nwhere C is a given channel capacity and recall that\
    \ R is the clear channel probability as deï¬ned in\nEquation (4). From Equation\
    \ (1), we can see that,\nÎ» = ËÎ» Ã Î½2,\n(8)\nwhere ËÎ» is the normalized value of\
    \ the sensing threshold, Î» and noise power, Î½2 in the wireless channel.\nPlease\
    \ note that the optimization model is only designed to obtain the optimized value\
    \ of sensing\ninterval while considering the peculiarities of spectrum sensing\
    \ in a real environment. So, the network\nthroughput is derived to observe the\
    \ effects of our design parameters. We have investigated the\nperformance of our\
    \ proposed protocol with more detail in the following.\n5. Performance Analysis\n\

    5.1.1. NTS collision\nWe recall that under HSMA/CA the contending SUs are dispersed\
    \ with the backoff mechanism\nto avoid the collision. The backoff time of each\
    \ SU is deï¬ned by its randomly chosen backoff counter,\nwhich is decreased by\
    \ one whenever the backoff slot is idle. The winner SU whose backoff counter\n\
    expires ï¬rst can transmit the NTS packet. However, more than one winner SUs can\
    \ cause NTS collision\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n11 of 21\nwhenever their backoff\
    \ counters expire at the same time. Suppose that SU i has the backlogged buffer\n\
    queue and the backoff counter 0. So, SU i transmits NTS packet to the SU j with\
    \ the transmission\ntrial probability denoted as Xi. After the timeout, SU i is\
    \ failed to receive the CTS packet since its\nNTS packet becomes collided with\
    \ another NTS packet. That situation, what we called as event e1,\nwill happen\
    \ with the probability,\np1 = Ri\n \n1 â\nK\nâ\nk=2\n\x02\n1 â XkRk\n\x03\n!\n\
    ,\n(9)\nwhere Xk and Rk respectively refer to the packet transmission trial probability\
    \ and the clear channel\nprobability for SU k. In the second term of Equation\
    \ (9), this can be helpful to notice that NTS packet\nof at least one SU will\
    \ collide to the NTS packet of SU i when k SUs, where k = 2, . . . , K, are not\
    \ trying\nto transmit with 1 â Xk probability. From Figure 4a, time delay of SU\
    \ i due to event e1 is,\nt1 = NTS + CTS + SIFS + DIFS,\n(10)\nwhere NTS and CTS\
    \ accounts for the transmission time of one RTS and that of one CTS, respectively.\n\
    5.1.2. Blocking at SU Transmitter\nSuppose that SUs i and j have exchanged the\
    \ NTS and CTS packets. Therefore, both SUs, thanks to\nNAV mechanism, mutually\
    \ conduct their spectrum sensing operations without receiving interruption\nfrom\
    \ the other SUs. However, SU i has sensed the neighboring PUs active and so it\
    \ is blocked by the\nspectrum sensing for a predeï¬ned period, which is event e2\
    \ that encounters with probability,\np2 = 1 â Ri.\n(11)\nFrom Figure 4b, time\
    \ delay by the event e2 at SU i can be written as,\nt2 = NTS + CTS + SS+ 3SIFS\
    \ + DIFS,\n(12)\nwhere SS denotes the length of spectrum sensing time for one\
    \ mutual operation.\n5.1.3. Blocking at SU Receiver\nSuppose that SU i is not\
    \ blocked by the spectrum sensing, so it is waiting to receive the ATS\npacket\
    \ from the SU j. However, if SU j has sensed the hidden PUs as active, then it\
    \ will be blocked by\nthe spectrum sensing operation and so cannot send the ATS\
    \ packet. That is event e3, in which SU i\ntransmits packet to SU j with the packet\
    \ transmission probability Î¸ij. However, the timeout in SU i\nwill ultimately\
    \ fail the data packet transmission with probability,\np3 = Ri(1 â Rj) â\njÌ¸=i\n\
    Î¸ij\n \nK\nâ\nk=3\n\x02\n1 â XkRk\n\x03\n!\n,\n(13)\nwhere 1 â Rj denotes no channel\
    \ clearance probability for SU j. The last term in Equation (13) indicates\nthat\
    \ no transmitter out of k SUs, where k = 3, . . . , K, can interrupt SU iâs transmission.\
    \ From Figure 4c,\nthe time delay due to event e3 can be measured as,\nt3 = NTS\
    \ + CTS + SS + 3SIFS + DIFS.\n(14)\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n12 of 21\n5.1.4. Successful\
    \ Transmission\nNow we consider the successful transmission case, which we called\
    \ as event e4. Suppose that\nSUs i and j are not being blocked by the mutual spectrum\
    \ sensing operation. In that case, SU i will\npositively decode the ATS packet\
    \ if there is an error-free channel. Thereafter, SU i sends an DATA\npacket and\
    \ then it will correctly receive the ACK packet from the corresponding SU j. Meanwhile,\n\
    NAV mechanism keeps the other SUs silent for the respective time periods noticed\
    \ in the overheard\nNTS, CTS, and ATS packets. The occurrence probability of event\
    \ e4 can be written as,\np4 = RiRj\n\01 â Xj\n\x01 â\njÌ¸=i\nÎ¸ij\n \nK\nâ\nk=3\n\
    \x02\n1 â XkRk\n\x03\n!\n,\n(15)\nwhere 1 â Xj represents reception state of SU\
    \ j. From Figure 4d, time delay by event e4 is given as,\nt4 = NTS + CTS + SS\
    \ + ATS + DATA\n+ ACK + 5SIFS + DIFS,\n(16)\nwhere ATS, DATA, and ACK respectively\
    \ denote the transmission time of one ATS packet, transmission\ntime of one DATA\
    \ packet, and that of one ACK packet.\n5.2. Normalized Throughput\nWe analyze\
    \ the performance of our proposed HSMA/CA protocol in terms of normalized throughput,\n\
    which is what is derived under the given set of assumptions:\nâ¢\nThe topology\
    \ of the secondary network is composed of a fully connected complete graph, therein\n\
    SUs are directly connected to each other with a single hop distance.\nâ¢\nThe secondary\
    \ network is saturated such that SUs have non-empty queues, in which there is\n\
    always an DATA packet to send at each station.\nâ¢\nThe transmission channel is\
    \ error-free and there is no capture effect, so the packets are discarded\nwhen\
    \ they receive collision.\nâ¢\nThe control and DATA packets are sent through a\
    \ single channel, which is shared among the SUs.\nâ¢\nThe SUs use the same physical\
    \ layer and their data transmission rate is also constant.\nWe investigate the\
    \ backoff process of SUs in HSMA/CA system with a two-dimensional Markov\nchain\
    \ model as illustrated in Figure 5, in which backoff states at time t are deï¬ned\
    \ by the values of two\nrandom processes of backoff stages m(t) and backoff counters\
    \ c(t). We can denote the backoff state of\nan arbitrary SU i being the value\
    \ of a backoff stage m â 1 and that of a backoff counter c â 1 as (m, c).\nThe\
    \ arbitrary SU i decreases it backoff counter from its contention window W whenever\
    \ the channel is\nobserved as idle. Once the backoff counter reaches 0, SU i can\
    \ begin data transmission process. In that\nprocess, if the transmission is successful,\
    \ then SU i returns to its initial backoff stage. Conversely,\nwhen SU i observes\
    \ collision, it increases its backoff stage from m to m + 1 upto a maximum retry\
    \ limit\nM. In that case, the backoff counter is chosen among m â [0, Wm+1] provided\
    \ m â¤ M. We denote the\nsize of initial and that of maximum window as W0 and WM,\
    \ respectively. When SU i transmits with\nprobability p, it is a failed transmission\
    \ that happens either due to e1, e2, or e3. For SU i, we can obtain\nthe probability\
    \ of a failed transmission from Equations (1), (9), (11) and (13),\npi = Î±i +\
    \ p1 + p2 + p3,\n(17)\nwhich will be increased by the inevitable probability of\
    \ false alarm, Î±i, in a real environment.\nFrom Equations (3) and (15), we can\
    \ obtain the probability of a successful transmission as,\nqi = Î²i + p4,\n(18)\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 241\n13 of 21\nwhere p4 remains high due to misdetection probability,\
    \ Î²i, in a real sensing environment. From Figure 5,\nwe can obtain the state transition\
    \ probabilities of the Markov chain as Equation (20). We noticed that\nthe Markov\
    \ chain of our HSMA/CA protocol hase close resmblace to that in Chong et al. [53]\
    \ due\nto the common backoff process. We hence directly refer to the results in\
    \ Chong et al. [53] for the\ntransmission trial probability of SU i as Equation\
    \ (21).\n0, 0\n0, 1\n0, W0 â 2\n0, W0 â 1\nm, 0\nm, 1\nm, Wm â 2\nm, Wm â 1\n\

    \ system slots into empty slots and event slots. In the empty slots, SUs do\n\
    not attempt to transmit packets. However, SUs in the event slots observe one of\
    \ the four possible\nevents, as deï¬ned in Equations (10), (12), (14) and (16),\

    \ classify the event slots into transmission slots and no-transmission slots.\n\
    The slots in which transmissions happen successfully are transmission slots. From\
    \ Equation (18),\nwe already have obtained the successful transmission probability\
    \ under a real environment for SU i.\nHence, the occurrence probability of the\
    \ slots with successful data transmission can be written as,\nPr = â\ni\nXiqi.\n\
    (22)\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n14 of 21\nHowever, the no-transmission slots are\
    \ those slots who have observed the failed transmissions.\nWe can ï¬nd the occurrence\
    \ of no-transmission slots with probability Pn = 1 â (Pe + Pr).\nThe throughput\
    \ of the proposed HSMA/CA system can be expressed as,\nS = Average data paylod\
    \ bits transmitted in a slot\nAverage length of a slot\n.\n(23)\nWe assume an\
    \ autonomous system in which SUs have an average size of the data payload bits\n\
    E[P]. So, the average amount of the data payload bits successfully transmitted\
    \ in one slot is PtE[P].\nLet E[O] be the average length of a slot, which can\
    \ intuitively be computed as,\nE[O] = PeÏ + PrE[Tr] + PnE[Tn],\n(24)\nwhere Tr\
    \ = t4 and Tn = t2(= t3). We assume t1(= t2 = t3) so that all SUs can keep pace\
    \ in the system.\nHence, Tn = t1(= t2 = t3). From Equation (16), we can observe\
    \ that\nE[Tr] = NTS + CTS + SS + ATS + DATA\n+ ACK + 5SIFS + DIFS\n= NTS + CTS\
    \ + SS + ATS(H + E[P])/E\n+ ACK + 5SIFS + DIFS,\n(25)\nwhere H and E respectively\
    \ represent the size of PHY plus MAC headers and the channel transmission\nrate.\
    \ From Equation (12), t2 is constant and so E[Tn] = t2. Conclusively, Equation\
    \ (23) becomes,\nS =\nK â 1\n\0PtE[P]\n\x01\nK\n\0PeÏ + PrE[Tr] + PnE[Tn]\n\x01\
    ,\n(26)\nwhere the term Kâ1\nK\nrefers to the blocking effect such that only one\
    \ SU can at most be blocked due to\nspectrum sensing out of K users in the system.\n\
    6. Results and Discussion\nWe used energy detection model for spectrum sensing,\
    \ in which ï¬rst we need to determine the\noptimized value of the normalized threshold\
    \ and that of spectrum sensing slots. For that purpose,\nwe have derived the spectrum\
    \ sensorâs false alarm and misdetection probabilities as Equations (1) and\n(3),\
    \ respectively. We assume a 1 MHz channel and set the spectrum sensing sampling\
    \ rate with 6 MHz\nand SNR of the PU signal measured at SU is set to 0 dB. Further,\
    \ the number of spectrum sensing\nslots is assumed to be 20, with duration of\
    \ 0.035 ms each. We consider the activity rate of hidden PU\nas 1%. To validate\
    \ our analysis, we develop simulation in C++ code according to the details of\
    \ our\nHSMA/CA protocol. We average 1000 runs to obtain one simulation result.\
    \ In a nutshell, the default\nparameters used in the simulation are summarized\

    \ we have shown the effect of various design parameters over the spectrum sensing\n\
    errors in the system. We have evaluated the variations of misdetection probability\
    \ for the various\nvalues of normalized sensing threshold in Figure 6a. We can\
    \ see that misdetection probability remains\n0 when the threshold is less than\
    \ 0.9975, and it becomes sharply increases when the threshold is greater\nthan\
    \ 0.9975. We mention that the sensing threshold is bounded upper due to the requirement\

    \ With higher sensing threshold\n(i.e., >0.9975), the throughput of secondary\
    \ network increases but the PUs cannot protect enough.\nOn the other hand, the\
    \ false alarm probability remains high with threshold less than 0.9975 and then\
    \ it\ngoes down sharply when the threshold exceeds 0.9975, as shown in Figure\
    \ 6b. Hence, the achieved\noptimized spectrum sensing threshold by minimizing\

    \ high probability of false alarm and thus the system\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n\

    \ the system throughput can\ndecrease due to the increased sensing overhead. We\
    \ can also see that there exists the optimal number\nof sensing slots (=5) and\
    \ accordingly the optimal spectrum sensing interval (=0.035 ms Ã 5) for the\n\
    best throughput. However, it depends on the system environment such as channel\
    \ model, sampling\nrate and the distance between PUs and SUs. In Figure 8, we\
    \ exhibit the effect of sensing threshold over\nthe throughput of the system.\
    \ We can see that system throughput remains low (=0) below the optimal\nthreshold\
    \ and thereafter it increases up to the maximum value due to the higher probability\
    \ of false\nalarm and misdetection, respectively. If the chosen threshold is higher\
    \ than the optimal value, the\nthroughput of the system can be achieved further\
    \ but at the cost of higher misdetection, which is not\ndesirable due to the protection\
    \ priority of PU in CR system.\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n0.8\n0.85\n0.9\n0.95\nNumber\

    We have shown the effect of hidden primary node activity rate over the system\
    \ performance\nfor the various number of hidden PUs in Figure 9. Therein, the\
    \ values of throughput monotonically\ndecrease with the increase in activity rate\
    \ of the hidden primary node. This is because of the fact that a\nhidden PU can\
    \ interrupt more with higher activity rate and secondary network accordingly vacates\n\
    the channel to avoid interference that eventually leads to a decrease in system\
    \ performance. However,\nthe gap between the curves of throughput is attributed\
    \ due to the large number of hidden PUs, that can\nblock SUs with more probability\
    \ and so the achieved throughput of the system decreases sharply.\nFigure 10 illustrates\
    \ the effect of sensing errors in terms of false alarm and misdetection\nprobabilities\
    \ at the optimal values of spectrum sensing slots and normalized threshold. We\
    \ can\nSensors 2019, 19, 241\n17 of 21\nsee that as long as the false alarm probability\
    \ decreases and the misdetection probability increases,\nthe throughput of the\
    \ system increases accordingly. This is because of the fact that a smaller value\
    \ of\nfalse alarm and a larger value of misdetection can generate the higher value\
    \ of throughput. On the\ncontrary, if the sensing errors and spectrum sensing\
    \ slots in the system are not optimized, then SUsâ\nsystem performance and PUsâ\
    \ protection both can degrade signiï¬cantly.\nWe now present the performance of\
    \ proposed protocol in terms of normalized throughput.\nIn Figure 11, we compare\
    \ the performance of the proposed HSMA/CA with CR-MEGA and\nMSMA/CA protocols.\
    \ We witness that our analysis is very accurate because our analysis results\n\
    closely follow the simulation results. We observe that the performance of the\
    \ secondary network\nremains low since the contention window becomes large for\
    \ the less number of SUs. On the other hand,\ncontention window becomes smaller\
    \ for a large number of SUs that lead to increase the RTS collisions.\nSo, the\
    \ system performance is decreased. We also observe that our proposed HSMA/CA outperforms\n\
    both CR-MEGA and MSMA/CA protocols due to its optimized sensing. This is how our\
    \ HSMA/CA\nprotocol avoids the sensing overhead to spare the fraction of bandwidth\
    \ for the transmission of more\ndata packets, which ultimately maximizes the system\
    \ performance. Given the best performance with\noptimal threshold and sensing\
    \ interval, it is safe to say that our HSMA/CA is a best candidate MAC\nprotocol\

    \ Conclusions\nWe propose a Handshake Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance\
    \ (HSMA/CA)\nmechanism for CR-based IoT networks. Therein, the transmitter ï¬rst\
    \ conducts carrier sensing and\nthereafter it handshakes with the intended receiver\
    \ using NTS and CTS packets to keep the neighboring\nSUs silent. Once NTS and\
    \ CTS are exchanged, the transmitter performs mutual spectrum sensing\nin conjunction\
    \ with the receiver in order to detect active PUs and active hidden PUs, respectively.\n\
    When PU is active, spectrum sensing blocks the transmitter. Otherwise, it waits\
    \ to receive the ATS\npacket from the corresponding receiver before transmitting\
    \ a DATA packet. If the hidden PU is\nactive, then the receiver holds the ATS\
    \ packet to block the transmitter. Whenever the channel is\nclear, the transmitter\
    \ sends an DATA packet and receiver replies with an ACK in the sequel. In case\n\
    of collision, SUs follow a bakeoff procedure as that in standard CSMA/CA. This\
    \ is how our MAC\nprotocol protects priority right of PUs by resolving the hidden\
    \ primary terminal problem, in addition\nto protecting a densely deployed network\
    \ from the classical hidden and exposed terminal problems.\nOur HSMA/CA also adapts\
    \ the spectrum sensing period by maintaining inefï¬ciencies in spectrum\nsensing\
    \ to avoid the sensing overhead. We investigate the performance of the proposed\
    \ protocol\nin terms of normalized throughput using the Markov model and duly\
    \ veriï¬ed by the simulation.\nWe observe that our HSMA/CA outperforms existing\
    \ schemes due to optimized spectrum sensing.\nHence, the proposed HSMA/CA can\
    \ be a good candidate MAC protocol in the real environment.\nAuthor Contributions:\

  key_findings: '*   The HSMA/CA protocol resolves the hidden primary terminal problem
    and maintains sufficient priority rights to PUs in a densely distributed network.



    *   The HSMA/CA protocol optimizes the spectrum sensing period to maximize the
    system performance by maintaining peculiarities in the sensing operation like
    false alarm and misdetection.



    *   Simulation results show that the HSMA/CA protocol outperforms existing schemes
    due to optimized spectrum sensing and is suitable for non-collaborative densely

  explanation: The paper proposes a novel cognitive radio-based approach to optimize
    wireless communication in noisy environments. It leverages cognitive radio networks
    and dynamic spectrum access to monitor the spectrum and identify underutilized
    portions. The system then dynamically configures the transmitter parameters to
    avoid interference and congestion, improving overall network performance and resource
    allocation.
  extract_1: '"Moreover, the introduction of cognitive radio with dynamic spectrum
    access considerably enhances the efficiency of spectrum utilization. Cognitive
    radio networks continuously monitor the spectrum to identify underutilized portions,
    thus allowing for opportunistic access. ... The proposed approach enables dynamic
    configuration of the transmitter parameters, including frequency, power, and modulation
    scheme, to optimally adapt to the current spectrum conditions."'
  extract_2: '"The intelligent transmitter continuously monitors the spectrum and
    identifies underutilized portions, enabling opportunistic access and optimal utilization
    of the available spectrum. As a result, the network performance is significantly

    AI-Based Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and
    7 more April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that
    uses neural networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually
    relevant text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The
    models are trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and
    learn complex concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases,
    and styles. FlowDep - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle
    detection for aut... Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection
    is crucial for the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles
    such as palm-sized drones, it is a challenge to implement traditional methods
    like Lidar due to high costs and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning
    approaches, while accurate, are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles.
    To address this issue, we introduce Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm
    inspired by the low-resolution but efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects.
    Flowdep combines optic flow and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the
    depth of every image pixel. We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial
    neural network (Flowdep-ANN). Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    5.8 to 114.7 times faster than the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies
    of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep
    and Flowdep-ANN on a small autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing
    platform, and both models successfully performed real-time object detection. The
    present work demonstrates the potential of using optical flow as an efficient
    approach to estimate depth and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles.
    Misinformative Data Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April
    03, 2024 Sports are data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics
    and teams leverage data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which
    is created by media outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating
    narratives about the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data
    in the sports world, data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape.
    These data visualizations, while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers,
    can be misinformative; media creators often have incentives to present specific
    narratives which don''t always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing
    misinformative data visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to
    understand the techniques and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations
    in all domains, not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols
    Drew Scott April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are
    ubiquitous in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual
    authentication between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level
    communications. This is because tags should not share secret information with
    unknown parties and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication
    protocols designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate
    for RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy,
    small memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and
    practical authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID
    systems became prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols.
    The Effect of Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal
    and 2 more April 03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels
    on the performance of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of
    the signal received from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical
    analysis of the variation in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath
    is given. We present the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power,
    and we analyze the received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform,
    impulse waveform, and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of
    standard channel models. It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels,
    the change in power between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight
    channel. It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely
    cancels unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in
    a distributed array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip
    paths are coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence
    in complex channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way
    time transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April
    02, 2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory
    based on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 â¼ 4Ã. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications

    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations

    FR2-2 Short-Range Communications for... Yusuke Koda and 3 more April 02, 2024
    This paper proposes a comprehensive 3GPPcnaompatible channel model with statistical
    enhancement tailored for indoor short-range device-to-device (D2D) communications
    operating in the frequency range (FR) of 52.6-71.0 GHz termed FR2-2. Regardless
    of the existence of various channel models at this band for indoor communications,
    there will be a need for developing a channel model compatible with and understandable
    from the current 3GPP stochastic channel model (SCM) to facilitate the discussion
    in the 3GPP for developing such FR2-2 short-range D2D communication framework
    based on the fifthgeneration (5G) new radio (NR). Indeed, such a futuristic vision
    can be foreseen from the fact that the 3GPP is discussing the evolution of sidelink,
    referred to as a D2D communication framework; however, there are no 3GPP SCM-compatible
    channel models applicable to FR2-2 short-range D2D communications. To fill this
    void, we propose the channel model coined 3GPPCompFR2-InS that allows us to generate
    channel impulse responses (CIR) for computer simulations, which is suitable for
    various indoor short-range D2D communication scenarios while retailing the similarity
    in terms of the implementation policy of the 3GPP SCM. 3GPPCompFR2-InS is verified
    based on the real-world measurements at the 60 GHz band from the viewpoint of
    both the validity of the channel model parameters and that of the statistical
    behavior of the generated CIRs. Effective media models for wave propagation in
    prestressed fractured rocks with nonli... Li-Yun Fu and 3 more April 02, 2024
    Stress-induced progressive deformations in fractured rocks with increasing effective
    pressure generally undergo nonlinear elastic (due to the closure of compliant
    pores), hyperelastic (due to residual stress), and inelastic (due to fracture
    growth) deformations prior to mechanical failure. Wave propagation in such rocks
    involves the complex interaction of fracture-and stress-induced changes in both
    velocity and anisotropy. With attention to nonlinear elastic and hyperelastic
    deformations, we incorporate acoustoelasticity into the traditional Hudson/Cheng
    models to describe the coupling of fracture-induced and stress-induced anisotropies.
    The resulting acoustoelastic Hudson model (AHM) is valid for the crack density
    smaller than 0.1 whereas the PadÃ© AHM could handle higher crack densities. We
    extend the PadÃ© AHM to consider the stress-induced crack closure with nonlinear
    elastic deformations by incorporating the dual-porosity model. These models approach
    the coupled anisotropies with different accuracies and computational complexities.
    The plane-wave analyses and effective-moduli calculations of stressed fractured
    rocks with varying crack densities determine the accuracy of these models under
    the isotropic (confining) and anisotropic (uniaxial and pure shear) prestress
    conditions. The relevant Thomsen parameters are applied to experimental data to
    validate the applicability. Finite-difference simulations are implemented to identify
    the contribution of different anisotropies through the variety of wavefronts,
    depending on fracture orientation, crack density, prestress mode and magnitude,
    and loading direction. Particular attention is paid to the anisotropic prestress,
    where the coupled anisotropies are constructive or destructive interference, strongly
    related to the relativity between fracture strike and loading direction. The stress-induced
    crack closure will reduce the fracture anisotropy so that the stress-induced background
    anisotropy dominates the shape of wavefronts with increasing prestress. Security
    and Reliability Performance of a Cooperative Network with Self-Sustaining No...
    Amit Patel and 1 more April 02, 2024 In this paper, we analyze the secrecy performance
    of a two-hop cooperative network consisting solely of energy-harvesting self-sustaining
    nodes drawing energy from a multi-antenna power beacon (PB). Performance of such
    networks is quite different from that with powered nodes. We consider optimal
    combining of the direct and relayed signals at the multi-antenna destination as
    well as the multi-antenna eavesdropper. Since availability of channel state information
    at the source is impractical in such networks, we assume fixed-rate signaling.
    To implement incremental signaling, we utilize feedback bits from the destination.
    Assuming practical nonlinear EH, exact and approximate expressions are derived
    for the secrecy outage probability of the selective decode-and-forward (SDF) and
    the incremental decode-and-forward (IDF) relaying schemes. It is demonstrated
    that IDF has much better secrecy performance than SDF just as with powered nodes.
    However, unlike with powered nodes, the secrecy performance is a convex function
    of the transmit power of PB. We propose a novel power back-off scheme to improve
    secrecy under different network operating conditions. The security-reliability
    trade-off (SRT) is analyzed to highlight the trade-off between outage and secrecy
    performance with the power back-off scheme. Simulation results validate the analytical
    expressions. Scalable Dynamic Spectrum Access with IEEE 1900.5.2 Spectrum Consumption
    Models Prasad Netalkar and 5 more April 03, 2024 Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)
    is a key mechanism for meeting the ever-increasing demand for emerging wireless
    services. DSA involves managing and assigning available spectrum resources in
    a way that minimizes interference and allows RF coexistence between heterogeneous
    devices and systems. Spectrum Consumption Models (SCMs)-defined in the IEEE 1900.5.2
    standard, offer a mechanism for RF devices to: (i) declare the characteristics
    of their intended spectrum use and their interference protection needs; and (ii)
    determine compatibility (non-interference) with existing devices. In this paper,
    we propose a novel SCM-based Spectrum Deconfliction (SD) algorithm that dynamically
    configures RF operational parameters (e.g., center frequency and transmission
    power) of a target transmitter-receiver pair aiming to minimize interference with
    existing devices/systems. We also propose sequential and distributed DSA methods
    that use the SD algorithm for assigning spectrum in large-scale networks. To evaluate
    the performance of our methods in terms of computation time, spectrum assignment
    efficiency, and overhead, we use two custom-made simulation platforms. Finally,
    to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of our methods, we build a proof-of-concept
    implementation in the NSF PAWR COSMOS wireless testbed. The results reveal the
    advantages of using SCMs and their capabilities to conduct spectrum assignments
    in dynamic and congested communication environments. Advanced Cardiovascular Health
    in a Quantum AI-driven Healthcare Framework Sarvapriya M Tripathi and 2 more April
    02, 2024 With the advent of Healthcare 4.0, there is increased interest from researchers
    the world over in the application of modern, cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) algorithms in solving healthcare
    challenges. The era of Quantum Computing (QC) promises to bring significant advancements
    in several areas of healthcare such that it may be sensible to give this hybrid
    Quantum/Classical paradigm its own name-Healthcare4Q. The potential of QC will
    extend the reach of Healthcare4Q with the help of diverse technologies such as
    quantum-enabled wearables, quantum-secure transfer and storage of data, and quantum
    computing at edge, fog, and cloud. All of these technologies promise to catapult
    Healthcare4Q to become the most capable healthcare framework in the advancement
    of medical innovations and improvement of patient care. An integral part of a
    person''s health lies in cardiovascular health, and thus prioritizing and optimizing
    cardiovascular health remains vital to the broader goals of public health and
    healthcare sustainability. In this study, under the paradigm of Healthcare4Q,
    we propose a framework called the Quantum AIdriven Heart Health Framework (QAIHHF)
    that can provide advanced predictive intelligence to healthcare providers by utilizing
    historical and real-time data and processing capabilities proposed in Healthcare4Q.
    We show that when applied to various diagnostics and health indicators such as
    ECG data, the Quantum AI provides accuracy at a level equal to or higher as compared
    to the classical methods thus proving itself to be the critical component that
    will herald the era of Healthcare4Q. QCDC-DR-GA: Optimizing Container Loading
    and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Docky... Md. Mahfuzur Rahman and 4 more
    April 01, 2024 This paper addresses the optimization of container unloading and
    loading operations at ports, integrating quaycrane dual-cycling (QCDC) with dockyard
    rehandle minimization. We present a unified model encompassing both operations:
    ship container unloading and loading by quay crane, and the other is reducing
    dockyard rehandles while loading the ship. We recognize that optimizing one aspect
    in isolation can lead to suboptimal outcomes due to interdependencies. Specifically,
    optimizing unloading sequences for minimal operation time may inadvertently increase
    dockyard rehandles during loading and vice versa. To address this NP-hard problem,
    we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) QCDC-DR-GA comprising 1dimensional
    and 2-dimensional GA components. Our model, QCDC-DR-GA, consistently outperforms
    four state-of-the-art methods in maximizing dual cycles and minimizing dockyard
    rehandles. Compared to those methods, it reduced 15-20% of total operation time
    for large vessels. Results underscore the inefficiency of separately optimizing
    QCDC and dockyard rehandles. Fragmented approaches, such as QCDC Scheduling Optimized
    by bi-level GA and GA-ILSRS (Scenario 2), show limited improvement compared to
    QCDC-DR-GA. As in GA-ILSRS (Scenario 1), neglecting dual-cycle optimization leads
    to inferior performance than our proposed QCDC-DR-GA. A Two-Stage Passive Matrix
    Addressing Method for Large-Scale Beam-Steering Arrays PengYuan Wang April 01,
    2024 This letter proposes a passive matrix addressing method to dramatically reduce
    the number of controlling (biasing) lines for large-scale beam-steering arrays.
    Phase shifting of each radiation element is accomplished in two stages by the
    row and column biasing lines located at two stacked layers, which offer a pair
    of orthogonal wave vectors. For an antenna array with M rows and N columns, conventional
    direct addressing designs need M * N biasing lines, while the proposed method
    needs only M+N biasing lines to complete the full-space beam-steering. The proposed
    method simplifies the routing of control lines and the design of driving circuits.
    Both theoretical and numerical analyses are provided to validate this method.
    Efficient Twiddle Factor Generation for Post Quantum Cryptography FALCON-based
    Number... Ghada Alsuhli and 4 more April 01, 2024 Area and power-efficient hardware
    implementations are crucial for the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography
    (PQC) algorithms like FALCON. One of the main operations in FALCON is the Number
    Theoretic Transform (NTT), which needs to be performed with many prime numbers.
    Having one set of twiddle factors (TFs) for each prime makes storing all of these
    TFs impractical. In this paper, we propose an architecture for generating TFs
    on the fly for FALCON-oriented NTT, designed for area and power efficiency. Our
    approach dynamically generates TFs during NTT computations, significantly reducing
    on-chip memory requirements. The ASIC implementation results demonstrate significant
    improvements, with the proposed design reducing on-chip memory requirements by
    99%, occupying 95% less area, and consuming 87.4% less power compared to the traditional
    ROM-based implementation. Furthermore, our design achieved a much higher maximum
    clock frequency, indicating superior performance in accessing twiddle factors.
    These findings highlight the potential of our proposed architecture for efficient
    hardware implementations of FALCON-based cryptographic systems. â Previous 1 2

    rights and content Abstract While 5G is at the early deployment state around the
    globe, the research and industrial communities have already started concentrating
    their efforts on formulating the overall 6G vision comprising requirements, key
    enabling technologies, performance indicators, and applications. Following the
    trend, it is evident that 6G will emerge as highly softwarized and open networks
    allowing the participation of multiple stakeholders. This undoubtedly will make
    6G more flexible, agile, autonomous, intelligent, and cost-efficient networks.
    However, the programmability and openness will make 6G networks more prone to
    issues like security, privacy, traceability, interoperability, auditability, resource
    manageability, spectrum efficiency, and 3D mobility. To address these issues,
    a deep integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks is foreseen. Thus,
    we aim to put together blockchain and 6G under a magnifying lens to gain a comprehensive
    understanding of the role of blockchain in the 6G ecosystem. We begin by providing
    an overview of the envisioned 6G networks and blockchain technology. Next, we
    present a high-level view of the role of blockchain for 6G trends and requirements.
    Following that, we conduct an in-depth study on how the blockchain can provide
    a secure, transparent, and decentralized underpinning to various technical aspects
    and use cases of 6G. Thereafter, we discuss the deployment challenges to be faced
    while integrating blockchain in 6G and the possible solutions. Finally, future
    research directions are expounded to set the floor for further advancements in
    the blockchainized 6G. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords
    6G networksTelecommunicationsBlockchainDistributed Ledger Technology 1. Introduction
    The evolution of mobile networks has come a long way and has hitherto fulfilled
    the market demands as well as usersâ expectations. The time has come for the world
    to experience and enjoy the services offered by the fifth-generation (5G) of mobile
    networks. It is going to radically change the way humans and machines communicate,
    interact and stay connected. Distinctively, 5G supports three different broad
    traffic classes namely eMBB (enhanced Mobile Broadband), URLLC (Ultra-Reliable
    and Low Latency Communication), and mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications)
    [1], [2]. These are designed to meet heterogeneous and customized demands of individuals
    as well as network tenants such as industry verticals, mobile virtual network
    operator (MVNO), Over The Top (OTT) service providers [3]. Moreover, various new
    technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization
    (NFV), Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), Network Slicing (NS), Cloud Computing
    (CC), Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), and massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
    (MIMO) drive the 5G ecosystem and help achieve the 5G vision [4], [5] (A list
    of important acronyms is given in Table 1). Table 1. Summary of important acronyms.

    community already has identified numerous gaps that will not be filled through
    5G even with its full capacity. For instance, 5G, in line with its predecessor
    generations, remains confined to cell-based communications that offer primarily
    ground coverage [6], [7], [8]. Further, even with 5G, a significant portion of
    the earth will remain unconnected and uncovered which includes large bodies of
    water, areas with low (or negligible) population, deep deserts, and mountains
    [9]. Hence, 5Gâs state-of-art and its ongoing initial deployments reveal many
    limitations when one envisions future requirements [7]. Hence, in a decade or
    so, even with 5G technology it would be difficult to scale up and meet the diverse
    demands (in terms of traffic, connection density, and services) of the hyper-connected
    future era. This understanding has impelled a new wave of interest in the next
    generation of mobile networks which is touted as the 6G. At present, with a resurgence
    of research activities around the globe, the research and industrial community
    is formulating the overall vision, exploring the potential use cases, defining
    the future requirements, and identifying the key enabling technologies for 6G
    [1]. 6G, the future generation of wireless communication system, is envisioned
    to lay the foundation of a new era of hyper-connected and artificially intelligent
    societies [10]. It would enable complete digitization, mobilization, and automation
    with seamless integration of heterogeneous networks spanning over space, air,
    ground, underground and undersea, thereby paving the way for universal communication
    system [11]. For instance, the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as Aerial
    Base Stations (ABS) will extend the reach of ground stations enabling better coverage
    and cell-free communications. Integrating heterogeneous networks in 6G calls for
    a unified framework comprising of key enabling technologies like Artificial Intelligence
    (AI), Blockchain, Visible Light Communication (VLC), quantum communications, and
    TeraHertz (THz) communications [7], [9], [12]. Moreover, 6G is believed to go
    beyond conventional RF-based communications and embrace various other propagation
    media like sonar waves for underwater, optical fiber for the fronthaul and the
    backhaul, and magnetic induction for underground communications [13]. Undoubtedly,
    6G has to meet the predicted explosive growth in terms of the number of connected
    devices as well as the exponentially increasing traffic demands. As per CISCO,
    by 2030, 500 billion devices would be connected across the globe, which will be
    of the order of 59 times more than the human population by then [10]. The traffic
    is estimated to be 607 exabyte/month by 2025 and 5016 exabyte/month by 2030 [14].
    Major contributors to this expected traffic will be video traffic and the M2M
    communications traffic [14]. The trend exhibits that the prominent users of 6G
    are going to be machines/devices thus network services will be more machine-centric
    than human-centric. The fascinating range of new devices that will proliferate
    the space of connected devices will be AR (Augmented Reality) glasses, VR (Virtual
    Reality) headsets, hologram devices, swarm robots, home appliances, range of sensors
    of autonomous vehicles, industrial machines, and Internet of Everything (IoE)
    devices [10]. 6G networks are envisioned to be softwarized, virtualized, customized,
    cloudified, edgified, intelligent, autonomous and self-sustainable [15]. Security
    and privacy of such open and programmable networks will be one of the indispensable
    architectural requirements. Some of the identified technologies that will play
    a cardinal role in this direction include blockchain technology, native Artificial
    Intelligence (AI), quantum computing and communication, and Physical Layer Security
    (PLS) techniques [9], [16]. Some of the captivating applications to be offered
    by 6G are VR, AR, MR (Mixed Reality) and XR (Extended Reality) applications [17],
    M2M type subscription and applications [14], 3D holographic imaging and presence
    [18], [19], 5D communications (sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste) [18], VLC
    (Visible Light Communications) [20], smart clothing and wearables, fully autonomous
    (Level-5 [21]) and connected vehicles, and accurate indoor positioning [22]. In
    a nutshell, the envisioned motive of 6G networks revolves around the following:
    â¢ To offer a universal communication system integrating underwater, ground, air,
    and space networks. â¢ To effortlessly accommodate a proliferation of heterogeneous
    devices emerging from IoE. â¢ To proactively meet the futuristic traffic demands.
    â¢ To offer strict Quality-of-Service (QoS) for new heterogeneous traffic classes
    and services. â¢ To open a new landscape of business opportunities with strong
    consideration for network tenants and industry verticals. â¢ To pave the way for
    an unseen fleet of real-time and AI-powered applications. Table 2. Section-wise

    motivation Blockchain, one of the most popular types of distributed ledger technology,
    has been identified as a key enabler for mobile communication systems. Already
    its applicability in 5G networks has been a hot research topic in the recent past
    [23], [24]. Since the future generation of mobile networks, especially 6G, is
    going to be increasingly softwarized, decentralized, and open systems thus the
    underpinning of blockchain technology is believed to be indispensability for secure
    and complete automation. In particular, there are technical aspects (such as security,
    privacy, network service management, resource utilization, and spectrum management
    discussed in detail in Section 5) and applications of 6G (such as healthcare,
    energy Internet, UAVs, CAVs, and XR presented in depth in Section 6) that are
    expected to be enhanced with the use of blockchain technology . In this context,
    researchers have already started exploring the role of blockchain in 6G networks
    [25], [26], [27]. 1.2. Selection method The aim of this paper is to put the integration
    of blockchain technology for 6G under the magnifying glass to provide an in-depth
    understanding of a wide range of benefits that can be achieved with the use of
    blockchain technology in 6G era. In particular, the motivation is to answer set
    of research questions when leveraging blockchain technology in conjunction with
    smart contracts for 6G. Table 2 provides section-wise research questions and the
    search keywords that were used for the search process. Various databases such
    as IEEExplore, ACM, Scopus, and Web of Science have been used to gather all the
    papers that fall within the scope of the this survey. Although, references used
    for this survey paper were published between 2002 and 2022, however, majority
    of the references (more than 200 out of total 380 references) are from year 2020
    and 2021. This is evident since research community gained momentum towards 6G
    since 2018, and specially the work regarding use of blockchain in 6G has picked
    up since 2019. Thus, this paper provides in-depth survey of latest research work
    that have been performed considering blockchain and smart contracts for next generation
    mobile networks, i.e., 6G. Table 3 summarizes the relevant works concerning the
    use of blockchain for 6G networks. Table 3. Summary of surveys related to the
    use of blockchain in 6G ecosystem. Reference Key contributions Relevance to blockchain

    technology for the key 5G technologies (like MEC, CC, NFV, NS, and D2D communication),
    5G services (such as spectrum management, data sharing, resource management, infrastructure
    management, security, and privacy), and 5G applications (such as healthcare, smart
    cities, smart transportation, smart grid, and UAVs The primary focus of the paper
    is the integration of blockchain for 5G (technologies, services, and 5G IoT applications).
    Thus, no explicit focus on 6Gâs trends, requirements, technical aspects, and applications.
    Wang et al. [7] The survey primarily investigates security and privacy issues
    that are expected in 6G networks. In particular, the authors identify four key
    areas for 6G (real-time intelligent edge, distributed AI, intelligent radio, and
    3D intercoms), discuss six key technologies that can drive them, and finally reveals
    the potential security and privacy issues that arise with the use of these technologies.
    Briefly presents the use of blockchain (as one of the six identified technologies)
    in 6G and related security concerns. Nguyen et al. [28] The work presents a brief
    discussion on security and privacy issues in 6G, opportunities and challenges
    in terms of use of blockchain in 6G, and outlines potential solutions towards
    mitigation of the challenges. Briefly introduces the opportunities where blockchain
    can be used in 6G networks. Liu et al. [29] A comprehensive survey on joint use

    1.3. Paper contribution Given the fact that blockchain has been envisioned as
    one of the key enabling technologies for 6G mobile networks [15], [17], [33],
    it is imperative to study various opportunities and challenges foreseen with its
    usage. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no comprehensive
    survey that presents the broader and in-depth role of blockchain technology in
    6G. The current paper is the first attempt to exhaustively survey the cardinal
    role of blockchain technology in 6G networks considering both the technical aspects
    of 6G and the applications & use cases envisioned with the underpinning of 6G.
    The main contributions of this survey are as follow: â¢ To explore the driving
    trends, applications, requirements, and key enabling technologies for 6G ecosystem:
    The paper discusses the trends that are propelling the futuristic 6G applications
    as well as outlines the distinct requirements of 6G along with the key enabling
    technologies. Blockchain is one of the key enabling technologies. â¢ To provide
    an overview of blockchain and present a high-level view of its role towards 6G
    trends and applications: Given, the observed trends and the estimated requirements,
    a zoom-out view of what blockchain can offer for 6G is projected. This sets the
    floor to probe thoroughly the use of blockchain in 6G ecosystem. â¢ To investigate
    blockchain-enabled improvements for 6Gâs technical aspects: Next generation of
    mobile networks will demand significant enhancement of the existing technical
    aspects in the current generation as well as new technical building blocks. For
    every technical aspect considered, this paper, identifies the key challenges and
    investigates how blockchain can play an instrumental role in mitigating them.
    Furthermore, efforts have been made to fairly represent both the pros and cons
    of using blockchain for the considered technical aspects. â¢ To gauge the use of
    blockchain for the envisioned 6G use cases and applications: The paper probes
    the role that blockchain will play in realizing a fleet of innovative 6G use cases.
    In particular, the motive is to comprehensively survey how the research efforts
    in the realm of blockchain-enabled 6G use cases are (and will be) shaping up.
    â¢ To elaborate deployment challenges encountered with the use of blockchain for
    6G: Despite the promising role the blockchain can play for enabling various technical
    aspects and use cases of 6G, there exist deployment challenges. Use blockchain
    in 6G ecosystem on the one hand will bring numerous advantages, but on the other
    hand, will encounter integration challenges. Thus, the paper put the use of blockchain
    in 6G through the prism of challenges. Moreover, various possible solutions are
    also briefly discussed. â¢ To present the lessons learned and the future research
    directions: As essence of our survey, the paper presents a concise discussion
    on the lessons learned for various 6G technical aspects and use cases. Furthermore,
    based on the findings, the paper put forward interesting future research directions.

    highlighted in Section 7. Section 8 discusses the lessons learned and provides
    the landscape for future research directions. Finally, Section 9 concludes this
    paper. The overall outline of this survey paper is depicted in Fig. 1. 2. Background
    of 6G network 6G mobile networks are expected to be deployed within the next decade
    around the globe [12]. As experienced from previous mobile generations, a new
    mobile generation appears every ten years. Therefore, it is realistic to assume
    that 6G will emerge around 2030 [12], [35]. 6G is going to implement smart and
    intelligent mobile networks that can satisfy all the expectations not met with
    5G, as well as new requirements to be defined at a later stage. Download : Download

    path towards 6G networks [12], [15], [34]. 6G will play a vital role as the main
    communication infrastructure in 2030 and beyond. Therefore, the development of
    6G network will shape up by the future trends of the 2030âs world. As illustrated
    in Fig. 2, the future trends in the future world will define the new applications
    and services enabled by 6G network. To realize these new 6G applications and services,
    a new set of technologies will be integrated with mobile networks. Fig. 3 presents
    the high-level view of 6G architecture. Among other 6G technologies, the integration
    of AI, edge AI, and ML will play a vital role in 6G network [36], [37]. Download

    6G architecture [1], [12], [35], [38]. 2.1. 6G driving trends 6G will be the key
    communication infrastructure to satisfy the demands of future needs of hyper-connected
    societies in 2030 [12], [15], [34]. Thus, these future demands will drive the
    development and define the features of 6G networks. â¢ Expansion of IoT: It is
    expected that the number of IoT devices in the world will grow up to 24 billion
    by 2030. Moreover, the revenue related to IoT will hit the market capitalization
    of USD 1.5 trillion by 2030 [39]. â¢ Massive Availability of Small Data: Due to
    the anticipated popularity of 6G-based IoT devices and new 6G IoT services, 6G
    network will trend to generate an increasingly high volume of data. Most of such
    data will be small, dynamic, and heterogeneous in nature [35], [40]. â¢ Availability
    of Self-Sustained Networks: 6G mobile systems need to be energy self-sustainable,
    both at the infrastructure side and at the device side to provide uninterrupted
    connectivity in every corner of the world. The development of energy harvesting
    capabilities will extend the life-cycle of both network infrastructure devices
    and end devices such as IoE devices [11], [41]. â¢ Convergence of Communication,
    Sensing, Control, Localization, and Computing: Development of sensor technologies
    and direct integration of them with mobile network accompanied by low energy communication
    capabilities will lead to advanced 6G networks [35], [42]. Such a network will
    be able to provide sensing and localization services in addition to advanced communication
    and computing features [35], [42], [43]. â¢ Zero Energy IoT: Generally, IoT devices
    will consume significantly more energy for communication than sensing and processing
    [44]. The development of ultra-low-power communication mechanisms and efficient
    energy harvesting mechanisms will lead to self-energy sustainable or zero energy
    IoT devices [44]. â¢ More Bits, Spectrum, and Reliability: The advancement of wireless
    communication technologies including coding schemes and antenna technologies will
    allow the utilization of new spectrum as well as reliably send more information
    bits over existing wireless channels [12], [35]. â¢ Gadget-free Communication:
    The integration of an increasing number of smart and intelligent devices and digital
    interfaces in the environment will lead to a change from gadget-centric to user-centric
    or gadget-free communication model. With such a transition, the user will be able
    to communicate with the hyper-connected digital surroundings without any devises.
    The âomnipotentialâ environment is smart enough to provide the necessary information,
    and digital services according to the user requirements [45], [46], [47]. â¢ Increasing
    Elderly Population: Due to factors such as advanced healthcare facilities and
    the development of new medicines, the older population in the world is increasing
    rapidly. According to âAn Aging World: 2015â report, nearly 17 percent (1.6 billion)
    of the worldâs population will be aged 65 and over by 2050 [48]. â¢ Emergence of
    New Technologies: By 2030, the world will experience new technological advancements
    such as stand-alone cars, AI-powered automated devices, smart clothes, printed
    bodies in 3D, humanoid robots, new AR devices, quantum computing, and space travel
    [12], [35]. 6G will be the main underlying communication infrastructure to realize
    these technologies. 2.2. 6G applications A new set of 6G applications will appear
    due to above-mentioned 6G trends. Some of these important 6G applications are
    discussed below: â¢ UAV based Mobility: The popularity and progress of research
    and development (R&D) activities related UAV based services are improving around
    the globe. This will lead to use UAVs in new domains such as taxi services, logistics,
    passenger transport, and military operations [49], [50]. â¢ Holographic Telepresence:
    is another exciting 6G application. Using holographic telepresence, it is possible
    to real-time project distant objects including people as full-motion 3D images.
    Due to a high level of realism to the actual physical presence, holographic telepresence
    useful for applications such as, meeting, conferences and news broadcasting [51],
    [52]. â¢ Extended Reality (XR): 6G is believed to offer extended reality which
    can combine real and digital/virtual environments. XR terms expands over multiple
    technologies i.e., Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality
    (MR), and everything in between [53], [54]. â¢ Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV):
    With more than 40 companies active contribution for R&D activities in CAV domain,
    the future human society will soon experience the fully autonomous, highly reliable,
    and commercially viable autonomous vehicles [55]. â¢ Internet of Everything (IoE):
    Current IoT ecosystem will evolve further to the Internet of Everything (IoE)
    which interconnects not only things but also people, processes and data itself
    [56]. â¢ Smart Grid 2.0: Energy networks will evolve from Smart grid 1.0 which
    is about installing interconnected smart meters and getting them integrated, to
    Smart Grid 2.0 which will actually do more advanced things such as automated meter
    data analysis, dynamic pricing, prepayments, and intelligent line loss analysis.
    Smart Grid 2.0 offers the distribution grid management automation via a self-healing,
    digitally controlled energy network for reliable electric power delivery [57].
    â¢ Industry 5.0: 6G will provide a solid underpinning for next generation of industries,
    i.e., Industry 5.0. It enables co-working concept of people, intelligent robots
    and smart machines. In this manner, Industry 5.0 adds the personalized human touch
    to the automation and efficiency in Industrial Internet applications [58]. â¢ Hyper-intelligent
    IoT: is a next generation of IoT application which relies mainly on AI technologies.
    It will use AI algorithms to mainly optimize the complex IoT data processing task
    to control automated devices such as robots and UAVs. In this way, hyper-intelligent
    IoT can use to implement intelligent digital services [59]. â¢ Collaborative Robots:
    directly collaborate with people by work side-by-side with them. These collaborative
    robots can perform tedious, repetitive, and risky tasks which are difficult to
    do with humans. The use of co-robots can improve the health and safety of human
    workers and automate the production process [60]. â¢ Personalized Body Area Networks(PBANs):
    is a short-range network which basically deploy around or within the human. PBAN
    are important to implement integrated mobile health (mHealth) systems. These mHealth
    systems are used to perform health monitoring and personalized health management.
    mHealth systems deploys multiple sensors within the human body to collect health
    information. PBAN interconnects these sensors to enable dynamic exchange of the
    collected information [61]. â¢ Intelligent Healthcare: is the next generation of
    healthcare systems. Novel AI technologies will use in ehealth sector realize this
    new intelligent healthcare systems. New devices such as Intelligent Wearable Devices
    (IWD) and Intelligent Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) will use to implement
    Hospital-to-Home (H2H) services and hyper-connected smart hospitals [38], [62].
    2.3. 6G technical requirements/vision The technical capabilities of 6G networks
    have to improved to realize new 6G applications. Thus, technical requirement of
    6G networks should extend the capabilities of 5G networks. 6G networking requirements
    can be divided into different categories as follows: â¢ Further enhanced Mobile
    Broadband (FeMBB): The mobile broadband speed should exceed the limits of 5g network
    and offer the peak data rate at Terabits per second (Tbps) level. Moreover, the
    user-experienced data rate should also increase to Gigabits per second (Gbps)
    level [38]. â¢ Enhanced Ultra-Reliable, Low-Latency Communication (ERLLC/eURLLC):
    The E2E latency in 6G should be further reduced up to Î¼ s level to enable new
    high-end real-time 6G applications [15]. â¢ Ultra massive Machine Type Communication
    (umMTC): Connection density will further increase in 6G due to the popularity
    of IoT devices and the novel concept of IoE. These devices communicate with each
    other and offer automated services collaboratively [63], [64]. â¢ Extremely Low-Power
    Communications (ELPC): The network energy efficiency of 6G will be improved by
    10x than 5G and 100X than 4G. It will enable extremely low power communication
    channels for resource-constrained IoT devices [15], [65]. â¢ Long Distance High-Mobility
    Communications (LDHMC): With the support of fully integrated satellite technologies,
    6G will provide communication for extreme places such as space and the deep sea.
    Satellite communication is said to have potential to enable Internet of Remote
    Things (IoRTs) [66]. Moreover, AI-based automated mobility management systems
    and proactive migration systems will be able to support seamless mobility at speed
    beyond 1000 kmph [38]. â¢ High Spectrum Efficiency: The spectrum efficiency will
    be further improved in 6G up to five times as in 4G and nearly two times as in
    5G networks [15]. â¢ High Area Traffic Capacity: The exponential growth of IoT
    will demand the improvement of the area traffic capacity by 100 times than 5G
    networks. It will lead up to 1 Gbps traffic per square meter in 6G networks. In
    addition to the above network level requirements, 6G networks are expected to
    deliver high security, high privacy and high reliability to enable new 6G applications.

    6G enabling technologies Several technologies will play a crucial role in realizing
    novel 6G applications and satisfying the requirements of 6G networks. â¢ AI/ML:
    The concept of creating intelligent machines that can simulate human thinking
    and human behavior is called AI [67]. Machine learning allows machines to learn
    about a process or performing a task from analyzing only data without being programmed
    explicitly [68]. Thus, ML is considered a subset of AI. â¢ Edge AI: is focusing
    on running AI algorithms locally at the edge of the network with limited resources
    and very low E2E latency. Due to limitations in edge computers, these edge AI
    models/algorithms can be pre-trained in the cloud for optimized results and can
    then be moved to the edge [69]. â¢ Above 6 GHz Radio Frequency: With the greater
    use of small cells and emerging advances in communication technology, 6G will
    be able to support the use of higher frequencies in future use cases [70]. â¢ Blockchain/DLT:
    Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a decentralized, secure and immutable database
    that is managed by multiple users. It will play a vital role in enabling many
    6G services [32]. â¢ Swarm Networking: is the concept of managing a group of network
    elements or users as a part of a swarm. 6G will need to use swarm networking concepts
    to efficiently manage a swarm of edge devices, UAVs, or robots, due to the collaborative
    nature of these elements [71]. â¢ Zero touch network and Service Management (ZSM):
    is the concept of enabling full end-to-end automation of network and service management
    to deliver services in an agile, high speed, and scalable manner [72]. â¢ Smart
    Surfaces: In the near future, the novel smart surfaces will be inherently intelligent
    to offer services. They will evolve from the current form to integrate smart technology
    onto the surfaces of furniture, buildings, and vehicles. Thus, these smart surfaces
    will combine the materials science of smart materials with IoT and big data analysis
    to offer dynamic, reconfigurable, and digitally controllable surfaces [73]. â¢
    Quantum Communication: With the development of quantum computing research, 6G
    may utilize quantum information processing and quantum teleportation to enable
    quantum communication. One of the most interesting applications of quantum communication
    is the protection of information channels against eavesdropping using quantum
    cryptography [74]. 3. Overview of blockchain In recent years, the rise of DLT,
    in particular blockchain technology, has gained significant momentum and has been
    embraced by the industry and research communities. This section briefly covers
    the basic concepts, types of blockchain, smart contracts, and salient features
    of blockchain. 3.1. Blockchain - A type of DLT Blockchain is a type of distributed
    ledger which is maintained in a decentralized manner by the underlying P2P network
    of nodes. As the name implies, blockchain comprises of series of blocks of transactions
    that are logically chained or linked together to form a digital ledger. Transactions
    occurring in a given time frame are verified and then bundled together in a unit
    called as block. So, each block contains a finite set of transactions. All these
    blocks are logically linked together in the order of their creation using cryptographic
    hashes. This is to say that every block stores the hash value of the previous
    block in the âprevious block hashâ field. The first block, aka genesis block,
    does not have any previous block. Thus, the previous block hash field of the genesis
    block is set to all 0âs. The digital ledger holds all the past transactions in
    chronological order and is cryptographically sealed [75]. Further, this ledger
    is replicated at all the participating nodes in a P2P blockchain network. With
    time, the distributed ledger keeps growing because the write operations are performed
    in exclusively append mode [76]. From a technological viewpoint, blockchain is
    considered as one single technological innovation which is a unique, and powerful
    mix of underlying concepts, techniques and technologies [77]. For instance, blockchain
    uses cryptographic techniques like Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), hashing, digital
    signature, and Merkle tree. It also utilizes P2P technology for connecting nodes
    (aka miners) to establish a blockchain network. Furthermore, a consensus mechanism
    allows nodes in the blockchain network to be synchronized and to agree on the
    current state of the distributed ledger. Blockchain promises to solve the issues
    like exclusive peer-to-peer transactions without centralized third parties, fraudulent
    replication of digital asset/value or transaction (e.g., double spending), establishing
    trust with pseudonymity, transparent yet immutable record-keeping, provenance
    and auditable enabled distributed ledger, and digital signing and execution of
    legal agreements (between parties) in the form of softwarized contracts. The technology
    is also optionally driven by incentive mechanisms to attract more nodes to participate
    in the decentralized management of the digital ledger [78]. 3.2. Types of blockchain
    There exist different types of blockchain and many times the clear distinction
    between them is missing. Fig. 5 shows different types of blockchain and the classification
    is based on (i) who is allowed to read, write and commit transactions in blockchain
    (i.e., permission configuration) [77], and (ii) on what type of servers hosting
    is done [79]. The read permission allows a node to access and see all the past
    transactions, and the write permission enables nodes to create and broadcast a
    transaction to all the other nodes in the blockchain network. The commit permission
    empowers a node to update the distributed ledger [77]. Fundamentally, there are
    four different types of blockchain: (i) public, (ii) private, (iii) permissionless
    and (iv) permissioned blockchain. If a blockchain permits any node to acquire
    read permission by default, and public servers are used for its hosting then it
    is considered as public blockchain. On the contrary, if read permission is restricted
    and private hosting is used then such a blockchain is called as private blockchain.
    In other words, in public blockchain anyone can read whereas in private blockchain
    only the set of vetted nodes can read. Next, a blockchain is said to be permissionless,
    if all the nodes with read capability can also write and commit. However, in permissioned
    blockchain only the authorized subset of the participating nodes (who can read)
    are capable to write and commit. Based on these four basic types of blockchain,
    there are four combinations possible which are shown as the leaf nodes of the
    inverted tree structure in  Fig. 5. Public permissionless blockchain are the ones
    where anyone can join the blockchain network and perform read and write operations.
    Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of such blockchain. Public
    permissioned blockchain allows anyone to read but allows only the selected few
    nodes to write and commit. For instance, a supply chain ledger that can be read
    by customers but updated by only the authorized nodes under the control of company
    [79] or a blockchain-based voting system. Private permissionless blockchain is
    formed by only the set of restricted nodes which can perform read, write and commit
    operations. Such a type of blockchain is also called a consortium or federated
    blockchain. Finally, private permissioned blockchain enable all the nodes in the
    set of approved nodes to carry out read operation, however, the write and commit
    operations are exclusively performed by network operators (i.e., a subset of a
    set of approved nodes) [77]. Download : Download high-res image (415KB) Download

    contract Yet another important concept that has extended the capability of blockchain
    is smart contract. The idea of smart contract existed much before the birth of
    blockchain technology. It was first introduced by Szabo in 1994 [80]. It can be
    simply defined as a computer program that encodes all the terms and conditions
    of an agreement between participating entities and runs on top of blockchain [81].
    Any node in the blockchain network is capable of executing a smart contract either
    when it is called by initiating a transaction or when certain predefined conditions
    are met. Moreover, a smart contract can be established between untrusted and anonymous
    entities in the blockchain ecosystem without the need of a third party [82]. As
    and when the pre-defined encoded conditions are reached the corresponding smart
    contract gets self-executed thereby empowering automation. It is worth noting
    that once a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain, it cannot be stopped
    by any entity within the system or outside the system [81]. 3.4. Salient features
    of blockchain This section briefly discusses salient features of blockchain technology.
    They are as follows: â¢ Decentralization: Unlike, conventional centralized technologies,
    blockchain technology offers decentralized modus operandi. This implies there
    is no central authority that owns and controls a given system completely. Rather,
    the system is collectively operated by a dynamic set of nodes (or miners) such
    that any node can create new block comprising a set of transactions. Thus, blockchain
    decentralizes the decision-making and control of the entire system. â¢ Immutability:
    Once any transaction or data is stored on the blockchain in general, there is
    no way that it can be tampered with or altered. This is due to the distributed
    digital ledger, use of cryptographic techniques, and consensus-based update procedure.
    Thus, it is important to note that immutability also implies irrevocability and
    non-deletion of content from the blockchain infrastructure. â¢ Transparency with
    Pseudonymity: Transparency implies any node in the blockchain network has access
    to read any content present in the digital ledger. The level of transparency is
    highest for public permissionless blockchain and is minimum in private permissioned
    blockchain. Further, nodes in the P2P blockchain network can just see transactions
    happening between different digital addresses (account IDs), however, the information
    about which ID belongs to whom (i.e., an individual or an organization) is absent.
    Thus, blockchain allows transparency with pseudonymity. â¢ Fast Processing and
    Lower Cost: Conventional (logically centralized) systems involve multiple intermediaries
    and/or trusted third parties. For the overall processing of a transaction, each
    of these intermediaries performs its set of dedicated tasks which incur some processing
    delay. Moreover, each intermediary charges some processing fee for the tasks performed.
    All these intermediaries collectively increase the total delay and inflate the
    overall cost to process a transaction. Thanks to the decentralized and disintermediated
    blockchain-based system, users can perform transactions directly at peep level
    without involving third parties or intermediaries. Any one node or miner in blockchain-based
    system can process a new transaction and this update gets registered in the distributed
    ledger. This results in fast processing and a reduction in the overall cost per
    transaction as compared to conventional centralized system. For instance, processing
    of international banking transaction using Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial
    Telecommunication (SWIFT) involves many intermediary banks which may take days
    to complete and charge high transaction cost [83]. However, blockchain-based system
    can process transaction fast and at low cost [83], [84]. â¢ Consensus-based Decision
    Making: To add new content or to update the current blockchain, consensus needs
    to be established among the majority of the nodes in the blockchain network. Thus,
    blockchain dethrones the monopoly and embraces democracy in the system. The algorithm
    required to establish the overall agreement in blockchain infrastructure is called
    a consensus algorithm. A variety of consensus algorithms are available for example
    Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Practical Byzantine Faulty Tolerance
    (PBFT), Delegated Proof-of-State (DPoS), Proof-of-Burn (PoB), and Proof-of-Activity
    (PoA). Based on the suitability and a given use case, one must be used. â¢ Automation
    Driven by Smart Contracts: Smart contract enhances the capabilities of blockchain
    technology and have been found to be versatile. In particular, smart contract
    helps in exercising tight access control and automating blockchainized systems.
    At any point in time, when the predefined conditions embedded in a smart contract
    are met, the smart contract gets self-executed and performs the required tasks
    without any human interventions. This results in achieving automation among multiple
    untrusting stakeholders in a system. 4. Blockchain for 6G trends and requirements
    - A high-level view This section provides a high-level view of the use of blockchain
    for 6G trends and requirements which were discussed in Section 2. Download : Download

    of blockchain for 2030âs world 6G driving trends. Table 4. Role of blockchain
    for to achieve 6G requirements. Blockchain has significantly outgrown its inceptive
    use in cryptocurrencies like in Bitcoin. It is rapidly emerging as a promising
    technology in other sectors such as supply chain management, healthcare, smart
    manufacturing, education, and other businesses and trades [85], [86]. It holds
    immense potential to transform the way peer transactions, log management, record-keeping,
    decentralized negotiation, trade agreements, audits and compliance, dispute settlements,
    access management, and secure automation (via digital contracts), are carried
    out. Continuing the fundamental trend we have witnessed with 5G, it is evident
    that 6G is going to entail increasingly softwarized, virtualized, intelligent,
    and programmable systems [15], [33]. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note the
    following. On the one hand, concepts like softwarization, virtualization, and
    programmability of the next-generation mobile networks would lead to enormous
    advantages such as agile and open network management and orchestration (MANO),
    multi and micro services, on-demand creation of virtual networks, and multi-tenancy.
    On the other hand, these concepts tend to exacerbate the issues like security
    vulnerabilities, privacy leakage, unauthorized access to user data, dispute-prone
    soft spectrum sharing, fake or corrupted software network functions and control
    APIs, illegitimate resource utilization, and inability to provide differential
    security for differentiated services [87]. Blockchain is entrusted to play an
    alleviating and central role in providing a feasible solution to these issues.
    For instance, 6G networks may witness the availability of open-source software
    for implementing various network functions at core, transport or access levels
    [10]. In such an open environment, blockchain can ensure the correct functioning,
    versioning, integrity, and overall security and trust management for the software
    available to be deployed. In essence, blockchain can be leveraged to improve and
    support the technical aspects of 6G mobile networks as well as uplift the applications
    and use cases envisioned with the realization of 6G. 4.1. Blockchain for 6G trends
    The blockchain and smart contract will play a vital role in 6G trends as well.
    Here we discuss the impact and added benefit of blockchain on the 6G driving trends
    mentioned in Section 2.1. â¢ Massive Availability of Small Data: Blockchain can
    be used to eliminate the data silos and enable the trusted data sharing between
    unknown parties. Smart contracts can automate such transactions. â¢ Availability
    of Self-Sustained Networks: The automation and management via smart contracts
    can reduce the extra overhead on network management and orchestration. Especially,
    decentralized access control and authentication will be used to fully enable energy-efficient
    communications. â¢ Convergence of Communication, Sensing, Control, Localization,
    and Computing: The development of wireless technologies and semiconductor technologies
    will lead to more advanced devices with different capabilities. One device can
    support communication, sensing, control, localization, and computing. This will
    lead these devices to interact with multiple stakeholders simultaneously. For
    instance, sensing information can be shared with MNOs and spectrum regulatory
    bodies [88]. Due to the convergence, not only the collected raw data but also
    computed data models (e.g., in the Federated Leading (FL) use case [89]) can be
    shared with other stakeholders. In such cases, Blockchain can be used to establish
    distributed trust between different stakeholders, protect the integrity of shared
    data and automate the process via smart contacts which encourages the realization
    of convergence. â¢ Expansion of IoT/Zero Energy IoT: Blockchain and smart contracts
    can automate a variety of IoT-related tasks such as authentication, data management,
    payment handling, and agreement management to support scalability. Such automation
    will lead to a reduction in operational costs. In addition, extra blockchain-based
    security and privacy mechanisms can be deployed to protect the IoT ecosystem and
    its stakeholders. â¢ More Bits, Spectrum and Reliability: Blockchain with clearly-defined
    smart contracts can alleviate the spectrum shortcomings against extreme capacity/rates
    by sharing spectrum in a transparent, agile (paperless), and trustworthy manner.
    In other words, it can enable on-demand spectrum via secure and auditable transactions.
    â¢ Gadget-free Communication: Blockchain can play a vital role in ensuring the
    required level of security and privacy. Especially, blockchain-based services
    can be deployed for the establishment of ad-hoc communication with different stakeholders
    in gadget-free environments. Moreover, the trustworthy sharing of user data between
    different stakeholders can also be enabled via blockchains. â¢ Increasing Elderly
    Population: The increasing elderly population will raise different demands, such
    as high demand for health services, the need for more prolonged government services
    (i.e., welfare, pension), and user-friendly and affordable shopping options (e.g.,
    grocery delivery, food delivery). To tackle these requirements, several technological
    solutions are developed and also proposed. E.g., the use of e-health services
    will reduce the cost and stress on existing health services. E-government can
    offer faster and more scalable services than existing legacy government service
    models. UAVs can be used to deliver food and groceries. However, these new technological
    solutions will face deployment challenges such as trust establishment, automation
    support, need for privacy protection, lack of scalability, etc. To tackle these
    issues, blockchain with smart contracts can be used as a viable solution in many
    application domains including healthcare [90], e-governance [91], transport [92],
    and multimedia [93]. In such domains, blockchain and smart contracts can enable
    automation, reduce the cost of operation, support scalability, and provide extra
    security and privacy. â¢ Emergence of New Technologies: Blockchain can be used
    as supporting technology for most of the novel technologies such as AI, humanoid
    robots, new AR devices, and quantum computing. For instance, blockchain can be
    used to eliminate the data positioning attacks on AI systems. Fig. 6 presents
    in nutshell the importance of blockchain for 6G trends. Moreover, the impact of
    blockchain in 6G trends will be discussed in detail under 6G technologies (Section
    5) and 6G applications (Section 6). 4.2. Blockchain for 6G requirements Table
    4 delineates the role of blockchain to support 6G requirements. â¢ FeMBB: Decentrality,
    data sharing, and distributed computation features of blockchain along with smart
    contracts can prove to be instrumental to provide extremely high data rates. Moreover,
    service automation can be enabled with the use of blockchain as a secure and decentralized
    service platform. Nevertheless, the design of lightweight blockchain (in general
    DLT technology) is important because of the computationally intensive nature of
    blockchain. â¢ umMTC: Blockchain-based ultra massive sensing applications, fast
    data exchange without the need of central entities, and trust-building can well
    support the extreme massive connectivity requirement of 6G. However, the design
    of a low-latency blockchain can further enhance the applicability of blockchain.
    â¢ eURLLC: Park et al. [94] have proposed various solutions such as ML-based prediction,
    non-RF modality utilization, and co-design of communication and control for eURLLC.
    Blockchain can support these solutions. For instance, blockchain provides numerous
    benefits like data and model sharing, trusted decision making, and decentralized
    intelligence as presented by Liu et al. [29]. However, how to manage blockchains
    for different verticals and how to speed up the consensus finality need further
    attention. â¢ ELPC: Use of private permissioned blockchain [95] or consortium blockchain
    [96] turns out to be applicable for low-energy communications. Deploying blockchain
    nodes at the edge of the networks or even at gateways [97] can enable power-constrained
    IoE devices to securely store and process data. Nonetheless, it is essential to
    access the impact of energy consumption of blockchain in 6G networks. Furthermore,
    computationally inexpensive consensus mechanisms tailored for ELPC are to be designed.
    â¢ LDHMC: 6G networks will offer seamless connectivity independent of 3D location,
    time, and mobility. Blockchain can provide secure and trusted connectivity monitoring
    and clearing among different network service providers, especially for roaming
    cases. Nevertheless, the overall latency and distributed storage of data from
    the subscribers of heterogeneous networks need innovative solutions. In addition,
    privacy must be guaranteed for dispute-free coexistence. â¢ High Spectrum Efficiency:
    Blockchain-enabled trustless and decentralized spectrum management can pave the
    way for highly spectrum efficient 6G networks. Xu et al. [25] proposed a basic
    blockchain-enabled framework for decentralized resource management. For harnessing
    the full potential, lightweight blockchain is required for small cells and its
    integration for RAN management is to be considered. 5. Blockchain for 6G technical
    aspects This section extensively discusses the use of blockchain to support and
    improve various technical aspects of 6G. The figure Fig. 7 is a panoramic view
    of the various benefits blockchain can bring to the technical aspects of 6G. Download

    of blockchain for improving technical aspects of universal communication system
    envisioned with 6G. 5.1. 3D networking 6G is destined to break the conventional
    two-dimensional (2D) nature of mobile communication systems and emerge as three-dimensional
    (3D) mobile networks to provide truly global coverage [11]. The aim is to extend
    the presence of mobile networks in air, space, underground, and sea. Thus, altitude
    is considered as the third dimension. Since the antennas installed at terrestrial
    base stations are optimized for ground users and cannot support high-elevation
    angles [98], flying technologies, such as UAVs, tethered balloons, and Low Earth
    Orbit (LEO) satellites have been proposed to contribute towards the extension
    of the mobile network ecosystem. In particular, UAV as Aerial Base Stations (ABSs)
    is characterized by flexible mobility, ease of maneuvering, varying capability,
    and Line-of-Sight (LoS) communications [98]. UAVs can provide coverage extension
    using UAV-to-user, UAV-to-UAV, UAV-to-base station, and UAV-to-satellite communication
    in future communication networks [99]. Thus, UAV ABSs can provide wide coverage,
    broadband and reliable wireless connectivity, cost-effective and flexible deployment,
    and pandemic and disaster management. In contract to 5G, satellite communications
    are envisioned as a key component for 6G systems to provide global coverage and
    services including multimedia [1], [100] 5.1.1. Key challenges Some of the impediments
    that exist in establishing a 3D networking paradigm are as follows: â¢ Interoperability
    and data management for heterogeneous networks in a seamless, trustless, and automated
    fashion, turns out to be an important challenge. One way to overcome this issue
    would be to use a network of hierarchical trusted entities. However, such a solution
    is prone to all the issues related to a (logically) centralized system. â¢ Adding
    altitude as a new dimension will open a new attack surface since the ABSs are
    not within the premises of their operators. Moreover, since attackers can easily
    get control of ABSs [101], secure key distribution and revocation are essential.
    â¢ Another challenge is ensuring secure seamless movement of increasing number
    of flying connected devices within different heterogeneous networks. â¢ In addition,
    3D localization, network planning, cell association, and spectrum sharing are
    yet another set of challenges that arise with the use of UAV ABS [98], [102].
    Table 5. Blockchain for 3D networking. Reference Key contribution Blockchain platform
    and consensus algorithm Remarks Sun et al. [103] Highlights the importance of
    using blockchain for SAGIN in terms of decentralized control, privacy, data auditing,
    registration and authentication. However, to overcome the high latency and large
    storage space issues associated with blockchains, authors proposed an architecture
    with multiple blockchains; space chain, air chain, and ground chain. Blockchain
    simulator (Go language), BFT consensus for space and air chains, and DPoS or BFT
    for ground chain. Dedicated efforts are required to ensure security of cross chain
    technology. Moreover, dynamic sharding or DAG to increase throughput and use of
    technique such as zk-SNARK to improve privacy are proposed. Tan et al. [104] To
    remove the dependency on any central authority such as base station, authors proposed
    lightweight blockchain-enabled distributed key management for heterogeneous FANETs.
    Rationale is to include cluster heads which are resourceful UAVs in addition to
    regular UAVs and modify the structure of block and transaction. Miner election
    scheme using distributed random generation (DRG) protocol. The major limitation
    is that cluster heads are assumed to be honest. A rouge cluster head can send
    fake transactions and may revoke benign UAVs from the system. Shi et al. [105]
    To overcome the issues with the centralized (AAA) management of LS-HetNet, authors
    proposed using of blockchain-enabled decentralized AAA scheme. The approach does
    not required use of ACL for exercising access control. Ethereum private blockchain
    Challenges that still need to be addressed are enabling secure routing within
    blockchain and make blockchain lightweight and secure at the same time. Dai et
    al. [106] Highlights the challenges being faced by the emerging Space-Air-Ground-Sea
    Integrated Network (SAGSIN) such as security and privacy issues as well as difficulty
    in resource sharing among heterogeneous networks. By integrating blockchain, network
    slicing and network softwarization, authors proposed frameworks for network management
    and brokerage services for SAGSIN. NA Optimization of large-scale cross-domain
    blockchain-based system is an open challenge to be addressed for maximum benefits.
    Approaches that can be used for cross-domain collaboration are game-theory and
    machine learning based. 5.1.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain has the required
    potential to offer secure and decentralized management of integrated heterogeneous
    mobile networks covering space, air, and ground [103]. In particular, blockchain
    and well-defined smart contracts can facilitate a decentralized solution for distributed
    key management, authentication, authorization, auditability. and trustless interoperability
    among heterogeneous networks (and even among various components of one network).
    Alladi et al. [107] reviewed the role of blockchain for UAVs and highlighted a
    wide range of benefits that can be achieved. Some of them are automated decision
    making, implementation of new business models, load balancing, detection of hijacks
    and data poisoning attacks, and avoidance of mid-air collisions [107]. To overcome
    the high latency and storage-intensive nature of blockchain for Space-Air-Ground
    Integrated Networks (SAGIN), Sun et al. [103] proposed the use of multiple blockchains,
    namely, space chain, air chain, and ground chain. Space chain is maintained by
    satellite network and to make this blockchain lightweight, Byzantine Fault Tolerance
    (BFT) consensus is used. The Air chain is maintained by air network (mostly UAV
    ABSs) and also by some trusted ground stations. Since ABSs are resource-constrained,
    authors used ground stations to perform computational tasks and ABSs simply acts
    like a mobile relay to flying users. Ground chain is maintained by mobile networks,
    ad-hoc networks and WiMAX. Additionally, for interoperability among three chains,
    the authors proposed the use of collaborative blockchain using side chain/relay
    technology. The authors carried out implementation using Ethereum. Their results
    show gains in terms of reduction in storage requirement, high average utilization,
    and reduced failure probability. Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) are considered
    important to realize 3D networking in 6G era by acting as airborne relays and
    providing on-demand extension of radio connectivity [108]. For distributed key
    management in the context of FANETs, blockchain is a promising technology, nevertheless,
    it incurs computational and storage overheads. Thus, to overcome the storage and
    computation issues associated with the use of blockchain for resource-constrained
    drones, Tan et al. [104] used heterogeneous FANETs containing resourceful drones
    (as cluster heads) in addition to usual drones. Moreover, to make use of blockchain
    lightweight for UAVs, authors modified the structure of a block as well as a transaction.
    In particular, the nonce and target difficulty fields were removed. Consequently,
    PoW consensus algorithm is not used. In fact, a miner election scheme is used
    which decides a miner who is given chance to generate the next block. The limitations
    of the proposed work are that the cluster heads are assumed to be honest and deployment
    of resourceful UAVs as cluster heads might be costly and at times not feasible
    for the state-of-art industrial UAVs. Shi et al. [105] deals with the issue of
    centralized management of data generated in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Networks
    (LS-HetNet). The authors put forward blockchain-based decentralized Authentication,
    Authorization, and Auditing (AAA) scheme for providing data access in LS-HetNet
    such that maintenance of Access Control List (ACL) is not required. Different
    phases are used for registration, access provisioning, and revocation of rights
    previously granted to the data consumers. To implement the proposed scheme authors
    used Ethereum private blockchain and evaluated throughput, storage overhead, and
    computation overhead. The results presented show the feasibility of the proposed
    scheme, nevertheless, rigorous testing on real-life testbeds is required to ensure
    efficacy. In [109], authors put forward a framework that comprises mobile mining
    nodes and communicating nodes. The latter types of nodes are connected via a high-bandwidth
    backhaul network and help former types of nodes to communicate mining results.
    Following this approach, authors in [26] integrated blockchain with federated
    learning for 6G edge to deal with disaster management. To ensure security, privacy
    and efficient resource sharing for Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Network (SAGSIN)
    in 6G era, authors in [106] proposed close integration of blockchain, network
    slicing and network softwarization. In particular, blockchain-based network management
    and blockchain-enabled brokerage services are presented for SAGSIN. Some of the
    important functionalities offered by decentralized blockchain-based network management
    of SAGSIN are ID management, authentication, authorization and firmware update
    management. Whereas blockchain-enabled brokerage service for cross-domain environment
    offers secure SLA, peer-to-peer payment settlement, and smart contract based tight
    access control. 5.1.3. Summary The use of blockchain for 3D networking can provide
    decentralized and secure solutions for data accessing, offloading, and interoperability.
    Moreover, the idea of using multiple blockchains along with hierarchical structure
    is highly appealing for 3D networks. Table 5 provides the summary of important
    related works using blockchain for 3D networks. Nevertheless, efforts are required
    to design lightweight encryption mechanisms and consensus algorithms to run blockchain-based
    solutions on UAVs. In the case of the use of multiple parallel blockchains, cross-chain
    security and isolation among blockchains need to be ensured [103]. Furthermore,
    efficient ways are needed to perform transaction prioritization in blockchain,
    and to handle interoperability when different networks have their decentralized
    platforms. 5.2. Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) Radio spectrum is a scarce and
    indispensable resource for mobile communication; thus, its overall management
    (allocation, sensing, and sharing) must be carried out efficiently in 6G networks.
    The traditional way of static spectrum allocation using Fixed Spectrum Access
    (FSA) policy by telecommunication regulatory bodies though ensures legitimate
    use of the spectrum but results in under-utilization of the allocated spectrum
    [110]. In recent years, various Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) mechanisms have
    emerged, such as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), Licensed Shared Spectrum (LSA),
    and Spectrum Access System (SAS) [111]. In general, the DSM system comprises two
    types of users: primary user and secondary user. The primary user (aka incumbent
    user) is an authorized entity with the exclusive right over the allocated spectrum;
    however, it might not be able to utilize the spectrum completely all the time.
    The secondary user is the one who gets access to the unused spectrum shared by
    the primary user. DSA allows the secondary user devices to assess the radio spectrum
    environment continually and automatically adjust operating frequencies to accommodate
    changing capacity/interference conditions [112]. However, the interference-free
    access and QoS is not ensured in DSA [113]. In LSA, the telecom regulatory body
    oversees the sharing agreement to overcome this issue  [114]. In other words,
    a secondary user must get an LSA license from the regulatory body to access the
    spectrum primary user (or the incumbent) is ready to share. MNOs or MVNOs are
    usually the secondary users. The requirement for DSM becomes even more critical
    in 6G era since the number of private networks or local operators are expected
    to increase and coexist with public networks [115]. The successful emergence of
    local (micro) operators calls for dynamic spectrum sharing between MNOs (or other
    incumbent users). 5.2.1. Key challenges â¢ The traditional (centralized) way of
    spectrum allocation and management has numerous challenges. These are high administrative
    cost, security vulnerabilities, privacy leakage, unoptimized spectrum allocation,
    existence of intermediaries to purchase spectrum, slow process of establishing
    spectrum sharing agreement, and difficulty to ensure compliance to SLA transparently.
    â¢ Although cognitive radio provides users the ability to exploit the unused spectrum,
    however, malicious unlicensed Secondary Users (SUs), using the spectrum-sensing
    mechanism, can randomly access the unused spectrum or channels by the licensed-Primary
    Users (PUs). Subsequently, they can launch attacks, such as primary user emulation
    or Denial of Service (DoS), affecting the cognitive radio networkâs performance
    and security [116]. â¢ In the case of shared spectrum, the primary issue with the
    private networks is the coexistence, i.e., managing Priority Access License (PAL)
    users and General Authorized Access (GAA) users to ensure how they can coexist
    by sharing the spectrum relatively [117]. Since private networks will continue
    to exist in 6G, designing a dedicated Spectrum Access System (SAS) will be crucial
    and challenging at the same time. 5.2.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain turns out
    to be a highly promising technology for dynamic spectrum allocation, sharing,
    accessing, and overall management, including auctioning and payment settlement.
    In particular, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has already identified
    the potential of blockchain for efficient management of spectrum [120]. Specifically,
    blockchain has immense potential to improve the localized visibility in spectrum
    usage and ease of auditability of overall activities for effective implementation
    of spectrum sharing rules [137]. Table 6. Blockchain for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing
    (DSM). Reference Key contribution Experimental setup Parameters evaluated Remarks
    [118] Considering the centralized dynamic spectrum sharing attack prone and non-transparent,
    authors proposed blockchain-enabled privacy-protected double auction mechanism
    for decentralized and auditable dynamic spectrum sharing. Truffle framework along
    with IPFS were used to develop a DApp Spectrum providerâs revenue and social welfare
    (difference of spectrum demandersâ utility and providersâ utility) The task of
    determining the winner of double auction mechanism is formulated as integer linear
    programming and solved using Hungarian algorithm. [119] To overcome the high administration
    cost and the privacy issues faced by the traditional CBRS, authors leveraged blockchain
    to propose distributed CBRS. Furthermore, ring signature is used to ensure usersâ
    privacy, and proof-of-strategy is proposed as a new lightweight consensus algorithm.
    Simulations using MATLAB platform Failure rate of system, recognition rate (of
    both authentic users and malicious users), and system utility were evaluated Genetic
    algorithm is used to solve the consensus puzzle which is a class of binary integer
    programming. [120] To improve the resource utilization in 6G networks, authors
    presented collaborative blockchain and AI for dynamic resource sharing. In particular,
    blockchain is used for achieving security, automation, regulation, and payment
    settlement, whereas, AI is used to attain improved pattern recognition and intelligent
    decision making. Simulation based setup is used and traffic is modeled using Poisson
    process Profit ratio and throughput per licensed time slot are evaluated Two-tier
    blockchain structure is used â local blockchain per area (comprises of mobile
    devices and base station of that area) and global blockchain (comprises of all
    the base stations). [121] To address the issue of low utilization efficiency of
    radio spectrum, authors proposed blockchain-based automated pricing model for
    secondary spectrum market trades among Primary Licensed Operators (PLOs). Simulation
    based experimental setup is used Total revenue of PLOs, floor values and sensitivity
    analysis are performed A new blockchain token named as spectrum dollar is used
    as incentive for spectrum trades in secondary markets. [122] To enable secure,
    privacy protected, and incentivized sharing of underutilized spectrum by H2H users
    for M2M communications, authors proposed blockchain based two-stage framework.
    In the first stage, H2H enters into contract with base station to share spectrum,
    and in second stage this shared spectrum is shared with M2M devices. Simulations
    based experiments are performed Amount of shared spectrum resources and utility
    of primary and secondary users are evaluated Contract theory is utilized to resolve
    the incentive optimization problem under information asymmetry. [123] To meet
    various challenges & functionalities required by increasing private local operators,
    authors put forward Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform. In particular, various
    functionalities such as subscription management for service registration, reputation
    management for service quality, fraud prevention for roaming instances, and data
    management are enabled in a decentralized and secure manner. Simulation based
    experiments using MATLAB and implementation using Ethereum test network Rinkeby
    are done Roaming cost, service charge, error rate, execution and transaction costs,
    and latency are evaluated. The structures used for various smart contracts used
    for DApp are given in the paper. [124] To effectively realize micro-operator based
    small cell deployments, authors presented blockchain and SDN integrated architecture
    where the complex service level agreements (SLAs) are coded as smart contracts.
    These smart contracts run on blockchain layer which logically sits on top of SDN
    layer. Ethereum private blockchain with PoW consensus algorithm and simulation
    module. Received signal strength, network throughput and transaction scalability
    are evaluated. Cost savings, and increase in network coverage with guarantee QoS
    are the main advantages of deploying micro-operator based small cell. Table 7.
    Summary of security attacks and tentative mitigation techniques with blockchain.
    Attack Description Blockchain based solution DDoS Attacks An attacker targets
    the resource consumption or protocol vulnerability of a single victim node by
    using malicious codes installed on several computers. Authors in [125] proposes
    a blockchain-based approach for intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS mitigation.
    They use smart contracts to facilitate collaboration among SDN-based networking
    domains. The work [126] use smart contracts for AI-based DDoS detection and mitigation.
    Eavesdropping An illegal action of a third party to secretly capture data being
    exchanged between both sides of communication. [127] adopts the blockchain platform
    (Ethereum) to decentralize a dynamic distributed honeypot system and store the
    port access data by delivering a private chain. Scanning attacks Send requests
    to all ports of a target host, aiming at exploring the opened ports and further
    exploiting associated bug to launch attacks. In [127], a private blockchain is
    used for encrypted communication and services transformation. It mitigates spoofing
    attacks with changing service IP addresses due to transformation property. Spoofing
    attacks This attack occurs when fake entities can trick users into sharing information
    for malicious activities. Use multi-layered blockchain framework for smart mobility
    data-market to enforce fair trade with smart contracts. The identity keys will
    reduce the number of fake users and node spoofing attack [128], [129]. Man-in-the-Middle
    This happens during data transmission where an adversary eavesdrops, intercepts
    and manipulates the information. The work [130] uses an ultra-lightweight RFID
    protocol targeted for integration in a supply chain management system that utilizes
    permissioned blockchain network. Sybil attack Adversaries create numerous fake
    identities to gain a disproportionately large influence. Trusted transaction mechanism
    is developed with permissionless tamper-proof blockchain-based data structure
    for storing transaction records of agents without central control [131]. Selfish
    mining attack When the selfish miners attempt to increase their rewards by deliberately
    keeping their blocks private Introduce a life-time or an expiry time for the blocks
    to prevent block withholding by selfish miners. Author in [132] formulate a set
    of Markov chains to capture the state transitions of private and public chains.
    Hijacking A network security attack divert traffic of legitimate users and network
    towards hijacked addresses. In [133], a blockchain based distributed prefix authentication
    protocol is used in ICN for authenticating mobile users. Each router in the network
    authenticates the prefix to verify the ownership before updating and forwarding
    the state of the network. Poisoning attack Attackers intentionally inject false
    data into the training pool of ML model. Replace the central authority by a blockchain
    system integrated with federated learning from the aspect of fog servers [134].
    The work [135] employs a private blockchain to deliver a collaborative deep learning
    task in IoT. Privacy attack Attackers intentionally capture personal data of the
    users and to impose attacks. Using digital signatures generated for a group of
    blockchain participants where group members remain anonymous [28]. Zero-knowledge
    arguments and proofs methods [28] and Coin mixers [136] are some other techniques
    to protect privacy. In contrast with the traditional exclusive frequency allocations,
    spectrum sharing by definition involves multiple entities with shared access rights
    to use the spectrum. Here, the users exchange spectrum usage rights to fulfill
    their needs [138]. In this regard, blockchain can be used to set-up a trustless,
    decentralized and open spectrum trading platforms. Nevertheless, blockchain-empowered
    open trading of spectrum resources may lead to privacy issues like revealing trading
    patterns or leakage of bids made in auction-based spectrum sharing. Various privacy-protection
    mechanisms based on blockchain and smart contracts can be used to protect the
    trading entities from such privacy threats. In this line of approach, Tu et al.
    [118] presented a double-auction scheme, which is deployed as a smart contract
    in a blockchain platform. To preserve the privacy of users, differential privacy,
    in addition to asymmetric encryption, is used during the bidding process. Furthermore,
    the problem of determining a winner in the double auction scheme, is formulated
    as Integer Linear Programming (ILP). With a similar aim to overcome the privacy
    risks plus the issues like administrative overheads and single-point-of-failure
    associated with traditional Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), Zhang et
    al. [119] proposed a distributed CBRS model using blockchain. CBRS, originally
    proposed by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is regarded as a potential
    candidate to meet the high spectral efficiency requirement for 6G. Authors, in
    particular, put forward Proof-of-Strategy (PoS) as a new consensus algorithm that
    is not only lightweight but also integrates with the spectrum allocation process,
    i.e., the system reaches the consensus by evaluating the spectrum allocation strategy.
    Moreover, the use of ring signature technique protects privacy by ensuring unlinkability
    between usersâ real-world identities and their pseudonyms. Similarly, Hu et al.
    [120] posited two-level hierarchical blockchain architecture powered by AI to
    manage spectrum resources effectively. In particular, authors manifest the use
    of blockchain to offer improved functionalities such as resource advertisement,
    spectrum regulation, a record of spectrum usage, and financial settlement. AI
    is suggested to provide usage pattern recognition using deep learning and intelligent
    decision-making using deep reinforcement learning. Moreover, the use of hierarchical
    blockchain reduces administrative costs, decreases computational and storage overheads,
    and minimizes the complexity of consensus algorithms. Nonetheless, blockchain
    overheads and techniques to acquire the training data for AI models with complete
    privacy compliance are still challenging. Furthermore, blockchain can enable guarantee
    SLA and dispute-free fast financial agreements for quasi-real time spectrum sharing
    (i) between different MNOs, and (ii) between MNOs and micro/local operators [139].
    For instance, Khan et al. [121] leveraged blockchain to carry out fair trading
    of spectrum in the future Secondary Spectrum Market (SSM) by eliminating the possible
    economic malpractices. In particular, the authors proposed tokenization of spectrum
    in form of a new virtual coin named âSpectrum dollarâ. Thus, their proposition
    allows disintermediation of financial (central) exchanges and faster financial
    settlement. Moreover, the authors used the floor-and-trade rule to tune the price
    of a spectrum dollar to maximize the profit, minimize the loss, and ensure loss-free
    trading. Nevertheless, building confidence and onboarding MNOs and local operators
    to such decentralized solutions with spectrum tokenization will be challenging.
    Blockchain has been shown to assist the sharing of spectrum by Human-to-Human
    (H2H) users with mobile networks to cater to the massive connectivity needs for
    M2M communications. Zhou et al. [122] proposed a blockchain-enabled framework
    that (i) preserves privacy in terms of spectrum sharing cost announced by H2H
    users, which acts like primary users and share their spectrum, (ii) facilitates
    optimized incentives to H2H users by employing contract-theory, and (iii) optimizes
    the allocation of the shared spectrum (by H2H users) to M2M devices by developing
    a matching solution. In general, such a technique can be helpful in dynamic spectrum
    management in future convergence of heterogeneous networks towards 3D networks.
    Nevertheless, the scenario involving multiple services and multiple base stations
    still needs to be studied, as stated in their work. In context of MNOs augmented
    with micro/local operators, blockchain as a service has been proposed to automate
    the secure management of spectrum between MNOs and local operators. Such a service
    can provide: (i) selection of spectrum owners (i.e. MNOs acting as primary user),
    (ii) open auction in secondary spectrum market, (iii) direct P2P payment for spectrum
    sharing, and dynamic creation of agreement using smart contracts [123]. With similar
    intent, Okon et al. [124] implemented a blockchain-based mechanism for spectrum
    sharing and SLA compliance in a multi-operator scenario characterized by small
    cell deployment by micro-operator. The authors implemented blockchain network
    as an overlay on SDN infrastructure. 5.2.3. Summary In nutshell, the broad roles
    of blockchain for 6G spectrum management are (i) decentralized, open and privacy-protected
    platform for intelligent spectrum trading, (ii) dispute-free and fast setting-up
    of agreements, (iii) tokenization of spectrum and P2P fast payments, and (iv)
    ease of monitoring and auditing to ensure SLA compliance while sharing spectrum.
    In particular, blockchain can be used as a secure and decentralized database for
    spectrum management that can record all the activities related to spectrum management.
    Table 6 provides the summary of related works that focus on using blockchain for
    spectrum management. Though there are significant advantages in using blockchain
    for dynamic spectrum management, however, deployment of blockchain network within
    the premises of cognitive radio network is challenging keeping in mind the resource-constrained
    mobile users [110]. Other practical challenging task will be the onboarding MNOs
    and local operators to a blockchain-based open platform which has no central authority.
    5.3. Security Security is an all-time important property in telecommunication
    and networking. Starting from no security mechanism and hard handovers in 1G,
    authentication, anonymity, and encryption-based security were introduced in 2G
    [5]. In 3G, security features of 2G were enhanced by introducing Authentication
    and Key Agreement (AKA), two-way authentication, and 3GPPâs air-interface security
    and network authentication by users [7]. With 4G Enhanced Packet System-AKA (EPS-AKA),
    mutual authentication, trust mechanism, and handover key management were introduced.
    5G incorporated many advanced security features like better mutual authentication
    capabilities, Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI), Extensible Authentication
    Protocol-AKA (EAP-AKA) [140], and 5G-AKA, Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption
    Scheme (ECIES) based identification mechanism [141], [142]. In future 6G networks,
    many security challenges may encounter due to extremely large network of heterogeneous
    networks, and the expected extremely higher reliability requirements. In order
    to thwart more sophisticated adversaries, advanced and intelligent security mechanisms
    will be needed [31], [143], [144]. 5.3.1. Key challenges Following are few security
    challenges identified in the envisioned 6G networks. â¢ Confidentiality and integrity
    will be challenging since the future 6G infrastructure may portray enormous threat
    surfaces with wireless connectivity and the massive data volume generated in the
    network. â¢ Uninterrupted service accessibility will be another challenge because
    the broader threat surface and massive connectivity will enhance the risk of Distributed
    Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks [5], [145]. â¢ The authentication and access control
    mechanisms need to be scaled-up to meet the diversification of 6G tenants, which
    are resource-intensive and may create bottlenecks in associated services. In particular,
    the centralized way of access control poses significant challenges in the design
    of future networks [7]. â¢ Auditing will be another challenging security perspective
    due to the assessment requirements of a huge number of tenants (e.g., managing
    network slices among multiple tenants.). â¢ With the emergence of ubiquitous intelligence
    in 6G, AI/ML based security attacks may also incur in 6G networks. In contrast,
    AI can be used as a tool for detecting, predicting, and mitigating security attacks.
    Therefore, the deployment of proactive security mechanisms and detection of zero
    day attacks will be vital security challenges in 6G [146], [147]. Download : Download

    attacks and challenges in 6G networks along with the security features which may
    accompany with blockchain. 5.3.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain is emerging as
    an intriguing solution to implement security, accountability, surveillance and
    governance of mobile networks. Table 7 summarizes the possible security attacks
    that can occur in the next generation of mobile networks and their possible mitigation
    using blockchain. Blockchain-based 6G networks may resist the eavesdropping and
    hijacking threats using the blockchain properties such as immutability, transparency,
    non-repudiation, and provenance. Blockchain provides decentralized means of trust
    among untrusted users because it can withstand Sybil attacks [148], [149], [150].
    Notably, in a Sybil attack, an attacker creates a large number of fake identities
    in a peer-to-peer network-based system and gains higher influence because of the
    sheer size of fake identities. By using efficient consensus protocols, such as
    PoW, blockchain ensures only genuine users control the system [151], [152]. Also,
    as only the participating nodes can view or add new transactions, such a combination
    will mitigate the chance of data modification and man-in-the-middle attacks. In
    addition, authentication, access control and accountability are key security aspects
    that can be addressed by deploying well-designed smart contracts on top of the
    blockchain. Furthermore, as stated in [29], the use of blockchain allows (i) secure
    training of AI/ML models based on the immutable data stored on blockchain typically
    in heterogeneous network scenario, (ii) trust-building by transparently storing
    data related to the decision-making process in AI/ML based systems, and (iii)
    trustless collaborative optimization of ML models by secure exchange of model
    parameters. For AI/ML functions, it is vital to have trusted execution for security.
    Smart contracts provide a distributed mechanism for that purpose. For instance,
    the developed smart contract in [153] is used to detect network anomalies and
    malicious traffic, thus providing an analysis of network traffic between industrial
    IoT with a trained deep learning model in a secure distributed environment. El
    Azzaoui [154] proposed a framework âBlock5GIntellâ where the support that blockchain
    can provide to AI for building secure 5G networks is discussed. Since will have
    AI at its core, blockchain has a significant role to play for 6G networks. From
    a different perceptive, 6G business ecosystem will be comprised of numerous stakeholders
    and business players, all working together to achieve common goals. Security will
    be of paramount importance to build trust among these players. In summary, Fig.
    8 provides an illustration of possible security attacks and challenges in 6G networks
    along with the security features which are offered by blockchain. The circles
    indicate two key components of a 6G network, namely distributed AI and intelligent
    radio, which have the closest relationship with the applicability of blockchain
    for the security landscape. The possible types of attacks for which blockchain
    based solutions can be adopted in the envisioned 6G networks are listed on the
    left side rectangle in the figure. The attacks may occur at different levels such
    as edge level, application level, device level, wireless air interfaces, external
    network, or different 6G verticals. Moreover, the security threats may be exacerbated
    with network softwarization and the use of AI/ML techniques. Among these categories,
    the specific attacks that can be mitigated using blockchain are discussed in Table
    7. Also, blockchain can be used for authentication, authorization and key management
    purposes in the communication networks [155], [156], [157]. Having a common communication
    channel in the form of blockchain will introduce trust among multiple stakeholders
    in 6G network to cooperate on a common platform even at unexpected failures of
    the networks [158]. 5.3.3. Summary Based on the above-related works, blockchain
    can be used as a security enabling technology in 6G networks to address the security
    features such as authentication, access control, communication integrity, availability,
    and accountability. Moreover, blockchain-based solutions can be formed to protect
    6G networks from several attacks as presented in Table 7 and Fig. 8. However,
    incorporating such blockchain based security solutions will still be challenging
    in the 6G networks due to increase in device heterogeneity, the convergence of
    heterogeneous networks towards 3D networking, growth in big-data, and additional
    computational resources required for blockchain. Moreover, the security issues
    of blockchain itself need to be addressed from the perspective of 6G. 5.4. Privacy
    Given that a significantly higher level of heterogeneity will characterize the
    6G ecosystem (in terms of users, devices, applications, services and stakeholders),
    privacy for such a complex ecosystem will be equally important, if not more, than
    security [159]. Preserving privacy while collecting, aggregating, and processing
    data in many application domains of 6G, such as healthcare, environmental protection,
    smart city, and social survey, will be essential [160]. Moreover, with every aspect
    of human lives getting connected and using of AI-enabled applications, both data
    privacy and user privacy must be protected. In addition, the novel 3D networking
    paradigm will allow the proliferation of flying connected devices. Despite the
    myriad of practical applications of UAVs, there are privacy concerns such as identity,
    trajectory (location), and mission privacy [161]. Thus, privacy will be an essential
    requirement for 6G networks, and compliance to privacy laws like GDPR [162] need
    to be ensured. 5.4.1. Key challenges Privacy preservation will be a significant
    consideration in the complex 6G network ecosystem. â¢ The unauthorized access to
    virtualized networking resources can impose a high risk of connected usersâ privacy
    [159]. Therefore, secure access control is one key challenge that arises for privacy
    preservation in vast data sets in 6G networks [107]. â¢ With the emergence of massive-scale
    sensing systems (e.g., using UAVs) with cameras and sensors continuously collect
    data from surroundings, there can be many instances that may cause violation of
    data privacy. For example, crowd monitoring drones that collect information on
    large gatherings may impose threats on individualâs privacy. â¢ Due to the enormous
    amount of data at centralized points such as data aggregation servers, data providers,
    and service providers, there can be the risk of privacy leakage [28]. â¢ Since
    AI/ML are key enabling technologies of 6G, while collecting individual personal
    related data for training models, the risk of revealing data may create privacy
    attacks [146], [163]. 5.4.2. Role of blockchain Privacy is another technical aspect
    that can be met with the use of blockchain in 6G networks [28]. Having a common
    communication channel in the form of blockchain, can allow network users to be
    identified by pseudo names instead of direct personal identities [148]. Manogaran
    et al. [159] proposed a blockchain-based integrated security measure (dubbed as
    BISM) for 6G communication environment. In the proposed measure, virtualized resource
    access control and user privacy-preserving techniques are modeled with low time
    complexity and memory consumption. The authors considered the connected users
    and the virtualized resources, and the access control decisions are taken by maintaining
    the states of the resources using a Q-learning procedure. The performance of privacy
    preserving is measured by the user and resource level with respect to time complexity
    and memory consumption. However, the drawback is that the authors do not present
    the deployment of their proposed solution in a real blockchain platform. As stated
    in [164], the use of blockchain for 6G-enabled UAV communication is significantly
    efficient compared to the current communication networks. It may provide higher
    privacy and transparency during data acquisition and air traffic management while
    allowing fast uploading of data with higher bandwidth and lower latency among
    UAV applications. In [160], the authors proposed a blockchain-based privacy-aware
    distribution collection-oriented strategy for data aggregation. In their solution,
    privacy protection is achieved by improving blockchain with a new block header
    structure to decompose high sensitive tasks and actors into different groups.
    However, they do not provide the exact details on how the block header modification
    can be performed for data aggregation in a trustless network. Fan et al. [165]
    proposed a privacy preservation scheme that grants complete data ownership based
    on blockchain for content-centric 5G networks. The clearly defined access rules
    govern who gets to access the userâs data and when, i.e., time. Moreover, the
    adopted key management and the use of encrypted data strengthen privacy. The work
    considers the mutual trust between the users and the content providers and exploits
    a public blockchain. In addition to that, as stated in [166], blockchain technology
    can be applied together with differential privacy and homomorphic encryption techniques
    for enabling privacy preservation in 6G. Privacy preservation using machine learning
    is an emerging research area. In [167], authors design a blockchain-based architecture
    for secure data sharing among distributed entities by incorporating privacy-preserved
    federated learning. More specifically, federated learning is used to build and
    share data models instead of sharing the actual data, and differential privacy
    is used to protect data privacy. However, on one hand Blockchain is using as a
    tool for privacy preservation, on the other hand the transparency in the blockchain
    networks may affect the privacy requirements in the 6G networks. Particularly,
    in the permissionless blockchains, transparency and openness may create harmful
    effects to the user privacy [168]. Mixing services are integrated as a solution
    to achieve on-chain transaction privacy. For instance, the mixing services allow
    different users to collaboratively form one transaction with multiple inputs and
    outputs. Thereby the attacker is unable to distinguish the connectivity between
    the transaction inputs and the corresponding outputs. 5.4.3. Summary Although
    preserving privacy will always add an extra overhead, it is quite important as
    it will be an implicit indicator that ensures trust among the stakeholders in
    future 6G networks. However, ensuring the proper accountability to assure the
    privacy protection aspects of fully automated AI-driven systems in future networks
    will be a challenging research area. As described in the above section, the existing
    literature reveals the efforts of exploiting blockchain for privacy preservation
    in 6G as well as the drawbacks. The use of blockchain for 6G privacy needs to
    be handled carefully for keeping the correct balance between data privacy protection
    and the system performance for computational overhead. 5.5. Resource management
    Efficient resource management and sharing have become crucial due to the scarcity
    of networking, computing, and memory resources. In 5G networks, softwarization
    and virtualization based technologies such as SDN, NFV, and NS, have enabled efficient
    management of resources. Nevertheless, with the ever-growing number of subscribers
    and their connectivity requirements of more data-hungry and computationally advanced
    applications, resource management will be more challenging in 6G. On the other
    hand, the emergence of micro-operator-driven local networks promises to serve
    customized and location-aware needs of industry verticals and other organizations
    [169]. Although these local networks deployed as small cell can guarantee QoS
    and reliability, however, for their successful deployment, on-demand infrastructure
    sharing is essential [123]. Thus, the resource management in the next generation
    of networks must undergo drastic improvements to minimize the cost and maximize
    the utilization of the resources while catering to the existing and the new range
    of services and applications. 5.5.1. Key challenges Some of the key challenges
    pertaining to resource management in 6G networks are as follows. â¢ As the number
    of network tenants (e.g., industry verticals) are increasing in parallel to the
    number of traditional mobile users; resource management will become more complicated
    [170]. In particular, the complexity arises not just due to massive connectivity
    requirements but also due to the time-varying and heterogeneous (at times orthogonal)
    service demands. Optimized management of physical and virtual resources under
    such dynamic scenarios will be challenging. â¢ Centralized orchestration of resource
    trading would not be able to scale-up and meet various demands of network tenants
    and infrastructure providers in terms of security, transparency, and trustless
    trading. â¢ The next-generation networks are becoming more distributed systems.
    Therefore, the networking and computational resources have to be managed by considering
    local availability and global requirements. 5.5.2. Role of blockchain The role
    of blockchain in 6G networks can be closely coupled with the dynamic resource
    management of next-generation networks. There are numerous alleviating roles that
    blockchain can play in future network softwarization related services. These services
    are automatic slice brokering, secure and optimized VNF placement, proactive service
    migrations to the edges, and transparent incentive mechanisms for sharing of unused
    resources. Blockchain-based network slice brokering is used to enable the dynamic
    interoperability and resource trading requirements of market players such as infrastructure
    providers, consumers, and mobile network operators in trading the network and
    computational resources [171], [172]. In addition to facilitating on-demand resource
    allocation and resource trading for RAN, computational resources, and storage,
    the slice broker performs admission control based on traffic monitoring and forecasting,
    including mobility, based on a global network view. In [173] authors studied the
    feasibility of blockchain and smart contracts to enabled network slice brokering
    in 5G networks. In particular, secure and autonomous network slice creation for
    industrial automation use case has been analyzed. Various industrial automation
    microprocesses such as testing, resource croudsourcing, sorting, grafting and
    streamlining have been considered and the applicability of blockchain-enabled
    5G network slice broker for these microprocesses has been explored. Another pertinent
    work is [174] where authors proposed a blockchain-based decentralized resource
    trading and distributed task assignment scheme for IoT devices. Game theory based
    smart contracts are used for the process of optimal resource trading among the
    participants. The consensus mechanism in their solution guarantees the reliability
    and security of distributed resource trading and task assignment. Likewise, in
    [175], the Stackelberg game theory model is exploited in edge computing resource
    trading for mobile blockchain. In particular, they consider the offloading of
    mining computation tasks to the edge computing service providers in a multi-user
    environment. In [176] also, the authors propose the use of public blockchain for
    MEC network with a Stackelberg game-based learning framework. Blockchain has also
    been exploited for edge caching and slice orchestration at the edge of the network
    [177], [178], [179]. In [177], the authors consider a joint resource allocation
    in blockchain-based MEC using a double auction mechanism. Using a tamper-proof
    ledger in blockchain, the authors could prevent the malicious edge servers from
    tampering with the player information. The resource management in edge clouds
    will be challenging due to the requirements of reliability, scalability, and fair
    service allocation. As stated in [180], blockchain can be used to face these challenges
    since it does not need a centralized scheduler, can handle intelligent contracts
    and ensure security. When the blockchain-based resource management schemes do
    not require a centralized scheduler, it can improve the robustness of the edge
    computing paradigm. Furthermore, blockchain capabilities can be utilized when
    spare or unused computational capabilities of nearby mobile and other devices
    need to be harnessed. In this scenario, smart contracts along with tokenized rewards
    can be used to compensate such nearby devices for sharing their resources [181].
    However, in terms of device performance, the resource management in 6G with blockchain
    has two-fold problems. On the one hand, it has to develop lightweight blockchain
    solutions for low-cost low-performing devices. On the other hand, high-performance
    blockchain and decentralization for the vertical industries and future networks.
    Moreover, the use of public blockchains for resource management may create privacy
    breaches [182]. 5.5.3. Summary Throughout this section we have identified few
    research efforts where blockchain is used for resource management in 5G and 6G
    networks in terms of resource trading with network slice brokers, edge caching,
    and wireless resource utilization. Table 8 provides the summary of important related
    works using blockchain for network resource management. Based on the above related
    works, the key limitations encountered with the use of blockchain for resource
    management include the extra overhead and the privacy breaches. Table 8. Blockchain

    to determine the feasibility of the solution. Further research is required to

    Service latency and revenue of resource providers For the resource trading in
    IoT networks, the task assignment is performed using game theory based smart contract.
    Only the feasibility analysis is provided and the proof-of-concept and overhead

    approach for pricing-based edge computing resource offloading of mobile blockchain
    miners operated in IoT networks. Numerical analysis Service utility and unit service
    price of edge service providers Mining tasks are offloaded to both edge and centralized
    service providers in order to make it a promising approach for more complex future
    networks. However, the feasibility of the proposed solution is proposed only with
    the simulation results. Asheralieva et. al. [176] Propose a hierarchical learning
    framework with Stackelberg game based model for a public blockchain realized in
    a mobile edge computing (MEC) network. Simulation setup in OPNET platform Payoff
    for miners and service providers It is proven that the learning algorithms converge
    to stable states when the minersâ actions are the best responses to the optimal
    price assigned by the SP. Proof of concept is missing from this work. Sun et.

    physical layer security techniques. It considers data reliability and frequencies
    to optimize the probabilities of content caching and secure transmission. Simulation
    setup Probabilities of secure transmission, content caching and redundancy rate
    The proposed blockchain based framework assures the security of historical data
    and the privacy of users. No implementation is provided in this work. 5.6. Ubiquitous
    intelligence In 6G, the concept of hyper-intelligence envisions a smart and autonomous
    networks which will facilitate key operational functions such as self-configuration,
    self-monitoring, self-healing, and self-optimization with minimal human effort
    and intervention [183]. Furthermore, the network services and applications will
    be hyper-flexible, customizable, and adaptive in a self-driven manner to provide
    the best user experience ubiquitously. This cognitive network inherently aims
    to integrate AI/ML as a native element in future networks, i.e., ubiquitous intelligence.
    For instance, the first step towards hyper-intelligent networks is ETSI ZSM architecture
    entailing closed-loop operation and AI/ML techniques with pervasive automation
    of network management operations [184]. Furthermore, distributed learning and
    intelligence schemes such as Federated Learning will be widely used across the
    network as a mechanism for distributed AI in heterogeneous settings [185]. 5.6.1.
    Key challenges The key challenges for ubiquitous intelligence in 6G networks can
    be summarized as follows: â¢ Complexity and optimization for AI/ML: The diversity
    and complexity of 6G networks will lead to challenges in terms of human-in-the-loop
    management and system optimization tasks. Autonomic and self-driven management
    and optimization schemes are crucial. However, the complexity of such intelligent
    schemes and how they can be optimized are challenging questions [12]. The overall
    complexity is to be managed, and the AI/ML adoption should be optimized. â¢ Integration
    of trusted nodes into distributed learning settings: The distributed nature of
    intelligence in 6G calls for an integrated operation of disparate parties for
    smart infrastructure. This is also due to the multi-party and multi-domain structure
    of softwarized and service-based architecture inherited from 5G networks and extended
    further [186]. However, trustworthiness for AI/ML agents is a not trivial attribute
    and may impair the intelligence performance in 6G networks. â¢ Secure data sharing
    for pervasive intelligence: The centralized storage and management feature in
    6G AI applications may incur threats to data security (e.g., stealing or malicious
    tampering due to compromise of the server), resulting in privacy violation and
    interference with normal network functions [27]. This is an important challenge
    for large-scale and multi-party networked systems such as 6G. â¢ Large-scale AI/ML
    applications: The ubiquitous intelligence for various use cases and applications
    will lead to a more decentralized data storage and exchange architecture in 6G.
    This drive is also related to the cooperative and federated services and infrastructure
    flexibly bound together for smart immersive environments and objects. An important
    challenge is how to devise and integrate technologies to enable such scalability
    for ubiquitous intelligence. 5.6.2. Role of blockchain Since the pervasive use
    of AI/ML will be realized in a distributed and large-scale 6G system for various
    technical aspects including network management, distributed AI/ML techniques are
    supposed to enforce rapid control and analytics on the extremely large amount
    of generated data in 6G networks. Blockchain can provide important functionalities
    towards ubiquitous intelligence in 6G networks. One such aspect is AI governance
    and data sharing. Governing and sharing the learning results efficiently, reliably,
    and safely are hampered by the heterogeneity and non-confidence among edges. For
    instance, in [187], Qiu et al. elaborated on the concept of blockchain energized
    edge intelligence for B5G networks and develop a distributed and immutable record
    of learning results, namely, Ai-Chain. Furthermore, the authors developed a new
    learning-based consensus protocol called proof of learning (PoL) that considers
    the results of local training processes running at edge learning nodes as a race
    that needs a consensus on the winning node. However, their work assumes every
    edge node to have the same number of neural cells and the same number of layers
    in their neural network. In realistic scenarios, this might not always be feasible.
    Another important role of blockchain is to support context awareness and autonomicity.
    Hyper-intelligent 6G networks have to be context-aware for network management
    as well as providing smart digital services. It is possible with ultra-scale sensing
    functions (discussed in the following paragraph), which will support such context-aware
    operation. Additionally, they need to be self-driven and autonomic to be able
    to meet performance KPIs. Blockchain will provide trusted execution with smart
    contracts and data sharing for context-awareness and, consequently, autonomic
    operation. However, the complexity of blockchain-based solutions for that purpose
    may lead to a burden. Ultra-scale sensing is another important capability as the
    integration of advanced sensor technologies with mobile networks accompanied by
    low-energy communication capabilities will lead to pervasive intelligent sensing
    and localized services [188]. Blockchain will also serve as a decentralized and
    trustworthy data stratum for ultra-scale sensing and big data analytics in 6G.
    This is a crucial utility of blockchain since sensing is a foundational pillar
    for intelligent services and networks. As an application of blockchain for intelligent
    sensing in Beyond 5G networks, Reebadiya et al. proposed a blockchain-based secure
    and intelligent sensing and tracking architecture for CAVs using beyond 5G communication
    networks in [189]. Their proposed architecture ensures secure sensing and object
    tracking through blockchain by deploying AI algorithms at the edge servers while
    the B5G network enables low latency and high reliability communications for serving
    these time-sensitive applications. For 6G networks, the anticipated services require
    very stringent and consistent QoE/QoS performance. This is only possible through
    a very effective and smart resource management framework in the network access.
    However, the resource scarcity and efficiency requirements make this kind of operation
    challenging. Control of massive-scale intelligent surfaces is a particular management
    challenge in 6G. The use of programmable intelligent surfaces to cover man-made
    structures (e.g., buildings, roads, indoor walls) allows intelligent control of
    the transmission environment in wireless systems [190]. Such intelligent surfaces
    are going to play an important role for 6G networks and will be beneficial the
    quality of radio signal is degraded. In a blockchainized 6G network, blockchain
    provides the key capability of facilitating federated control among disparate
    intelligent surfaces. Moreover, intelligent surface control functions from different
    administrative domains (e.g., different network operators) can exchange synchronization
    and reconfiguration information using blockchain. 5.6.3. Summary Blockchain can
    serve as an enabler for implementing pervasive intelligent networks via secure
    data sharing, immutability, and decentralized architecture. The decentralized
    paradigm also provides a more robust intelligence stratum for the entire network
    ranging from smart devices to cloud services. It can facilitate federated very
    large-scale AI/ML applications for smart and autonomous digital connected services.
    Therefore, a decentralized and secure data sharing technique without a so-called
    trusted third entity or intermediary, i.e., blockchain is promising in future
    6G [27]. However, the overhead, scalability, and interoperability challenges of
    blockchain are especially apparent on the way to achieve the ubiquitous intelligence
    objective of 6G. For instance, the energy consumption due to blockchain functions
    such as consensus and cryptographic operations are challenges limiting the utility
    of blockchains. This phenomenon heralds the critical need for analysis of the
    energy and environmental impact of pervasive blockchain adoption in 6G, and thus
    research for its minimization is essential. Moreover, the scalability aspect needs
    to be improved for realizing ultra-scale intelligence solutions. There are also
    new attacks emerging which try to impair the reliability and accuracy of AI/ML
    solutions using blockchains, which the research community needs to heed more elaborately
    in the future [28]. 5.7. Mobility management Since 6G networks will be a super-dense
    network of networks and will make use of a higher frequency spectrum (GHz/THz
    range), the 2D cell boundaries would shrink to a few meters [8]. This drastic
    reduction in 2D cell size would require more base stations to cover the same area,
    and so the expected number of handovers for mobile users will also increase exponentially.
    Furthermore, because of the non-optimized handover mechanisms for various overlapping
    and small coverage base stations (such as Picocell, Femtocell, and UAV-based ABSs),
    the handover probability (HOP), Handover Failure Probability (HFP), Handover Ping-Pong
    Probability (HPPP) effect, and Radio Link Failure (RLF) will increase significantly
    [191]. Subsequently, it will have an adverse impact both on throughput and delay.
    On the other hand, the advent of 3D networking will support 3D mobility of flying
    users, requiring new mobility management techniques since handover will also happen
    in vertical direction [2]. As 6G aims to offer ultra-reliable low-latency communication,
    the efficient management of mobility is very crucial [191]. 5.7.1. Key challenges
    Some of the challenges pertaining to mobility management in next-generation networks
    are as follows. â¢ Distributed Mobility Management (DMM), an initiative of IETF,
    has numerous security issues such as impersonation attack, session hijacking,
    DoS attack, man-in-middle attack, and attacks by malicious entities involved.
    These issues make DMMâs use challenging for mobility management. â¢ To ensure the
    secure handovers and avoid performance degradation, forward secrecy is crucial,
    which protects the past session keys (and corresponding communications) even if
    the long-term secrets of UE and APs are compromised in the future. In addition
    to the forward secrecy, simultaneously achieving other requirements (e.g., mutual
    authentication, key agreement, traceability, and robustness) is a significant
    challenge [192], [193]. â¢ Use of centralized authentication server for mobility
    management leads to both performance and security issues. â¢ Roaming fraud due
    to inefficient and delay-prone data exchanges between a home network and a visitor
    network causes high economical losses [194]. Such roaming fraud can be a critical
    challenge in future 6G networks because of the densification of networks, 3D networking,
    and popularity of micro-operators powered local/private networks [123]. 5.7.2.
    Role of blockchain The combination of blockchain and smart contracts can establish
    trust among mobile users and mobile networks in a distributed and anonymized fashion.
    Various use of blockchain to efficiently manage mobility in wireless networks
    are discussed as follows. DMM aims to overcome the issues (e.g., single-point-of-failure
    and sub-optimal routing) related to traditional centralized mobility management
    [195]. The rationale of DMM is to distribute the control of mobility across the
    network. Nevertheless, as pointed out by Sharma et al. [196], DMM suffers from
    security issues like session hijacking, DoS attack, and attacks by Mobile Anchors
    and Access Routers (MAARs). These issues are mainly because security is implemented
    in a centralized manner. Thus, authors in [196] proposed blockchain-based DMM,
    which provides distributed security, fault-tolerance, and identity management.
    Though their scheme has been shown to be promising, however, high storage redundancy
    due to multiple distributed ledgers is challenging. Furthermore, how the initial
    authentication of mobile devices happens is not discussed and is assumed to happen
    using a private secure channel. Lai et al. [197] provides a solution to handover
    authentication for group communication scenario in VANETs where mobility of fleet
    of vehicles is to be managed. The authors used aggregate message authentication
    code, one-time password, and blockchain to reduce the handover overload. The proposed
    protocol uses Elliptic Curve DiffieâHellman (ECDH) algorithm for session key management.
    The protocol uses blockchain in which the vehicle, control mobility databases,
    and mobility access routers, store the vehicleâs key information, which mobility
    access routers can use later to authenticate the vehicles. In addition to fulfilling
    the security requirements such as session key confidentiality and immunity towards
    reply attack and sybil attack, the authors demonstrate that the proposed scheme
    is effective in the context of handover latency and computation and communication
    overheads. Similarly, the use of blockchain for authentication during handover
    while protecting userâs privacy in SDN-based 5G Networks has been presented by
    Yazdinejad et al. [198]. As 6G will use SDN and NVF to manage the networks efficiently,
    it is expected that blockchain can play a significant role in mobility management.
    The authors in [192] proposed RUSH, which provides anonymous mutual authentication
    with key authentication, robust traceability, and perfect forward secrecy by using
    chameleon hash functions and blockchains. In RUSH, after the initialization phase,
    a user registers in a network to get the service. Subsequently, the user prepares
    for the handover phase. It first chooses a pseudo-identity, computes various parameters
    to prove the legitimacy of his identity, and submits the authentication parameters
    to the access point. The access point checks the freshness of the information
    to prevent replay attacks and verifies the legitimacy of the authentication parameters.
    The authors compared the proposed mechanism in terms of authentication message
    sizes and the storage cost and concluded that both the parameters decrease in
    the proposed scheme. The authors used Burrow-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic to check
    the security properties of the proposed anonymous mutual authentication. Furthermore,
    to formally verify the proposed authentication mechanism, the authors used AVISPA
    model checkers. For ensuring the secure handover key management with complete
    forward key separation, Lee et al. [199] proposed a novel approach, named Parallel
    Blockchain Key Derivation Function (PB-KDF). Their proposed architecture comprises
    an entity named Authentication Center, which initially collects the public keys
    of all the Base Stations and then puts them together to form a genesis block.
    This genesis block is then shared with all the Base stations in a geographical
    area belonging to one administrative domain. By doing so, all the base stations
    get public keys of all the other base stations that they can use for secure communication.
    When a user device joins a base station, the base station sends the genesis block
    to the user device. Upon receiving the genesis block, the user device sends its
    public key and a timestamp to the base station. The base station shares this information
    with other base stations. Hence, each base stations have the same data about the
    user, which is used for creating a proof-of-work challenge. Similar to [192],
    the authors in [199] used BAN logic to prove various security objectives and evaluated
    the performance of their system in terms of packet loss vs. distance between base
    stations, latency incurred because of handover failure rates, and key derivation
    time. With the same intent to provide forward secrecy and meet the lightweight
    requirement for resource-constrained mobile devices and protect the privacy of
    users, Hu et al. [193] proposed an anonymous, temper-resistant and seamless handover
    authentication scheme. Their proposed scheme uses a chameleon hash function and
    blockchain-protected user certificate to perform handover authentication. When
    a user registers at the authentication server, the latter generates a unique certificate
    and uploads it to the blockchain. When the user moves to a new access point, s/he
    is authenticated by cross-checking with the original certificate available on
    the blockchain. The authors analyzed the security and efficiency of the proposed
    authentication scheme. They showed that their scheme provides conditional privacy
    based on the pseudonymity feature of blockchain, immunity to various attacks (like
    replay, man-in-middle, and passive eavesdropping attacks), and perfect forward
    secrecy of session key. Mobility of UE can also result in a roaming situation
    when the source and destination base stations belong to two different networks.
    The home network is where the UE is officially registered, and the visitor network
    is the one that has a prior agreement signed with a home network to provide services
    to the customers of the home network. Usually, it takes significant time to establish
    such roaming agreements, and also they are static in nature. The latter implies
    that traditional roaming agreement is apt when there are a standard set of services
    [200]. However, for heterogeneous, agile, and customized services as offered in
    5G (and are expected with 6G), dynamic agreements are needed. Blockchain and smart
    contracts are considered to realize such dynamic roaming agreements [123]. Another
    vital issue associated with the current roaming system is roaming frauds that
    result in significant revenue loss. The primary cause behind roaming fraud is
    the presence of third-party entity called Data Clearing House (DCH). This DHC
    stands as an intermediary between a home and a visitor network and introduces
    a significant delay that hinders the home network from charging mobile UE under
    roaming, precisely [194]. To overcome the issue of roaming frauds, authors in
    [123], [194], [201] proposed the use of blockchain. In particular, authors in
    [194], [201] make use of blockchain and Stackelberg game theory based economic
    model to ensure secure communication, enable fast and decentralized data exchange
    between home and visitor network, and maximize profits of involved parties. 5.7.3.
    Summary Blockchain has been shown to have the potential to provide key derivation
    (with full forward secrecy) during handover, maintaining anonymity during authentication,
    reducing overall authentication overload, deploying fair economic incentive policies
    and mitigating roaming frauds. Significant research work has already manifested
    blockchain as an efficient tool to implement secure mobility management for MNOs,
    local operators, VANET, fog networks, and in general wireless mobile networks.
    Its role in 6G will continue to solve similar issues. However, the cost paid to
    use blockchain for mobility management is in the form of high storage requirements
    and additional computation resources to implement blockchain. Also, achieving
    transparency and verification while ensuring a fair incentive mechanism in a mobile
    environment is challenging as the number of UE estimated to use 6G networks are
    going to highly mobile and very volatile. 5.8. Other emerging technical aspects
    Some of the other technical aspects that can be ameliorated with the use of blockchain
    are discussed as follows. 5.8.1. Zero-touch network and service management (ZSM)
    ZSM, an initiative of ETSI, is an emerging paradigm to achieve the E2E network
    and service automation. The ultimate goal of ZSM is to realize a hundred percent
    autonomous networks capable of self-configuration, self-optimization, self-monitoring,
    self-healing, and self-scaling without any human intervention [202]. Thus, ZSM
    leads to flexible and agile delivery of services by ensuring economic sustainability
    in the diversified networks [72]. The ZSM architecture is formed using intent-based
    interfaces, closed-loop operation, and AI/ML techniques to empower full automation
    of the management operations. 6G complex ecosystem is envisioned to be comprised
    of multi-tenants, multi-operators (strengthened by local/micro operators), and
    multiple (virtual network) service providers. Thus, ZSM will play an instrumental
    role for 6G networks in achieving E2E automation of network resources and services
    that fall under different parts of a mobile network (e.g., core, transport, and
    radio access) spanning over multiple operators and service providers. Blockchain
    and AI-driven operations may support cross-domain security and trust orchestration
    mechanisms in the proposed ZSM architecture by assisting service lifecycle automation
    in multi-tenant and multi-stakeholder environments [203]. DLTs like blockchain
    can be adopted to implement distributed security and trust through smart contracts
    among both trusted and non-trusted multiple parties (i.e., multi-tenant and multi-operator
    scenarios) [204]. This approach can be further combined with distributed AI for
    cognitive network orchestration, leading to zero-touch network automation. Thus,
    blockchain has the potential as a promising technology to promote trust in zero
    touch network management. However, it is still challenging to maintain the proper
    balance between data privacy and trust in a blockchain-based automated system
    to operate with assured information security. 5.8.2. Edge Computing (EC) and Federated
    Learning (FL) Edge Computing (EC) will continue to play a key enabling role in
    6G networks by extending the computing and caching facilities offered by cloud
    servers to the edge of the mobile networks, i.e., very close to the end-users.
    Some of the well-known advantages of using EC are the closest proximity, extremely
    low latency, location and context awareness, real-time access, and high bandwidth
    capacity. Further, the potential use of AI/ML techniques within the premises of
    edge computing is popularly called Edge AI. However, for AI/ML based systems,
    there is a need to frequently send a significant volume of raw data to a centralized
    server to perform the training of AI/ML models. This uploading of raw data can
    lead to possible challenges in terms of data and user privacy, communication overheads,
    and extra load on resource-constrained mobile devices [205]. To overcome these
    issues Federated Learning (FL) turns out to be a promising distributed AI solution.
    In FL, statistical models are collaboratively trained directly at the participating
    devices with the locally generated (private) data. Thus, instead of sharing the
    raw data, FL allows devices to upload the locally trained model to the server.
    Blockchain is being considered as tool for Edge AI [187] and edge-based FL platforms
    [89] to provide trust, security, and strict access control. AI-native 6G is envisioned
    to offer intelligent predictive pre-caching at the edges to meet the needs of
    network tenants, efficiently. However, to carry out such analytics and prediction,
    logs of userâs activities are fed to AI/ML algorithms that raise privacy concerns.
    In this regard, Sun et al. [177] developed blockchain-driven edge caching architecture
    that aims to optimize both the cache hit rate and the redundancy rate while ensuring
    security and userâs privacy. There is an increasing number of works that aim to
    harness the synergy between FL and EC using blockchain. For instance, Lu et al.
    [206] use digital twins to improve the reliability of EC applications by creating
    digital twins of IoT devices in the EC server and performing data analysis on
    the digital replica present on the edge servers. Here, the authors used a blockchain-based
    FL to secure and protect data privacy of digital twins. In [207], authors proposed
    blockchain-enabled FL scheme for digital twin edge computing platform serving
    a huge number of IoT devices in 6G era. With the help of numerical results, the
    authors showed that their proposal can boost the communication security and preserve
    data privacy. 5.8.3. Interference management The process of managing the radio
    spectrum to minimize the interference and maximize the efficiency of spectrum
    utilization is referred to as interference management. Different types of interference
    are co-channel interference, adjacent channel interference, out-of-band interference,
    and remote interference. Co-channel interference occurs when two or more users
    transmit on the same frequency in the same geographic area. It reduces Signal-to-Noise
    Ratio (SNR), hence reducing the throughput [208]. Adjacent channel interference
    happens when the receiver cannot reject off-channel signals of the desired signal
    at reference sensitivity level due to an adjacent channel signal. It occurs because
    the adjacent channel interfererâs modulation products are falling in the receiverâs
    IF passband [23], [209]. Out-of-band interference, also known as sideband noise,
    happens when transmitter emissions fall outside the transmitterâs intended channel
    bandwidth. This noise permeates into the adjacent channels or other bands and
    adds to the thermal noise floor of the receiver. Remote interference takes place
    when, during certain atmospheric conditions, downlink transmissions travel a large
    distance and interfere with uplink reception of another base station despite the
    guard period as the downlink generally has much higher transmit power than the
    uplink [210], [211]. It is a large-scale phenomenon, and thousands of base stations
    may interfere with each other at the same time [212]. Gamal et al. [213] emphasized
    the fact that the inference management for the next-generation wireless networks
    will see a significant difference as compared to the current generation wireless
    networks. In particular, the authors focused on Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP)
    communication, which can boost the rate gains at the reduced delay. Nevertheless,
    CoMP suffers from unequal gains for participating users in every channel. To overcome
    the issue, the authors proposed a blockchain-based monetary mechanism that drives
    a greedy distributed strategy to avoid interference. The blockchain-based monetary
    mechanism uses a coin that is traded between the participating nodes. A node represents
    a transmitterâreceiver pair. A node i pays a coin to node j , either when node
    i produces interference at the node j âs receiver or when node i rents the transmitter
    of node j . Though their proposition is promising, however, the work needs to
    be evaluated with a prototypical implementation. Another interesting work by Vishal
    et al. [214] suggested using blockchain-enabled on-demand drones to support inter-service
    operability with minimal interference in the network. The authors presented the
    idea of forming an aerial blockchain comprising drones from different vendors.
    Thus, these drones are said to socialize via blockchain and form a common platform
    to provide interference-free fronthaul communication for a highly dense user environment.
    In summary, blockchain-based solutions can improve interference management by
    enabling dynamic collaboration and trust among the users. Furthermore, using blockchain
    for allocating frequency spectrum based on fair and trusted economic schemes can
    also avoid interference among primary and secondary users [25]. However, remote
    interference management would be complex, especially as 6G envisions to provide
    connectivity to UAV; remote interference would create problems both for UAVs and
    base stations. 5.8.4. Tactile Internet The evolution of the internet from mobile
    Internet to the Internet of things (or everything) is now moving towards Tactile
    Internet that aims to communicate physical, tactile experiences in real-time [215].
    Thus, Tactile Internet requires ultra-reliable, ultra-responsive, and ultra-secure
    network connectivity with extremely low latency. Since these requirements match
    the 6G KPI, Tactile communications are envisioned to be rolled out in 6G era.
    Nevertheless, the key issue is to maintain data integrity and access control while
    delivering real-time control using tactile communication [216]. As in tactile
    communication, information related to the kinesthetic perception (such as applied
    force, the exact position, and velocity) and tactile perception (such as surface
    texture and necessary friction) will be transmitted to be reproduced at the receiver.
    Thus, any kind of security and privacy vulnerabilities will have a severe impact.
    For instance, in telesurgery, the consequences can be fatal. The use of blockchain
    has been looked upon as a possible solution to deal with security and privacy
    issues in Tactile Internet [217]. Hassija et al. [218] proposed a blockchain-based
    framework for drone-mounted base stations in the Tactile Internet environment.
    The authors used permissioned blockchain with authorized nodes and smart contracts
    to prevent any dispute. These nodes run on drones mounted with small cell stations
    and cellular base stations. Hassija et al. [219] put forward the use of blockchain
    to perform secure mobile data offloading in Tactile Internet scenario. The authors
    highlight that conventional blockchain suffers with poor scalability, inefficiency,
    and no provision of timestamp-based ordering required to handle mission-critical
    time-sensitive applications. To overcome these issues, the authors make use of
    (i) Hashgraph, which is based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and (ii) game-theoretic
    bargaining model. The use of Hashgraph offers consensus timestamp and Asynchronous
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (ABFT) mechanism, which is immune to colluding nodes,
    and the use game-theoretic model allows cost-effective negotiation for offloading.
    5.8.5. Quantum Communication Quantum Communication (QC) is an emerging communication
    paradigm that encodes the information in a quantum state using photons or quantum
    particles and transfers these quantum states from one place to another [15], [74].
    The security comes from the fact that the information cannot be accessed or cloned
    without tampering the quantum state because of quantum principles like the correlation
    of entangled particles, quantum superposition, quantum entanglement, the no-cloning
    theorem, and inalienable law [11], [53], [220]. There are several applications
    of QC, such as quantum key distribution and quantum secret sharing in long-distance
    communication with improved data rates due to the superposition nature of qubits.
    For instance, Liao et al. [221] have exhibited intercontinental QC between earth
    stations located in China and Austria using Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite as
    a relay. The distributed secure data storage and smart contract based strict access
    control features of blockchain can well support quantum (or semi-quantum) communication
    based applications in 6G era. Due to the complexity of quantum devices and their
    high prices, at present semi-quantum techniques are proposed. They aim to integrate
    quantum with classical cryptographic techniques. Zhu et al. [222] put forward
    two semi-quantum reflection protocols using blockchain technology for security
    enhancement and efficient management of Internet of Vehicle (IoV) scenario. The
    authors considered all the exchanges (as part of the semi-quantum protocol) over
    quantum channels as âtransactionsâ in blockchain parlance. Their proposed IoV
    architecture is shown to be immune to most of the attacks under the no-cloning
    theorem and unbiased-chosen basis (UCB) assumption. Nevertheless, more research
    efforts are required to gauge the clear benefits that blockchain can bring to
    QC, especially the role of blockchain for routing in multi-hop quantum communication
    [223], quantum entanglement and quantum parallelism based MAC protocols [224],
    and for error detection and correction in QC [13]. Download : Download high-res

    Industry 5.0 applications. 6. Blockchain for 6G use cases and applications Distributed
    ledger technologies such as blockchain are expected to play a vital role in future
    6G communication networks to enable numerous trending applications such as industry
    5.0 enabled factories, holographic teleportation, extended reality, and connected
    autonomous vehicles [31], [95], [225]. Furthermore, [226] evaluates blockchain
    and IoT use cases and presents that blockchain and smart contracts align well
    together with the microprocesses related to value creating resource configuration
    that is capable of being realized through modern microservice technologies. In
    addition, the shift from conventional value chains to decentralized platforms
    will also lead to value propositions towards the end-to-end business ecosystem.
    This section elaborates on several 6G-enabled use cases and applications that
    are envisaged to harness the capabilities of blockchain. Each application is described
    highlighting the key challenges and how blockchain can act as an enabler to realize
    them. Table 9 summarizes the role of blockchain for 6G-enabled use cases in terms
    of features offered, types of blockchain used, consensus algorithms used, expected
    throughput and latency, and the potential blockchain platforms. 6.1. Industrial
    applications in Industry 5.0 Industry 4.0 aimed to increase the productivity and
    efficiency of smart industries by intensively using CyberâPhysical Systems (CPS)
    that harness the mMTC and URLLC capabilities of 5G networks [227]. Industry 5.0
    will advance the Industry 4.0 concept with the efficient use of machines and human
    workers in a synergistic environment to personalize autonomous manufacturing [58].
    Notably, in Industry 5.0, humans will be expected to perform high-level and creative
    tasks while the autonomous machines will be conducting mundane and time-consuming
    work. Industry 5.0 applications will leverage AI/ML technologies together with
    VR/AR/XR, digital twins and advanced robotics. This gamut of technologies will
    facilitate humanârobot co-working (with collaborative robots aka cobots) and customized
    manufacturing processes while increasing production efficiency, minimizing wastage
    and environmental pollution [228]. 6.1.1. Key challenges Some of the key challenges
    related to Industry 5.0 in future 6G communication networks are given below. â¢
    Scalable communication infrastructure will be required for Industry 5.0 to connect
    a large number of devices facilitating humanâmachine interactions on top of automated
    applications [229]. Moreover, storage and processing of the generated Big Data
    will also be a challenge for Industry 5.0. â¢ The overall network should be secured
    against possible attacks while personal and sensitive data are being gathered.
    In particular, humanârobot interactions can raise privacy concerns as they may
    collect personal data [230]. Thus, privacy compliance will be indispensable, and
    the challenges will be automated monitoring and secure auditing. â¢ Efficient utilization
    and security of AI/ML techniques are essential for Industry 5.0 applications to
    enable automated decision making. â¢ Although the existing cloud manufacturing
    has numerous advantages, however, it is prone to all the issues related to centralized
    systems and dependency on third-party entities [231]. â¢ Federated and optimized
    use of computational resources available in the surroundings will be essential
    to meet the future dynamic requirements of industrial applications. However, the
    challenge will be how to incentivize and automate such resource pooling. 6.1.2.
    Role of blockchain It is envisaged that blockchain will play a key role in facilitating
    Industry 5.0 applications in future 6G networks in the coming decade [232]. The
    role of blockchain towards enabling Industry 5.0 in future 6G networks is illustrated
    in Fig. 9. According to Wu et al. [233], blockchain enables many features towards
    establishing industry infrastructure by enabling enhanced scalability, security,
    and privacy. In particular, blockchain integrated with edge computing is capable
    of offering the above features in the IIoT scenario by distributing computing
    across the IIoT infrastructure and offloading computationally intensive tasks
    to the edge servers. In this direction, a blockchain-based secure edge intelligence
    platform is proposed by Zhang et al. [225] to facilitate edge services in an IIoT
    environment. In this work, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques are utilized
    to improve the efficiency of the blockchain-based distributed edge resource utilization.
    The nodes that contribute towards edge intelligence by performing tasks such as
    transaction validation in the blockchain are rewarded with a novel credit-differentiated
    transaction approval scheme. This scheme is reliable and incentivizes the nodes
    to participate in blockchain-related operations. However, the realization of this
    approach requires efficient AI processing mechanisms and smooth interoperability
    between diverse blockchain technologies. A communication protocol that uses blockchain
    and smart contracts to enable autonomous agents to make independent decisions
    on economic actions in industries is presented in [234]. This protocol arranges
    economic interactions that are performed between autonomous agents using a P2P
    network that is based on blockchain. Authors used Ethereum for implementation,
    where the smart contracts were linked with the Robot Operating System (ROS) communication
    framework of autonomous agents. The connection between physical sensors and the
    Ethereum blockchain is performed through Open Platform Communications United Architecture
    (OPC UA) while InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a distributed storage system,
    is used for storage. However, the smooth operation of this protocol requires autonomous
    agents to be equipped with sufficient RAM and computing resources. The limitations
    imposed by the centralized framework in the existing cloud manufacturing architecture
    can be solved by introducing blockchain driven decentralized architectures. For
    instance, blockchain-based cloud manufacturing architecture is proposed in [231]
    to facilitate on-demand secure services, secure data exchange, and effective collaboration
    between multiple parties. In the proposed architecture, the user part of the architecture
    consists of the end-user, while the blockchain cloud manufacturing part consists
    of the core layer, blockchain networks, and the cloud manufacturing layer. Here,
    the important challenge is to virtualize cloud manufacturing in the blockchain
    network. Blockchain can provide a high level of security by storing all the data
    and transactions in the shared ledger which is replicated at all the nodes in
    the network. To meet this requirement of secure and efficient exchange of big
    data in an industrial environment, Zheng et al. [235] proposed an IIoT data management
    system the harnesses the best of blockchain and distributed off-chain storage
    system like IPFS. Furthermore, the authors used Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structured
    IOTA Tangle to meet the high scalability, immutability, and low operational cost
    requirements. This method facilitates better data exchange among IIoT devices
    to facilitate advanced data-driven techniques in Industry 5.0. Blockchain capabilities
    can be utilized when spare or unused computational capabilities of nearby mobile
    and other devices need to be harnessed. In this scenario, smart contracts along
    with tokenized rewards can be used to compensate these devices [158]. Furthermore,
    in case of dispute or ownership violation, blockchain-assisted management of Intellectual
    Property (IP) rights will be a rescue [236]. 6.1.3. Summary Based on the existing
    works, it can be concluded that blockchain turns out to be a promising technology
    for Industry 5.0. It can enable Industry 5.0 applications by providing features
    such as improved security and privacy of data and stakeholders, secure use of
    AI and ML for autonomous operations, optimized cloud manufacturing, and agile
    and dispute-free business agreements between companies, their partners and customers.
    However, there are aspects that require more efforts such as building of standard
    application programming interface (APIs) for development of DApps, enhancing scalability
    and security of blockchain-enabled IoT system, and optimized allocation of networking,
    storage, and computing resources for running blockchain [233]. These gaps are
    yet to be filled towards utilizing blockchain as an enabler of Industry 5.0 in
    future 6G era. 6.2. Smart healthcare 6G communication networks will revolutionize
    the smart healthcare sector by going beyond space and time barriers [38]. 6G technology
    will be able to meet the stringent Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of healthcare
    applications such as ultra-high reliability, extremely low latency, and high mobility
    [237]. Intelligent Wearable Devices (IWDs) will be instrumental in health monitoring
    and early detection of various health conditions such as Alzheimerâs disease [238].
    The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will form a network of medical devices,
    equipment, and people, aiming to exchange healthcare data seamlessly [239]. Moreover,
    in the 6G era, the convergence of smart devices and the use of AI/ML techniques
    will lead to Intelligent Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) facilitating early
    diagnosis and intelligent preventive healthcare [38]. Patient visits to hospitals
    can also be minimized by enabling medical staff to be virtually present using
    technologies such as XR applications to discuss patient issues [240]. Hospital-to-Home
    (H2H) services will be implemented on a mobile vehicle platform that will be facilitated
    with medical equipment and will have minimum dependence on hospital resources,
    including medical professionals [38]. Telesurgery with 6G enabled tactile internet
    can use fully automated robots or robots that work in collaboration with humans.
    Thus, 6G as underlying communication infrastructure will realize a complex, intelligent
    and connected healthcare paradigm. 6.2.1. Key challenges The smart healthcare
    applications in the 6G era require overcoming a significant number of challenges
    as follows. â¢ Besides a wide range of benefits offered by the digitization of
    healthcare systems with the use of smartphones, IoMTs, and cloud services, there
    has been a significant increase in privacy breaches in the healthcare industry
    [241]. Thus, the key challenge of 6G-envisioned intelligent healthcare system
    is to ensure complete privacy protection. â¢ Future healthcare systems require
    extremely high reliability and availability ( > 99 . 99999 % ) [1]. â¢ Decentralized
    operation of IIoMT devices comprising cyberâphysical systems in smart healthcare
    applications should be facilitated. â¢ Managing a large number of IIoMT devices
    requires autonomous operation between devices. â¢ Providing harmonious cooperation
    between different stakeholders such as hospitals, government agencies, and insurance
    companies to provide better healthcare services. Download : Download high-res

    6G networks for smart healthcare. 6.2.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain is emerging
    as a promising candidate to support the future 6G-envisioned smart healthcare
    ecosystem. Fig. 10 illustrates the envisaged use of blockchain in the healthcare
    domain. According to [242], the management of Electronic Medical Record (EMR)
    is one of the popular use-cases of blockchain in healthcare. MedRec, GHN, HealthChain,
    MedBlockm, and BlockHIE are some of the reported blockchain-based applications.
    Since privacy-protection of medical data is very crucial, thus in this context,
    Dwivedi et al. [243] proposed a decentralized healthcare blockchain for secure
    management of healthcare-related big data for IoT environment. Their system combines
    the benefits offered by blockchain together with lightweight cryptographic approaches.
    In particular, a lightweight ring signature is used to ensure the anonymity of
    transactions and the ARX algorithm (a type of symmetric key encryption) is used
    to encrypt data to be uploaded on the blockchain. Moreover, DiffieâHellman technique
    is used to securely exchange keys using public channel. The use of lightweight
    mechanisms alleviates the system from satisfying the powerful computational and
    bandwidth requirements of blockchain such as consensus algorithms (e.g. PoW).
    Therefore, their proposed system is more suitable for a resource-constrained IoT
    environment. However, the proposed system is still prone to attacks like DoS attack.
    With a similar intent, Zghaibeh et al. [244] presented a blockchain-enabled healthcare
    platform named as Smart-Health (SHealth) to ensure features such as security,
    availability, reliability, trustworthiness, and efficient data management. SHealth
    is based on three layers; government, users, and IIoMT devices. The proposed system
    uses a permissioned blockchain implemented on a modular hypeledger fabric utilizing
    the PBFT consensus mechanism. Smart contracts are capitalized to automate the
    process of facilitating user requests such as medical appointments, tests, and
    access to medical history. However, realizing such a comprehensive system would
    require multiple blockchain platforms to seamlessly interoperate and integrate
    with the existing standalone medical platforms. Real-time telesurgery is another
    application that is expected to be realized in the future by 6G-enabled smart
    healthcare sector. In this regard, a blockchain-based framework named HaBiTs is
    proposed by Gupta et al. [245]. The work emphasizes achieving interoperability
    and security using smart contracts on top of blockchain for telesurgery in healthcare
    4.0. This framework suggests the use of permissioned blockchain platforms such
    as hyperledger fabric (or consortium blockchain). Being a distributed platform
    owing to the usage of blockchain, this platform does not require multi-level authentication
    while the system performance and cost efficiency are enhanced. However, the implementation
    of such a proposition and its testing under various types of attacks would be
    necessary for a clear understanding of the pros and cons of blockchain-based telesurgery.
    Blockchain has also been identified as a key technology to deal with global pandemic
    like COVID-19 [246]. Such unprecedented situations demand sharing of healthcare
    data among various stakeholders across the borders. In the context of COVID-19,
    contact tracing has been implemented as a mechanism to monitor close physical
    interactions among the people. In case an individual is diagnosed with the disease,
    people who had close contact with the infected person can be identified based
    on the information collected from the contact tracing application. However, such
    contact tracing applications must overlook patientâs/userâs privacy. Accordingly,
    Zhang et al. [247] proposed the integrated use of 5G and blockchain for a privacy-preserving
    contact tracing scheme named PTBM. In particular, the authors used 5G as underlying
    high-speed communication infrastructure and used blockchain together with bloom
    filter and Public-Key Cryptosystem with Distributed Decryption (PCDD) for privacy
    (identity and location) protection. The authors used two different blockchains;
    permissionless blockchain accessible to the people using contact tracing application
    and permissioned blockchain providing restrictive access to medical organizations,
    medical centers and fog nodes. Hyperledger fabric was used to show the high computation
    efficiency and low cost of communication. Nevertheless, large-scale testing and
    benchmarking of such blockchain-enabled contact tracing are essential. Furthermore,
    with the emergence of 6G, AI/ML techniques, and big data analysis, blockchain-enabled
    could be used to predict, model and analyze future epidemics. Yet another important
    challenge being faced by the healthcare domain is the fair and transparent acquisition
    of data for research, commercial products, and drug development. This challenge
    can be well-addressed by blockchain, as discussed by Mamoshina et al. in [248].
    The authors proposed a blockchain-powered framework to build a marketplace that
    uses LifePound as a new crypto utility token. Such a marketplace helps user to
    sell their biomedical data directly to the consumer and earn LifePound. Furthermore,
    to allow the exchange of large-sized files, cloud storage services (which can
    be made to comply with privacy laws like HIPAA) are used, thereby making the solution
    scalable with off-chain storage. Furthermore, the authors suggest the use of threshold
    encryption to boost security. In threshold encryption willingness of multiple
    parties is necessary for the decryption of data. Nevertheless, building an effective
    real-time pricing model for data selling/buying is still an important question
    to be answered. 6.2.3. Summary Blockchain has proven itself to be a suitable candidate
    to resolve security, privacy, trust, and auditability issues of smart healthcare
    applications in the future 6G era. Specifically, blockchain in healthcare can
    help realize telesurgery, avoid counterfeit medical equipment and drugs, enable
    secure and remote patient monitoring, automated processing of health insurance
    claims, and establishment of an open market for profitable medical data acquisition.
    However, blockchain technology should mature in several directions, including
    improving interoperability, scalability, and transaction speed. Furthermore, privacy
    laws and regulations should also see appropriate amendments to facilitate the
    decentralized storage and operation of sensitive health data. 6.3. UAV applications
    UAVs, colloquially called drones, are another interesting application that is
    expected to flourish with the dawn of 6G [53], [249]. The market capitalization
    of drones for industrial and commercial applications was 19.3 billion USD in 2019
    and is projected to grow up to 45.8 billion USD by 2025 [250]. UAVs are considered
    to emerge as an another key application of future 6G mobile networks. While UAVs
    had their inception in military applications, their role is rapidly growing in
    civilian applications. Some of the civilian applications of UAVs are management
    of ground traffic in smart cities, video coverage of live events, video surveillance
    at industrial scale, remote sensing, wildlife survey, delivery of goods and packages,
    smart agriculture, smart construction, and short distance air taxis [1], [107].
    Furthermore, UAVs can enable intelligent transportation systems [251]. The key
    features of UAVs are ease of deployment, line-of-sight connectivity, and controlled
    mobility [252]. In addition, UAV-to-Everything (U2X) networks are also envisaged
    together with the developments of 6G and IoE [253]. Moreover, UAV or Unmanned
    Aerial Systems (UAS) require a solid UAV Traffic Management (UTM) system to operate
    fully autonomous UAVs safely beyond visual line of sight [254]. UTMs require efficient,
    secure, and risk-free communication to manage their movement in the urban airspace.
    It is envisaged that 6G will enable a UTM ecosystem focusing on terrestrial and
    non-terrestrial features supporting mobile, aerial and satellite communication.
    6.3.1. Key challenges The deployment of UAV-based applications in 6G communication
    systems will encounter many challenges; some of them are discussed as follows:
    â¢ UAV applications in B5G and 6G communication networks need to be highly available,
    reliable, and fault tolerant [250]. â¢ UAV networks are prone to different types
    of security vulnerabilities such as cyber-attacks, jamming, hijacking, eavesdropping,
    and privacy attacks [255]. Therefore, ensuring security and privacy in UAV applications
    are considered to be pivotal [256]. â¢ The latency should be minimized to facilitate
    UAV applications. â¢ The operation of large UAV swarms should be automated efficiently.
    6.3.2. Role of blockchain The use of blockchain offers many unique features that
    can help better realize 6G-enabled UAV applications. For instance, Mehta et al.
    [250] discussed the integration of blockchain with UAV networks to solve the inherent
    issues such as fault tolerance, reliability, energy efficiency, latency, QoS,
    and bandwidth. The distributed nature of blockchain offers increased fault tolerance
    for UAV networks if one or more nodes are disconnected. These nodes will be synchronized
    once they are reconnected. Furthermore, the security vulnerabilities of UAV communication
    can be addressed through blockchain owing to decentralized security management
    techniques. The energy efficiency and latency issues can be solved through lightweight
    blockchain architectures. Trusted access point groups are utilized to improve
    the access efficiency, and thereby QoS and blockchain-enhanced cloud platforms
    with efficient cryptographic algorithms are suggested to facilitate low latency
    [250]. Sharma et al. [257] proposed a blockchain-based method to utilize drones
    as on-demand caching nodes towards facilitating ultra-reliable communication in
    MEC. This neural blockchain based drone caching approach banks on blockchain to
    ensure high reliability, availability, and survivability amongst peers. Blockchain
    is used as a distributed ledger shared with all nodes in the network which are
    identified through their public keys. Moreover, Kuzmin et al. [258] presented
    a blockchain-based approach for performing secure operations in semi-autonomous
    UAVs. In this approach, each UAV in the UAV communication network (UAVNet) acts
    as a blockchain node. To minimize the threat on the communication channel between
    UAV and ground station, the fly route is included as a smart contract in the blockchain.
    Thus, UAVs can consider sensor data and the flight schedules of other UAVs to
    avoid any collision when operating autonomously. The consensus algorithm used
    in this blockchain UAV network is Proof-of-Game (PoG). However, the successful
    implementation of this requires facilitating the dynamic participation of UAV
    groups and autonomous information exchange mechanisms, while memory limitations
    of UAVs should be addressed. Furthermore, blockchain based privacy preservation
    methods in 5G and beyond UAV communication networks are presented in [259]. For
    instance, blockchain can be used for an efficient UAV ID management system, which
    will be robust, tamper-proof, and minimize single point attacks. Furthermore,
    smart contracts can be used to automate the process of ID management. In addition
    consensus mechanisms such as PoW and PBFT can make UAV networks resistant against
    malicious attacks, including Sybil attacks. Protecting drone trajectory information
    through blockchain-based access control and authentication methods is another
    way of preserving user privacy. However, several aspects of blockchain need more
    research and development, such as low efficiency and resource overhead of consensus
    algorithms, research constraints of UAVs, and scalability of blockchainized UAV
    networks. In addition, [260] explores UTM related security issues and proposes
    UTM-Chain, which is a lightweight blockchain-based security solution. This security
    solution is based on utilizing hyperledger fabric for UTM of UAVs in low-altitude
    by addressing computational and storage resources limitations of UAVs. The proposed
    method integrates the blockchain technology with UTM components. The architecture
    of the proposed system is based on a permissioned blockchain network. Blockchain
    is also utilized to store transactions and control the access to flight data that
    are securely stored in a decentralized off-chain database. The access is controlled
    through blockchain and smart contracts. Therefore, the proposed UTM-Chain also
    provides secure and reliable data transmission between UAVs and ground stations
    in envisaged 6G networks. 6.3.3. Summary Blockchain is emerging as a viable technology
    to realize UAV applications in the future 6G networks. It offers unique features
    such as decentralized decision-making, strong security while exchanging data between
    UAVs and between UAVs and ground stations, privacy protection of the sensed data,
    automated collaboration, identity management, mission secrecy, and tight access
    control through smart contracts. However, several issues, including increased
    scalability, lower latency, and resource constraints in UAVs, need further research.
    6.4. Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) Another prominent use case of the future
    networks will be Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which will demand advanced
    technologies for real-time sensing, secure connectivity, and automate vehicle
    decisions [261]. CAVs evince, on the one hand, the convergence of connected vehicles
    powered by V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communication facilitated through dedicated
    short-range communications (DSRC) and mobile networks, and fully autonomous vehicles
    on the other hand [262], [263]. 6G will provide a solid underpinning for the deployment
    of CAVs as an emerging industry vertical [264]. CAVs with various types of sensors
    (e.g., camera, ultrasound, radar, lidar, and other V2X sensors) will provide information
    related to safety, navigation, mapping, and infotainment to users [263]. In addition,
    CAVs will resolve the existing problems in transportation systems, such as traffic
    congestion, road safety, fuel wastage, and air pollution [265]. 6.4.1. Key challenges
    There are several challenges to be addressed to facilitate the deployment of CAVs
    in the 6G era. â¢ CAV applications driven by future networks will need reliable
    support for real-time operations. Providing such time-critical services with non-stop
    availability will be challenging with centralized management because it is prone
    to single-point-of-failure and is costly [266]. â¢ CAV applications require AI/ML/FL
    techniques to support the intelligent processing of big data. However, sharing
    of data for training purposes or sharing of locally trained models for global
    optimization may encounter security breaches [267]. â¢ CAVs will give rise to a
    new range of services like optimized ride-sharing, trusted payments, automatic
    insurance renewal and claim settlement, smart parking, and location-specific personalized
    services. Security aspects like authentication, integrity, privacy, and trustworthiness
    must remain intact for these services-related CAVs [268]. 6.4.2. Role of blockchain
    Blockchain is envisaged to play a substantial role in enabling CAV applications
    of future 6G networks. Authors in [269] have surveyed the integration of Internet
    of Vehicles (IoV) together with Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) towards
    realizing CAV. Accordingly, blockchain is capable of providing decentralized operation
    and management, peer-to-peer trading [270], improving system performance, and
    high trust, security, and privacy in CAV applications. Blockchain and smart contracts
    have the potential to offer data protection management for secure and safe driving.
    In this context, [271] presents a framework incorporating consortium blockchain
    with AI named Blockchain-enabled intElligent Safe-driving as-sessmenT (BEST) towards
    enabling safe-driving while ensuring the security of vehicle information and other
    data in CAVs. This method utilizes blockchain as a distributed data management
    platform to ensure the trust as data are immutable and transparent to the users.
    The consensus method used in this system is byzantine fault tolerance-based delegated
    proof-of-stake (BFT-DPoS). In this, BFT is added as an extra layer to DPoS to
    further ensure the robustness and validity while minimizing the consensus delay.
    However, challenges such as resource limitations in CAVs, vehicles not willing
    to actively share their information, and adapting to highly dynamic road conditions
    remain yet to be addressed. Blockchain can enable a new range of services emerging
    from CAVs like ride-sharing, trusted payments, automatic insurance renewal and
    claim settlement, smart parking, and location-specific services. Rathee et al.
    [272] presented a framework using blockchain towards securing CAVs and providing
    Connected Vehicles as a Service (CVaaS). This framework enables confidentiality
    and transparency among various parties (e.g., customers and vehicle owners) using
    blockchain to extract information from IoT devices and store records securely
    and transparently. All the records related to documenting, controlling and monitoring
    are securely stored in a blockchain ensuring that any alteration, deletion or
    compromise of IoT device is identified in an efficient and timely manner. However,
    this system needs to harness efficient AI/ML capabilities towards enhancing system
    intelligence. Another work presented in [273] presents a Blockchain based Framework
    for Auto-insurance Claim and Adjudication (B-FICA) for CAVs. B-FICA provides an
    access control mechanism using partitions to prevent unauthorized access evidence
    while protecting evidence from alteration through dynamic validation. This method
    uses permissioned blockchain together with multi-signed transactions as a proof
    of interaction-execution method. Also, block validation plus dynamic, lightweight
    consensus mechanism enables updating the data states while ensuring data security
    against any alteration. Furthermore, proof of interaction-execution also ensures
    non-repudiation while facilitating investigations of insurance claims. Blockchain
    has the capacity to enable energy trading among the CAVs and between the CAVs
    and electricity charging service providers. For instance, Zhao et al. [270] put
    forward a blockchain and smart contract based decentralized architecture for trading
    electricity among autonomous Electric Vehicles (EVs) since they are equipped with
    bidirectional charging points. Their proposed solution comprises conceptually
    three entities; supplier EV that will discharge, consumer EV that will charge,
    and Road Side Units (RSUs). The authors used permissioned blockchain which is
    maintained at the RSUs. The system allows automated negotiation between supplier
    and consumer vehicles based on the trust values of EVs, economic status of consumer
    EV, and demand/supply parameters exchanged between consumer and suppliers. Such
    a kind of decentralized P2P energy trading among EVs can have numerous advantages
    like decreasing charging queues during peak hours, reducing energy loss by trading
    surplus energy and earning immediate economic rewards of selling energy. Nevertheless,
    testing and formal verification of such solutions are required before they can
    be entrusted. As an instance of blockchain-enabled automated energy trading between
    electric CAVs and electricity charging service providers, Gabay et al. [274] proposed
    a framework for charging EVs, including authentication and scheduling. In particular,
    the authors made integrated use of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument
    of Knowledge (zkSNARKs), blockchain, and smart contracts to enable privacy-protected
    authentication and charging process. Their implementation setup made use of Zokrates
    for zkSNARKs and Ethereum test network Ropsten for deploying smart contracts.
    6.4.3. Summary Blockchain has unique capabilities to support 6G-enabled CAV applications
    in future communication networks. Specifically, it will enable automation through
    smart contracts, decentralized management, transparent P2P electricity trading,
    new services based on CAVs, and privacy protection. However, there are still some
    challenges like improving scalability, minimizing latency, overcoming resource
    constraints in CAVs, and effectively integrating edge intelligence capabilities
    with CAVs, which are to be addressed. 6.5. Energy Internet Energy Internet (EI)
    or Smart Grid 2.0 is the evolution of Smart Grid, which enables the integration
    of heterogeneous energy sources and energy storage systems that can be monitored
    and controlled using communication networks [57]. EI is also visualized to be
    a key application realized through the capabilities of future 6G communication
    networks [1]. Multiple decentralized and self-operating electric charging points
    need to be placed to facilitate the charging of autonomous vehicles, unmanned
    aerial vehicles, and self-operating robots [275]. Distributed energy sources that
    can be in the form of solar power generators, and wind power generators in households
    or commercial entities, will contribute to the smart grid to cater to the substantial
    energy demands of nearby devices [276]. Using such distributed energy sources
    would reduce the losses incurred during power transmission and increase the power
    quality of the consumer. Having more renewable energy resources and minimizing
    the losses will also minimize the carbon footprint. Energy markets will facilitate
    the trade and supply of energy generated using various sources using wholesale
    peer-to-peer energy trading platforms [277]. Cryptocurrencies and energy tokens
    will be used in these energy marketplaces to perform secure and transparent transactions.
    6.5.1. Key challenges Some of the key challenges that should be addressed to deploy
    EI in the future are as follows. â¢ The existing centralized business model will
    suffer scalability and management issues when used for renewable energy sources,
    which are distributed in nature [278]. Thus, EI requires an open and decentralized
    marketplace for future energy businesses. â¢ EI will encounter growing number of
    stakeholders in terms of suppliers and consumers, and they will be varying in
    real-time. Thus, for such dynamic (at times ephemeral) energy trading developing
    a complete automated system will be challenging but essential. â¢ Security and
    privacy of EI, if not instilled precisely, will result in stealing of energy,
    unavailability of services, leakage of sensitive information, and damages to costly
    equipment and appliances. â¢ Measures of energy sharing amongst various IoT devices,
    including EVs should be facilitated. 6.5.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain is envisioned
    to play a cardinal role in enabling EI through future communication networks.
    For instance, a study on how blockchain will enable future smart grid applications
    is presented in [279]. Blockchain facilitates decentralized smart grid management
    while ensuring security privacy and trust in the EI. One of the blockchain applications
    in EI is Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) that enables energy suppliers
    and consumers to interact with each other. Smart meters can send time-stamped
    records to create a new block in the distributed ledger once a transaction happens.
    Also, edge intelligence capabilities combined with blockchain can strengthen energy
    security in EI. Similar other applications include decentralized energy trading,
    open marketplaces, and monitoring, measuring and controlling the grid. Nevertheless,
    issues including less number of transactions per second, and prevailing security
    and privacy vulnerabilities in blockchain should see developments towards realizing
    blockchain-enabled EI. Furthermore, [280] proposes the use of a blockchain based
    marketplace as a business model archetype for the energy trading industry. This
    can function without the requirement of an orchestrator and will lead towards
    providing full autonomy to the energy market stakeholders. Authors introduce a
    system-oriented architectural insight in to the structure and management resulting
    in a orchestrator-led energy market that is capable of decentralizing the peer-to-peer
    energy market realized banking on blockchain. Furthermore, a decentralized access
    control mechanism using blockchain for smart grids is presented in [281]. This
    method operates without the involvement of a trusted third party and is capable
    of bringing data from service providers from smart meters. Each block in the private
    blockchain is verified using a leader selection process in the network. The leader
    runs the consensus algorithm in order to validate blocks by peer nodes using PBFT.
    Also, the encryption algorithm used to encrypt transactions is ECC. Khalid et
    al. [282] proposed blockchain to perform load balancing in decentralized hybrid
    P2P energy trading market for Smart Grids. Their work intends to minimize cost
    and electricity peak to average ratio. Khalid et al. [282] proposed blockchain
    to perform load balancing in decentralized hybrid P2P energy trading market for
    Smart Grids. Their work intends to minimize cost and electricity peak to average
    ratio. The proposed solution for the energy trading market is fully decentralized
    allowing members to trade energy with each other without the involvement of a
    third party. Smart contracts are utilized to impose the rules and regulations
    related to energy trading. Three smart contracts are presented towards implementing
    the hybrid energy trading market. They are the main smart contract (to perform
    user registration and data storage), peer-to-peer smart contract, and prosumer-2-grid
    smart contract. Another application of blockchain, as presented in [283], is to
    realize secure and distributed power transfer in UAV networks. More specifically,
    the authors proposed a blockchain-enabled UAV-assisted wireless power transfer
    framework named aerial-ground chain to charge low-power smart devices. In particular,
    their framework utilizes consortium blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
    Energy micro-transactions are verified by UAVs through heterogeneous consensus,
    where a cumulative weight based consensus mechanism is utilized in aerial nodes
    while the ground nodes use a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus scheme.
    The time-out for energy micro-transactions is confirmed through access points
    utilizing consortium blockchain. Also, this method develops a resource cooperation
    mechanism to motivate UAVs to take part in wireless power transfer actively. Access
    points that contribute to verify micro-transactions cooperatively are also incentivized.
    Payments are made through energy tokens, a new cryptocurrency that is managed
    and stored by wallets of participating nodes. 6.5.3. Summary Blockchain is recognized
    as a key enabler of EI or Smart Grid 2.0 applications in future communication
    networks. Blockchain combined with smart contracts enables many EI features, including
    decentralized grid management and autonomous operations, secure logging of smart
    meter readings, transaction verification, decentralized marketplace for energy
    trading, and enhanced security, privacy, and trust. Further research and development
    work in improving blockchain scalability, transaction speed, and addressing blockchain-related
    security and privacy issues will be instrumental in realizing EI applications
    through future communication networks. Moreover, establishing blockchain-based
    large-scale infrastructure for energy with well-defined APIs can accelerate the
    development in the EI sector. Table 9. Role of blockchain for 6G use cases with
    expected operational parameters and potential platforms (see [284], [285], [286],
    [287], [288], [289], [290], [291], [292], [293], [294], [295], [296], [297], [298],
    [299], [300], [301]). Table 10. Mapping deployment challenges to 6G technical
    aspects and 6G applications and use cases ([302], [303], [304], [305]). 6.6. Other
    use cases 6.6.1. Extended reality Extended reality (XR) is another use case visualized
    with 6G. In particular, XR is expected to harness the extremely highly reliable
    connectivity, massive data rate, and ultra-low latency offered by 6G networks
    [306], [307], [308]. XR incorporates AR, MR and VR to a wide range of applications,
    ranging from smart healthcare, education, haptics, CAVs, to BrainâComputer Interfaces
    (BCI) [35]. Moreover, XR-enabled applications are expected to revolutionize manufacturing
    by providing new methods for designing, prototyping, marketing, and maintenance
    [309], [310]. Blockchain integrated 6G networks will be instrumental in facilitating
    XR applications. For instance, blockchain can offer its subscribers to enjoy live
    events (e.g., music, sports, interactive games) with a fully immersive and virtual
    experience. Such offering can be a part of a subscription as a value-added service
    or can be purchased explicitly. In either case, blockchain can be utilized for
    creating a marketplace for virtual experience [299]. Moreover, blockchain can
    resolve the issue of incorrect file formats, which arises with the increasing
    use of VR/AR applications in heterogeneous domains [299]. Authors in [311] propose
    blockchain-powered 6G-enabled Information-Centric massive Internet of Things (ICmIoT)
    for Ubiquitous VR/AR services. In particular, they utilize permissioned blockchain
    and introduce a new consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Cache-Offloading (PoCO).
    In general, the intrinsic security features of blockchain with decentralized nature
    can provide security and privacy to XR applications. However, blockchain technology
    is expected to evolve, specifically by minimizing the processing delay and scalability
    towards facilitating XR applications in 6G communication networks. 6.6.2. Holographic
    telepresence (teleportation) The growth of extended reality applications together
    with ultra-reliable, high throughput, and extremely low latency communication
    networks in 6G will enable holographic teleportation [312]. Holographic teleportation
    is expected to teleport users to a computerized virtual environment that resembles
    the real world to create a sense of presence while collaborating with others in
    virtual spaces [313]. It is expected that a plethora of new services based on
    fully immersive holographic experiences will be introduced with the dawn of holographic
    communication, such as virtual schools and universities, virtual tourism, and
    virtual sports and activities [232]. The use of blockchain can help the realization
    of holographic applications. For instance, large amounts of raw data obtained
    through cameras and sensors supporting holographic communication can be processed
    efficiently using edge intelligence nodes facilitated through blockchain and smart
    contracts. Higher data rates in the wireless access network or wireless backhaul
    could also be achieved by minimizing interference related issues using blockchain
    based spectrum sharing [314]. Network security and user privacy can be ensured
    owing to the inherent security features of blockchain. Faster processing, scalability,
    and blockchain security and privacy need further research to realize holographic
    telepresence applications utilizing blockchain-based 6G networks. 6.6.3. Smart
    cities Smart cities are envisaged to cater to the requirements of over 70% of
    the world population by the year 2050 [315]. Moreover, these requirements are
    expected to be diverse and complex in the future. Thus, the future smart cities
    are to be equipped with modern information and communication infrastructure [316].
    Environmental pollution, energy management, traffic management, and disaster management
    are a few of the applications of ICT tools in future smart cities. These will
    be facilitated through heterogeneous IoT devices and sensors towards IoE. The
    Big Data extracted through these IoT devices need to be analyzed using advanced
    learning techniques to obtain insights on city planning and city development activities
    [317]. Blockchain is considered to be an enabling technology of smart cities.
    One of the major blockchain applications towards smart cities is to ensure information
    security and privacy [318]. Blockchain also offers enhanced fault tolerance, better
    reliability, and scalability. Furthermore, blockchain is instrumental in weaving
    a communication platform that can connect a large number of heterogeneous and
    distributed IoT devices and sensors in a smart city environment. For instance,
    the authors in [319] present a hybrid network architecture combining Software
    Defined Networking (SDN) and blockchain. This architecture consists of a core
    network and an edge network to enable distributed networking applications. In
    addition, a blockchain-based vehicle network architecture for smart cities, named
    Block-VN, is presented in [320]. This architecture facilitates reliable, secure,
    and distributed functioning of vehicle networks. However, scalability in terms
    of transactions per second and storage turns out to be a bottleneck to use blockchain
    for 6G-enabled smart cities. 6.6.4. Digital twins The underpinning of 6G will
    support an effective realization of DTs which is an emerging paradigm for smart
    industries, smart cities and smart healthcare facilities [321]. The concept of
    DTs is about creating an exact digital replica of any physical entity or process
    in a computerized virtual world. Thus, any given physical entity (either living
    or non-living) has existence in both the physical world and the virtual world.
    These replicas in physical and virtual worlds are called as DTs and they enable
    tight integration via seamless exchange of relevant data between themselves [322],
    [323]. Systems based on DTs have huge potential in the field of manufacturing,
    healthcare, aviation, and smart cities [323], [324]. In particular, DTs has potential
    to enable 3D visualization and simulations, virtual testing, predictive maintenance,
    and various type of analytics (descriptive, predictive and prescriptive) which
    pave the way for 6G-enabled industrial applications [322], [324]. Despite the
    myriad of advantages, an important challenge to successfully realize DTs is to
    ensure security, privacy, transparency, and trust while communicating and exchanging
    data between physical and virtual twins as well as with surrounding environment
    and external parties involved. In this direction, Yaqoob et al. [322] identified
    various alleviating roles of blockchain for DTs such as decentralized and tamper-persistent
    data exchanges, providing DTsâ proof of legitimacy and identities, tight access
    control based on smart contracts and strict adherence to distributed policies
    and ensuring transparent tracking and accountability. For industrial manufacturing
    use case, Zhang et al. [325] proposed the use of permissioned blockchain while
    considering a digital twin manufacturing cell scenario. In particular, authors
    implemented a prototype of a Manufacturing Blockchain of Things (MBCoT) architecture
    using hyperledger fabric and demonstrate that their solution can achieve high
    throughput and low latency while being secure and traceable. Putz et al. [326]
    developed a Decentralized Application (DApp) using Ethereum blockchain and off-chain
    data storage. However, simulation data is used for the experiments. 7. Deployment
    challenges Despite the advantages that blockchain can bring to the 6G realm, there
    are challenges that will be encountered, and thus, must be investigated to harness
    the maximum potential of blockchain in 6G. This section expounds on various deployment
    challenges, their importance to the 6G ecosystem, and possible solutions to mitigate
    them. Towards the end of this section, Table 10 maps the deployment challenges
    to the 6G technical aspects and 6G applications. 7.1. Scalability (data) - Throughput
    and storage For blockchainized systems, scalability in terms of throughput and
    storage is still challenging. Throughput indicates the number of transactions
    being successfully processed per unit time. The increasing size of the ledger
    highlights the need for higher storage capacity at all the full nodes in the blockchain
    network. Throughput depends on numerous factors such as hardware capacity, network
    latency, block size, size of the ledger, size of the P2P blockchain network, and
    complexity of both the cryptographic techniques and the smart contracts used.
    In general, due to the restriction on the maximum size of a block, the time required
    to perform transaction validation, and establishing consensus, the throughput
    of blockchainized systems is less than conventional centralized systems. 7.1.1.
    Importance in context of 6G Since 6G will cater to a new range of applications
    and use cases that demand ultra-high data rate (Tbps) and extremely high connection
    density, high throughput and efficient storage requirements are a must for successful
    use of blockchain in the 6G realm. Furthermore, with the open business 6G ecosystem,
    an increasing number of stakeholders (of all sizes) will participate, which will
    lead to a high access rate and, at the same time, would require higher storage
    capacity to maintain logs of their activities. 7.1.2. Possible solutions A variety
    of solutions have been explored to improve the scalability of blockchainized systems.
    To improve the throughput solutions like sharding [327] (for processing and storing),
    multiple blocks per leader [328], Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Payment Channel
    Network (PCN) [329]. Compared to traditional systems, the difference in throughput
    of blockchainized systems is significantly large for the public permissionless
    type of blockchain. Thus, the use of private permissioned (or consortium) type
    blockchain can narrow down the difference in the performance (throughput), making
    blockchain suitable for 6G networks. Solutions such as off-chain storage, block
    (data) compression, sidechain, and hierarchical blockchain are being explored
    to deal with storage scalability [330]. Interestingly, emerging multi-peer permissioned
    blockchains leveraging microservice-based architecture (such as Rahasak [331]
    and Mystiko [332]) have the potential to meet high scalability demands of 6G ecosystem.
    Instead of conventional full node data replication which is resource inefficient
    and increases latency, Rahasak carries out limited data replication using sharding
    algorithm. Moreover, actor-based smart contracts âAplosâ [333] can enable concurrent
    execution of transactions by executing a given transaction only once at one of
    the blockchain peers. 7.2. Measure of decentrality Decentralization fundamentally
    refers to a property of a system that ensures that every user has equal control
    over the system; hence no single user or a group of users could control a systemâs
    assets or impose changes that other users do not consent to [334]. Hence, decentralization
    removes the dependency on a central authority by increasing the number of decision-makers
    [335]. This is a key requirement for blockchainized 6G networks. However, the
    measure of decentrality in those systems is a challenge. 7.2.1. Importance in
    context of 6G For security in 6G, this property needs to be maintained for any
    blockchain-based solution. A blockchainized system itself needs to be inspected
    carefully for properties, including decentrality and verified/validated operation.
    As blockchain is supposed to provide decentralized means of trust among untrusted
    users by withstanding a large number of fake identities in a peer-to-peer network-based
    system and prohibiting them from gaining higher influence, decentralization is
    an important requirement in that regard. 7.2.2. Possible solutions The authors
    in [336] identify the emergence of centrality in the governance, network, and
    storage layers of blockchain-based systems. Subsequently, they presented various
    metrics to measure decentrality in respective layers. In particular, metrics such
    as Gini coefficient, entropy, Euclidean distance, and Minkowski distance are used
    to measure decentrality in the governance layer. Similarly, degree centrality,
    betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality metrics are used to measure decentrality
    in the network layer. For the storage layer, the distribution index is used, which
    measures the extent to which the information is stored in a distributed way. Baran
    et al. discussed the importance of measuring these properties in centralized,
    decentralized and distributed systems in [337]. Buterin discussed the meaning
    of decentrality in a blockchain system [338]. In [334], an entropy method from
    information theory is proposed to quantify the decentralization of blockchains.
    Using this technique, the discrete degrees of blocks mined and address balances
    are calculated to quantify the degrees of decentralization for Bitcoin and Ethereum
    systems. In [339], the authors define a new metric centralization level where
    a blockchain is N Ïµ centralized if the top N nodes perform more than 1 â Ïµ fraction
    of transactions. Given the same Ïµ , a blockchain is more centralized if it has
    a smaller N . In blockchainized 6G, such a decentrality measurement and monitoring
    system should be a part of the general security architecture to ensure proper
    operation of network functions. However, how that integration will be achieved
    in that multi-party and large-scale system is still an open question. 7.3. Security
    and privacy Although blockchain is identified as an enabling technology to tackle
    security and privacy issues in the networking and telecommunication industry,
    using blockchain itself may create security and privacy issues making this a double-edged
    sword. In particular, the transparency of the records and transactions in the
    blockchain may create potential privacy breaches with in the network. Each transaction
    in the blockchain is signed using asymmetric keys and a list of several transactions
    joins together to form a block. Each block contains a hash pointer of the previous
    block and a hash of the listed transactions. This makes the transactions or the
    blocks immutable and secure. However, this will no longer be secure with a powerful
    adversary capable of breaking the cryptographic materials. In addition to that,
    several other security attacks related to blockchain have been identified, e.g.,
    majority 51% attack, double-spending attacks, re-entrancy attack, sybil attacks,
    authentication access control attacks, security misconfigurations, and privacy
    attacks. 7.3.1. Importance in context of 6G There are many potential scenarios
    in 6G that can be secured by blockchain, such as advancing spectrum sharing security,
    eliminating tampering of the lease records, and assuring trust among market players.
    However, how the blockchain can be protected from many security threats, including
    Sybil attacks and privacy leakages, are yet to be addressed. In the long run,
    6G is expected to use the devices in the post-quantum era with higher processing
    capability. Therefore, it is highly likely that the security and privacy solutions
    developing with the current blockchain technology will be no longer safe for quantum-based
    security threats. The combined use of AI/ML and blockchain will also create additional
    security threats while protecting the integrity of AI data which are shared among
    different stakeholders. 7.3.2. Possible solutions It is clear enough that when
    the blockchain-based security solutions are adopted in 6G networks, it is necessary
    to design possible mechanisms to mitigate the blockchain-specific security threat.
    The introduction of post-quantum cryptography to the blockchain and the use of
    quantum key management schemes may make the blockchain-based security solutions
    quantum-safe in 6G. When the adversaries become unconquerable with the quantum
    level powers, the existing public-key encryption and signature schemes will no
    longer provide secure connectivity. The security of quantum cryptography can be
    proven mathematically without imposing any restrictions on the abilities of an
    eavesdropper. The longer symmetric key derived and distributed by quantum cryptographic
    approaches will ensure the lifetime security of many schemes and digital systems.
    Therefore, a gradual shift to quantum-resistant cryptography will be necessary
    for blockchain technology. Another possible solution, to prevent security attacks
    and threats related to miners, is to model, verify and ensure correctness of secure
    and trustworthy blockchain-based systems. The security of the consensus protocol
    will be ensured by formally specifying security properties such as persistence,
    liveness, safety, fault tolerance and fraud resilience. Similarly, the trust of
    the consensus protocol shall be assured by formally defining trust properties,
    i.e., miner and verifier trust to prevent their malicious behaviors [340]. For
    such verification and assurance goals in blockchain-based systems, formal methods
    can be used [341]. In particular, model checking can be used for the formal verification
    of the consensus protocol as it successfully uncovers errors in the model in the
    form of counter examples [342]. In detail, formal specification language, such
    as, Communicating Sequential Processes can be used to formally specify the consensus
    protocol. Subsequently, the correctness of the protocol will be verified using
    formal verification tools, such as, Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) model checker
    [343]. However, the appropriate modeling and verification techniques are still
    open research questions for blockchains in large-scale systems like 6G networks.
    7.4. Consensus algorithms The consensus algorithm plays a vital role in running
    the blockchain system. Different types of consensus algorithms are developed and
    used in different applications. However, most general purpose consensus algorithms
    such as PoW are not optimal for mobile networks and the associated service. Specially,
    the direct utilization of generic consensus algorithms of well-known blockchains
    in pre-6G telecommunication networks had several negative impacts such as high
    operational cost and extended latency [344], [345]. For example, PoW like consensus
    algorithms are highly computationally intensive, and it is very costly to operate
    mining nodes. Moreover, a considerable amount of energy gets wasted just to perform
    some cryptography operations that have no benefits other than selecting the winning
    node. 7.4.1. Importance in context of 6G The greening of networks is a fundamental
    driver for the design and implementation of future networks, including 6G as evidenced
    by the recent regulatory and policy developments [346]. However, blockchain will
    be a big challenge against this goal due to its computationally intensive and
    high-energy consuming consensus algorithms. Moreover, with the positive development
    of quantum computing, 6G networks may have to address the issues related to the
    post-quantum era. Specially, most of the existing contemporary cryptographic mechanisms
    used in current consensus algorithms (e.g., PoW currently utilized hash scheme
    such as like SHA256 or KECCAK256 [347], [348]) can be easily breakable with quantum
    computing. Thus, using such legacy computation-oriented and energy-intensive consensus
    algorithms may not be possible in 6G networks, especially for ELPC use cases.
    7.4.2. Possible solutions To mitigate the above challenges, new custom-made consensus
    algorithms for 6G should be developed. For instance, a quantum-safe consensus
    algorithm can be designed by focusing on randomness than computational difficulty
    [349]. As a wireless communication medium, 6G networks will also consist of a
    variety of random data sources. For instance, wireless channel state information,
    user traffic and mobility patterns, and interference level are possible sources
    with random nature. Such sources can be used to design consensus algorithms. Moreover,
    6G specific consensus algorithms can be designed in a way that miners have to
    focus on useful tasks such as spectrum sensing, abnormality detection, and traffic
    pattern analysis than meaningless cryptography operations such as hash value calculations
    [137]. That will also eliminate the extra energy use and wastage to run consensus
    algorithms. 7.5. Standards, policies and legal issues As an emerging technology
    for various use cases including future networks, blockchain is still in its infancy
    terms of standardization and regulations. The popularity of cryptocurrencies and
    various pitfalls and negative incidents have also painted blockchain as a high-risky
    technology in public perception. Therefore, to reap the benefits of the standardization
    and help the stakeholders, community-driven standardization and well-informed
    blockchain regulations are crucial. These regulations should also foster the blockchainâs
    role in addressing various challenges to fulfill potential impact on future 6G
    systems. 7.5.1. Importance in the context of 6G The integration of blockchain
    into 6G networks will require well-defined and industry-approved standards. The
    6G infrastructure is supposed to be multi-X (multi-vendor, multi-technology and
    multi-domain) network of networks. Moreover, telecommunication networks are tightly
    regulated for a service-level agreement based user experience and service quality.
    From a practical point of view, interoperability and clear guidelines on how to
    use blockchain in network infrastructure and use cases are crucial. To realize
    their key benefits in digital infrastructure including 6G networks, blockchains
    should be interoperable between themselves and with incumbent systems in other
    domains [350]. Moreover, high-gain use cases should be identified and addressed
    first to boost the blockchainâs role in 6G networks. 7.5.2. Possible solutions
    ETSI Industry Specification Group (ISG) Permissioned Distributed Ledger (PDL)
    is actively working on the foundations for the operation of permissioned distributed
    ledgers to improve the trust and dependability of digital services supported by
    global and open telecommunications networks [305]. They have developed a reference
    architecture framework specification and published it as ETSI GS PDL 012 in May
    2022 [351]. As an industry organization of mobile operators, GSMA has already
    developed âGSMA eBusiness Networkâ, a new private-permissioned industry-wide blockchain
    network, focusing on the wholesale roaming clearing and settlement process as
    the first application [352]. Similarly, ITU SG3 working on tariff and accounting
    principles and international telecommunication/ICT economic and policy issues
    has an active work item on usage of DLT to handle accounting, policy, regulatory
    and economic issues in the international telco/ICT domain [353]. Such solutions
    will be more important with the pervasive 6G user experience, which should be
    seamless across different serving networks and minimize roaming overhead among
    service providers. ITU SG13 on future networks and emerging network technologies
    is developing recommendations on requirements and architecture for network resource
    sharing including site-sharing and RAN-sharing [354]. NIST Blockchain group has
    been investigating blockchain technologies at multiple levels ranging from use
    cases to protocols, security guarantees, and cryptographic mechanisms [355]. The
    fundamental contributions from this standardization organization may provide input
    to 6G networks in terms of blockchain design, interoperability and access control.
    ISO Technical Committee ISO/TC 307 Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies
    has been actively developing widely-applicable standards on various aspects including
    use cases, interoperability and security of blockchain and DLT [356]. These fundamental
    standards are all currently under development and will be important not just for
    future 6G networks, but for ICT systems in general. Regarding oversight and policy
    making, policymakers could provide two-pronged contribution to the use of blockchain
    in digital infrastructure such as 6G networks: to clarify existing oversight mechanisms,
    including regulations, or create new mechanisms to ensure appropriate oversight
    of blockchain applications [357]. They should identify legal actors and responsibilities
    in a well-defined framework and establish accountability for relevant stakeholders.
    In that regard, an important effort is by EU: It has a strategy on blockchain
    aiming to build a pan-European public services blockchain while promoting legal
    certainty and increasing funding for research and innovation [350]. Overall, these
    activities will have a profound impact on how blockchain can be integrated in
    future networks and exploited for realizing the envisaged benefits. 7.6. Interoperability
    The existing blockchain ecosystem incorporates multiple blockchain platforms.
    However, these platforms are not fully compatible with each other. One of the
    main reasons for this phenomenon is the lack of governance of various blockchain
    platforms through protocols and standards, especially in the case of communication
    networks. However, this may give rise to interoperability issues with multiple
    blockchain platforms envisaged in future 6G communication networks. Presently,
    functions such as sending tokens, authentication, executing smart contracts, and
    validating data are not possible among multiple blockchain systems [358]. Such
    issues should be resolved to realize blockchain/DLT as an integral part of future
    communication networks. 7.6.1. Importance in context of 6G The envisaged blockchain-based
    6G networks demand the seamless integration and operation of multiple blockchain
    platforms. For instance, smart contracts are expected to execute seamlessly regardless
    of the platform to enable the automation of many 6G features. Also, umMTC requires
    support for scalability via distributed control, universal identity management,
    and automatic authentication and access control irrespective of the platform used.
    Moreover, network security through security orchestration and automation, and
    privacy measures through DApps should operate flawlessly across multiple blockchain
    platforms that are envisaged with blockchainized 6G. Therefore, enabling seamless
    interoperability among multiple blockchain platforms is essential towards realizing
    blockchainized 6G networks. 7.6.2. Possible solutions Establishing interoperability
    among multiple blockchain platforms has been explored in several research and
    development work. A trustless cryptocurrency exchange in terms of atomic cross-chain
    swaps to allow different cryptocurrencies to swap assets was presented in [359].
    However, to ensure that no assets are destroyed in case of atomic swaps, cross-blockchain
    tokens can be used to hold assets in any required blockchain. Furthermore, a secure
    cross-platform token transfer mechanism and inter-blockchain communication protocols
    are developed, facilitating the incompatibility of consensus mechanisms, hash
    algorithms, smart contract interactions, and data exchanges. In addition, interoperability
    issues across blockchain systems can also be solved using blockchain gates [358],
    [359]. Also, ETSI is developing interoperability guidelines while Ethereum and
    Hyperledger are also taking measures to minimize the issues raised due to blockchain
    interoperability [303], [304], [360]. 8. Lessons learned and future research directions
    This section discusses the lessons learned, and based on these lessons, synthesizes
    the future research directions that can pave the way for a profitable blockchain
    integrated 6G ecosystem. 8.1. 6G requirements 8.1.1. Lessons learned Blockchain
    related works from the 6G requirements perspective lead to the following lessons
    learned: Extreme Data Rate: Blockchain-based optimized resource management has
    the potential to achieve extremely high data rates requirement for 6G. Its use
    is particularly beneficial for flat network structures with less centralized control.
    Moreover, the required cooperative nature of 6G RAN can be realized using blockchain
    [361]. Extreme Reliability: Despite the tangible security gains via the encryption
    and digital signature enabled by blockchain integration into IoT for extreme reliability,
    security is still a key concern in such systems due to potential vulnerabilities
    of blockchain-integrated IoT systems [362]. Extreme Connectivity: A promising
    approach to enable massive connectivity is to use heterogeneous and multi-tiered
    networks such as integrated aerial and terrestrial networks [363]. To this end,
    blockchain can enable extreme connectivity by helping multi-mode connectivity
    in heterogeneous networks. The openness of permissionless systems provides more
    degrees of cooperation among different RAN elements of a 6G network to boost capability
    for ubiquitous coverage. For instance, blockchain can support extreme coverage
    by operating network clusters with intermittent connectivity where it can be used
    to manage the operations within the cluster [364]. However, such systems are more
    complex and may require more advanced security measures. Thus, a trade-off exists
    between the openness of a blockchain system for expanding coverage versus the
    complexity and security issues. Extreme Sensing: The current goal of supporting
    small-packet and sensing-based URLLC services in 5G systems will be challenged
    and disrupted for an entirely new degree of massive connectivity. This level of
    connectivity requires blockchains to enable ultra massive sensing applications
    in 6G. 8.1.2. Future directions Some of the important research directions on how
    to better utilize the blockchain to address 6G requirements are as follows: â¢
    Position-based optimization: Accurate indoor positioning is vital for capacity
    management since the location of users and devices provide crucial inputs for
    optimization. However, positioning accuracy and reliability are boosted with cooperative
    techniques. For instance, blockchain is used to enable a crowdsourced indoor navigation
    system in [27]. In that regard, how to develop blockchain driven data sharing
    among disparate entities in the network infrastructure is an important research
    direction for 6G networks. â¢ Roaming frauds in 3D networks: Already, secure and
    transparent roaming against frauds is a big challenge in current networks. Moreover,
    roaming in 6G networks will become more complicated due to the existence of 3D
    networks and their roaming requirements [98]. Therefore, efficient integration
    of blockchain for 3D roaming frauds involving heterogeneous networks is an interesting
    research question. â¢ Trustless sharing ecosystem: Pragmatic blockchain-driven
    mechanisms for âX-sharingâ for capacity maximization and efficiency is a promising
    research direction. â¢ Blockchain for heterogeneous networks: Though blockchain
    is considered as a promising solution for data sharing and distributed control
    for network monitoring and management in the 6G ecosystem comprising of heterogeneous
    networks. Nonetheless, an important research question is how to control latency
    overhead due to blockchain integration in these disparate and physically distant
    networks in 6G ecosystem. Multi-peer blockchain clusters [331] and dockerized
    micro-services [333] turns out to be proposing solutions to effectively implement
    scalable and trustless mobile network of heterogeneous networks. â¢ Management
    of blockchain-based solutions for decoupling eURLLC verticals in case of hazards/risks:
    The concept of blockchain is inherently promising for cooperation and sharing
    among 6G verticals. However, the drawback can be the strong coupling among different
    verticals, a situation which may sporadically impair the latency performance of
    various verticals in case of malicious events or security incidents occur in an
    eURLLC vertical [94]. Therefore, management schemes and modular approach in such
    malfunctions and performance issues form an important research direction. â¢ Fundamental
    limits on the applicability of blockchain to eURLLC: A fundamental research question
    to explore is the theoretical limits of blockchain schemes with respect to their
    applicability to various eURLLC applications. Such research can shed light on
    what the valid and invalid vertical scenarios are for the blockchain in the eURLLC
    regime. Moreover, use of multi-peer permissioned blockchains has potential to
    push the performance limitations of conventional peer-to-peer monolithic blockchains
    [331]. â¢ Rigorous testing of 6G consensus algorithms: While the design of energy-efficient
    and secure consensus algorithms is already an active research topic from a 6G
    perceptive, the developed solutions still need to be thoroughly tested at large
    scale test networks and accordingly may need further improvements. 8.2. 6G technical
    aspects 8.2.1. 3D networking Following are the lessons learned and future research
    directions for using blockchain for 3D networking in 6G. Lessons Learned: With
    the emergence of altitude as a third dimension and the proliferation of flying
    technologies (particularly UAVs and LEOs), the next-generation mobile networks
    aim to extend radio footprints both horizontally and vertically. This implies
    ultra-tight integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks in 6G era
    which will offer a multitude of benefits including global coverage. Nevertheless,
    3D networking will give rise to new challenges such as automated and trustless
    interoperability, privacy-protected and decentralized data exchanges, secure control
    plane functionalities, avoiding air-collisions of ABSs, and automated decision
    making. In this context, blockchain has been considered to mitigate these challenges,
    thanks to its intrinsic features. Future Directions: To overcome the downside
    of using blockchain for 3D networks, which are high latency, large storage facility,
    significant computational and communication overheads, researchers have proposed
    a wide range of solutions, including multichain, modified structure of the block,
    and mix of resourceful and resource-constrained ABSs. However, experimental testing
    using real-world mobile network test-beds is still missing. Also, issues like
    flexible interoperability between heterogeneous (decentralized) networks, lightweight
    consensus mechanism, and cross-chain security and isolation among multiple blockchains
    are yet to be improved upon. 8.2.2. Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) The lessons
    learned and future research directions for using of blockchain for spectrum management
    for 6G networks are as follows. Lessons Learned: To maximize the use of the radio
    spectrum, its management in 6G should be more dynamic and real-time than static
    allocation. In this regard, DSM can improve spectrum efficiency by enabling effective
    sharing between primary (incumbent) and secondary users. Although DSM has clear
    advantages, the inherent centralized management counteracts and results in high
    administrative cost, security and privacy vulnerabilities, existence of centralized
    entities for spectrum trading, slow process of creating spectrum sharing agreement
    and less transparency in actual spectrum usage. Moreover, using cognitive radio,
    unlicensed secondary users can maliciously access unused spectrum and mount various
    attacks. To overcome these issues, blockchain can play a cardinal role. The spectrum
    management activities where blockchain can strengthen are spectrum (auction-based)
    trading, spectrum allocations, payment settlement based on spectrum usage, and
    secure recording of all the activities involved during spectrum trading. Thanks
    to decentralized decision making and disintermediation of centralized entities,
    its use can eliminate dependency on trusted third parties such as spectrum licensees,
    band managers, and spectrum access system administrators [25]. Also, to ensure
    that the primary users are compensated for sharing their licensed bands with secondary
    users, the sharing and leasing policies can be coded into smart contracts to enforce
    the contractual agreements between parties digitally [137]. Future Directions:
    Despite numerous advantages that can be gained using blockchain technology, an
    important hurdle is the on-boarding of various entities to a blockchain-based
    decentralized and open spectrum management system. This requires proper standardized
    APIs and well-defined architectural procedures. Furthermore, privacy preservation
    must be exclusively dealt within (or outside) blockchain to ensure trade secrets
    are not leaked. The reason being a blockchain, by default, does not guarantees
    privacy. 8.2.3. Security in 6G Following are the lessons learned and future research
    directions for using blockchain to strengthen security in 6G networks. Lessons
    Learned: The envisaged massive connectivity, native-AI capabilities, complete
    network automation, heterogeneous and specialized service demands, never-seen-before
    use cases, various business entities of different scale, and blending of new technologies
    would demand pervasive security by design in a complex 6G ecosystem. Blockchain
    is an envisioned enabler for facilitating the expected pervasive security and
    trust in 6G networks as presented in Section 5.3. Future Directions: Although
    blockchain has the potential to meet security requirements for 6G networks, however,
    a blockchain-based implementation itself needs to be inspected carefully for security
    properties such as decentrality and verified operation. Specifically, the correctness
    of the consensus protocol needs to be verified as the consensus protocol is the
    backbone of every blockchain-based system. Therefore, the protocol should be clearly
    modeled, the correctness should be adequately verified, and all its desired properties
    should be validated [365]. Nevertheless, it is extremely difficult because of
    the distributed nature of blockchain. Moreover, the security of the consensus
    protocol will be ensured by formally specifying security properties such as persistence,
    liveness, safety, fault tolerance and fraud resilience. Similarly, the trust of
    the consensus protocol shall be assured by formally defining trust properties,
    i.e., miner and verifier trust to prevent their malicious behaviors [340]. 8.2.4.
    Privacy-protection in 6G The lessons learned and future research directions for
    protecting privacy in 6G using blockchain are as follows. Lessons Learned: With
    everything and every aspect of human lives getting connected in the envisioned
    6G networks, privacy will be indispensable. Typically, both data privacy and user
    privacy need to be carefully handled. Blockchain has been considered as an enabler
    for preserving privacy for 6G networks in terms of decentralized identity management,
    tight access control using well-defined smart contracts, modified/tailored block
    structure to hide sensitive information, and obfuscation intended blockchain-based
    encryption like homomorphic encryption. Future Directions: Despite the potential
    use of blockchain to preserve privacy in the 6G network, the enhanced privacy-protected
    blockchain solutions come with a performance trade-off. Hence, a balance needs
    to be maintained between the level of blockchain-based privacy and the system
    performance. Furthermore, a well-defined framework and formulation of test cases
    are required to check the level of privacy offered by blockchain-powered solutions
    in mobile networks. Also, blockchain-based experiments and testing on real testbeds
    networks need to be explored to understand better the pros and cons of rolling
    out blockchain-enhanced privacy. 8.2.5. Resource management The lessons learned
    and future research directions for using blockchain in 6G are discussed as follows.
    Lessons Learned: Efficient resource management leads to increased utilization
    efficiency, reduced cost, improved QoS, and higher revenue generation. However,
    with the ever-growing number of subscribers, connected IoE devices, and industry
    verticals, there is no wonder that resources management as a whole will be challenging
    for the 6G networks. The resources include networking, computation and storage
    resources, and these can be virtualized or made available physically. In addition
    to the massive connectivity demands, what makes resource management complicated
    is the heterogeneity and time-varying nature of demands. Hence, conventional centralized
    management is not the best match. Moreover, the availability requirement for 6G
    networks impels secure resource management against threats and attacks [25]. Blockchain
    provides visibility and memory to multiple parties regarding the current and past
    network resource conditions due to its immutable and transparent logging operation.
    Moreover, blockchain-based decentralized slice brokering offers a way to carry
    out secure resource trading between network tenants, infrastructure/resource providers,
    local network operators and mobile network operators. Such a platform can allow
    automatic trading (i.e. negotiation, leasing of resources and payment settlement)
    between unknown entities in the telecommunication ecosystem. Some of the other
    uses of blockchain in resource management are securing the life-cycle management
    of VNF (involving network operator, edge platforms, and third-party VNF providers)
    and incentivizing the sharing of nearby unused resources. Future Directions: Although
    blockchain is introduced as a solution for resource management in the future networks,
    the research is still in its infancy stage. A substantial amount of work should
    be focused on integrating blockchain-based resource management solutions in wireless
    networks and proceeding with the standardization process. As usual, the inherent
    security and privacy issues of blockchain technology need to be tackled. In a
    fully automated 6G network management architecture, resource management needs
    to be performed with higher intelligence in a very responsive manner. Monitoring
    and updating network resource availability should be performed in real-time, and
    they can be fed as inputs for intelligent resource trading. 8.2.6. Ubiquitous
    intelligence Following are the lessons learned and future research directions
    for the ubiquitous intelligence in 6G networks. Lessons Learned: Much deeper integration
    of AI at all levels of the 6G network communications is visualized with the ultimate
    goal to make our society super-smart, super-efficient and greener. In particular,
    the advantages of native-AI based 6G networks are seen at the network management
    level with complete automation in heterogeneous settings (multi-tenants, multi-operators,
    and multi-vendors), at the network service level with flexibility, customization
    and self-adaptability, and also at the application level. However, the optimized
    adoption of AI in the complex 6G ecosystem, the trustworthiness of AI/ML agents,
    the efficacy of distributed AI system, and the scalability of ubiquitous intelligence
    are the challenges. Blockchain has been found to be apt to meet these challenges.
    For instance, blockchain is capable of handling the secure exchange of training
    data for AI-driven solutions [366] and uploading of locally trained ML model in
    FL-based solutions [367]. Thus, different operators, tenants, or mobile end users
    in 6G networks can securely share their data for training or incremental updates
    of AI models as in federated learning [232]. Also, blockchain can make the decision
    process of the AI/ML methods more coherent and auditable as all the underlying
    elements on which the decisions are made can be traced back. Moreover, since blockchain
    provides a distributed database, it can protect a massive amount of data expected
    to be processed by AI in 6G, leading to enhanced security and transparent operation
    against corruption and hacking. Specially designed consensus algorithms can provide
    fault tolerance, reduced requirement of computational resources, and efficient
    and coherent learning at the same time. Furthermore, ultra-large-scale sensing
    and tracking in 6G will be well supported by blockchain. Future Directions: The
    convergence of blockchain and AI has huge potential for 6G networks, and thus
    there are many research avenues for research. Computationally light, attack immune,
    and learning-based consensus algorithms need to be developed to ascertain the
    use of blockchain for native-AI 6G networks. Another direction for successful
    integration of blockchain and AI/ML is setting up of platforms and testbeds to
    put such solutions through rigorous testing. This would require collective efforts
    from blockchain alliances and telecommunication regulatory bodies. The key challenges
    for ubiquitous intelligence in 6G have two aspects: the challenges against realizing
    ubiquitous intelligence and the challenges once intelligence is embedded in every
    layer of 6G networks (from the PHY layer functions to applications). Although
    we focus on the former, the latter is also a critical research topic and may be
    integrated with blockchain technology, e.g., how to enable flexible and secure
    resource sharing with network intelligence [95] or for trust scoring for ICN contents
    in B5G networks [96]. 8.2.7. Mobility management The lessons learned and future
    research directions for blockchain-based mobility management in the 6G network
    are discussed below. Lessons Learned: On the one hand, small cell size (due to
    the high-frequency spectrum) and 3D network will result in high mobility and a
    large number of handovers both in horizontal and vertical directions. On the other
    hand, the 6G requirements pose mobility management to happen transparently and
    with high reliability. Thus, mobility management will be a crucial technical aspect
    to achieve ultrahigh-speed with low-latency communications in the 6G era. Numerous
    key requirements for mobility management are immunity to security attacks, perfect
    forward secrecy, mutual authentication and key agreement, traceability, decentralized
    authentication facility, and immunity to roaming frauds. Blockchain has been found
    capable of resolving many of these issues. In particular, blockchain can enable
    session key confidentiality, secure authentication during handover, decentralized
    authentication server, dynamic roaming agreements, preventing roaming frauds,
    fair economic incentive policies and immunity towards numerous attacks like reply
    attack and Sybil attack. However, high storage redundancy due to the distributed
    ledger and computational overheads is the downside of using blockchain. Future
    Directions: One of the challenges to support mobility is to manage handover among
    diverse wireless technologies as different handover strategies affect the signaling
    overhead and handover delay. Even though blockchain has been found beneficial
    for secure and decentralized mobility management, there are few areas where blockchains
    role needs to be explored. For example, blockchains role for physical layer fingerprinting
    based authentication during mobility has yet to be explored. Similarly, the impact
    of blockchain to manage the resource constraint problem during handover is an
    open research topic. The existing blockchain systems have a low block throughput
    to reach a consensus about new block addition. So, ensuring higher block throughput
    in a dynamic and mobile environment is still an open research question. While
    continuous improvements are being observed from the low throughput consensus protocol,
    like PoW, to high throughput consensus protocol, like Mystiko [332], there is
    still a need for better mechanisms to achieve higher throughput to meet the 6G
    requirements. 8.3. 6G applications 8.3.1. Industrial applications in Industry
    5.0 Following are the lessons learned and future research directions for the use
    of blockchain for 6G-powered industrial applications. Lessons Learned: Future
    industrial applications in Industry 5.0 with underpinning of 6G will see machines
    and humans coming together on the same floor and working in a synergistic environment
    with close interactions. 6G-enabled integration of technologies like VR/AR/XR,
    advance robotics (in form of cobots), AI/ML techniques, and Brain Control Interface
    (BCI) will help humans to perform creative, high-level, controlled and finer tasks
    in Industry 5.0 era. Nevertheless, there are concerns like connection scalability,
    secure and privacy-protected storing and processing of generated Big data by human
    robot interaction, centralized management of on-demand cloud manufacturing, secure
    logging of trade secrets, and automated detection of copyright violation or patent
    infringements. Blockchain potentially can resolve many of these concerns as discussed
    in Section 6.1. Moreover, industrial applications that requires powerful computational
    resources can be securely offloaded to edge servers using blockchain. This significantly
    improves the performance of these applications while keeping the latency minimal.
    Furthermore, blockchains and smart contracts can also be instrumental in automating
    the agreement processes between companies and their partners or customers. Future
    Directions: In spite of promising roles the blockchain can play in Industry 5.0,
    there is need to build standard platforms where smart contracts are integrated
    with industry-scale robotic operating systems, and APIs are made available for
    wide adoption DApps in industrial environment. Moreover, blockchain-based industrial
    ecosystem can also be crippled with availability-targeting attacks such as incentive-based
    DoS attacks (e.g., Blockchain Denial-of-Service (BDoS) [368]) or non-malicious
    glitches during the operation (e.g., due to bugs [369]) [370]. Hence, the extreme
    high reliability objective requires more effort in the blockchain domain for adaptability
    and usability in IoE-enabled 6G industrial application scenarios. 8.3.2. Smart
    healthcare The lessons learned and future research directions for blockchain empowered
    smart healthcare in 6G era. Lessons Learned: 6G-powered smart healthcare ecosystem
    will revolutionize the landscape of medical services like real-time monitoring,
    intelligent preventive healthcare, early diagnosis, H2H services (i.e. mobile
    hospitals), and tele-surgeries with holographic presence of doctors. Although,
    on the one hand, the increasing digitization of healthcare activities with the
    integration of numerous technologies (e.g., IWDs, AI/ML, IIoMTs, and big data
    analytics) and the solid underpinning of 6G, will offer numerous advantages. However,
    on the other hand, the increased digitization is also highly prone to security
    and privacy breaches of medical data. Such medical data breaches result in exposing
    the sensitive/personal information, economic losses, faulty treatment, and permanent
    or long-time damages [241]. Blockchain together with smart contracts and lightweight
    cryptographic techniques can elevate the performance of 6G-powered smart healthcare
    platforms. Specifically, decentralized medical data management, enhanced security
    from attacks (both external and internal attacks), strict access control, and
    uninterrupted service availability are some of the offerings of blockchain in
    healthcare sector. Future Directions: Despite the promising benefits blockchain
    can bring to the realm of 6G-enabled healthcare ecosystem, strong privacy by design
    is required for such systems. This should be followed with real-life rigorous
    testing and formal verification of these systems. Also, blockchain-based unified
    healthcare ecosystem would need required update to the existing legal frameworks
    to allow decentralized storage and processing of private medical data. Especially,
    if blockchain nodes are spread across countries [246]. Also, a well-defined system
    to check the compliance to privacy laws of medical world. 8.3.3. UAV applications:
    The lessons learned and future research directions for blockchain supported 6G-enabled
    UAV applications. Lessons Learned: UAVs, initially conceptualized and developed
    for military applications, have demonstrated their immense applicability in public
    and civil domains as well. With the availability of 6G networks, wide range of
    UAV-based advance use cases such as flying fire brigades, airborne short distance
    taxis, and flying cargo services, will become reality. However, UAVs will be easy
    victim of security attacks like route or mission hijacking, jamming, eavesdropping,
    and rouge device. Moreover, privacy will be at stake since UAVs with its easy
    maneuvering, small size and controlled aerodynamics can silently enter personal
    space. Blockchain has demonstrated its benefits in overcoming these challenges.
    For instance use of blockchain for identity management can efficiently detect
    rouge UAVs. Blockchain based secure logging of UAVâs trajectory, decentralized
    route and resource management, trustless cooperation, and smart contract based
    storage and computational offloading some other use of blockchain for 6G-envisioned
    UAV applications. Future Directions: However, further research is required in
    several areas such as improving privacy, scalability in terms of number of transactions
    per second, security in terms of 51% attacks, and resource utilization in terms
    of power and energy. 8.3.4. CAVs Following are the lessons learned and future
    research directions for the use of blockchain for 6G-enabled CAVs. Lessons Learned:
    Convergence of fully connected and highly autonomous vehicles in form of CAVs
    will be another popular 6G automation use case. Some of the much awaited advantages
    of CAVs are reduction in accidents and fatal consequences, decrease in insurance
    claims, less traffic congestion, effective and automated route planning, P2P vehicular
    resource trading, and even reduction in fuel consumption. However, since with
    every advancements there are associated challenges, the ones with CAVs are support
    for real-time and computational decentralized services, strong security towards
    the use of AI/ML/FL techniques, all time service availability, and trustless and
    privacy protected P2P resource trading. Blockchain along with smart contracts,
    lightweight cryptographic techniques, edge intelligence has shown encouraging
    solutions towards solving these issues. Future Directions: An interesting open
    questions on how to reconcile data protection and privacy issues with immutability
    and transparency in blockchain. Moreover, use of multiple chains and their interoperability
    may be required but to find effective way to do that is still a challenging task.
    8.3.5. Energy Internet (EI) The lessons learned and future research directions
    in context of EI are as follows. Lessons Learned: EI is an emerging internet-based
    paradigm that integrates variety of energy sources (including renewable sources),
    heterogeneous storage systems and advance control and monitoring techniques. With
    the advent of 6G, EI will receive the underlying support to meet the future energy
    demands. However, there are number of impediments that need to be addressed before
    one can achieve full benefit of EI. These are scalability issues with current
    centralized energy business models, nonavailability of complete automation keeping
    in mind the growing number and the time-varying nature of renewable energy sources,
    non-existence of large scale dynamic energy trading platforms, and strict security
    provisions. Recent research demonstrate the applicability of blockchain to mitigate
    many of these issues. For instance, decentralized smart grid management, secure
    logging of smart meterâs readings, decentralized market place for energy trading,
    auditing with strict access control and load-balancing are some of the appealing
    benefits that blockchain can bring to 6G-enabled EI. Future Directions: In future,
    establishment of blockchain-based energy infrastructure and associated APIs will
    ease the advancements in EI sector. Moreover, efficient consensus algorithms will
    be required that can sense and adapt based on energy related parameters. 8.4.
    Relation to other 6G enabling technologies Following the 6G vision and capabilities
    in the previous parts of this section, the most outstanding research opportunities
    for 6G enabling technologies regarding blockchain technology are elaborated in
    this subsection. 8.4.1. Internet of Everything (IoE) The distinguishing role of
    IoE as discussed in [371] will be the total transformation of business processes
    and business models. By the optimization and automatization of such processes
    with intrinsic digital technology, new business models and value chains in different
    industries become feasible. From the business perspective, it will be worthwhile
    to the impact of integrating IoE in future ICT systems [372]. Particularly, the
    unprecedented business velocity and agility will lead to a high competition pressure
    among businesses. To this end, the pros and cons of integrating blockchain-based
    technologies for enabling interoperability among different entities and industries,
    e.g., charging and billing, is an important research topic. 8.4.2. Data storage
    and analytics As the IoE concept is realized in future networks, an enormous number
    of things and objects will continuously generate and stream new data in real-time.
    That phenomenon leads to the fundamental requirement of efficient and capable
    centralized and decentralized data storage technologies in 6G. Blockchain enabled
    technologies for data storage, management and processing can play a key role to
    address this challenging need. However, it is an open question how to distribute
    and synthesize these technologies in different network domains (e.g., edge, fog,
    and cloud). Moreover, research on data analytics methods will be critical to analyze
    and then extract the crucial elements out of this large amount of data for effective
    and accurate decision making. The appropriate methods mainly depend on the type
    of use cases and applications. The four main categories of methods in that regard
    are descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive
    analytics as listed by [373]. As a future research direction, investigation on
    efficient ways to integrate these data analytics methods with a blockchain based
    distributed data storage and smart contracts for process automation can be studied.
    8.4.3. Quantum Computing There are specific vulnerabilities of blockchain technology
    manifested by the development of quantum computers. Namely, the security of distributed
    ledger technology depends on the difficulty of solving certain cryptographic problems
    which are undermined by the potential of quantum computation [374]. However, two
    research questions for blockchain are relevant to quantum computing era in 6G:
    (i) Hashing security: A key assumption for hashing security is that inversion
    is computationally difficult. However, a quantum computer can mitigate this barrier.
    Then the authenticity of the upstream blockchain is not guaranteed anymore and
    the blockchain entries can be compromised in terms of authentication. (ii) Quantum
    informational modeling: With quantum computing in operation, quantum informational
    versions of systems such as blockchain are essential. In that regard, an envisaged
    research direction is quantum resistant cryptography, also known as post-quantum
    cryptography, which further studies potential attacks exploiting a quantum computer
    for the analysis of conventional cryptographic algorithms. With the parallel developments
    in quantum computing and blockchainized 6G networks, this is an important research
    question to have future-proof 6G specifications and standardization. 8.4.4. Edge
    computing Edge computing is an inherently distributed environment that needs mechanisms
    for secure and trustworthy data as well as computation fluidity [375]. Therefore,
    blockchain is to be integrated into edge computing in 6G networks [376]. It is
    possible for resource owners to join the ecosystem and to lend the compute resources
    as needed. IoT devices can offload some of the edge computation to the resource
    owner nodes when required [377]. In [378], the integration of smart contracts
    with the edge nodes acting as a platform hierarchical and distributed control
    systems is presented. The executive process control is based on a micro-services
    architecture where Docker containers implement function blocks with Kubernetes
    platform used as the edge orchestrator. Blockchain technology has also emerged
    as a solution for managing MEC services, with consensus protocols and data integrity
    checks that enable transparent and efficient distributed decision-making [35],
    [379]. An existing blockchain cannot be directly applied to an edge network since
    it requires all participants to store the entire history of the data provenance,
    which clearly cannot be achieved by most end devices under certain resource constraints
    [380]. To summarize, existing security and fault tolerance approaches pose unrealistic
    expectations on compute, network, or storage in the context of edge computing.
    For edge computing in 6G, blockchain driven scalability enhancement and resource
    management is an interesting research direction [376]. Blockchain provides techniques
    to address these aspects albeit also bringing forth its own challenges (e.g.,
    complexity and scalability). Blockchain can also support self-organization due
    as an enabler for distributed data exchange and control. Furthermore, how to provide
    security is a crucial research question as the case for the overall 6G network.
    9. Conclusion 6G wireless networks, driven by the vast and heterogeneous demands
    of hyper-connected existence of everything, will indeed give rise to new use cases
    as well as business avenues. In line with ongoing resurgence of research activities
    centered around 6G, this paper took a deep dive to comprehend multitude of benefits
    that can be achieved with integration of blockchain in 6G. In particular, the
    survey began with tracking the trends, requirements, applications and key technological
    enablers for 6G, which revealed the panoramic view of current 6G evolution. Then,
    the paper assimilated various technical aspects of 6G by presenting the key challenges
    and benefits that blockchain can usher. Further, the paper presented that blockchainized
    6G ecosystem can offer diverse and substantial underpinning to future envisioned
    use cases and applications. Towards the end, dedicated efforts have been put to
    delineate numerous research opportunities. In summary, blockchain has immense
    potential that can be harnessed for designing next generation of mobile networks,
    however, more research efforts are required to ensure the extent to which it can
    be pragmatically used. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that
    they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

  description: In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has had a big impact
    on both industry and academia. Its profound impact is particularly felt in the
    industrial sector, where the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), also known
    as Industry 4.0, is revolutionizing manufacturing and production through the fusion
    of cutting-edge technologies and network-embedded sensing devices. The IIoT revolutionizes
    several industries, including crucial ones such as oil and gas, water purification
    and distribution, energy, and chemicals, by integrating information technology
    (IT) with industrial control and automation systems. Water, a vital resource for
    life, is a symbol of the advancement of technology, yet knowledge of potential
    cyberattacks and their catastrophic effects on water treatment facilities is still
    insufficient. Even seemingly insignificant errors can have serious consequences,
    such as aberrant pH values or fluctuations in the concentration of hydrochloric
    acid (HCI) in water, which can result in fatalities or serious diseases. The water
    purification and distribution industry has been the target of numerous hostile
    cyber security attacks, some of which have been identified, revealed, and documented
    in this paper. Our goal is to understand the range of security threats that are
    present in this industry. Through the lens of IIoT, the survey provides a technical
    investigation that covers attack models, actual cases of cyber intrusions in the
    water sector, a range of security difficulties encountered, and preventative security
    solutions. We also explore upcoming perspectives, illuminating the predicted advancements
    and orientations in this dynamic subject. For industrial practitioners and aspiring
    scholars alike, our work is a useful, enlightening, and current resource. We want
    to promote a thorough grasp of the cybersecurity landscape in the water industry
    by combining key insights and igniting group efforts toward a safe and dependable
    digital future.

    digital future. Keywords: IIoT; Industry 4.0; water industry; cyber security;
    attacks; challenges and future prospective 1. Introduction IoT has limited processing
    capability and a low-power network of sensing devices that interchange data with
    each other, such as cloud servers and gateways, usually via wireless or wired
    technologies. The use of IoT devices is increasing, and it is estimated that by
    the end of 2030, the number of connected devices will reach around 24.1 billion
    [1]. However, progress in the IoT has highlighted security concerns. Considering
    the variety of IoT topologies and the abundance of sensing and communication modules
    they incorporate, integrating such devices leads to a dynamic and varied landscape
    [1,2]. Actually, IoT devices are considered and, in some cases, known to be vulnerable
    to network attacks, such as spoofing, data theft, denial of service attacks (DDoS
    attacks), and phishing attacks [3]. According to a lab study, nearly 30% of attacks
    on IoT devices occur on wireless or mobile technology devices [4]. In several
    situations, IoT device security is handled by the deviceâs own application [5].
    For instance, it has been shown that battery-powered wearable, handheld, and portable
    gadgets frequently sacrifice security performance in order to support longer working
    times. Although energy-efficient communication and control protocols for IoT have
    been developed to address these problems, vulnerabilities associated with these
    protocols may still be present. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) affects a wide range
    of IoT devices and is widely used for industrial IoT (IIoT) and wearable devices.
    Basically, IIoT is the extension of IoT in industry. Focusing on machine learning,
    machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, big data, and IIoT-capable enterprises,
    industries will have suitable reliability and efficiency in operation. The interaction
    of operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) marks a distinction
    between IoT and IIOT [6,7]. IIoT systems are more vulnerable to advanced persistent
    threat (APT) adversary assaults than conventional industrial control systems (ICS)
    and OT networks because of IT network connectivity and the introduction of M2M,
    which connects different intelligent and latest devices. In addition, ICS devices
    often work on legacy (without a security mind) or unaware (no updates from time
    to time) software. Attackers or âEvil Eyesâ usually target ICS-related information
    to gather intelligence that can shut down critical systems, endanger human lives,
    and disrupt industrial processes. In the past, such attacks have occurred in the
    real world; hence, we can say they were real-world attacks (RWA). Examples include
    Iranâs uranium Stuxnet attack in 2010 that caused a sufficient setback to Iranâs
    nuclear program and damaged their centrifuge [8]; the German steel mill attack
    in 2014 that caused significant loss (the mill avoided blast burning from shutting
    down) [9]; the power company attack in Ukraine in 2015 that detached small-level
    stations from the power grid, leaving millions of customers without power for
    a long time [10]; the similar attack in Ukraine in 2016 on transmission-level
    substations that disconnected capital without power for more than an hour [11];
    and the attacks on the petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia in 2017 that shut down
    the safety controller of the plant which could have caused massive loss, damage,
    or an explosion [12]. Industry, the malware behind the power grid attack in Ukraine
    in 2016 and the Saudi petrochemical attack in 2017 are still active in targeting
    energy sectors and electrical power substations [13,14]. In-controller IIoT malware
    that was recently revealed in 2022 consists of modules that hit particular ICS
    devices such as Schneider Electric PLCs using Modbus, open platform communication
    (OPC) servers, Codesys protocols, and Ormon PLCs. The energy, critical manufacturing,
    water/wastewater, and commercial sector are the major sectors affected by cyber
    attacks, as shown in flow chart Figure 1, while the US Department of Home Security
    considers the water and waste industry to be the main target of cyber attacks
    [15]. Securing it [16,17] is considered to be a national priority [18]. From 2012
    to 2015, this industry received the most assessments from the Cybersecurity and
    Infrastructure Security Agency Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response
    Team [18]. Recently, in August 2022, a criminal attack on a UK water company was
    observed which gained access to customer banking details [19]. Cybersecurity has
    developed a huge interest in the water industry and some educational programs
    have been offered [20,21]. This provoked great interest in the research environment
    [22,23,24,25,26,27], as earlier cybersecurity incidents may have provided insightful
    information that could be used to inform current cyber defense efforts, promoting
    investments and initiatives and increasing their applicability and efficiency.
    This calls for a thorough compilation and analysis of these instances, which is
    currently lacking. This study presents a study of water industry vulnerabilities
    and security, a review of malicious, documented, and disclosed cybersecurity attacks
    in the water industry, and safety guidelines or tips. This review also presents
    the challenges and future prospective analyses from real-world water industry
    attacks. Figure 2 represents the paperâs architecture. This study highlights the
    attackerâs role and âproofâ in water purification and distribution plants. According
    to a study in 2021, the average instance of cybersecurity and data breaches will
    eventually be 15% yearly [28]. As of the time at which we wrote this review, there
    has been no research that provides a comprehensive study of security issues, vulnerabilities,
    and real-world cases in water distribution and purification plants. This review
    is new, and we hope to maximize researchers interest. Figure 1. Cyber attacks
    in various industries [29] (vulnerabilities). Figure 2. Paper architecture. The
    rest of the paper has been organized as follows: Section 2 concerns the comparative
    evaluation of previous surveys. In Section 3, we discuss the architecture of the
    industrial control system. Section 4 contains a discussion of secure water treatment
    plant components and processes, as well as the methods by which an attacker could

    in the ICS environment. Section 6 concerns attacks on water purification and distribution
    plants in real-world scenarios. In Section 7, we discuss the vulnerabilities,
    challenges, and future of water purification and distribution plants, while Section

    purification and distribution plants, and our conclusions are given in Section
    10. 2. Previous Surveys IoT is a technology that links physical devices through
    a wired or wireless network, and IIoT is a technology that deals with complicated
    architecture and is linked with the hardware and software in the industry. Actuators
    and sensors play an important role in data transmission and communication in an
    ICS environment such as industrial architecture. The authors of [30] studied IoT
    problems and challenges, but their work is limited, and the authors did not explain
    the applications of IoT or the role of IoT in the industrial domain. IoT-based
    applications have been studied in [31], in which the authors presented a general
    review of IoT-based applications. This work is useful for researchers in understanding
    the IoT applications and the advancement of the technology, but the authors did
    not discuss security issues or future perspectives in this work. Moreover, very
    few IoT applications were discussed. IoT advancement from various perspectives
    such as social impacts, applications, and challenges has been studied in [32,33].
    The work is far from a discussion of security issues and future challenges in
    IoT. A review has been presented in [34] which is IoT-based but limited to healthcare
    applications. Future research on green IoT has been discussed in [35]. With the
    development of technology and IoTâs role in connectivity, industrial IoT (IIoT)
    has been playing an important role in academia and industry. The authors of [36,37]
    presented a review on IIoT, and they explained the interaction of IoT with IIoT.
    A security review of IoT has been discussed in [38], but the authors did not present
    their work from the perspective of applications and cases. The authors of [39]
    studied emerging technologies in the IIoT, and their work explained the experimental
    and conceptual architecture of IIoT. IIoT has been reviewed from a business perspective
    in [40]. Security is a key issue in an ICS environment, and researchers are doing
    their best to identify and overcome these issues. The authors of [41] presented
    a review of security in ICS. Research shows that there is insufficient attention
    being paid to the patch management process because of SCADA complications. The
    authors presented several security issues and SCADA assessments, but in this work,
    the authors were to able to highlight maximum security issues in an ICS environment
    and solutions. An ICS environment covers several applications, such as the chemical
    industry, oil and gas, water and wastewater treatment, agriculture, and many others.
    Our focus is on cyber security in water and wastewater treatment plants. Water
    is a basic element of life. It is considered one of the major sectors affected
    by cyberattacks. Researchersâ contributions are playing an important role in raising
    awareness of such issues. The role of IoT in water distribution systems has been
    studied in [42]. The authors of [43] presented a review of cyber security in water
    treatment plants, and they also discussed real cases in water treatment plants.
    The authors discussed fifteen real-life cases in the water purification and distribution
    industry. The authors discussed the attackerâs methods and vulnerabilities in
    the system, but their work did not explain the latest cyberattack incidents in
    the water industry, and there is also insufficient discussion of the future prospects
    in the water and wastewater industry. The authors of [22] presented a systematic
    review of cyber security in the critical infrastructure of water and wastewater
    treatment plants. The authors discussed future research work, but they did not
    study real cases and the attackersâ means of entering the water plantâs communication
    network. Their work also did not explain the key challenges and vulnerabilities
    in the system. A study has been presented in [44] that explains the water distribution
    [45] system while ignoring the security aspects involved in distribution. Cyberattack
    mitigation in an ICS environment has been studied in [46]. The authors of [47]
    presented a review of cyber attacks and detection methods in water purification
    plants. The survey is based on general cyber attacks and common attack detection
    methods and it does not cover the latest research and incidents in water purification
    plants. The work also fails to present the vulnerabilities in the system. These
    surveys show insufficient knowledge of cyber security in water distribution and
    purification plants. There are recent incidents in water purification and distribution
    plants that have not been discussed in these surveys. Moreover, attacker entranceways
    and system vulnerabilities have not been discussed in previous surveys. Very few
    of the previous works dedicated space to future prospects, and none covered the
    subject extensively. At the time of writing this manuscript, there has been no
    survey on attack detection in water purification and distribution plants. In previous
    surveys, significant information has been missing regarding the security of water
    purification and distribution plants. The current survey will therefore be very
    useful and informative, offering maximum information and knowledge for researchers
    and industrialists. We provide a comparison with previous surveys in Table 1.
    Table 1. Comparative analysis with previous related surveys. 3. Industrial Control
    System (ICS) In this section, we provide work on the integration of IT with traditional
    OT networks and the general architecture considered for ICS networks. We will
    also discuss adhering to this ICS architecture when we discuss real-world incidents
    in water treatment plants. Usually, an ICS architecture consists of software and
    hardware components, which are known as supervisory control and data acquisition
    (SCADA) for systemic monitoring, process control, ICS device communication, data
    collection, log data storage, and system monitoring. In a typical SCADA system,
    the lowest level consists of dumb devices, also called field devices, such as
    sensors, actuators, etc. Remote terminal units (RTU) and programmable logic controllers
    (PLC) are used to control these devices. Generally, RTU and PLC are computer-based
    systems that give control signals to field devices, obtain data, and send it to
    central control stations such as the master terminal unit (MTU). The MTU communicates
    in a master-slave model via a telephone network, wireless or wired network, or
    the internet for monitoring the field devices, uploading fresh or updated configurations,
    and sending commands. All such operations are managed by the humanâmachine interface
    (HMI) that is linked to the MTU and permits gathering data, transferring signals
    to remote sites, and varying configurations and settings. An old water distribution
    system architecture is shown in Figure 3a with PLC and RTU distributed sites.
    In this simple network, we discussed various layers of SCADA architecture in which
    field devices such as pressure gauges and valves are under the monitoring of RTU
    through a wireless system, while the role of SCADA is that of a central control
    station, such as the head of the ICS network, and it is in communication with
    PLC and RTU in the environment. Figure 3. (a) Old architecture of a water distribution
    system. (b) Architecture of a water purification and distribution system. Previously,
    there was an air gap between the SCADA system and traditional OT system networks,
    which were not interlinked with the IT system. With the advancement of technology,
    several industries moved to overlap the IT and OT network, which is known as the
    cost-effective approach. On the one hand, this approach is considered cost-effective
    and time-saving; on the other hand, there seems to be serious security threats
    involved in this approach, for the following reasons: There are different operational
    priorities of OT and IT networks, such as availability vs. confidentiality, and
    both may not adjust; Several ICSs lack security features such as access control
    and data encryption; There are limited visualization options for implementing
    and assessing security adjustments, which are provided by expensive legacy devices
    in ICS setups; The immediate adoption of corrective measures that may require
    system interruptions is prohibited by the critical and real-time business activities
    in OT as well as safety rules. As a result of these security measures, some limitations
    have been suggested by security experts for access to the OT network. There are
    some other works in the ICS security field intended to enhance protocols, standards,
    and components to support security benefits. In an ICS, the development of technology
    has merged the IT and OT networks, which is known as IIoT and is without air gaps.
    Figure 4 is an ICS network architecture that consists of various zones and can
    be described as an industrial automation and control system security. Basically,
    a zone is defined as a set of devices or components (IT and OT) joined together
    for a subclass of applications in an ICS environment. Figure 4. An ICS architecture.
    4. Secure Water Treatment Plant Components and Processes, and Attacker Means of
    Access IIoT-deployed water plants or systems increase with the development of
    technologies such as monitoring and sensing technology and real-time communication
    technology such as satellite and wireless communication, intelligence, and controls.
    4.1. Components in Plant There are various components used in water purification
    plants. These are given as follows. 4.1.1. Pressure Meter This is used to detect
    a pressure leakage in the plant such as via flooding, pipe burst, or any other
    kind of irregularity. It senses and stops the flow or transportation of water.
    4.1.2. Advance Valves With the variation of environmental situations, these stop
    or regulate the water flow in the system. Smart valves permit bidirectional water
    flow and stop the reduction of water or signal the water meter to reduce the oversupply
    of water. 4.1.3. Flood Sensors These analyze the existing and impending safety
    with respect historically occurring and impending flood disasters. They stop the
    flow of water when they detect a pipe break in a source to stop water loss. 4.1.4.
    Advance Pumps To pump water via pipelines into and out of tanks, these machines
    need electricity. They permit water to flow both ways and are employed for high-energy-use
    processes and can stop a significant waste of water. 4.1.5. Digital Water Meters
    These are electrical devices that assess water consumption on a regular basis.
    Data on water use by consumers are gathered by the water utility administration
    from the smart water meters via communication networks. The information gathered
    is then utilized to calculate the cost of water consumption and manage bills.
    4.1.6. Digital Controllers These have thermostats for sprinkler systems that allow
    water to be automatically irrigated based on schedules or specific circumstances,
    which is useful in preventing wastage of water and energy occurring due to excess
    use of water. 4.1.7. Tanks These are used for the purpose of storing water received
    from external resources or from step six to three processes (see below). 4.1.8.
    Pipes These are the basic elements of water transportation. 4.1.9. Digital Contaminant
    Sensors These determine the biochemical state of the water by computing factors
    including temperature, turbidity, oxidation-reduction potential, pH, and conductivity
    to ensure purity. They can stop the aging of water, the corrosion of pipes, and
    the entry of contaminants. Cyber security in water purification and distribution
    plants is mandatory because the above-mentioned components or elements are linked
    together, connected to the internet at some point in the system, and are easy
    targets for attackers without any secure management. There are various stages
    in a secure water treatment plant, and the PLC is responsible for controlling
    each stage. Typically, two PLCs are used, with one reserved for emergency use.
    The general process of securing a water treatment plant is given in the following
    stages: Storage of raw water (received from outside) in a tank; In the second
    stage, chemicals such as HCl, NaCl, and NaOCl are added for better water quality;
    In the third stage, through ultra-filtration, the filtration process starts; In
    the fourth stage, ultraviolet light is used to dechlorinate the water; The fifth
    stage is the reverse osmosis process; In the final stage, the remaining water
    is stored in another tank, and this water can be sent to step three for the backwash
    process. 4.2. Attack Techniques Water is a basic element of life. It is challenging
    to secure a water treatment plant, but it is essential not only to secure a plant
    but to save lives connected with this plant such as those of humans, birds, animals,
    etc. Advanced and digital technology-based plants are helpful in the improvement
    of water quality and ensuring a quick supply. However, this deployment of technology
    also increases the security challenges in the process. For example, an attacker
    can attack to shut down the water supply, increase the HCl quantity, or overflow
    the tank. The attackerâs purpose is to damage the plant system. There are several
    ways that an attacker can attack a water treatment plant, as shown in Figure 5.
    Figure 5. Attacker means of accessing an ICS system. 4.2.1. Attack through Actuators
    In this type of attack, the attacker targets the actuator and provides misinformation
    concerning the water quantity to disturb the water facilities, as shown in Figure
    5. 4.2.2. Attack through PLC When an attacker targets the PLCs, it leads to the
    attacker misleading the network operation. 4.2.3. Attack through Sensors When
    an attacker attacks through the sensor, it leads to varying sensor [48] readings
    for private data. 4.2.4. Attack through a Network or Communication Layer Here,
    the attacker attacks through the communication or networking links to disturb
    or damage the system. This communication could be between PLCs, SCADA, sensors,
    actuators, and the relevant software and hardware used in communication. The authors
    of [13] studied all means of maliciously accessing a plant such as through sensors,
    actuators, networks, and PLCs, etc. In [26,27,30,31,35,36,39], the authors studied
    attacks through sensors in the environment. Ref. [28] shows an attack via an actuator
    in the plant. Refs. [31,35] also show means of attack via PLCsâ and actuatorsâ
    communication and more than one PLC communication network. The researchers in
    [35] also represent an attack through PLCs and sensors and the PLC communication
    link, while [39] only covers attacks through sensors and actuators. Still, there
    is a lack of security management and the tools necessary for a secure system.
    5. Attack and Defense Model The real-world cyber attack cases studied in this
    review can be grasped efficiently with the understanding of attack and defense
    models. 5.1. Attack Model The primary objective of the water distribution and
    purification company is to deliver secure, safe, and pure water to the customers.
    Because of cyber attacks, there is a danger of disturbances to the water transportation
    system or variations of chemicals which is a very sensitive issue. A small negligence
    can cause a big loss. Attackers try to attack through the main components of the
    plant. From the perspective of the attacker, there are various stages in a systematic
    process or isolated malicious activity by which to gain access to or reach the
    target and disturb the network. The killed chain concept has been proposed by
    researchers in military applications such as weaponization, installation, reconnaissance,
    delivery command, and control action, etc. It introduced and defined the cyber
    kill chain (CKC). Taking inspiration from CKC, researchers studied a few attack
    models. In an ICS environment, the attack method is quite different because of
    the different architecture. In an ICS environment, the target can be IT, OT, or
    DMZ. In real cases, most targets are on the OT network, where attackers gain access
    to the system or network through the IT network and affect the OT system by applying
    a number of attacks. This model is known as the combined ICS kill chain and CKS.
    Here, the attacker can repeat his process to reach the target. He will move inside
    the network until the time when he accesses the target. Te authors of [49] studied
    a spiral attack model that moves inside the IT/OT network till it reaches the
    target. There are various ways for an attacker to enter the ICS environment through
    sensors, actuators, communication links, or valves, etc. Attacking sensors means
    varying the water level in the tank. The authors in [50,51] studied an experimental
    setup to explain the disturbance in the water level in an ICS environment while
    attacking through actuators to vary the data linked pumping speed and implement
    a DoS attack. Attacking via the communication link between sensors and PLC means
    varying the PLC-collected data and getting water status information; attacking
    via the actuators and PLC communication link means changing the signals and sending
    wrong information. By attacking via PLCs, attackers can acquire full control of
    the system and can easily inject a DoS attack; while the attack on sensors means
    varying the water system configuration system and changing the sensorsâ collected
    data. As shown in Figure 4 the attacker may initiate suspicious activities in
    an external environment and approach an employee of the organization to insert
    or inject an attack via email or web server, and a vulnerable host can be helpful
    to reaching the target. Once an attack happens or is sent into the environment,
    the attacker is already in the network and moves slowly and safely to reach the
    target and infiltrate the control or required target. This is an example of a
    general attack; it is not mandatory that an attack be injected from level 5; an
    insider can launch an attack, such as an employee in the workstation or DMZ zone.
    As to how an attacker delivers attacks on victims, the key features are given
    as follows. 5.1.1. Adversary It is an organization that is responsible for attacks.
    It can be from inside or outside and emerge from individual activity or that of
    a group. In most cyber incidents, this is unknown. It is important to understand
    the relationship between the attacker and the customer. 5.1.2. Capability A technique
    or tool used by the hacker. The target environmentâs configuration flaws and vulnerabilities
    determine an attackerâs capacity. 5.1.3. Infrastructure A logical or physical
    communication method such as email or an external device (USB, Hard drive) is
    used by the attacker to inject the attack and to control the network to attain
    the required objective. The ICS environment can be monitored, controlled, and
    attacked by the hacker when he or she injects an attack successfully. 5.1.4. Victims
    The system is targeted by the attacker for a self-directed requirement or purpose.
    The âvictimsâ include any technical issues or vulnerabilities in the network that
    allow the attacker to penetrate and obtain control of the whole environment. Sometimes,
    an attacker attains overall control of the ICS environment, and sometimes the
    attacked gains control of some specific parts, as is often the case in water secure
    treatment plants; for example, sometimes, the attackerâs purpose is to increase
    the PH level of water or HCl in the water; sometimes, it is to overflow the tank.
    For a secure and safe environment, it is important to build a secure algorithm
    inside the system to detect the attackerâs activity or anomalies before reaching
    the target. Such an algorithm should also have the capacity to detect the major
    and minor kinds of anomalies in the world by using various sensors and different
    dimensional spaces, while there is no need for more sensors in local anomalies.
    Furthermore, there is a chance that a single attack will hit several sensors at
    once, confusing the systemâs functioning. Here, we study researchersâ contributions
    to anomaly detection in water purification plants. The authors of [52] studied
    nine types of attacks within the water distribution system, and tge attacks studied
    are through PLCs, SCADA, and sensors. They also studied attack limitations and
    detection methods. A detection method has been studied in [43] for the identification
    [53] of local anomalies that affect each sensor individually and worldwide anomalies
    that use multiple sensors. Researchers in [54] studied an algorithm for the identification
    of malicious activity by actuatorsâ regularity and sensorsâ data integrity and
    detected suspicious activities in data. Later on, they separated it from SCADA
    measurements. The authors of [55] studied intrusion detection for malicious activity
    in smart cities. The authors detected denial of service attacks (DDoS)âsuch attacks
    can disturb the system by flooding the system with a huge number of requests and
    trying to make it inaccessible to users. Similarly, DDoS disturbs the water purification
    system by sending a large number of requests. An algorithm for the identification
    of anomalies consisting of control, consistency, pattern recognition, and hydraulic
    system has been studied in [56]. For the detection of cyber attacks in water purification
    plants, model-based fault detection methodology has been studied in [20]. For
    attack prediction, the authors of [57] presented the long short-term memory recurrent
    neural network method for testing. There were accurate results in the provided
    data. In this method, the authors used a limited number of sensors, but it can
    be enhanced to the overall dataset in the SWaT test bed. Security experts can
    install several security tools and technologies in an organization for secure
    processes. Furthermore, experts will have access to databases, standards, benchmarks,
    and security controls. Safety from security threats is a key challenge in advanced
    and technology-equipped organizations. A valuable and basic security actions list
    has been provided by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The following are
    the controls suggested by the CIS. 5.2. Basic Controls Basic control consists
    of an inventory of software and hardware tools, controlled use of admin, and regular
    vulnerability management. They consist of an inventory of licensed and unlicensed
    devices and software, their secure configuration, regular vulnerability management,
    the controlled use of admin privileges, and keeping an eye on audit logs. 5.3.
    Foundational Controls These are internet-based controls such as email and web
    browser safety, network secure configuration, malware defence (installation, execution,
    and spread), and red ream practice. They consist of an information backup process
    that secures the firewall, wireless access control (track, prevent, and control
    wireless access), boundary defence (detection and prevention of information flow),
    data protection, etc. 5.4. Organizational Control These controls involvetraining
    programs and implementations of security awareness, incident management, and response,
    red team practice, and penetration tests. In these controls, there are application
    and software security checks, penetration tests, and red team practice. Controls
    are available in various security solutions and tools and can have different impacts
    depending on the target, such as denying or securing the hacker from accessing
    private information, detecting and attacking, minimizing the attack impact, disturbing
    or interfering with active malicious activities, containing a consensus zone deceiving
    the attacker, etc. The authors of [52] studied the various security tools and
    solutions. Network-based intrusion detection systems, anti-virus solutions, or
    host-based intrusion detection systems can be useful in the detection process
    of suspected activities. Malicious activities can be in the trust zone, which
    consists of various attack steps from delivery to actions and honeypots. Antiviruses
    are useful in detection and disruption attacks during delivery, and data execution
    protection techniques are useful in disruption mechanisms. In old or traditional
    IT-based security control, there were several OT-based security tools such as
    unidirectional gateways and data diodes, passive OT intrusion detection, passive
    tool discovery, and patch management, which are being used in the current ICS
    environment. It should be noted that each AS is designed for a specific goal but
    is patched with the OT network, not the IT network. Because several industries
    moved towards an advanced industry without changing devices or components that
    were OT patch-managed, there were several vulnerabilities by which attackers could
    gain access, such as the limitation of network interaction in the unidirectional
    gateway for IT to OT and the need for a firewall in the new concept of IT and
    OT, with limited communication regulations limited to the OT network. This is
    known as boundary defence control, and in the OT network, passive tools discovery
    is basic control. In a SCADA system, each action requires one or more security
    controls. 6. Evil Eyes on the Water Purification and Distribution Environment
    in Real-World Incidents An industrial plant consists of controllers, sensors,
    and actuators such as robotics manufacturing, power plant controllers, remote
    telemetry, management systems such as remote terminal units, and the humanâmachine
    interference. The interconnectivity of such a complex architecture enables the
    industrial system to exchange messages or communicate in real time, enhancing
    system control, providing sufficient real-time awareness, and enhancing efficiency
    and productivity. In an industrial control system (ICS), devicesâopposite to the
    operating systemâare responsible for improving system efficiency, productivity,
    monitoring, and controlling the system. To meet basic security objectives, ICS
    device operation requires confirmation of in-transit data, confidentiality of
    sensed measurement, surety of secure stored information integration, and access
    only to trusted parties. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) are
    known as the basic principles of security investigation in an ICS sector. Indeed,
    the confidentiality of stored data in plants is crucial to the ICS sector. In
    an IIoT automation environment consisting of critical infrastructure such as chemical
    plants, water plants, nuclear plants, energy plants, etc., since they can result
    in catastrophic events or uneconomical plant operation, the integrity of the sensed
    data and the availability of system resources are of the utmost importance. Because
    of the distinct security objectives of ICS plants and the heterogeneous and interoperable
    architectures of the ICS sector, comprehensive security research is required in
    order to to evaluate IIoT security challenges with RWA examples for the best understanding
    and motivation of incoming researchers. Some of the incidents, their objectives,
    and limitations are given in Table 2. Table 2. Cyber attacks in water and wastewater
    distribution and purification systems. IIoT systems combine IT, OT, IoT, and IIoT
    technologies. So that they may operate effectively in a distributed manner and
    be monitored and controlled from far-flung areas, IIoT systems can make use of
    enhanced networking capabilities. This connectivity may cause vulnerabilities;
    however, in the case of insecure IIoT systems, adversaries can use them to their
    advantage by breaching industrial networks or distant connections through the
    Internet. Additionally, attacks can be carried out by accessing compromised industrial
    staff accounts and abusing their rights. In several industries, attacks have been
    reported in which either attackers directly attack IIOT systems, such as IIoT
    device attacks, or they are compromised as a result of the interconnectivity of
    IT and IIoT systems, in which case attacks travel from IT systems to IIoT devices.
    In this section, we will discuss some real-world attacks and some lab validations
    derived from the industrial domain. Figure 3b represents a water purification
    and distribution plant. 6.1. RWA in Water Industry/Plant Water is an essential
    component of life. The water and wastewater sector (WWS) is known as one of the
    most targeted lifeline infrastructures. A large number of cyberattacks in the
    water industry has been noticed over a short time, and this number is increasing
    [28]. These cyberattacks disturb water distribution and water treatment/purification
    systems. In 2020, a large number of cyber attacks was noticed in the water industry
    [42]. In the water industry in Israel, the first attack was noticed in the modification
    of the chemicals used to process tap water, followed by attacks on city water
    pumps and the agriculture sector. Although these attacks were minor and there
    was no big loss or damage, Israelâs responsible authorities started to focus on
    strict cyber security measurements in water treatment plants. Israelâs national
    cyber chief stated âWe can see something like this aiming to cause damage to real
    life and not to IT or dataâ [42,64]. Out of several incidents in the water industry,
    one of them is the 2016 attack on a company commonly using the pseudonym âKemuri
    Water Company (KWC)â in Israel [14]. After hiring expert security persons in KWC,
    the company came to learn that there were still many vulnerabilities in their
    plant architecture. After a careful examination of the KWC systems, the security
    firm discovered a series of mysterious valve manipulation patterns combined with
    the IP addresses of state-sponsored hacktivists in the facilityâs traffic records
    and possible unauthorized access to the subsystems. Further investigation helped
    to collect useful shreds of evidence in the infrastructure of KWC, which uncovered
    ex-filtration of 2 million plus unique results and chemical flow rate manipulation
    [43]. The authors of [65] studied a similar water attack incident that happened
    in 2020. In reality, OT systems were updated according to the times; the OTs used
    were outdated, and several IT OTs were working with AS400, and a 1988 built-in
    IBM application system was in use [66]. The following functions were conducted
    by AS400: Controlling flow control applications and several PLC devices for the
    water valve and the operation of the SCADA platform. The SCADA system in water
    treatment and purification plant was shown in Figure 3c. Billing information of
    the water utility customers and hosting personally identifiable information. A
    router for the various KMC-connected networks was used for storing the firmsâ
    financial statements. In addition, SQL injection vulnerabilities were found in
    the system [43,67], and the AS400 system was also connected to the Internet. The
    internal IP address and login information for the web server hosting the payment
    application was kept in plaintext in a .ini file, giving opponents access. The
    following vulnerabilities were found by experts in the KWC system: Outdated devices
    in the systems were in operation; There was no time-to-time updating of the system;
    The company was using the IBM application system built in 1988 and designed for
    intermediate and small-sized firms on a large-scale firm; Remote connection vulnerabilities.
    Now we would like to summarize the effects of the attack on KWC. There were the
    following effects: modified the level of chemicals used to process tap water;
    breaching the personal identification information system; trying to access the
    customerâs payment information and managing water flow valves and chemical mixtures
    ratios Such kinds of attacks are known as âDevice Typeâ attacks because they directly
    impact the control strategies, limits, and set point of actuators in touch with
    the industrial processes. After careful investigation, it was suggested that KWC
    install new technology devices within the system to meet the state-of-the-art
    security practice for the safety of human lives and the companyâs financial interests.
    KWC Attack Type The attacker found easy access to the login application and breached
    the personal identification system to obtain access to the client payment information
    service [67]. Attackers entered using the IT environment, carrying the attack
    payload to the OT endpoints and damaging the accessible infrastructure and quality
    of water. This attack proves that industrial facilities, and especially complex
    infrastructure, must ensure that the security standards and strategies required
    to meet a secure IIoT system are attained. Figure 6 shows the attackerâs way into
    KWC. Figure 6. Attacker way to KWC incident. 6.2. Florida Water Supply Attack
    In [68], there is a new story of a cyber attack on a water treatment plant in
    a Florida city. A worker in plant management observed that the mouse cursor was
    moving strangely on the screen and was not in his control, so he informed the
    local police. In the beginning, there was no concern; his manager frequently connected
    to his computer to keep an eye on the facilityâs systems. The plant utilized the
    remote-access program TeamViewer to let employees exchange displays and troubleshoot
    IT difficulties. Within a short time, the attacker was trying to vary the water
    supply level of sodium hydroxide, moving the setting from 100/ppm (parts per million)
    to 11,100 ppm. This disturbs the PH level at a low level and damages human tissue
    it touches at a high level. According to officials [68], the operator quickly
    overcame the problem and returned the water to its normal position. There is no
    idea as to how it happened (i.e., whether from inside or outside). The Federal
    Board of Investigation (FBI) and the cityâs own investigation teams are currently
    searching for the reason behind this attack. 6.3. Bay Area Utility Attack for
    Drinking Water System Recently, in the US, a hacker obtained access to the Bay
    Area drinking water system digital network and tried to vary the effluent quality
    [69]. According to the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, the attacker
    gained the TeamViewers login information of one of the companyâs former employees
    in order to obtain access to the system. Refs. [70,71] reported that the hacker
    tried to poison the drinking water plant serving the San Francisco Bay Area. In
    initial reports, it was hard to identify the hackerâs means of access. The case
    will be handed to the Federal Board of Investigation (FBI), who will search for
    the cause. The Biden government [72] seems interested in overcoming cyber attacks
    on drinking water plants and other critical infrastructure in the country. It
    is a good step for the US state to make drinking water safe; however, there a
    significant challenges, such as the following: In the critical infrastructure
    of the entire country, water treatment plants are considered most vulnerable to
    hackers. It is difficult for everyone to follow cyber security rules, and it is
    easy to cause major harm to several people. According to NBC news [70] weather,
    recently, water plant attacks have increased because there is no specific federal
    industry for water treatment security accountability. 6.4. Colonial Pipeline Attack
    (CPA) Incident Sticking to critical US infrastructure, there is the question which
    type of attack was inflicted om the drinking water system. It has also been confirmed
    by officials of the FBI that the attacker forced the Colonial pipeline [42] to
    shut down the gasoline and jet fuel to the East Coast. The attacker tried to obtain
    access via ransomware, which is a type of malware that encrypts data until victims,
    who are threatened with their data being made publicly available via the internet,
    pay a ransom. Fox News confirmed [71] âIn order to prevent the ransomware from
    spreading and because it was unable to bill customers since itâs business and
    accounting networks were down, Colonial Pipeline preemptively shut down its pipeline
    operationsâ. In Table 3, we present some of the well-known cyber attacks on the
    water industry from the last five years. Table 3. List of some famous water industry
    cyber attacks from 2018â2022. CPA Effects This attack caused the fuel price to
    rise at a high level. This attack also forced some airplanes to make extra fuel
    stops and compelled a White House strategy. 6.5. Riviera Beach Attack A police
    department employee unleashed a devastating ransomware attack on Riviera Beach,
    a tiny city with 35,000 residents north of West Palm Beach (Florida), on 29 May
    2019, openning a compromised email crippling the computer systems of the police
    force, the municipal council, and other neighborhood government offices, All operations
    were shut down by the malware, which also encrypted their data. The attack also
    affected the water utility, compromising the computer systems in charge of pumping
    stations, testing the waterâs purity, and handling payments. The city council
    unanimously agreed to allow its insurer to pay the attackers 65 bitcoins, or about
    USD 600,000, a few days after the attack. The cityâs budget would be used to cover
    an additional USD 25,000 in insurance deductibles. After the attack, two weeksâ
    investigation revealed that the IT division which created the cityâs website and
    email services was running at full capacity, although the water pump stations
    and systems for assessing water quality were only partially accessible. The municipal
    council representative emphasized that although water quality sampling had to
    be done manually, the water quality itself was never in jeopardy. The FBI, Secret
    Service, and DHS looked into the incident and advised the city not to pay the
    ransom. Instead of waiting for a description key from the attacker, local authorities
    decided to purchase new hardware and computers by spending USD 900,000 because
    most of the devices and computers were old and vulnerable to the attacker. This
    shows that small towns and cities are more vulnerable to attackers because of
    their old systems. 6.6. Secure Water Treatment Plant (SWTP) Lab Validation and
    Challenges At the Singapore University of Technology and Design, there is a SWTP
    test bed plant [50]. This plant has been widely used by researchers [16] for secure
    mechanisms and control infrastructure. In this section, we studied the introduction
    and challenges faced by researchers in the lab plant. Introduction of SWTP SWTP
    is meeting the latest technology requirements for the water treatment process.
    Its production capacity is almost 19 liters/minute for water purification by the
    use of ultra-filtration. This SWTP ICS consists of six stages, with each stage
    each stage labeled as Pn where n is for the nth stage. At this stage, there are
    sensors and actuators. Sensors are for measuring the quantity level of water in
    the tank, the pressure, and the water flow, and also for measuring properties
    such as conductivity, PH, and oxidation reduction potential. Electric pumps are
    motor valves which operate as actuators. The functionality of SWTP stages are
    as follows: Stage 1âRaw water for treatment; Stage 2âChemical dosing to treat
    water depending on the measurements from water quality sensors.; Ultrafiltration;
    Removal of free chlorine from water; Water passes to reverse osmosis process;
    Cleaning the ultrafiltration unit through the backwash process. 6.7. Challenges
    in Anomaly Detection Challenges faced during the process of anomaly detection
    and development are divided into the following categories: model creation; model
    deployment; and model training. 6.8. Challenges in Model Creation There are following
    challenges faced during model creation. Supervised vs. unsupervised learning Supervised
    machine learning (ML) is useful for attack detection [83,84]. Supervised ML models
    are unsuccessful in the detection of unknown attacks due to signature deficiency.
    The signature updating process is highly complex in ICS. Many researchers and
    industries prefer unsupervised learning for the process of attack detection [85,86]
    because unsupervised learning is designed on normal plant operation requirements.
    A comparison of supervised and unsupervised learning is presented in [85]. Unsupervised
    learning is more useful but can enhance the number of false alarms. Model localization:
    in a wide system, ICS is a complex distributed control system as there are several
    steps in the water treatment process that must be connected logically and physically.
    It is important to consider whether to create a single model for the whole throughout
    system or for different steps. Scalability: For this, ref. [87] is best work to
    consult. There is a sensor multitude consisting of pressure, level, quantity,
    and flow [88]. The work in question shows that unsupervised learning is better
    than supervised learning for attack detection in water treatment plants. Reliability
    and data availability. Model deployment is another challenging phase. Data sampling
    rate; System Modeling: In the system modeling process, modeling the entire physical
    state space during the training phase is also challenging. Model retraining: Once
    the detector has been validated, built, and tested in live plant operation, it
    may demonstrate a different performance than it did in the initial stages, and
    such observations also face challenges such as distribution shift, noisy data,
    attack localization, limiting the source attack, unbalanced data, alternation
    of parameters, process parameter changes, model validation, model complexity,
    and attack detection speed etc. 7. Vulnerabilities, Challenges, and Future Prospective
    in the IIoT Environment of Water Purification and Distribution Plants Vulnerabilities
    assessment in water purification and distribution plants assist in highlighting
    the malicious activity threat and trigger quick action which can minimize the
    risk of serious attack from attacker action [43]. This water distribution system
    vulnerability may impact the overall distribution or purification system [44].
    Assessment of vulnerability in a system provides a model by which to reduce the
    attack impact and reduce the cost. The above studies show that this modern purification
    plant is linked to open internet and IIoT-linked devices with a number of vulnerabilities,
    as listed below. 7.1. Physical Layer Vulnerabilities can be due to physical elements
    such as reservoirs, valves, pipes, motors, PLCs, distillation, tankers, etc. There
    can be faults or errors in any physical element which may lead to losses [47].
    7.2. Human Layer The human is the greatest point of vulnerability for an attacker.
    Usually, attackers use social engineering methods to enter the environment, and
    a social engineering attack is conducted via human factors such as employees,
    managers, and contractors, exploiting a personâs lack of education, greedy nature,
    or psychological issue [24]. 7.3. Cyber Layer SIn CADA and data acquisition etc.,
    some general vulnerabilities are as follows: Improper device management (such
    as installation of devices without any prior knowledge or planning); Insecure
    devices (such as old designed devices which are OT-designed but have no capacity
    to meet IT requirements); Insecure ecosystem; Use of old devices/components in
    a network environment (such as old PLCs, SCADA systems, and OT devices); Insecure
    Network connection (such as communication between sensors and PLCs, actuators
    and PLCs, or PLCs and SCADA communication). 7.4. Challenges and Future Prospective
    IIoT is linked with IT and OT. In the above real-world experiments, we studied
    attacks that happened in the water industry. We also studied the challenges in
    the real-world water industry. IIoT is not limited to the water industry; it covers
    all kinds of industries such as energy, chemical, oil and gas, health, agriculture,
    etc. The authors of [89] explained the means by which to overcome the challenges
    in water treatment plant security. Here, we would like to discuss some challenges
    in IIoT or Industry 4.0 [27]. Interoperability Even if the individual devices
    in an interconnected system operate in completely diverse fields, they must all
    be able to communicate with one another and speak the same language. In the world
    of the IoT, things are made more difficult by a lack of standard software interfaces,
    data formats, and networking protocols. Due to the incompatibility of various
    technologies, 40% of the Industrial IoTâs potential economic value will remain
    locked in the industry. The long lifespan of conventional equipment, which necessitates
    pricey retrofitting or replacement to work with the most recent technologies,
    further complicates the goal of seamless interoperability. Security The vulnerability
    to cyberattacks is greater than ever as more and more industrial users demand
    to be able to remotely access all of their Internet-connected devices and cloud-based
    services. Cybersecurity has hitherto concentrated on a small set of endpoints.
    With the introduction of the Industrial Internet, security must broaden its scope
    to cover both the real and virtual worlds. Reliability IP-based networks that
    are dependable are essential to the IoTâs development. Tried-and-true devices
    are also essential to a successful network. In the demanding operating environments
    typical of the oil, gas, maritime, power, and railway industries, device dependability
    in the IoT is extremely crucial. It is in these sectorsâ best interests to install
    robust enough devices because they will depend more and more on remote access.
    If the systemâs backend is unreliable, even the best-designed and most user-friendly
    front end will be useless. The adoption of the IoT will be negatively impacted
    by devices that are flawed or malfunctioning as a result of adverse climatic conditions
    such as excessive heat or cold. We are all acutely aware of the potential effects
    of device failure, including risks to individuals, expensive downtime, and incorrect
    data interpretation, to mention a few. A strong, high-performing backend infrastructure
    is crucial for the Industrial IoT to succeed. Scalability The unpleasant reality
    is that with billions of additional connected devices on the horizon and billions
    more now linked, millions of possible event failures are bound to occur. Infrastructures
    for industrial systems that are scalable and capable of extension are required.
    By 2020, more than 200 billion âConnected Thingsâ will exist worldwide, according
    to IDC. Future deployments will also see an increase in mobile, sporadic connectivity,
    and low-power devices that must interact with a dynamic environment. IoT systems
    must be scalable and adaptable, using software or additional functionality that
    seamlessly fits into a larger solution. Network Performance Simply put, most networks
    are not built to handle the problems of an increasing IoT. In order to incorporate
    video, speech, data, and control commands, integrated networks with high bandwidth
    are necessary given the trend toward multi-system integration and video surveillance.
    The limitations of legacy monitoring methods have already been reached. The requirement
    to collect and analyze an increasingly growing quantity of data points produced
    by billions of devices will put enormous pressure on networks to expand their
    bandwidth. In order to move this much data over the Internet, unprecedented amounts
    of bandwidth are required; otherwise, networks may experience bottlenecks. Management
    Construction of the Industrial IoT must take upgrades and maintenance into consideration.
    System administrators will be required to oversee all of the new systems as well
    as the original system as a complex web of interconnected devices grows. By giving
    network engineers the following tools, modern management solutions simplify their
    jobs. Application program Iiterfaces (APIs) are an effective tool for streamlining
    the creation of applications for managing devices or systems; A complete network
    administration solution that includes setup, running, upkeep, and diagnostics;
    Instead of relying solely on conventional maintenance schedules, predictive maintenance
    uses sensors to continuously monitor equipment to avert malfunctions and predict
    when maintenance will be necessary; Engineers can access real-time device status
    information and event notifications via mobile management apps; A productivity
    tool for quickly configuring and deploying devices Future Prospective of IIoT:
    The IIoT has a bright future ahead of it, with more options for internet-to-device
    connection and cost-effective predictive maintenance available to small enterprises
    and multinational organizations. The possibility of connecting more facilities
    will also increase as IIoT access becomes more affordable. Many experts also believe
    that WiFi-powered devices will eventually take the place of IoT devices that are
    currently powered by hardwired connections. Overall, more firms will profit from
    the IIoT as it becomes more widely available. In the futurem the IIoT will be
    useful in device management, advancement in sensor technology, predictive IoT
    gaining adoption, ensuring security, location tracking, keeping an eye on real-time
    data, IIoT as service, better operational efficiency, wuality control, and customer
    service. Predictive maintenance, digital twins, cloud edge computing and more
    connected devices. Furthermore, with the countless advantages of IIoT, experts
    are also concerned with the increase in cyberattacks. A study [90,91] shows that
    cybercrimeâs global cost will increase from USD 8.44 trillion in 2022 to USD 23.84
    trillion by 2027. According to [42,92], the Biden administration has vowed to
    overcome the security issues in the water and oil and gas industries. The U.S.
    government decided to take fast and quick action against such attacks, which an
    increase of 50% across the world in 2020 [92]. From the above study, we concluded
    that water purification and distribution are critical infrastructures; without
    water, there is no life, and there are serious impacts from cyberattacks on newly
    deployed water purification and distribution plants. We studied several real-life
    incidents and attack detection methods. From the study, it has been observed that
    there are limited attacks, but in the future, this number can increase. Moreover,
    current attack detection methods are insufficient and are unable to detect all
    kinds of attacks. Hence, there are several key challenges and research directions
    that can be addressed by researchers. It has been noticed from the above studies
    that attack impact can be minimized in purification and distribution plants; however,
    current research is insufficient to reduce the attack impact. Because of key components
    such as SCADA, PLCs, and sensors irregularities, faults occur, and these irregularities
    can cause tank overflow, pipe burst, valve locking, or motor outage. Available
    water distribution and purification systems deploy certain software and hardware
    tools to overcome the faults in the system but are limited and expensive. The
    water distribution and purification plant is a real-time environment and it should
    not halt its operation, even in a faulty situation. For this, there must be a
    fault tolerance algorithm or tool that can enhance resilience, separate the damaged
    or faulty components, and recover from attack effects. For such fault tolerance,
    deep learning techniques can be useful in attack or fault location identification.
    Deep learning techniques can also be useful in providing mitigation. It is important
    to design and develop safe and secure methods. Several studied techniques use
    deep learning-, machine learning-, or artificial intelligence-based algorithms
    [93]. However, there are some disadvantages to such approaches, such as ensemble
    datasets and high dimensional data. Furthermore, the ensemble dataset may cause
    inaccuracy in the dataset with respect to attack identification when using machine
    learning techniques. By reducing false negative rates, enhancing data training
    is also a key issue. The use of hybrid methods is more useful than others. In
    addition, at time of writing, there has been no work on explaining and detecting
    the various kinds of attacks in water purification and distribution systems, so
    it needs more research and attention. IoT devices with various smart devices developed
    in a purification plant permit transparency in water transportation systems such
    as monitoring and processing systems. Because of limited resources, the network
    becomes vulnerable. In this case, privacy and security are both key challenges
    because of the IoT deviceâs properties such as less battery timing, low capacity,
    low memory, and regulations. Violation of privacy reduces the water acceptance
    level. The key objective of privacy violation is to access private data such as
    customer data, monitoring data, system functioning data, etc. To date, there has
    been a lack or deficiency of universal IoT security devices with which to secure
    the water treatment and distribution plant. To meet the new advanced technology
    devices, there should be a universal algorithm designed to secure the water supply.
    For reliability, safety, and security, we require enhancements to the network
    communication security wit respect to the varying data in various components of
    the ICS environment. For data exchange, there are heterogeneous networks like
    wide area networks (WAN), home area Nntworks (HAN), WiFi, etc. This variation
    in the communication network can become the cause of major cyber attacks in the
    ICS environment. There are various issues such as verification of heterogeneous
    networks, key management, access control, and privacy protection. In addition,
    in smart water purification and distribution plants, there is an exchange of data
    over the network, and they store data in the network or in the central system
    such as SCADA, due to which the attackerâs key objective remains targeting the
    SCADA system to obtain control of the ICS environment. There is a requirement
    for suitable tools to be installed in a suitable place. Most of the studies show
    similar attacks and, overall, the work is very limited. For consensus and robustness
    in water plant security systems, there is a requirement for new, advanced, and
    updated systems or algorithms that can overcome these issues. Anti-detection attacks,
    collaborative attacks, and multiple-factor attacks are future research directions
    in water purification and distribution plants. 8. Cyber Safety Tips in IIoT Everyone
    understands the importance of water and the water industry in his/her life and
    of protecting it from digital threats. Many organizations have provided guidelines
    with which to protect their plants from cyber attacks. The following are some
    basic guidelines for cyber security protection in IIoT and the water industry
    [94]: Avoid revealing personal or sensitive data to phishers; Never click or open
    any malicious link; Prefer to use a VPN when using public WiFi; Avoid plugging
    an unknown USB into your computer; Before downloading software, verify its legitimacy;
    Keep software updated; Employ up-to-date patches; Select prevention over detection
    technology. In conclusion, we can say that water purification and distribution
    plants can be improved via reliability, security, mitigation, detection, and recovery
    techniques. There should be due consideration of cryptography algorithms such
    as network communication security, IoT devices security, and cyberâphysical design
    security. At the time of writing this review, there has been very limited work
    on the security of water purification and distribution plants. In the future,
    quality research should be conducted in this domain. 9. Discussion There are âEvil
    Eyesâ in the water purification and distribution industry that are creating serious
    issues for the community, society, and even humanity. It has been noted that these
    evil eyes are becoming greedy and targeting the industry more and more. The progress
    of technology is leaving several vulnerabilities in the system and providing gateways
    to evil eyes through which to observe and enter the system. It has been noted
    that in traditional or old water distribution systems, evil eyes could only damage
    the OT infrastructure, while the integration of IT and OT provided an opportunity
    for these evil eyes to disturb the overall system, vary the chemicals, and can
    obtain control of the SCADA system. In this paper we provided some real incidents
    that occurred because of these evil eyes. We studied system weak point âvulnerabilitiesâ
    and affected countries and case studies in detail. We also discussed the impact
    of evil eyes on the environment/system. We explained that evil eyes used advanced
    technologies such as IT and OT architecture, which are vulnerable to the internet.
    They are easy targets for evil eyes because of the number of potential objectives
    to which they are vulnerable, such as getting control of the network, intalling
    ransomware, varying the chemicals in the water, etc. We feel it necessary to share
    real case incidents the researchers and industrialists for secure network planning.
    Most of the cyberattack incidents happened in the USA, while Ukraine, Israel,
    and the UK are also affected countries. At the time of writing this review, there
    was little awareness in society regarding evil eye issues and their effects on
    the water purification and distribution industry. Most attackers are grouped based
    on their specific target and objective. Different attacker groups are divided
    into cyber-terrorists, who cause physical damage to the system; script kiddies,
    who engage in social engineering attacks such as motivating unskilled labour for
    entry purposes; hacktivists, who have political or social objectives; and cyber-criminals,
    who have financial objectives, etc. Researchers also studied [95] a few other
    groups, such as internal actors, cyber actors, and black hats. The classification
    depends on the attackerâs objectives and whether the attacker originates from
    inside or outside the system. We also summarized the attackerâs means of entering
    the ICS environment. We provided examples of vulnerabilities in the system, attackersâ
    target points, and attacker entranceways. We noted that at the time of writing,
    there was no universal algorithm/technique/mechanism that could secure the water
    industry from these evil eyes. There is a need for a universal algorithm that
    could detect, deny, and deceive these evil eyes to protect the plant process.
    In this paper, we provided the future prospects of cyber security in IIoT and
    water purification and distribution plants. We also provided some security tips
    with which to keep the industrial environment secure from these evil eyes. This
    survey paper worked on residential, agricultural, and industrial water applications.
    Studying recent attack incidents and researchersâ efforts, it appears that the
    development of water monitoring systems to assess the effects of cyber attacks
    on water quality remains the only focus of research in water and wastewater distribution
    and purification applications. First and foremost, developing precise, improved
    detection technologies is crucial. Nowadays, the majority of techniques use artificial
    neural networks or machine learning techniques. Second, the reliability of data
    exchange across various WDS components can be increased by strengthening network
    and communication security. Third, the Internet of Things (IoT) and other intelligent
    devices provide the water distribution system (WDS) with more utility by ensuring
    real-time monitoring and automatic processing while allowing transparency in the
    water supply chain processes. Finally, there is great attention paid to the attack
    effect in the WDS. In conclusion, measures for mitigation, recovery, and prevention
    can all improve the WDS. We must take into account both secure software and hardware.
    Cryptographic algorithms, security network/communication protocols, cyberâphysical
    system designs, and device-level security (such as IoT security), etc., should
    all be taken into account. According to the literature, there is still a dearth
    of studies on security for the WDS. Future studies could be conducted on a wide
    range of subjects. 10. Conclusions The global organized society is currently being
    impacted, and will continue to be impacted, by the issue of cyber-security. Additionally,
    as infrastructure becomes more interconnected and communicative, a significant
    issue with cyberâphysical security will arise in key infrastructure, such as the
    water supply. This paper provided a comprehensive study of the evil eyes in water
    purification and distribution systems. We discussed real-world cases in the water
    industry, vulnerabilities, gateways, and evil eye targets. This paper highlighted
    current real-world cases that occurred in the water and wastewater purification
    and distribution industry. In this paper, we highlighted how attackers obtain
    entrance into an ICS system. We covered a number of vulnerabilities and challenges
    in the system. This paper is useful for securing the ICS environment of water
    purification and distribution systems and other industries targetted by the evil
    eye. There are a large number of incidents in the water industry, but we covered
    only a few of the major incidents for better understanding of readers. We highlighted
    open challenges in the ICS environment of the water industry and other industries
    under the threat of evil eyes. We also presented the future prospects of IIoT
    in an ICS environment and some useful tips. Our paper is intended to promote sufficient
    knowledge and awareness in the community. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Introduction On 6 February 2023, a Mw 7.8 earthquake destroyed southern and central
    Turkey as well as northern and western Syria. 37 km (23 miles) west-northwest
    of Gaziantep is where the epicenter was. The earthquake near Antakya, Hatay Province,
    peaked with a Mercalli rating of XII (Extreme) as mentioned in [1]. The epicenter
    of the strong earthquake, followed by the one that occurred on February 6 by nine
    hours, was 95 km (59 miles) to the north-northeast of the most recent one. There
    was significant destruction and tens of thousands of deaths. At least 57,300 fatalities
    had been reported as of 20 March 2023, with more than 50,000 of those occurring
    in Turkey and more than 7200 in Syria [2]. It was the deadliest natural disaster
    in the history of Turkey and the largest natural disaster to hit Turkey in modern
    times since the earthquake in Antioch in 526 [3]. Aside from being the deadliest
    earthquake since the 1822 Aleppo earthquake in modern-day Syria, it was also the
    worst earthquake worldwide since the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the sixth deadliest
    of the twenty-first century [4]. The fourth-costliest earthquakes on record, damages
    in Turkey were expected to total USD 104 billion, and in Syria, USD 5.1 billion
    [5]. There are strong correlations between earthquakes, climate changes, and mining
    activities [6,7,8]. Many scientists have predicted that the frequency of earthquakes
    will keep increasing [9]. Figure 1 illustrates the location of earthquakes that
    occurred in the last 12 months with intensity larger than 7 Moment W-phase (Mww).
    In [10], the first paper on the idea of earthquake early warning systems (EEWS)
    in 1985 was presented. These systems are networks of ground-based sensors that
    alert users when the earth starts to tremble. Figure 1. Major earthquakes that
    occurred in the last 12 months as reported in [11]. EEWS operates under the assumption
    that, despite the slow speed at which seismic waves move, electronic alerts from
    the epicenter region may be delivered almost instantly. The process is as follows:
    Several types of seismic waves radiate from an earthquakeâs epicenter. Sensors
    are activated by P-waves, which are weaker but move more quickly. Thereafter,
    sensors send signals to cloud servers for processing. Algorithms in the cloud
    server instantly determine the location, magnitude, and severity of an earthquake.
    How big is it? Who will suffer from this? The technology sends out an alert before
    slower but more destructive S-waves and surface waves arrive. Those who are close
    to the epicenter will not receive much, if any, warning beforehand, while those
    who are farther away could only have a few seconds to brace themselves. EWS may
    help reduce some of the injuries and damage caused by large earthquakes when used
    in conjunction with automated countermeasures such as stopping trains or turning
    off gas lines. Recent years have seen a significant increase in the number of
    traditional as well as contemporary technology utilized in EEWSs [12,13,14]. As
    a consequence of this, effective integration of the numerous scientific fields
    is sought after in order to serve such crucial systems. In general, actions taken
    to reduce risks, conduct seismic hazard assessments, determine site specifications,
    and the like can be of assistance in this regard [15,16,17,18,19]. Developing
    a reliable EEWS necessitates solving a number of issues that are impacted by the
    ongoing difficulties associated with earthquake catastrophes. These issues include
    the observation of earthquake characteristics, and the environment type [20,21,22,23,24,25].
    Radio-frequency identification, satellite systems, the Internet of Things (IoT),
    network functions virtualization (NFV), 5G, software-defined networks (SDN), data
    networks, and a variety of other technologies have all been the focus of significant
    research in recent years in an effort to lessen the damage that earthquakes cause
    [26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34]. For instance, satellite systems have been used to
    track earthquake movements, and IoT sensors have been used to detect earthquakes
    and provide early warnings. Furthermore, 5G and SDN technologies have been deployed
    for real-time communication and data transmission in emergency situations. These
    technologies have greatly enhanced the accuracy and speed of earthquake detection
    and warning systems and have improved the response time of emergency services.
    Moreover, the integration of robots and the internet has the potential to be a
    significant breakthrough in this field. According to [35], a new integrated system
    named ârobot-eventâ has been proposed, which is able to execute autonomous inspections
    and emergency responses to a severe event. The robot uses real-time image tracking
    to inspect the indoor environment and help any human victims found on the ground.
    It operates in structurally sound houses with moderate damage, focusing on situations
    where people are at risk from falling furniture. The system was tested indoors
    to assess its functionality and operation alongside a smart EEWS. This new technology
    has the potential to significantly reduce the risk of human casualties during
    an earthquake by providing timely and accurate information to emergency responders.
    Future research in this area could explore further the use of robotics, artificial
    intelligence, and the internet to develop more advanced and efficient EEWSs. The
    research conducted in the literature regarding remote sensing applications facilitated
    by satellite communication systems did not cease with the studies by [36,37].
    It also encompassed NFV and SDN, which involved gateways via IoT as well as Micro-Electro-Mechanical
    systems (MEMS), as noted in [38,39,40,41]. The primary objective of this endeavor
    was to provide relief to areas that had suffered damage or destruction on a large
    scale. Virtualization played a critical role in this, as it could help mitigate
    the risks posed by natural disasters. As highlighted in [42], such networks must
    be designed to optimize node lifetimes. In addition, ref. [43] presented a tragic
    scenario that showcased an EEWS designed to facilitate a safe evacuation plan
    against disaster risks by combining cloud-based IoT with heterogeneous networks.
    Similarly, the combination of IoT and current communication technologies and techniques
    could prove to be crucial in ensuring the smooth and secure transfer of data,
    as stated in [44,45,46,47,48,49]. The studies mentioned here are accompanied by
    conventional approaches to earthquake detection and analysis, as well as methods
    for distinguishing between different types of fault ruptures, which have been
    extensively investigated in the relevant academic literature [50]. In [51], a
    local similarity earthquake detection approach based on the nearest neighbor method
    was proposed to determine whether an earthquake had occurred by examining the
    consistency of received signals from the nearest neighbors of targeted stations
    and their closest neighbors. On the other hand, refs. [52,53] focused more on
    determining the earthquakeâs amplitude in the first few seconds of its occurrence
    rather than the complete rupture. However, conventional methods take a significant
    amount of time to calculate earthquake parameters [54], highlighting the need
    for additional efforts and studies. Early research suggests that it is possible
    to accurately predict the magnitude and depth of an earthquake using a graph CNN
    model that employs batch normalization and attention mechanism techniques. This
    model can be used in any location with any seismic nodes. The variability of seismic
    waves and the complexity of the Earthâs structure suggest that there is ample
    room for innovative and adaptable solutions. With the help of modern technologies,
    the impact of earthquakes on the studied region in [54] can be significantly reduced.
    An increasingly useful technology for disaster management is drones. They can
    be used to gather real-time data and give emergency responders situational awareness,
    which can aid in improved decision-making and more efficient responses. Drones
    with cameras and sensors can survey disaster regions swiftly and safely, collecting
    precise imagery and data that can be used to assess damage, spot areas that require
    immediate attention, and organize rescue and recovery efforts [55]. Drones can
    also be used to transport people in hazardous or hard-to-reach locations necessary
    goods such as food and medical supplies [56]. Drones are an important tool in
    emergency management because they have the potential to greatly speed up and enhance
    the efficiency of disaster response efforts. 5G and B5G networks offer several
    advantages for emergency communication, including faster data transmission speeds,
    lower latency, and improved reliability [57,58,59]. These networks can enable
    real-time communication between emergency responders and affected individuals,
    as well as the seamless transfer of data and video feeds from IoT devices, such
    as sensors and drones [60,61,62]. In particular, D2D communication can play a
    crucial role in emergency situations, as it allows devices to communicate directly
    with each other without relying on a centralized network [63,64]. This can be
    especially useful in scenarios where network infrastructure may be damaged or
    overloaded, as D2D communication can operate on a peer-to-peer basis and bypass
    the need for a central network [65,66]. In an earthquake early warning system,
    D2D communication could allow sensors to share data with each other and trigger
    alerts in real-time without relying on a centralized system [67,68]. Edge computing
    can also be leveraged to enhance the performance of earthquake early warning systems
    [69,70]. By processing data closer to the source, edge computing can reduce the
    amount of data that needs to be transmitted to centralized servers and enable
    faster response times [71,72]. For example, in an earthquake early warning system
    that uses drones to collect data, edge computing could be used to process the
    data on the drones themselves, rather than transmitting it back to a central server
    for processing [73,74]. This would not only reduce the amount of data that needs
    to be transmitted but also enable faster response times in the event of an earthquake
    [75]. Cloud computing helps manage disasters. Disaster management firms can swiftly
    deploy vital apps and services to assist emergency response activities using cloud
    platformsâ scalability, flexibility, and accessibility. Cloud-based technologies
    can monitor and analyze disaster data in real time, helping emergency responders
    manage resources. Cloud systems can store and handle enormous volumes of data,
    such as maps, satellite imaging, and social media feeds, to help businesses better
    analyze disasters. Cloud-based communication and collaboration solutions can also
    help rescuers communicate, coordinate, and stay linked during the pandemonium.
    Cloud computing may make disaster management businesses more agile, responsive,
    and effective in saving lives and minimizing damage. Fog and edge computing are
    distributed computing methods that provide computing resources near data sources.
    Fog computing is a dispersed computing infrastructure that processes data near
    its source. Edge computing brings computing resources to the end-user or device.
    Fog and edge computing are important in natural disaster detection and control.
    Natural disasters damage communication networks, making data collection and transmission
    difficult. Fog and edge computing provide local data processing and analysis without
    data centers or clouds. In the aftermath of a disaster, time is of the essence
    because communication infrastructure may be compromised [76,77,78,79]. For example,
    sensors deployed in an area prone to flooding can collect data on water levels,
    flow rates, and other factors that can help predict and manage the impact of a
    flood. By using edge and fog computing, this data can be analyzed in real-time,
    allowing for EWS to be put in place and emergency responders to be deployed more
    quickly [80]. Similarly, sensors can be used to detect seismic activity and predict
    earthquakes, with data processed locally to provide early warning and minimize
    damage. Overall, fog and edge computing play an important role in natural disaster
    detection and management by enabling real-time data processing and analysis at
    the edge of the network [81]. This approach can help improve the speed and accuracy
    of disaster response, ultimately leading to better outcomes for affected communities.
    Verification and validation (V&V) techniques are crucial for ensuring the quality,
    reliability, and security of software systems in the context of IoT and cloud
    computing [82,83]. These systems involve a complex network of devices, sensors,
    and services that must work together seamlessly and securely [84]. V&V techniques
    provide a framework for testing and validating these systems, ensuring that they
    meet the specified requirements and perform as intended. By implementing V&V techniques,
    developers can identify and correct defects and errors before they cause significant
    problems, ultimately leading to higher quality and more reliable IoT and cloud
    systems [85]. In [86], the authors reviewed geospatial and remote sensing technologies
    in earthquake research and disaster management, analyzing their historical and
    future applications, limitations, and methodologies. It provides a framework for
    earthquake hazard, vulnerability, and risk analysis using geospatial technologies.
    In [87], the study examined remote sensing applications, including Landsat satellite
    imaging, LiDAR, optical satellite photography, InSAR, and DEMETER in earthquake
    research. Many other studies [88,89,90] explore the role of IoT in disaster management
    and compares IoT-based options for various calamities. It highlights IoT EWS for
    fires and earthquakes and advises stakeholders on leveraging IoT technology to
    secure smart citiesâ infrastructure and minimize risks. The studies also evaluate
    Caribbean DRM (Disaster and Risk Management) systems, emphasizing the need for
    technology and new methods in monitoring disaster risks in small island states.
    It assesses technology in the five DRM pillars and proposes improvements for technology
    adoption in the Caribbean subregion. The research contributes to the global discussion
    on technology and innovation in DRM and addresses sustainable development concerns
    in Caribbean SIDS (Small Islands Developing States). The review paper [91] explores
    building damage mapping techniques in post-earthquake scenarios, emphasizing machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning frameworks. It addresses the drawbacks of manual
    interpretation of remote sensing imagery and identifies research gaps. The study
    of [92] reviews remote sensing methods for earthquake risk assessment, highlighting
    the importance of vulnerability assessment and the need for a comprehensive approach.
    In [93], satellite remote sensing technology for EEWS is suggested to achieve
    more improvements for EWS. The research of [94] examines post-earthquake damage
    investigation using optical remote sensing data and change detection algorithms,
    discussing their challenges and potential. The authors in [95] analyze how emerging
    technologies improve disaster management processes and call for further investigation.
    Lastly, the work done in [96] presents a procedure for managing pre- and post-earthquake
    stages of structure management using digital tools and emphasizes the role of
    BIM models and IDM standards. Compared to previous works, our paper presents a
    comprehensive overview of the role of EEWS in disaster assessment and relief,
    specifically focusing on the use of IoT networks and cloud infrastructure. The
    paper provides fundamental concepts about seismic waves and associated signal
    processing, details on the EEWS IoT system, and a taxonomy of EEWS approaches
    using emerging IoT and cloud facilities. Additionally, our paper elaborates on
    a generic IoT-enabled EEWS architecture, discusses dronesâ role in disaster management,
    and provides a summary of the primary verification and validation (V&V) methods
    required for the systems under consideration. Finally, the paper describes research
    gaps in this research domain and provides future directions. While previous papers
    have discussed geospatial technologies, remote sensing, and social media platformsâ
    use in earthquake research, disaster management, and catastrophe response, our
    paper focuses on the role of IoT and cloud infrastructure in EEWS and provides
    a comprehensive overview of the many elements needed to realize an EEWS. Table
    1 is intended to provide a comparison of our work with previous works in the field
    of earthquake research and disaster management. It summarizes the main focus,
    methodology, and contributions of each paper, highlighting the unique contributions
    of our work in relation to other research in this domain. Table 1. Comparison
    of our work with previous works. The following is a list of the key contributions
    that the paper makes, highlighting the various points of innovation: We clarify
    why the EEWS is advantageous for smart cities. We emphasize the growth of IoT
    usage, as well as the IoT system framework in general and its constituent parts.
    We have developed a thorough taxonomy of IoT devices that includes various topics
    such as the source of data, environment, measured parameters, and factors of validation.
    We present a standard design for the IoT that takes into account potential emergency
    management. We discuss the verification and validation concerns related to using
    IoT-based EEWS. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates
    some generic notions about seismic waves and signals. Section 3 provides an overview
    of IoT-Cloud systems. Section 4 depicts the IoT and cloud techniques integration
    in terms of EEWS. Section 5 presents an overview of the verification and validation
    issues associated with the use of IoT-Cloud-based EEWS. Section 6 lists the main
    open challenges, concludes the work, and identifies some potential future work
    directions. 2. Seismic Waves and Seismic Signal Processing Techniques Seismic
    activity is a key subject of investigation. Understanding how different types
    of structures respond to earthquake loads and finding out how to safeguard occupants
    of a structure in an earthquake are both aided by this knowledge. The study of
    seismicity can help us better understand the many seismic wave types that are
    generated, allowing us to map both the regions that are earthquake-prone and those
    that are not. Studying a regionâs seismic activity aids in establishing minimum
    safety requirements for that area, making it simpler for life to go on after an
    earthquake [97,98]. Acoustic energy, known as a seismic wave, can move through
    the Earth or another planetary body. It could be caused by a quake (or an earthquake
    more generally), a volcanic eruption, the movement of magma, a big landslide,
    or a sizable explosion brought on by human activity, such as mining, which releases
    low-frequency acoustic energy. Seismologists are responsible for investigating
    seismic waves. To record the waves, seismologists use accelerometers, hydrophones,
    or seismometers that are submerged in water [99]. It is important to differentiate
    seismic waves from seismic noise, also known as ambient vibration, which is characterized
    by a continuous low-amplitude vibration and can be caused by a wide variety of
    natural and artificial sources. Arrays of sensors are typically used in seismic
    signal processing, which is followed by signal conditioning and data fusion. An
    ADC converter is then used to digitize the gathered data, and a microcontroller
    is used to process it. This is referred to as an IoT node in the context of the
    IoT, and it is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. IoT sensor node for EEWS. It is possible
    to differentiate between the two types of seismic waves known as body waves, which
    move through the inside of the planet, and surface waves, which move along the
    surface of the planet. Body waves flow through the interior of the Earth in a
    manner that is determined by the paths that are created by material properties
    such as density and modulus (stiffness). Temperature, chemical composition, and
    the state of the material all have an effect on the materialâs modulus and density.
    This phenomenon can be compared to the refraction of light waves. On the basis
    of how particles move, body waves can be divided into two distinct categories:
    primary and secondary waves. Around the year 1830, the French mathematician SimÃ©on
    Denis Poisson identified this distinction as follows [100]: Primary waves, also
    referred to as P-waves, are longitudinal compressional waves that move through
    the earth in a straight line. These waves are known as âprimaryâ waves because
    they arrive first at seismograph stations, traveling faster through the earth
    than other types of waves. P-waves are pressure waves that can travel through
    any material, including fluids, and move at a speed that is around 1.7 times faster
    than that of S-waves. In contrast to S-waves, which are transverse waves that
    move side-to-side, P-waves are compression waves that cause particles in the material
    they are traveling through to move back and forth in the direction of the waveâs
    propagation. They take the form of sound waves in the air and move at the same
    velocity as sound waves, which is around 330 m per second on average. The ability
    of P-waves to travel through any material allows them to be used to study the
    interior of the earth. By measuring the time taken for P-waves to travel through
    the earth from an earthquakeâs epicenter to a seismograph station, scientists
    can calculate information about the earthâs internal structure. For example, the
    average speed of P-waves in granite is roughly 5000 m per second, while in water,
    it is around 1450 m per second. This information can be used to create a detailed
    model of the Earthâs interior. S-waves, also known as secondary shear waves, are
    transverse waves that cause the ground to shift in a direction perpendicular to
    their propagation during an earthquake. These waves arrive at seismograph stations
    after P-waves, which are faster. S-waves have a horizontal polarization and move
    in a horizontal direction, causing the ground to shift from side to side. However,
    S-waves can only travel through solids since liquids and gases do not support
    shear forces. They move through any solid medium at a speed that is approximately
    60% slower than P-waves. The absence of S-waves in the outer core of the Earth
    is consistent with the presence of liquid. This is because S-waves cannot propagate
    through liquids, and their absence indicates that the outer core is predominantly
    liquid. However, P-waves can propagate through liquids, which is why they can
    travel through the entire Earth. The study of seismic waves and their behavior
    has provided scientists with valuable insights into the structure and composition
    of the Earthâs interior. The path that seismic surface waves take along the surface
    of the Earth [101]. These are an example of a type of surface wave known as mechanical
    surface waves. They are referred to as surface waves because their strength decreases
    as they go away from the oceanâs surface. They move at a much slower pace compared
    to seismic body waves (P and S). The amplitude of surface waves can reach several
    millimeters during particularly powerful earthquakes. Seismographs that are situated
    at a greater distance from the epicenter of an earthquake are unable to detect
    the high frequencies of the first P wave. In contrast, seismographs that are situated
    closer to the epicenter are able to record both the P and S waves that are generated
    when an earthquake takes place [102]. The problems that are associated with seismic
    data are probably unmatched by any others. During the course of the past few decades,
    the amounts of such data have nearly multiplied exponentially [103]. In recent
    acquisition studies, petabits of data are being processed on a daily basis. This
    requires massive processing capabilities. It should, therefore, not come as a
    surprise that data formats have evolved significantly over the years and that
    they have been altered to meet particular workflows or software solutions, which
    has added to the complexity of managing data [104]. In recent years, the industry
    of exploration and production has been dealing with âbig dataâ in the form of
    seismic data [105]. This data is collected during seismic surveys. As more and
    more varieties of data are gathered and reprocessed for a variety of purposes,
    the amount and volume of data continue to grow at an alarming rate. It is necessary
    to locate and manage both field and prestack data because new insights can be
    derived from old data by applying updated seismic processing methods. Because
    of this, it is important to keep track of both sets of data. Several companies
    made the decision to store this information on tapes because of the massive size
    of seismic data files and the prohibitively expensive cost of disk space. However,
    tapes were difficult to handle and regularly went missing, so this was not an
    ideal solution. Web-based viewers and administration tools make it easier to discover
    and handle data from anywhere in the world. At the same time, tiered storage and
    cloud storage offer new and more cost-effective means of keeping enormous seismic
    datasets [106]. Figure 3 shows the enhancements of the utilized earthquake measurement.
    Figure 3. Earthquake measurement evolution. Seismic wave analysis is a key component
    of earthquake early warning systems, as it enables the detection and characterization
    of seismic waves in real-time [107,108]. One of the most widely used signal processing
    techniques in seismic wave analysis is the Fourier transform, which is used to
    transform time-domain signals into frequency-domain signals [109,110]. In earthquake
    early warning systems, the Fourier transform is often used to analyze the spectral
    content of seismic waves, which can provide important information about the location,
    magnitude, and duration of an earthquake [111]. The Fourier transform is also
    used to filter out noise and unwanted signals from seismic data, improving the
    accuracy of earthquake detection and analysis [112]. Another advanced signal processing
    technique used in seismic wave analysis is wavelet analysis, which is used to
    analyze signals that are both time-varying and non-stationary [113,114,115]. In
    earthquake early warning systems, wavelet analysis is often used to detect and
    analyze seismic waves that have complex frequency components, such as those generated
    by slow earthquakes or volcanic activity [116,117]. By decomposing a seismic waveform
    into its constituent frequency components, wavelet analysis can provide more detailed
    information on the characteristics of seismic waves, such as their frequency content,
    duration, and amplitude [118,119]. In addition to these advanced signal processing
    techniques, earthquake early warning systems also rely on a variety of specific
    parameters to optimize their performance [120,121]. These parameters include sampling
    rates, window sizes, and filter cutoff frequencies, among others. Sampling rates
    determine how often seismic data is collected and stored, while window sizes determine
    the length of time over which seismic data is analyzed. Filter cutoff frequencies
    determine which frequency components of a seismic waveform are analyzed and are
    often used to remove noise and unwanted signals from seismic data. In conclusion,
    earthquake early warning systems rely on a variety of advanced signal processing
    techniques and specific parameters to detect and analyze seismic waves in real
    time. By providing more detailed information on these techniques and parameters,
    we aim to enhance the technical rigor of our paper and improve the understanding
    of the underlying technology. By optimizing the performance of earthquake early
    warning systems through advanced signal processing techniques and specific parameters,
    we can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of these systems, ultimately helping
    to save lives and reduce the impact of earthquakes on communities. 3. IoT-Cloud
    Systems 3.1. IoT Systems The IoT is gaining increasing support as a viable new
    technology throughout the world [122,123]. An IoT is a system that relies on connected
    embedded items or gadgets that have identifiers and are able to interact with
    one another without the assistance of humans using a common communication protocol.
    It has been reported that there are more internet-connected devices on the earth
    than there are humans, where these devices support the smart cities establishment
    [124,125,126]. Some smart cities are already in existence [127]. The growth of
    intelligent technology is outlined on Statistaâs website [128] under Figure 4.
    As has been suggested, an enormous increase in smart homes as well as commercial
    buildings, and important requirements for these buildings will include intelligent
    electricity and water management [129]. Statista projects that the number of IoT
    devices will nearly triple between 2020 and 2030, going from 9.7 billion in 2020
    to more than 29 billion in 2030. Over 5 billion consumer IoT devices are expected
    to exist in China by 2030. Accordingly, it is the nation with the majority of
    these devices. Consumer markets make use of IoT devices; nevertheless, it is anticipated
    that the consumer market will account for more than 60 percent of all IoT-connected
    devices by the year 2020 [128]. For the next decade, it is anticipated that this
    proportion will not change from its current value. Figure 4. Estimated growth
    of IoT nodes. According to [130,131,132,133,134], several industry verticals now
    have more than 100 million connected IoT devices, including government, retail
    and wholesale, transportation and storage, electricity, steam, gas, air conditioning,
    waste management, water supply, and retail and wholesale. It is predicted that
    by 2030, over 8,000,000 IoT nodes will be employed in all industries [128]. In
    addition, cell phones can represent the best contributor to IoT nodes. Interestingly,
    it is expected to reach nearly 17 billion by 2030, and more than one billion would
    be used to connected (autonomous) vehicles [128], information technology infrastructure,
    asset tracking and monitoring, and smart grids [135,136,137]. While configuring
    an IoT system, the following steps should be carried out in accordance with established
    industry standards [138,139,140,141,142,143]: Providing the node with an interface
    that can collect data from the environment. Providing a tool for acquiring and
    analyzing data in order to derive knowledge from it. Taking action and communicating
    choices and information to the appropriate hubs. To gain a comprehensive understanding
    of an IoT solutionâs architecture, it is necessary to examine multiple IoT systems.
    As shown in Figure 5, an IoT systemâs framework typically consists of a sensor
    network that monitors changes in the surrounding environment. Depending on the
    required transmission speed and distance, the collected stream should be transmitted
    to a centralized or decentralized administration using, e.g., Zigbee, Bluetooth,
    Tmote Sky, 4G, etc. It is important to note that the sensor system needs a continuous
    source of electricity, and the choice of connectivity is influenced by power consumption,
    with mobile service requiring more power than WiFi, 474.67 to 576.64 mW and 1254.3
    to 1540.6 mW, respectively [144]. Safety considerations for both hardware and
    connectivity are also crucial. An IoT systemâs data is reviewed or saved in the
    cloud system to identify patterns and extrapolate information, a critical requirement
    for any IoT system. The data can be simplified using data visualization, and alert
    systems can be implemented to provide appropriate levels of caution to users.
    It is essential that IoT system design is not limited to industry professionals
    only. Figure 5. A general IoT system paradigm. The IoT has the potential to revolutionize
    methods of detecting and managing disasters. With the help of IoT devices, we
    can collect real-time data on various environmental factors such as temperature,
    humidity, air pressure, and wind speed, which can help us detect natural disasters
    such as hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes. These devices can also monitor infrastructure
    such as bridges, dams, and buildings for any signs of damage or weakness and alert
    authorities before they collapse or fail, preventing further damage and loss of
    life. Moreover, IoT can aid disaster management by providing real-time updates
    on the affected areas, helping authorities plan and allocate resources effectively.
    Smart sensors and cameras can be deployed to assess the extent of the damage in
    disaster-stricken areas, and drones can be used to reach inaccessible areas and
    gather more information. This data can be analyzed using ML algorithms to identify
    patterns and predict future disasters [145,146], improving the accuracy of EWS
    and minimizing the impact of disasters. Another significant advantage of IoT in
    disaster management is its ability to facilitate communication between emergency
    responders and victims. Wearable devices and mobile apps can help victims send
    alerts and SOS messages, and responders can use IoT devices to locate and rescue
    survivors in real time. IoT can also help in tracking the movements of rescue
    teams and ensuring their safety. The use of IoT for disaster detection and management
    has the potential to save countless lives and minimize the impact of disasters.
    By leveraging IoT devices to collect real-time data, authorities can detect disasters
    early, manage resources effectively, and respond quickly to save lives. However,
    it is crucial to address concerns about data privacy and security to ensure the
    safe and ethical use of IoT in disaster management. Drones, also known as unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs), have come a long way since their inception in the early
    20th century [147]. Initially used for military purposes, drones have evolved
    and diversified over time, and today they have a wide range of applications in
    various fields, including photography, agriculture, search and rescue, and disaster
    management [148]. In addition, it can be equipped with thermal imaging sensors
    that can also be used to detect the presence of survivors in collapsed buildings
    or other hard-to-reach areas [149]. There are several types of drones (Figure
    6), each with unique characteristics and capabilities. The most common types of
    drones are fixed-wing, rotary-wing, and hybrid drones. Fixed-wing drones are similar
    to airplanes and can fly for longer distances, while rotary-wing drones, also
    known as quadcopters, are more agile and can hover in place. Hybrid drones combine
    features of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing drones, providing a balance between
    endurance and agility. Figure 6. Different types of UAVs. Drones can be involved
    in various types of communications (Figure 7), including visual, auditory, and
    data communication. Visual communication involves transmitting images and videos
    captured by the droneâs camera to a remote operator or a ground station. Auditory
    communication can include transmitting audio messages, such as warnings or instructions,
    to individuals or groups on the ground via a speaker on the drone. Data communication
    involves transmitting data, such as telemetry and sensor readings, between the
    drone and a ground station or another device. Additionally, drones can be equipped
    with communication technologies such as satellite communication, Wi-Fi, and cellular
    networks to enable long-range communication and control. In [150], the authors
    exploited the UAVs to collect data for disaster management relying on 5G (fifth
    generation) and B5G (beyond 5G) systems with their huge capacity in terms of different
    data types. The authors investigated various literature solutions to some UAV
    issues, such as energy harvesting and security. For example, they mentioned a
    sample method that used UAVs to find the most suitable localization of the sensor
    nodes for optimizing Quality of Service. Figure 7. Possible types of communications
    between UAVs and end-users. In recent years, advances in technology have enabled
    the integration of new sensing and data collection methods into EEWS systems,
    including the use of drones [151,152]. Drone-based sensing can provide high-resolution
    data on earthquake characteristics, such as ground motion and deformation, which
    can improve the accuracy and effectiveness of EEWS systems [153,154]. The main
    advantages and limitations of the use of drones is summarized in Table 2. Table
    2. Main Advantages and Limitations of Drones. Real-time communication is also
    essential for the timely dissemination of earthquake alerts, and various communication
    technologies, including satellite and wireless networks, are used to transmit
    sensor data and alerts to processing centers and end-users [155]. In addition,
    the integration of EEWS systems with IoT and cloud infrastructure can provide
    scalability, fault-tolerance, and data processing capabilities [156]. IoT devices,
    such as accelerometers and GPS sensors, can provide additional data sources for
    earthquake monitoring and analysis. In contrast, cloud infrastructure can provide
    storage and processing capabilities for large-scale data analysis and modeling
    [157]. Coordination between these various technical aspects is essential for the
    successful deployment and operation of EEWS systems, and careful consideration
    of their capabilities, limitations, and interdependencies is necessary to ensure
    their effectiveness in mitigating the impact of earthquakes [158]. 3.2. Cloud
    and Fog Systems Cloud computing is a model of delivering computing resources,
    such as servers, storage, databases, and software, over the internet on an on-demand
    basis [159]. It provides users with easy access to a wide range of computing resources
    that can be scaled up or down based on demand without requiring users to invest
    in and maintain their own physical infrastructure. Fog computing, on the other
    hand, is a distributed computing model that brings computing resources closer
    to the edge of the network, closer to where data is generated and consumed, and
    provides real-time processing and decision-making capabilities [160]. The importance
    of cloud and fog computing in natural disaster detection and management cannot
    be overstated. Natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and
    wildfires can cause widespread devastation and loss of life. The use of cloud
    and fog computing in disaster management can help to mitigate the effects of these
    disasters by providing real-time data analysis, decision-making, and communication
    capabilities [161]. Cloud computing can be used to store and process large amounts
    of data generated by sensors and other devices used in disaster management. This
    data can be analyzed in real-time, providing EWS to alert authorities and the
    public of impending disasters. Cloud computing can also be used to store and share
    critical data such as emergency response plans, evacuation routes, and contact
    information for emergency services. Fog computing can be used to process and analyze
    data at the edge of the network, near the source of the data. This can provide
    real-time information about the status of infrastructure such as roads, bridges,
    and buildings, allowing authorities to make informed decisions about evacuation
    and emergency response efforts. Fog computing can also be used to provide real-time
    communication capabilities, allowing emergency services to coordinate their efforts
    and communicate with each other and the public in real time. In summary, cloud
    and fog computing play a critical role in natural disaster detection and management.
    They provide real-time data analysis, decision-making, and communication capabilities,
    allowing authorities to respond quickly and effectively to disasters, potentially
    saving countless lives and minimizing the damage caused by these events. 4. IoT-Cloud-Based
    EEWS This section will highlight the significant significance that the IoT-Cloud
    technology plays in EEWS. In point of fact, the application of IoT-Cloud strategies
    has been of assistance to EEWS before and after disasters. The IoT has revolutionized
    the way we interact with the physical world, and one of its most promising applications
    is in the detection and prediction of natural disasters such as earthquakes. The
    basic idea behind using IoT for earthquake detection is to deploy a network of
    sensors that can detect seismic activity and transmit the data to a central server
    for analysis. These sensors can be embedded in buildings, bridges, and other structures,
    as well as in the ground itself. By analyzing the data from these sensors, it
    is possible to detect the onset of an earthquake and predict its magnitude and
    location. One of the key advantages of using IoT for earthquake detection is that
    it allows for real-time monitoring of seismic activity. Traditional methods of
    earthquake detection rely on seismometers, which are expensive and require a lot
    of maintenance. They also typically only provide data after an earthquake has
    already occurred. In contrast, IoT sensors can provide continuous data in real-time,
    allowing for EWS to be put in place [162,163,164]. This can be particularly useful
    in areas prone to earthquakes, where early warning can save lives and reduce damage.
    Another advantage of using IoT for earthquake detection is that it can provide
    more denser data network than traditional methods. IoT sensors can be placed in
    a wider variety of locations, such as inside buildings or underground, allowing
    for a more comprehensive picture of seismic activity. They can also provide data
    on other factors that can affect the impact of an earthquake, such as soil conditions
    and building materials. This information can be used to develop better models
    for earthquake prediction and to design buildings and infrastructure that are
    more resistant to seismic activity. The use of IoT for earthquake detection has
    the potential to revolutionize the way we prepare for and respond to earthquakes.
    By providing real-time data and more comprehensive information on seismic activity,
    IoT sensors can improve our ability to predict earthquakes and minimize their
    impact. As the technology continues to develop, we can expect to see more widespread
    deployment of IoT sensors and more sophisticated analysis techniques, leading
    to even better earthquake detection and prediction capabilities. A generic EEWS
    architecture typically consists of three main components: the seismic network,
    the processing center, and the alert distribution system [165]. The seismic network
    comprises a set of sensors deployed across a region of interest, which detect
    and record seismic waves generated by earthquakes. The sensor data is transmitted
    to the processing center, where it is analyzed in real-time using algorithms and
    models to estimate the location, magnitude, and other characteristics of the earthquake
    [166]. The alert distribution system then disseminates the earthquake alert to
    end-users through various channels, such as mobile devices, sirens, and public
    announcements [167]. The underlying infrastructure of the EEWS includes a variety
    of hardware and software components, including seismometers, communication networks,
    computing systems, and databases [168]. The seismometers are typically deployed
    in a dense network to ensure high spatial resolution and coverage, and they are
    connected to a communication network that transmits the sensor data to the processing
    center [169]. The processing center comprises a set of computing systems that
    perform real-time data analysis, using a variety of algorithms and models to estimate
    the earthquake parameters [170]. The alert distribution system includes a set
    of communication channels and protocols that disseminate the alert to end-users,
    as well as a database that stores historical and real-time earthquake data [171].
    The interactions between these components are tightly coordinated to ensure timely
    and accurate earthquake alerts, which can help to mitigate the impact of earthquakes
    and save lives [172]. In [173], the authors developed CrowdQuake, a DL-based seismic
    detection system. Utilizing a dense IoT network composed of MEMS nodes, the system
    employs a multi-head convolution neural network to analyze a large quantity of
    observed acceleration data. During the model validation procedure, the scientists
    got data from the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention
    (NIED) and measured the precision-recall, accuracy, and noise level. The developed
    system could process data from up to 8000 IoT sensors, and identifying an earthquake
    required only a few seconds of processing time, according to the researchers.
    In [174], an advanced EEWS supported by an IoT network that operates on the basis
    of real-time alerts has been established. The network utilized MEMS accelerometers
    and an Arduino Cortex M4 CPU for measuring acceleration. This technique employs
    ML to improve the accuracy and latency in earthquake detection. The model was
    constructed using data gathered locally by the MEMS accelerometer nodes that were
    installed. In [175], IoT acceleration nodes were designed explicitly for earthquake
    detection. Two methods are used to utilize these nodes: a technique of standalone
    and a technique of client-server. The first technique is more commonly used, while
    the client-server technique is more precise but requires high-performance servers
    and network infrastructure to manage data acceleration from multiple client machines.
    Basic earthquake detection methods can be independently explored on less capable
    mobile nodes. However, this may result in false alarms. To overcome this limitation,
    a cooperative method that uses a large number of mobile phones located in close
    proximity to one another is employed. This creates a seismic network that can
    detect earthquakes and monitors any shaking caused by human activity, mechanical
    vibrations, earthquakes, etc. By relying on a primary neural network, a motion
    similar to an earthquake detected by a smartphone is transmitted to other cellphones
    in the immediate area using a multi-hop mode. Furthermore, every mobile phone
    in the network determines and notifies the network of an earthquake, then triggers
    an alarm after obtaining detection data from other smartphones in its immediate
    vicinity. This technique improves the earthquake detection capabilities of a standalone
    method that does not use any system or network infrastructures. In [176], a predictive
    model that combines IoT devices and ML techniques was used to detect geological
    landslide occurrences. The predictive model was trained with geotechnical parameters
    such as soil shear strength, soil moisture, rain intensity, terrain slope, and
    more. The actual hardware used for this purpose consisted of a collection of sensors
    that gathered real-time information on the topography and soil. In [177], the
    authors proposed a compute offloading system architecture that can be implemented
    on Internet-connected drones. They conducted an in-depth experimental study to
    compare the efficiency of cloud computing offloading strategy with that of the
    edge computing strategy for DL solutions in the context of unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs). The authors investigated the balance between the computational cost of
    the two alternative options communications in an experiment. In [53], a DL paradigm
    based on integrating autoencoder (AE) and CNN was developed to immediately determine
    earthquake magnitude and position three seconds after the P-wave begins. The authors
    referred to it as CNN and 3s AE (3S-AE-CNN). The data set used in the study was
    monitored by three stations of the Hi-net seismic network in Japan, and the approach
    was evaluated using data from 12,200 separate occurrences (109.80 thousand 3 s
    three-component seismic windows). The model simplifies the extraction of essential
    waveform properties, resulting in a higher degree of credibility in earthquake
    parameter assessment. The suggested model predicts magnitude, latitude, and longitude
    with an accuracy of within 28 Ã 10 â6 , 3.3 Ã 10 â6 , and 100 Ã 10 â6 degrees,
    respectively. That model immediately communicates event features to a sink IoT
    node. It provides guidance to the relevant administration on how to proceed. It
    is noted that AE has proved beneficial in feature extraction regardless of the
    application [178]. The framework for earthquake prediction proposed in [179] is
    a novel approach based on federated learning (FL). This FL framework outperformed
    the previously developed ML model for earthquake estimation through an IoT gateway
    in terms of reliability and accuracy. The model achieved an accuracy of 88% by
    analyzing multidimensional data over a 100 km radial area, excluding the Western
    Himalayas, and studying the data. In [180], an EEW based on an IoT and an ML model
    was suggested to predict tsunamis using tsunami data dating back to 2100 BC and
    was trained on earthquake parameters in the dataset. It achieved an accuracy of
    95% in predicting earthquake location, depth, and magnitude. In [181], a DL approach
    that can identify P-waves despite background noise was developed using MEMS for
    observing events. The model can detect the probability of occurring preceding
    significant shocks and accurately predict P-waves between 1.5 and 2.5 s before
    their arrival. In [182], the authors used detector nodes to detect earthquakes
    locally by probing the environment and assessing data from probes in the surrounding
    area. The method stores all data locally, making it resistant to node failures
    and partial network outages, thus increasing privacy. The test network consisted
    of twenty node codes joined with ten neighbor nodes chosen at random. The total
    number of detectors was sampled every ten seconds. In [183], a Multilayer Perceptron-classifier
    was developed to provide a severity-based warning by predicting the possibility
    of an onsite intensity exceeding a pre-trained PGA threshold associated with damaging
    intensities on the MMI scaleâseismic properties observed by the strong-motion
    signal starting from the P-wave in the developed model. The authors of [184] proposed
    an independent model of earthquake detection via low-cost acceleration nodes.
    The model utilized four different sensor types for establishing an EEWS with different
    types of data, e.g., noise from buildings, vibrations, and earthquake records.
    To test the sensors, two actual earthquakes were replicated on a shake table.
    The study found that low-cost acceleration sensors can detect earthquakes by monitoring
    differences in acceleration induced by a range between 0.02 g to 0.8 g, which
    can be detected by the sensors. Therefore, the authors used scaled data within
    that range. An ML methodology with earthquake characteristics was utilized, as
    opposed to the more conventional seismic methodologies that are typically used
    [185,186,187]. The authors broke the detection problem down into two distinct
    groups, namely, static settings and dynamic settings. They provide the most effective
    ML approach and input data for the static environment based on an experimental
    evaluation of numerous features for circumventing the issue of discriminating
    earthquake and noise components to reduce the number of false alarms. This model
    was validated with the help of 385 earthquakes ranging in magnitude from 4.0 to
    8.0. The authors of the paper [188] introduced the Distributed Multi-Sensor Earthquake
    Early Warning (DMSEEW) system as a cutting-edge ML-based technique that includes
    data from GPS stations and earthquake sensors in order to recognize large and
    medium earthquakes. The model relies on an innovative stacking ensemble technique
    that has been validated by geoscientists using a real-world dataset. This approach
    was used to build DMSEEW. The architecture of the system was designed to be regionally
    spread, which allows for both brisk processing and resistance to disruptions in
    some aspects of the underlying infrastructure. To be more specific, these systems
    combined GPS and seismic data in order to enhance earthquake detection, which
    led to the creation of an efficient EEWS. KaracÄ± [189] used vibration sensors
    for earthquake detection according to some threshold values. If an earthquake
    has been detected via the vibration sensors, a warning system takes place. In
    this warning system, there is a Wi-Fi module for Internet connection to send a
    tweet by means of the ThingSpeak IoT analytics platform service. There is also
    a sound alarm via a buzzer for the people staying around the earthquake area.
    Thus, the electronic part of this study covers an Arduino card, Wi-Fi module,
    Inertial Measurement Unit sensor, vibration sensor card, and buzzer. The software
    part involves the codes of Processing with Arduino to obtain the sensor data normalization
    and the difference between sequential sensor values for monitoring the threshold
    level. Babu and Rajan [190] have studied an IoT solution that alerts for a flood
    or earthquake detection before they happen and living beings being searched for
    during the disasters. Sensors are connected to a microcontroller, RF transmitter,
    and receiver. Their values are analyzed in real-time via ThingSpeak IoT analytics
    platform service [190]. The authorities are notified by GSM messages during a
    flood or earthquake disaster using the IP protocol. A water level sensor has been
    used for flood detection, and four color bulbs represent the danger levels. A
    rain sensor has worked to determine whether there is rain. Additionally, a vibration
    sensor has been used for an earthquake. The system and the mobile phones are charged
    with solar energy as a secure option for flood environments. ESP Wi-Fi module
    is the gateway as the fundamental processing and storage part between the RF receiver-transmitter-bulb
    system and ThingSpeak cloud server for sensor data transmission. This data can
    be followed using a ThingSpeak API that is used for mobile phones, laptops, or
    any other internet-connected device. Wireless communication, especially GPS, is
    used for living being searches. Won et al. [191] proposed a high-fidelity vibration
    sensor consisting of a MEMS accelerometer with high sampling frequency and digital
    filtering. During the sensing process, Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average trigger
    is compared with a threshold value. Over the threshold, data acquisition, low-pass
    filtering, and downsampling to a frequency are performed. After this procedure,
    if an earthquake is detected with the proposed algorithm, the system notifies
    it through a Bluetooth Beacon. The authors mentioned that the hardware platform
    was Adafruit nRF52840 Feather Express developed based on nRF52840 (Nordic, 2019)
    board having fast computing and high storage attributes provided by CPU, RAM,
    and flash parts. Additionally, the nRF52840 module has Bluetooth 5 and Arduino
    IDE support. Duggal et al. [192] mentioned that the literature studies could not
    separate any other vibrational noise properly from that of earthquakes. They proposed
    a new method by using IoT to eliminate this drawback. A Micro Electro-mechanical
    system sensor is set inside a building after finding the most suitable place via
    structural analysis with the information on seismic shear walls. Inside this sensor,
    there is an accelerometer and a gyroscope. The gyroscope saves the groundâs shaking
    pattern, representing a distinctive nature during an earthquake. IoT I 2 C Communication
    Protocol is used between the devices in the network. Arduino Uno microcontroller
    board and NodeMCU Dev Kit firmware have interfaces with the sensor node. The sensor
    data is sent by Arduino inbuilt WiFi to the ML side. In this part, Logistic Regression,
    Support Vector Machine, and Convolutional Neural Networks have been used for modeling.
    Sharma et al. [89] gave a table for ten different IoT disaster management systems
    based on several properties, such as IoT architecture ownership, cloud-enabled,
    computer technology area, main focus, and disaster type. They also classified
    IoT-based disaster recovery systems into four groups: Service-oriented, natural,
    artificial, and post-disaster. They compared IoT-enabled disaster management methods
    according to their wireless communication technologies, sensor types, and some
    additional features. They also put a comparison diagram exhibiting that Bluetooth
    and Wi-Fi were the best cost, and Bluetooth and ZigBee had the best power usage
    among the IoT communication technologies. The authors proposed case studies for
    forest fire detection and EEWS based on IoT devices. For the earthquake warning
    part, they mentioned the usage of Vibration Sensors (Accelerometer), PIC (Peripheral
    Device Controllers), ZigBee communication procedures, LCD monitors, and RS232
    cables. An IoT alarm message was sent to smartphones, and an alarm message via
    GSM standard was sent to other cell phones. Mishra et al. [193] have optimized
    a schedule for distributing relief items using IoT technologies, such as smart
    cities. There are some dynamic features dependent on the disaster conditions,
    such as changing relief demand and resource availability. IoT is suitable for
    such issues related to continuously flowing and dynamically changing data [194].
    The authors symbolized different time periods with sliding time windows in which
    the data update occurs. For the first window, relief distribution is decided according
    to the availability of vehicles, relief resources, priority of the disaster area,
    and delivery routes. The distribution schedule has been optimized repeatedly in
    the next time slots. The fragility of the problem that is being targeted, as well
    as its direct effect on human life, makes it imperative that a solution be found
    that is intelligent, trustworthy, and flexible despite the considerable efforts
    that have been put into developing the state-of-the-art. In this section, we throw
    light on the primary research explorations that have been done in this area. The
    primary efforts in developing IoT for the EEWS are outlined in detail in Table
    3. Table 3. IoT-based EEWS main efforts. In order to prevent the loss of human
    life, the implementation of an EEWS is an absolute necessity. In order to effectively
    manage disasters and reduce the danger of earthquakes, it is essential to have
    the ability to promptly detect the features of an earthquake. With technologies
    already in place, such as the IoT network, social media, global positioning system
    (GPS), and mobile nodes, these attributes can be sent to help mitigate the effects
    of a catastrophic earthquake. Figure 8 depicts a comprehensive EEWS with many
    administrations assisting in relieving the earthquake tragedy. The EEWS will include
    complete statistics regarding hospitals, railways, fire services, ambulances,
    airports, and so on based on these administrations. This proposed system does
    integrate social media, IoT technologies, cloud systems, and mobile systems. It
    operates in two stages. The first stage is pre-disaster, as ML models are used
    to detect the commencement of the principal wave. This procedure is extremely
    advantageous for risk minimization, such as rapid shutting down of nuclear power
    plants, electrical producers, and so on. The second phase begins after the disaster
    has occurred, with the goal of mitigating/reducing the disasterâs impacts. Using
    an integrated system, for example, allows for more accurate statistics regarding
    the affected people, buildings, utilities, and areas. As a result, an effective
    evacuation strategy can be implemented. Figure 8. A general architecture of EWS.
    A solution that is both flexible and intelligent and that is able to deal with
    complex problems in a relatively short amount of time is required for such a system.
    ML has the potential to play a significant and critical part in the administrations
    that are interconnected and working on achieving successful EWS among the variety
    of existing current techniques. ML is a promising method that works regardless
    of the data type, format, length, and other factors such as these. Indeed, real-time
    monitoring takes place across all of the dispersed organizations shown in Figure
    8, which serves as the foundation for a reliable EEWS. As a consequence of this,
    the transfer of data between various entities needs to be thoroughly investigated
    and estimated. After that, ML models are utilized to zero in on the current status
    of each object and even provide an estimate for a certain word. As a consequence
    of this, those institutions are capable of making useful contributions prior to,
    during, and after earthquake disasters. To put it another way, a technique such
    as this can assist with the management of earthquake catastrophes, the reduction
    of earthquake risks, and evacuation tactics. As a consequence of this, the performance
    of the EEWS improves in direct proportion to the quality of the ML model. Figure
    9 provides a visual representation of the interaction between trains as a specific
    administration used in the process of full EEWS, the data processing, and the
    research done. To be more precise, earthquake data is monitored to be sent for
    processing using the IoT network in order to carry out the desired check and determine
    the correct decision to send to the railway system for suitable action using an
    ML model and the railway information of the disaster location. This process is
    repeated until the appropriate decision is made. Figure 9. A pattern of Iot-based
    EEWS. The authors of [197] mentioned the same approach of benefiting from UAVs
    as Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) to provide connectivity instead of traditional
    base stations. They proposed two trajectory planning algorithms using a k-value
    selection method and K-means centroids for UAVs. These UAVs served to the clusters
    of user equipment. By enhancing the study, the authors also gave two methods for
    cluster head selection to support continuous connectivity via UAVs and cluster
    heads. The authors of [198] suggested a system to find the damage degrees of various
    earthquake region parts such as roads and riverways. They used single-rotor and
    six-rotor UAVs and took visible light images of the region parts. Once the image
    quality evaluation was done according to the image contrast, the image blur, and
    the image noise formulas, the aerial images were analyzed with Gray Level Cooccurrence
    Matrix, the Tamura, and the Gabor wavelet features. Lastly, the SVM classifier
    was used to obtain the damage levels. The authors of [199] proposed to use UAVs
    for monitoring earthquake impacts after the disaster occurrence. The damage to
    the buildings was derived with the help of one fixed-wing UAV and two multirotor
    UAVs. The aerial mapping gathered from the UAVs was compared with a physical field
    survey. The buildingsâ structural properties were extracted from the damages on
    different parts of the surfaces, such as walls, roofs, and perimeter columns.
    Additionally, the liquefaction situation was seen from the area investigation
    that also presented the damage levels of the settlements. Overall, the use of
    drones in earthquake disaster detection and management has the potential to save
    lives, speed up response times, and improve the efficiency of emergency services.
    As technology continues to advance, it is likely that drones will become an even
    more important tool in disaster management, helping to mitigate the effects of
    earthquakes and other natural disasters. Figure 10 shows the role of UAVs for
    three scenarios of pre, during, and post-disaster situations. Figure 10. Three
    scenarios of disaster and the role of UAV. Evaluating the performance and reliability
    of IoT-enabled earthquake early warning systems (EEWS) is crucial for ensuring
    their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. There are several techniques that
    can be used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance and reliability
    of these systems, including simulation testing, field testing, and data-driven
    analysis: Simulation testing involves creating a virtual environment that simulates
    real-world conditions, including seismic activity and sensor data [200,201]. Simulation
    testing allows researchers to test the performance of an EEWS system under different
    scenarios, such as different magnitudes and distances of earthquakes and different
    types of seismic waves [202]. This technique can also be used to evaluate the
    effectiveness of different algorithms and parameters used in the system [203].
    Field testing involves deploying an EEWS system in real-world conditions and collecting
    data on its performance and reliability [204,205]. Field testing can provide valuable
    insights into the systemâs performance under actual operating conditions, which
    may differ from those in a simulated environment. Field testing can also help
    to identify potential issues with the system, such as sensor malfunction or communication
    failures [206]. This technique can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, but
    it provides valuable data on the systemâs performance and reliability in real-world
    scenarios [207]. Data-driven analysis involves analyzing large datasets generated
    by an EEWS system to identify patterns and trends, which can provide insights
    into its performance and reliability [208]. Data-driven analysis can be used to
    identify correlations between sensor data and earthquake characteristics, such
    as magnitude, duration, and intensity [209]. This technique can also be used to
    identify anomalies in sensor data, which may indicate issues with the systemâs
    performance or reliability [210]. Data-driven analysis can provide valuable insights
    into the performance and reliability of an EEWS system over long periods of time
    [211]. By using a combination of these techniques, researchers can gain a more
    comprehensive understanding of the performance and reliability of IoT-enabled
    EEWS systems. This can help to identify areas for improvement and ultimately improve
    the effectiveness of these systems in mitigating the impact of earthquakes. Integrating
    advanced technologies such as ML algorithms, distributed computing, and edge computing
    into EEWS systems can improve their accuracy and effectiveness. However, there
    are several challenges and considerations associated with these technologies.
    For example, ML algorithms require large amounts of data and computational resources
    to train and optimize, which may be difficult to obtain in the context of EEWS
    systems [212,213]. Distributed computing can improve the scalability and fault
    tolerance of EEWS systems, but it also introduces additional complexity and overhead
    in terms of communication and coordination [214,215,216,217]. Edge computing can
    improve the responsiveness and efficiency of EEWS systems by processing data closer
    to the source. Still, it also requires careful management of resources and trade-offs
    between processing power and energy consumption [218,219]. In addition, the implementation
    of these advanced technologies can be complex and may require significant expertise
    and resources. Furthermore, there may be limitations associated with the hardware
    and software infrastructure of EEWS systems, such as sensor networks and communication
    protocols, which may need to be upgraded or modified to support these technologies.
    Therefore, while integrating advanced technologies into EEWS systems has the potential
    to improve their accuracy and effectiveness, careful consideration of the trade-offs
    and implementation complexities is necessary to ensure their successful deployment
    and operation. 5. Validation and Verification Aspects Validation and verification
    (V&V) are essential for ensuring the quality, reliability, optimization, and safety
    of systems and products [220,221,222]. They involve rigorous evaluation against
    requirements and standards, identifying and correcting defects, improving performance,
    and ensuring compliance. In the context of IoT systems, V&V is crucial for addressing
    complex behaviors, identifying vulnerabilities, and complying with regulations
    [223,224]. For cloud systems, V&V ensures dependability, security, performance
    optimization, and adherence to standards [225,226,227]. Overall, V&V is vital
    for constructing trustworthy, resilient, compliant systems that meet user and
    societal expectations [228]. 5.1. Different Categories of V&V Techniques There
    are several types of validation and verification techniques that can be applied
    to these systems [229,230] (Figure 11). One common technique is functional testing,
    which involves testing the systemâs functions to ensure that they perform as expected
    [231]. This testing can be done manually or through automated testing tools. Another
    technique is performance testing, which involves testing the systemâs ability
    to handle a certain level of workload or traffic [232]. This can include stress
    testing, load testing, and capacity testing [233,234]. Figure 11. Different Categories
    of V&V Techniques. Security testing is another important technique for IoT and
    cloud systems [235,236,237]. This involves testing the systemâs security features
    and protocols to identify vulnerabilities and ensure that sensitive information
    is protected [238,239,240]. Penetration testing is a type of security testing
    that involves attempting to hack into the system to identify weaknesses and potential
    security breaches [241,242,243]. Usability testing is also important for these
    systems, as they must be user-friendly and easy to navigate [244]. This testing
    involves gathering feedback from users to identify areas of the system that can
    be improved to enhance the user experience [245]. Regression testing is another
    important technique for IoT and cloud systems [246,247]. It involves retesting
    the system after making changes or updates to ensure that the changes have not
    introduced new defects or issues in previously tested areas [248]. Regression
    testing can be done manually or through automated testing tools, and it is important
    to perform regularly to ensure that the system remains stable and reliable throughout
    its lifecycle [249,250]. By conducting thorough regression testing, developers
    can identify and fix issues early on, ultimately leading to a more robust and
    reliable system for users [251]. Formal methods (Figure 12) are another important
    set of techniques that can be used for validation and verification of IoT and
    cloud systems [252,253]. Formal methods involve the use of mathematical models
    and logic to verify the correctness and reliability of a system [254]. This technique
    can be used to check the consistency of the system design and its specifications,
    as well as to identify potential errors and defects in the system [255,256]. Formal
    methods can also be used to ensure that the system meets certain performance and
    safety requirements [257,258,259]. While formal methods can be more time-consuming
    and complex than other validation and verification techniques, they can provide
    a high level of confidence in the correctness and reliability of the system [260,261,262].
    Therefore, formal methods are an important tool for developers to consider when
    designing and testing IoT and cloud systems. Figure 12. A simplified illustration
    of how Formals Methods work [263]. In addition to these techniques, there are
    also validation and verification techniques specific to cloud systems. For example,
    validation techniques for cloud systems may include compliance testing to ensure
    that the system complies with industry standards and regulations and testing the
    systemâs ability to handle real-time data processing and communication. Overall,
    validation and verification techniques are critical for ensuring the reliability,
    security, and efficiency of IoT and cloud systems. By applying these techniques,
    developers can identify and address issues early in the development process, ultimately
    leading to better-performing and more secure systems for users. 5.2. Adaptation
    of V&V Techniques for EEWS Verification and validation (V&V) techniques are crucial
    for ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of earthquake detection and warning
    systems in the context of IoT. These systems use a combination of sensors, data
    analysis algorithms, and communication technologies to detect and respond to earthquakes
    in real time. However, the adaptation of V&V techniques for these systems presents
    unique challenges and opportunities. One challenge is the need for a robust and
    reliable sensor network. EEWS relies on a sensor network to detect and measure
    seismic activity. These sensors must be calibrated and tested regularly to ensure
    that they are functioning correctly. V&V techniques can help to ensure that the
    sensor network is reliable and accurate by providing a framework for testing and
    calibration. More precisely, to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the entire
    sensor network, a statistical calibration and testing approach can be employed.
    This involves validating a representative sample of sensors rather than individually
    testing each sensor, given the large number of sensors typically used. Statistically,
    the majority of sensors will be sufficiently calibrated and functioning properly
    at the time of an earthquake. Another challenge is the desirability of real-time
    data analysis and action plans. In earthquake detection systems, timely and accurate
    decision-making is critical for minimizing damage and saving lives. V&V techniques
    can help to ensure that the data analysis algorithms used in these systems are
    accurate and reliable. This can involve testing the algorithms under a variety
    of conditions and scenarios, as well as ensuring that they are able to operate
    in real time. In addition to challenges, there are also opportunities for the
    adaptation of V&V techniques for IoT earthquake systems. One opportunity is the
    use of simulation and modeling. V&V techniques can be used to create simulations
    and models of earthquake scenarios to test and validate the performance of the
    detection and warning systems. This can help to identify potential weaknesses
    in the system and inform improvements. Another opportunity is the use of crowdsourcing
    and citizen science. V&V techniques can be used to validate and integrate data
    from citizen scientists and volunteers who contribute to earthquake detection
    and warning systems. This can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of
    the system while also engaging the public in the process. In conclusion, the adaptation
    of V&V techniques for IoT earthquake systems presents both challenges and opportunities.
    By leveraging V&V techniques, developers can ensure that these systems are reliable,
    accurate, and effective in detecting and responding to seismic activity. This
    can help to minimize damage and save lives in the event of an earthquake. 5.3.
    Cost and Limitations of V&V Techniques Verification and validation (V&V) techniques
    are crucial in ensuring the quality and reliability of software systems for IoT
    and cloud computing systems. However, these systems come with unique challenges
    and limitations that must be considered when implementing V&V techniques. One
    cost of V&V techniques for IoT and cloud systems is the sheer scale of these systems.
    These systems can involve thousands or even millions of interconnected devices,
    making it difficult to perform comprehensive testing and validation. Additionally,
    the heterogeneity of these systems, with devices from different manufacturers
    and with different capabilities, can complicate the verification and validation
    process. Another cost of V&V techniques for IoT and cloud systems is the need
    for specialized testing environments and tools. These systems require highly specialized
    tools and environments for testing and validation, such as simulators, emulators,
    and testbeds. These tools can be expensive to implement and maintain and may require
    highly skilled personnel to operate effectively. Furthermore, there are limitations
    to the effectiveness of V&V techniques for IoT and cloud systems. One limitation
    is the difficulty of testing for security and privacy vulnerabilities. These systems
    often involve sensitive data and critical infrastructure, making security and
    privacy a top priority. However, it is challenging to test for all possible security
    and privacy vulnerabilities, especially as new threats emerge constantly. Another
    limitation is the challenge of testing for real-time and low-latency requirements.
    IoT and cloud systems often require real-time performance and low-latency communication,
    which can be difficult to test and validate. These systems may involve complex
    interactions between devices and services, making it challenging to ensure that
    they meet these requirements. In conclusion, V&V techniques are crucial for ensuring
    the quality and reliability of software systems for IoT and cloud computing systems.
    However, these systems have unique challenges and limitations that must be considered
    when implementing V&V techniques. By understanding these costs and limitations,
    software developers can implement V&V techniques more effectively and efficiently,
    ultimately leading to higher-quality software systems. 6. Open Challenges, Conclusions
    and Future Directions The use of IoT and cloud facilities for EEWS presents significant
    opportunities for improving the speed and accuracy of earthquake detection and
    response. However, there are also several challenges that must be addressed to
    ensure the reliability and effectiveness of these systems (Figure 13). Figure
    13. Open Challenges. Sensor network reliability and accuracy: One of the primary
    challenges in implementing IoT and cloud-based EEWS is ensuring the reliability
    and accuracy of the sensor network. These systems rely on a network of sensors
    to detect and measure seismic activity, making it essential to ensure that the
    sensors are functioning correctly. Real-time data processing and decision-making:
    EEWS require fast and accurate data processing and decision-making capabilities
    to provide timely alerts to people and organizations in affected areas. This requires
    sophisticated algorithms and real-time data processing capabilities, which can
    be challenging to implement in IoT and cloud-based systems. Secure communication
    channels: The transmission of data between sensors, cloud facilities, and other
    components in an EEWS must be secure to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.
    Ensuring the security of communication channels is a significant challenge in
    designing and implementing these systems. Heterogeneity and scalability: IoT and
    cloud-based systems are inherently heterogeneous, with devices and services from
    different manufacturers and with different capabilities. Ensuring seamless integration
    and scalability of these systems is a significant challenge, particularly as the
    number of devices and sensors in the network increases. Cost-effectiveness and
    sustainability: Implementing an EEWS using IoT and cloud facilities can be costly,
    requiring significant investment in hardware, software, and personnel. Ensuring
    the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of these systems is a significant challenge,
    particularly in regions with limited resources. Usability and accessibility: EEWS
    must be usable and accessible to people and organizations in affected areas, including
    those with limited literacy or technical skills. Ensuring the usability and accessibility
    of these systems is a significant challenge, requiring careful consideration of
    user needs and preferences. Privacy and ethical concerns: The collection and processing
    of data in EEWS raise privacy and ethical concerns, particularly as these systems
    become more sophisticated and widespread. Ensuring that these systems comply with
    relevant regulations and ethical principles is a significant challenge. Interference
    from environmental factors: EEWS can be affected by environmental factors such
    as electromagnetic noise and weather conditions, which can interfere with the
    accuracy and reliability of the sensor network. Ensuring the robustness and resilience
    of these systems is a significant challenge, requiring careful consideration of
    environmental factors. Continuous monitoring and maintenance: IoT and cloud-based
    EEWS require continuous monitoring and maintenance to ensure system performance
    and reliability. Ensuring the continuous monitoring and maintenance of these systems
    is a significant challenge, requiring robust and scalable infrastructure and skilled
    personnel. The use of IoT and cloud facilities for EEWS presents a significant
    opportunity for improving the speed and accuracy of earthquake detection and response.
    However, addressing the challenges outlined above is essential to ensure the reliability
    and sustainability of these systems in the long term. This survey has highlighted
    the potential benefits of using IoT and cloud technologies in EEWS, including
    real-time data analysis, improved sensor networks, and faster decision-making.
    However, the survey has also identified several challenges that must be addressed,
    such as the need for reliable and accurate sensor networks, real-time data processing,
    and secure communication channels. Overall, the survey underscores the importance
    of continued research and development in this area, as well as the need for rigorous
    verification and validation techniques to ensure the reliability and effectiveness
    of these systems. Below, we propose some interesting future directions: Development
    of more efficient and accurate sensors: Research and development should focus
    on developing more efficient and accurate sensors that can accurately detect and
    measure seismic activity while also being cost-effective and scalable. Integration
    of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML: The integration of AI and ML can help
    to improve the accuracy and reliability of data analysis algorithms used in EEWS.
    This can lead to faster and more accurate decision-making, improving the effectiveness
    of these systems [264,265]. Standardization of communication protocols: The standardization
    of communication protocols can help to ensure the interoperability and scalability
    of IoT and cloud-based EEWS. This can simplify the integration of different devices
    and services, reducing the complexity of these systems. Adoption of free, open-source
    software: The adoption of free, open-source software can help to reduce the cost
    and complexity of developing EEWS while also encouraging collaboration and innovation
    in this area. Engagement with local communities: Engagement with local communities
    can help to ensure that EEWS are developed in a form that meets the needs and
    preferences of people and organizations in affected areas. This can improve the
    usability and effectiveness of these systems in real-world scenarios. Development
    of new funding models: The development of new funding models, such as publicâprivate
    partnerships, can help to ensure the sustainability and scalability of EEWS. This
    can provide the necessary resources and expertise to develop and maintain these
    systems over the long term. The âlast kilometerâ problem: This problem is the
    difficulty of assuring prompt and efficient warning, communication, and reaction
    systems to people and communities in the final seconds before the occurrence of
    powerful and devastating S-wave shaking during an earthquake. In particular, it
    requires addressing densely populated areas where the window for preparation and
    evacuation is constrained, where there is a gap between earthquake EEWS and the
    capacity to reach and notify individuals in the impacted area. In order to protect
    peopleâs safety and well-being in the final crucial seconds before the arrival
    of the destructive seismic waves, this topic focuses on the necessity for the
    effective broadcast of alerts and emergency instructions. In conclusion, continued
    research and development, as well as collaboration and innovation, will be essential
    in addressing the challenges and realizing the potential benefits of using IoT
    and cloud facilities for EEWS. By addressing these challenges and implementing
    future directions, it is possible to develop more reliable, accurate, and effective
    EEWS that can save lives and minimize damage in the event of seismic activity.

  description: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) ecosystem faces increased
    risks and vulnerabilities due to adopting Industry 4.0 standards. Integrating
    data from various places and converging several systems have heightened the need
    for robust security measures beyond fundamental connection encryption. However,
    it is difficult to provide adequate security due to the IIoT ecosystemâs distributed
    hardware and software. The most effective countermeasures must be suggested together
    with the crucial vulnerabilities, linked threats, and hazards in order to protect
    industrial equipment and ensure the secure functioning of IIoT systems. This paper
    presents a thorough analysis of events that target IIoT systems to alleviate such
    concerns. It also offers a comprehensive analysis of the responses that have been
    advanced in the most recent research. This article examines several kinds of attacks
    and the possible consequences to understand the security landscape in the IIoT
    area. Additionally, we aim to encourage the development of effective defenses
    that will lessen the hazards detected and secure the privacy, accessibility, and
    reliability of IIoT systems. It is important to note that we examine the issues
    and solutions related to IIoT security using the most recent findings from research
    and the literature on this subject. This study organizes and evaluates recent
    research to provide significant insight into the present security situation in
    IIoT systems. Ultimately, we provide outlines for future research and projects
    in this field.

    The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) ecosystem faces increased risks and vulnerabilities
    due to adopting Industry 4.0 standards. Integrating data from various places and
    converging several systems have heightened the need for robust security measures
    beyond fundamental connection encryption. However, it is difficult to provide
    adequate security due to the IIoT ecosystemâs distributed hardware and software.
    The most effective countermeasures must be suggested together with the crucial

    and ensure the secure functioning of IIoT systems. This paper presents a thorough
    analysis of events that target IIoT systems to alleviate such concerns. It also

    widespread adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices has revolutionized
    industrial environments, enabling enhanced efficiency, automation, and data-driven
    decision making. However, this rapid integration also exposes these systems to
    an increased risk of cyber threats and attacks. This article, âA Comprehensive
    Survey of Cybersecurity Threats, Attacks, and Effective Countermeasures in Industrial
    Internet of Thingsâ, addresses the critical issue of IIoT security. It comprehensively
    analyzes various attack vectors that target industrial systems while proposing
    effective countermeasures to mitigate these risks. By thoroughly examining the
    evolving threat landscape and identifying potential vulnerabilities, this study
    serves as a valuable resource for organizations aiming to protect their critical
    infrastructure and ensure the secure operation of their IIoT networks. Cyber-physical
    infrastructures serve as vital elements inside these partially structured facilities
    if intelligent factories, as described by the industry 4.0 standards [1], have
    to maximize their manufacturing cycle. Their job entails monitoring and managing
    natural processes while making independent, decentralized decisions. The operational
    network of the IIoT is crucial since it makes it possible for logical systems
    to collaborate and communicate instantaneously. Thus, it is possible to execute
    the administrative services, operational procedures, and creative manufacturing
    solutions required for the smooth completion of the production chain [2]. This
    âIIoTâ refers to an extensive collection of linked sensors, tools, and gadgets
    that, once incorporated into industrial sectors like manufacturing and energy
    management, produce a high-tech architecture of services. Figure 1 [3] illustrates
    how this interrelated structure makes it possible to deploy automation at an advanced
    level, reducing costs and increasing manufacturing procedure productivity. Figure
    1. Generalized architecture of Industrial Internet of Things systems. The interconnectedness
    of the IIoT enables seamless data collection, analysis, and exchange, thereby
    facilitating the optimization of production chain performance. This enhanced connectivity
    also opens up new possibilities for the industrial sector, allowing the realization
    of previously impractical operations and driving significant innovation and progress
    in the industry. The constant and seamless interchange of information across all
    production stages is essential for successfully transforming the supply chain
    into a fully automated operation powered by the IIoT. Utilizing a tiered architecture
    inside IIoT systems is frequently required to achieve this level of connectivity.
    Physical elements, including sensors, actuators, control systems, and security
    methods, are considered at the hardware level. The physical networking medium,
    such as cable and wireless technologies, are included at the network level. Finally,
    the architectureâs upper levels contain protocols that gather and send data throughout
    the communication stack, ensuring efficient and dependable data transport. The
    requirement to defend critical industrial systems from cybersecurity threats is
    highlighted by the growing interconnectedness and adoption of standard communication
    protocols, as outlined in the Industry 4.0 specifications [4]. Factory automation
    systems (ICSs), which manage the manufacturing process and the functioning of
    intelligent factories, constantly have access to critical corporate data in addition
    to the internet and industrial networks [5]. Sensors employed in control loops
    for data collecting and process automation are two typical examples of such systems
    [6]. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems (SCADA) are another example
    of the same environment. The IIoT networkâs interconnected technologies allow
    for the remote monitoring and control of processes from any location. While connectivity
    and networking improve operational effectiveness, they also pose severe problems
    to infrastructure security [7]. Considerations for privacy, reliability, and accessibility
    become critical. Moreover, the initial design focus of industrial machines and
    devices is functionality rather than security, rendering them particularly vulnerable
    to cyberattacks. Exploiting flaws in commonly used Industrial IoT communication
    protocols, as well as inadequacies in their management of operations and consumption,
    can result in the compromising of crucial devices, the denial of vital functions,
    and possibly the total or partial demise of those items, with likely disastrous
    results [8]. Although several studies have explored security risks in IoT systems
    in general, there is currently limited extensive research specifically focused
    on the Industrial IoT environment. In addition, the seriousness of assaults and
    the hazards that accompany them, which can cause substantial harm and even fatalities,
    are frequently not appropriately highlighted in current studies. By undertaking
    a thorough analysis of popular attack techniques used in industrial applications
    and researching pertinent literature, this essay seeks to fill the following gaps.
    The objective is to promote a resilient industrial environment and provide a more
    efficient, cybersecurity-focused strategy. This studyâs main contribution is to
    offer a thorough analysis of security hazards to manufacturing machinery and the
    most recent solutions to protect the infrastructure for researchers and organizations
    working with Industrial IoT technologies. It addresses these structuresâ essential
    qualities and shortcomings and thoroughly analyzes all potential solutions to
    overcome the vulnerabilities, as recommended in recent research. The supplied
    evaluation and analytic paradigm set this research effort apart from other IIoT
    studies. It provides a thorough, current, and reliable standard for detecting
    and evaluating risks in the constantly changing workplace. This article offers
    a comprehensive analysis of the countermeasures that have been advanced in the
    most recent research articles. We examine many types of attacks and their possible
    consequences to understand the security landscape in the IIoT area. This study
    is organized as follows: While Section 3 thoroughly explains the significant dangers
    in the Industrial IoT ecosystem, the second part reviews relevant studies. The
    next part additionally looks at how these risks operate and discusses practical
    fixes suggested in recent studies. The main conclusions regarding our investigation
    are presented in the fourth part. The last part summarizes the research and highlights
    potential directions for further investigation. 2. Related Literature This part
    analyzes research studies that concentrate on the risks posed by Industrial IoT
    systems. The critical security threats are covered, as well as potential solutions.
    The contributions of these works are also examined, and issues that need additional
    research and study are noted. Many contemporary attacks and threats on critical
    infrastructure networks, such as power grids [9], exploit specific control systems
    like SCADA devices or compromise actuators or sensors in the physical layers of
    the network or attack links between devices in the data-link layer. Industrial
    automation control and telemetry systems depend on SCADA products, which use local
    controllers to connect to an Industrial IoT network. Contemporary cyber assaults
    [10,11] frequently use tactics to disconnect actuators or sensors, enabling the
    manipulation of sensor readings and changing how cyber-physical structures function
    in industrial settings. For example, cyber-attacks on a SCADA water supply and
    decontamination plant might cause crucial operations, including water treatment
    and production, flow meters, level and conductivity analysis, pH analysis, and
    chemical dosing pumps, to be compromised. Such assaults may have grave effects
    on public health. One specific paper skips over a detailed analysis of assaults
    on the physical layer and only lists the parts of a viable SCADA system. The paperâs
    authors address five attack types and attack vectors, including the use of cross-site
    scripting (XSS), overflowing buffers, injection of SQL queries, and source code
    design and implementation. However, they do not offer detailed explanations or
    methodological approaches for mitigation or prevention. Moreover, the study fails
    to provide substantial insights into attacks on the software 4.7 or raise awareness
    about the severity of attacks against SCADA systems, which can result in substantial
    destruction and human casualties. In comparison, [8] presents a more thorough
    strategy for tackling vulnerabilities connected to Industrial IoT systems. The
    Industrial IoTâs functional levels classify the first three probable attacks as
    operational technology (OT), and the final two are classified as information technology
    (IT) in Table 1 by the authors. The first functional layer covers the physical
    IIoT processes involving embedded devices, sensors, actuators, transmitters, and
    motors. Attacks at this level demand in-depth familiarity with the IIoT system
    architecture, access to device specifications and engineering blueprints, and
    a comprehensive understanding of installation and operational functioning. The
    second functional layer consists of specialized hardware, such as distributed
    control systems (DCSs), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and gateways, facilitating
    communication and control between components in the first functional layer. This
    assault aims to influence the information flow and obstruct appropriate communication
    between the two layers. The third functionality stage consists of IP-based data
    acquisition devices, master stations, humanâmachine interfaces, SCADA systems,
    and relevant industrial automation control and surveillance systems. Many SCADA-level
    attacks use IP packet manipulation techniques to conceal the senderâs identity
    by faking attributes like the source address. Thanks to this alteration, the recipient
    is duped into thinking the packet came from an authorized network user. Business
    planning services, including office applications, intranet, web, and mail services,
    are included in the fourth level of service. Threats at this stage use known or
    unidentified weaknesses in the attacked services. Table 1. Layered IIoT architecture
    and possible attacks. Many tools like analysis, information extraction techniques
    used by enterprise applications, and cloud computing services are all included
    in the fifth level of functionality within the IIoT framework. Attacks at this
    level can take a variety of forms, including confrontational assaults as well
    as complex ones like surveillance and manipulation. A demilitarized zone between
    levels three and four, which includes service servers accessed by users from unknown
    networks, is introduced by the authors of the cited paper. It is essential to
    note. Even while the study provides insightful information about how the IIoT
    operates and the risks connected to it, its absence of particular instances of
    related attacks or preventative measures makes it insufficient. Instead, it acts
    as an overview of recognized attack types, including little data beyond what are
    already available in the existing literature. Manuscript [17] presents a thorough
    framework for IIoT security based on standardized and commercial design. In a
    three-tier design, the study looks at the security needs for industrial connection
    and communication protocols and evaluates the type of safety these standards offer
    at each layer. The study starts by outlining a three-tier, generic IIoT architecture,
    which effectively classifies the core elements of most IIoT advances, as depicted
    in Figure 2. The edge tier comprises endpoints and edge-based gateway devices
    that interconnect actuators, control systems, and sensor equipment in a vicinity
    connection. Gateway units act as aggregating indications, allowing layered connections
    with the upper structure tier alongside internal inter-level connectivity. The
    system layer leverages web or mobile network connections as a conduit for data
    and control exchange between the various levels. It includes software 4.7 and
    services applications for integrating data, transforming data, and analyses. The
    third and highest levelâs link with the organizational tier is formed via an intranet
    infrastructure driven mainly by the World Wide Web. The corporate tier provides
    specialized protocols for customer interface and enables suitable offers, including
    specialized apps for enterprise, domain services, and hosting cloud computing.
    Gebremichael et al. offer a set of interconnection procedures appropriate to each
    tier and explain the security characteristics of secure device implementation
    in IIoT networks based on this architectural framework. These deployment solutions
    improve the security posture by dispersing security needs across various network
    regions and building backup protection in widespread attacks. Figure 2. Three-Tier
    Architectural Model for IIoT Connectivity and Communication Standards. Lastly,
    researchers [18] have given a thorough analysis of SCADA attacks. The primary
    hardware of the IIoT ecosystem, SCADA devices, are employed to track different
    industrial processes. They are made up of several entities that are arranged in
    a tiered framework. They include methods for integrating humanâmachine interfaces
    (HMIs), data transmission, and data collecting systems. An HMI is an operator
    contact that links a human to a device and is mainly used for displaying information,
    tracking operation time, and viewing machine input and output data. The master
    station unit or master terminal unit (MSU/MTU) operates as the principal control
    facility for a SCADA network, while the sub-MSU/sub-MTU functions as an auxiliary
    control site. The most frequent assaults on SCADA systems, their occurrence patterns,
    and the techniques typically employed are listed in this paper. The ensuing modes
    of attack are discussed in further detail. Intercepting communications on a wired
    or wireless network [19] between master terminal units (MTUs), sub-MTUs, or remote
    terminal units (RTUs) is known as passive or active monitoring. To exploit the
    collected data, an attacker with network access can install malware [20]. A man-in-the-middle
    (MitM) attack [21] is when an individual observes and intercepts network traffic
    to modify and deliver data to the intended recipient [22,23]. When a breach is
    successful, the attacker seizes control of the session and keeps the connection
    going while using a fake IP address to evade detection [24,25]. Masquerading assaults
    happen when a hacker adopts an alias and uses a fake IP address to pretend to
    be an authorized network client to take data from the system or network [26,27].
    Brute force attacks may use stolen credentials to access critical data without
    authorization [28]. After conducting MitM or hybrid assaults, intruders may use
    infectious agents, Trojan horses, or worms [29,30,31]. Unauthorized people may
    gain access to the compromised system through malicious code, maybe exploiting
    it to launch more attacks on other infrastructure. Alternatively, the code may
    infect more MSUs/MTUs across the network, leading to unstable behavior or system
    failure [32,33]. Rogue RTUs overwhelm the MTU with arbitrary IP addresses during
    denial of service (DoS) or distributed denial of service (DDoS) threats, draining
    the frameworkâs resources and making it unusable [1,34,35,36,37,38,39]. These
    threats make use of internet packet-based fragmentation flaws. The MSU/MTU is
    unable to manage data transmissions that are larger than the maximum transmission
    unit size, which results in a loss of connectivity and system breakdown [3,40,41,42].
    A Cinderella-like attack happens when an evil individual modifies the systemâs
    intrinsic schedule after gaining unauthorized access to a machine. The computer
    systemâs vulnerability is increased by this early expiration of security software
    4.7 [43,44]. Doorknob rattling entails preparations, including legal methods for
    system testing. To assess the readiness and responsiveness of security measures,
    for instance, a small number of efforts to enter the network using randomized
    criteria are attempted [45,46]. Given the wide variety of systems with SCADA structures
    and associated designs, Ghosh and S. Sampalli performed thorough research on standards
    of current security (IEEE 1402, ISO 17799, ISO 15408, NERC security guidelines,
    NERC 1200, API 1164), detection mechanisms for SCADA (comprising some machine
    learning (ML)-based models like the Bayes algorithm, probabilistic forests, and
    choice trees), and avoiding a SCADA system assault. Adapting key management protocols
    like cryptography (SCADA Key Establishment (SKE), SCADA Key Management Architecture
    (SKMA)), and logical key hierarchy (LKH) are among the prevention techniques.

    with Countermeasures Remote administration and robotics can now improve the efficiency
    and caliber of services in critical infrastructures [47]. However, accuracy, dependability,
    and safety are of the utmost significance to effectively administer IIoT systems.
    Although the IIoT ecosystem incorporates digital technologies to increase efficiency,
    these technologies also present substantial hurdles because of the ongoing threats
    to digital security [48]. As a result, defending crucial national infrastructure,
    such as information technology, water and electricity networks, and public utilities,
    has come to be related to preserving the IIoT. These devices are excellent targets
    for extensive assaults since they are directly connected to the IIoT ecosystem.
    We divide IIoT risks into five broad categories in the following provisions: attacks
    involving phishing, ransomware infections, protocol assaults, supply chain attacks,
    and system attacks [49]. This categorization makes it easier to communicate security
    concerns thoroughly and comprehensively, along with the related solutions that
    are especially suitable for the Industrial Internet of Things environment. 3.1.
    Attacks by Phishers Phishing attacks are a popular technique for collecting critical
    data from customers. In this kind of assault, the perpetrator assumes the identity
    of a trustworthy organization [50] and tricks people into disclosing personal
    information on phoney websites or via infected attachments. This might lead to
    the installation of malware or the unintentional revealing of private data. Specialized
    phishers deploy sophisticated methods known as compromised assaults on critical
    infrastructures, which combine social engineering techniques with the exploitation
    of lax user awareness and the absence of active security mechanisms in systems.
    These methods could include website forgeries, logo obfuscation, link manipulation,
    filter evasion, covert redirects, and zero-day spyware. The primary targets are
    often vendor or remote websites, aiming to breach IIoT systems and gain control
    over their linked operational systems. Having a final objective of breaking IIoT
    networks and gaining control over operational systems connected to them, the primary
    targets are frequently vendors or distant services. The front-office stage usually
    occurs when a hacker tries to enter or use the IIoT. Analysts trace the system
    during the investigation phase, look for weaknesses, and decide when an extensive
    attack would be most effective. Pivoting, which is the act of switching from one
    system to another to apply the necessary exploits and compromise Industrial Control
    Systems (ICSs), may be involved. The problem of malicious website crawling employing
    specific techniques has been covered in several studies. A brand-new method named
    PHONEY, presented by Madhusudhanan et al. [51], allows for automated detection
    and analysis of phishing attacks. A web browser extension that informs users about
    the caliber of websites, their security certificates, and whether they have been
    found to contain dangerous code or misleading URLs is the basic idea behind PHONEY.
    Figure 3 depicts PHONEYâs entire structure. Figure 3. PHONEY Architectureâs Block
    Diagram [51]. Using PHONEY tokens, the article [52] provided an innovative technique
    for spotting website phishing material. In the paper [53], authors devised a technique
    for ranking, detecting, and phishing sites based on association rules and categorization,
    creating correlations between objects and association criteria. In the sense of
    precision, their approach outperformed more sophisticated standardizations like
    the SVM algorithm. The authors in [54] built a prototype web browser as an agent
    for processing data from phishing attacks, enabling users to access emails securely
    and receive alerts if an attack is discovered. The Intelligence Web Application
    Firewall (IWAF), an automated active security tool for identifying phishing assaults
    in crucial infrastructure, is a cutting-edge ML technique suggested by [55]. To
    improve the ability of critical infrastructure to respond, IWAF uses an updating
    Izhikevich spiking neuron model to recognize phishing websites and convert the
    information into firewall rules. The Industrial IoT device network traffic is
    parsed for features of interest, and the Izhikevich spiking model algorithm classifies
    and recognizes phishing assaults. Creating and converting indicators of compromise
    (IoCs) into group policy objects (GPOs), which are then applied to Windows Active
    Directory, establishes rules to stop and restrict phishing assaults. The URL Encoding
    (UE) technique, which analyzes relationships between various domain names and
    computes correlation coefficients among URLs, was first described in the publication
    [56]. The technique entails utilizing a network of neural networks to translate
    dispersed visualizations of URLs and then storing the mapping to handle spatial
    complexity. The authors suggest using clever machine-learning techniques to recognize
    malicious website addresses in DNS queries before they are executed. By mapping
    a sequence model based on extracting URLs from spam emails, the publication authors
    [57] created a method for identifying botnets. In [58], writers investigated various
    machine-learning techniques for categorizing websites according to their features
    and content. They used information, including IP addresses, WHOIS records, and
    lexical characteristics of phishing URLs, to filter emails connected to phishing
    and identify questionable domain registrations in the paper [59]. By building
    regular signatures based on expressions from a set of spam address data, Xie et
    al. [60] concentrated on identifying spamming botnets. By examining DNS queries,
    including multiple addresses (As) and NS records, IP ranges, time-to-leave (TTL),
    and alphanumeric characters from domains, the author developed a method [61] for
    identifying and reducing botnet infection. Furthermore, the study suggested by
    [55] presents a ground-breaking defense mechanism against fast-flux botnets, which
    use domains created using the domain generation algorithm (DGA) method. The system
    builds a Smart URL Filter within a zone-based policy firewall to find harmful
    domain names generated by algorithms. The third and most sophisticated generation
    of neural networks, also known as the evolving spiking neural network (eSNN),
    which mimics how the human brain operates, is used in this system. Comparing it
    to other developing and bio-inspired learning techniques, the suggested method
    showed improved prediction accuracy and generalization to fresh data. 3.2. Attacks
    by Ransomware In this form of attack, malware is introduced into the IIoT system
    to cause a denial of service (DoS) or access to private files, and the users are
    then required to pay a fee to regain access. Unlike traditional ransomware, which
    is generally disseminated, IIoT ransomware is typically targeted, i.e., it focuses
    on essential system components to cause as much harm as possible. Due to this
    restriction, IIoT ransomware research cannot be considered transferable to conventional
    ransomware. The authors of [62] present a comprehensive and methodical examination
    of the hazards posed by IIoT ransomware and offer some viable suggestions for
    remedies. According to their findings, IIoT edge gateways are particularly susceptible
    to ransomware assaults in IIoT networks. The IIoT gateways have some features
    in an industrial setting, despite different variations in their working as well
    as architecture. In a typical IIoT edge gateway, input/output (I/O) or program
    logic controller (PLC) devices act as a conduit between the outside globe and
    crucial IIoT infrastructure. The attacker can take complete control of an IIoT
    gateway after successfully attacking it with ransomware by changing its password
    and then replacing the current firmware with malicious code. Although the individual
    succeeds in reaching the surroundings of locking, the hacker is still capable
    of encryption and accession of all customers and their data, including those achieved
    from the PLCs and input/output devices as well as those exchanged across the internet
    and the business. The attacker can then threaten to slowly remove the victimâs
    data in case of unpaid ransom or demand payment to gain access to the information.
    To assess the vulnerabilities in IIoT edge frameworks, M. Al-Hawawreh and colleagues
    constructed a functional testbed for an IIoT framework in compliance with the
    Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA), as depicted in Figure 4 [31].
    Figure 4. The Evaluation Platform (Testbed) for IIoT Systems. Their setup consists
    of three main elements: IIoT channels, input-output devices (like IoT actuators,
    controllers, and sensors), digital actors (such as maintenance personnel, email,
    and cloud servers for handling IoT data, and SCADA real-time monitoring devices).
    They employed Python code similar to the Erebus Linux Ransomware attack to execute
    proof-of-concept (PoC) ransomware attacks on this framework. This targeted ransomware
    attack affected various web services, databases, and multimedia files from a web
    hosting service [60]. Reference [63] description outlines the primary stages of
    the attack, which also include scanning for data and system files in specified
    directories of the IT/OT edge gateway, encrypting data and identifying original
    files, transmitting the pilfered data as an email attachment via Simple Mail Transfer
    Protocol (SMTP) to a fabricated email account, and notifying the user about the
    ransom demand. M. AlHawawreh and team collected and analyzed data related to system
    performance, such as CPU usage, memory load, I/O device utilization, and CPU processing
    demands, and compared these metrics to data collected when the system was malware-free.
    Their findings show that compared to a similar attack on a desktop, the targeted
    ransom attack on the IIoT edge gateway considerably increased system resource
    utilization and processing power. These findings led the authors to conclude that
    keeping an eye on kernel-related activity characteristics can serve as a valuable
    predictor of crypto-ransomware attacks on IIoT edge gateways. M. Al-Hawawreh advocated
    adopting advanced security measures to fortify IIoT architectures against such
    attacks. These measures include the implementation of Next-Generation Firewalls
    equipped with sophisticated traffic filtering capabilities, the deployment of
    monitoring solutions like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for prompt recognition
    of malicious activities, and the strategic segregation of the IIoT edge gateway
    by positioning it in a specially designated secure area. These precautionary steps
    aim to substantially improve the resilience of IIoT systems to threats of this
    nature. Numerous research studies have used machine and deep learning (DL) techniques
    in different domains alongside traditional methods [64,65,66,67]. For improving
    the detection of ransomware outbreaks to consistently detect Windows ransomware
    network attacks, the authors of [68] presented a detection model using dynamic
    ML approaches, specifically conversation-based network traffic features. Their
    tests showed that the feature database performed exceptionally well in accuracy.
    Two independent classifiers running concurrently at the packet and flow levels
    were used by the authors of [69] to create a network-based intrusion detection
    system to find Locky ransomware. The suggested methodology demonstrated high tracking
    efficiency and good detection precision for ransomware attacks. To minimize data
    dimensions and provide accurate activity visualizations, also suggested was a
    hybrid detection model that combines classical auto-encoding (CAE) [70] and variational
    auto-encoding (VAE) DL approaches [71]. A deep neural network (DNN) classifier
    was trained using a new vector created from extracted characteristics. The proposed
    approach performed the highest concerning detection rate (DR), false negative
    rate (FNR), and support vector machine (SVM) [72,73] efficiency when compared
    to other models, such as random forest [61], decision trees [68], logistic regression
    (LR), SVM, and DNN [73]. 3.3. Attacks on Protocols The OSI network framework for
    the Internet of Things (IoT) consists of five hierarchical layers: physical, data-link,
    network, transport, and application. In the context of IIoT devices, the first
    four layers often employ the same protocols utilized in conventional IoT systems,
    such as IEEE 802.15.4 6LoWPAN, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), IEEE 802.11 (commonly
    used by WiFi), Long-Term Evolution (LTE), and UDP/TCP protocols. This analysis
    emphasizes the significance of the application layer, which is vital for IIoT
    solutions, and provides a summary of potential risks and countermeasures applicable
    to the foundational four layers. These six layersâapplication layer, transport
    layer, network later, adaptation layer, MAC layer as well as physical layerâconstitute
    the OSI networkâs tiered structure for IoT, as delineated in Table 2 [74]. Table
    2. Comparison of IoT Protocol Stack and TCP/IP Stack [69]. 3.3.1. Attacks on Physical
    and Data-Link Layers Numerous studies have focused on attacks targeting different
    layers of IoT systems and have proposed corresponding countermeasures [74,75,76,77].
    At the physical and data-link layers, denial-of-service (DoS) assaults are among
    the most prevalent dangers. In these assaults, rogue devices reduce the nodesâ
    processing power to turn off the system. The most common techniques used in DoS
    assaults include jamming, collision, exhaustion, and unfairness [77]. While tinkering,
    DoS assaults include physically altering sensor nodes, such as wiring on the electrical
    board or joining cables and buzzing. DoS threats entail transmitting signals at
    the same frequency to interfere with conversation. Cross-layer security detection
    and a jammed area mapping model (JAM) are two surveillance technologies created
    to identify buzzing DoS attacks and decrease their consequences [75,76,77,78].
    Tampering risks in wireless sensor networks (WSN) and RFID sensor networks (RRSN)
    can be found and avoided by physical inspection or by using particular instruments.
    When a malicious device transmits data on the victimâs frequency, it launches
    an interference DoS assault that results in subsequent signal transmissions and
    crashes. A fatigue assault is when the collision attack continues until the targeted
    nodeâs energy resources are depleted [79]. Injustice assaults take advantage of
    the systemâs decreased functionality brought on by fatigue threats for their advantage.
    Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) is one method of protection versus buzzing
    and crash assaults [80,81]. Assaults on data transfer that target IoT systemsâ
    physical and data-link layers, such as packet sniffing and man-in-the-middle (MitM)
    attacks, are common. Data encryption technologies such as the asymmetric encryption
    standard (AES) in IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN networks [82], wired equivalent privacy
    (WEP), and WiFi Protected Access II (WPA2) in WiFi and LTE networks [83] are some
    of the countermeasures for these dangers. Encrypting data using technologies such
    as the asymmetric encryption standard (AES) in IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN networks
    [82], wiring equivalent private (WEP), and WiFi Protected Access II (WPA2) in
    WiFi and LTE networks [83] are some of the solutions for these risks. Numerous
    studies have discussed assaults on the layers and offer suitable defenses [74,75,76,77].
    Denial of service (DoS) assaults constitute one of the most prevalent dangers
    at the physical and data-link levels. This kind of threat causes the system to
    become unavailable by reducing the nodesâ processing power. The four most significant
    DoS attack techniques are jamming, collision, exhaustion, and unfairness [77].
    In contrast to node sensor manipulation, which involves physically taking control
    of the sensor node by connecting to the computer board or adding wires to the
    motherboard of the circuit, a DoS assault involves the attacker transmitting at
    the same frequencies to interfere with the transmitted signal. To identify jamming
    DoS attacks, the researchers of [75,76,77,78,79,80,81] propose a jamming area
    mapping model (JAM) that bypasses the crowded region of the wireless sensor network
    (WSN) by rerouting the packets to alternate channels. By physically inspecting
    the WSN with the naked eye or with specialized equipment, tampering hazards can
    be recognized and eliminated. When an attackerâs device begins transmitting messages
    on the target deviceâs frequency, collisions, and packet retransmissions result.
    This is known as an interference DoS assault. A fatigue attack is one in which
    the impact attack lasts until the intended nodeâs resources for energy run out
    [82]. If an exhaustion attack compromises a systemâs capability to benefit hostile
    users, this is known as an injustice assault. Frequency-hopping spread spectrum
    (FHSS) technology is used for efficient protection versus jamming and crash attacks
    [83,84,85,86,87]. Information transportation assaults, such as sniffing of packets
    and man in the middle (MitM) attacks, are highly prevalent at both the physical
    and data-link levels of IoT systems involving wireless sensor networks (WSN) and
    RFID sensor networks (RRSN). Encrypting information technologies such as the asymmetric
    encryption standard (AES) in IEEE 802.15.4 and 6LoWPAN systems [88,89,90], wired
    equivalent privacy (WEP), and WiFi Protected Access II (WPA2) in WiFi and LTE
    networks [91] are used as solutions against this kind of danger. 3.3.2. Attacks
    on Network Layer Routing and DoS attacks, transmission of data assaults, and threats
    on the neighbor discovery protocol (NDP) are the most often seen threats at the
    network layer of IoT devices [75]. In routing attacks, the malicious device transmits
    the active signals to the incorrect routes, and in denial-of-service assaults
    (DoS), it overwhelms the networkâs resources and clogs up data. Evacuation sorting,
    authorization, and control technologies, such as IoT-specific intrusion detection
    system (IDS) solutions like SVELTE, are efficient defenses against these attacks
    [92,93,94]. Information transfer threats impact data integrity and confidentiality.
    Datagrams Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is one of the condensed transport protocols
    that can be used as safeguards [89,90]. Work [85] discusses the dangers to the
    neighbor discovery protocol (NDP). This work thoroughly overviews the operation
    and the most frequent assaults against NDP. This article also includes a complete
    analysis of tunneling (IPSec) and secure neighbor discovery (SEND) procedures,
    two NDP security techniques. The study results show that SEND is a highly effective
    defense against DNP protocol attacks for NDP, although most operating systems
    still do not provide enough assistance. Common risks to IoT devices at their network
    layer involve DoS and router assaults, assaults on data transport, and attacks
    on the neighbor discovery protocol (NDP) [70]. Routing assaults include illegal
    devices passing active data to the wrong pathways, whereas DoS attacks overwhelm
    the networkâs resources and generate traffic congestion. Egress filtering, authorization,
    and monitoring technologies like IoT-specific intrusion detection system (IDS)
    solutions like SVELTE are effective defenses against these threats [84]. Datagram
    Transport Layer Security (DTLS), among other condensed transfer procedures, can
    be used to reduce the impact of information transit assaults on data integrity
    and secrecy [77]. In [85], which additionally examines defense techniques, including
    tunneling (IPSec) and secure neighbor discovery (SEND) standards, the dangers
    to the NDP are detailed in detail. Deliver is the most effective defense against
    NDP assaults despite most operating systems failing to embrace it entirely. 3.3.3.
    Attacks on Transport Layer IoT systemsâ transport layers are frequently targeted
    by attacks, including desynchronization, SYN flooding, and MQTT exploiting assaults
    [75]. Desynchronization threats interfere with terminal synchronization by inserting
    messages with fictitious command flag number sequences. A strong defense against
    desynchronization assaults is the authentication of messages [86,87,88]. SYN flooding
    attacks involve inundating the target with many SYN messages, which clogs the
    targetâs queue and prevents it from processing valid SYN inquiries. By improving
    memory and queue management within the transport protocols and bolstering network
    security with packet screening and intermediary methods, SYN flooding assaults
    can be mitigated [84]. Work [85] lists the MQTT protocolâs shortcomings. Because
    it lacks built-in data encryption and authentication measures, the simple communication
    system MQTT, created for IoT applications with limited bandwidth, is open to assaults.
    Developing safe MQTT protocols that use attribute-based encryption (ABE) for scalable
    and reliable security is offensive against MQTT exploitation. An essential component
    of IoT applications, secure message delivery to numerous recipients, is supported
    by ABE [91]. Table 1 lists the most frequent protocol assaults in the IIoT, their
    hazards, and any suggested defenses. Desynchronization, SYNflooding, and message
    queue telemetry transport (MQTT) make assaults among the most common IoT vulnerabilities
    at the transport layer [95]. Desynchronization assaults cause destinations to
    become out of sync by injecting messages with fictitious control flag sequence
    numbers. Message authentication is a valuable countermeasure [96,97,98,99]. In
    SYN-flooding assaults, the malicious device floods the target with many SYN packets.
    The faked device does not send acknowledgments (ACKs) in response to the victimâs
    SYN-ACKs. Consequently, the target cannot receive valid requests for SYN because
    of a total backlog. To defend against SYN-flooding assaults, transport protocols
    must be modified and optimized. Memory and queue management must also be made
    to handle SYN packets more efficiently, and network security must be strengthened
    using packet filtering and proxy techniques [100,101,102]. The writers of [103]
    outline the shortcomings of the message queue telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol.
    A simple communication protocol called MQTT is tailored for remote equipment management
    with bandwidth restrictions, such as IoT applications. MQTT modifies the publish-and-subscribe
    communication strategy. However, because MQTT does not, by design, include any
    confidentiality or identity method, it is highly susceptible to assaults. Implementing
    scalability and reliable safety methods, such as the safe MQTT procedure that
    upholds the attribute-based encryption (ABE) methodâs security, is critical to
    protection against MQTT attacks. ABE offers broadcasting encoding, a preferred
    capability in IoT gadgets [104,105,106], and enables secure message delivery to
    multiple intended receivers. Table 3 provides a comprehensive overview of the
    most frequently encountered protocol attacks in IIoT, outlining the associated
    risks and suggested mitigation strategies. Table 3. General attacks in the primary
    four layers of the IoT stack and probable countermeasures. 3.3.4. Attacks on Application
    Layer Threats aimed at the SCADA protocol, frequently employed in SCADA networks,
    often target the application layer of IIoT systems. The writers of [107] focused
    on sensor assaults against loops of control for collecting SCADA infrastructure
    information, especially in gas pipelines and water tank storage implementations.
    The sensors themselves are PLCs (programmable logic controllers), acting as the
    operational devices in a network linked to provide remote monitoring and control
    of high-speed reaction processes, even across dispersed locations. The widely
    used SCADA Modbus messaging protocol that enables clientâserver connection over
    multiple bus or network types, generally via serial lines, makes it possible to
    communicate among these gadgets. In the operated computer simulation, the researchâs
    attention was directed toward Modbus masterâs gadgets, which provide queries for
    details to facilitate discrete or analog IO communication and data recording by
    the slave, Modbus. Every transaction uses a simple demandâresponse method in which
    the master gadget sends the request, and the agent device answers appropriately.
    After realizing several flaws in the Modbus protocol implementations, they continued
    to mimic those weaknesses in a monitored setting. They were able to perform this
    to document and assess the different kinds of attacks that might take place. The
    lack of identification of a fake slaveâmaster IP address within the SCADA network
    is a flaw in Modbus technology. By submitting requests with the wrong IP addresses,
    an unauthorized remote intrusive can use this security hole to launch a man-in-the-middle
    (MitM) assault. An intruder can learn more about the MSUs and MTUs of the network
    by examining the emails that are delivered. An additional flaw results from insufficient
    safety measures and identity/certification inspections that jeopardize verifying
    the Modbus master and agent device connection. Using a Modbus master, this weakness
    permits outsiders to send random commands to any slave equipment without authenticating
    themselves. The SCADA Modbus system is also vulnerable to abuse due to development
    problems in handling request messages and separate input read responses. As a
    result, a remote attacker with malicious request or response parameters who targets
    susceptible Modbus programs can start a denial of service (DoS) or distributed
    denial of service (DDoS) attack on a SCADA network. Last, Modbus TCP is the most
    widely used protocol for process control in SCADA systems. To allow communication
    via a serial RS-485 interface, the protocol being used sets a size restriction
    of 253 bytes for the protocol data unit (PDU). The Modbus protocol header is extended
    by 7 bytes by Modbus TCP, significantly limiting the permitted package size. An
    attacker can take advantage of this restriction by crafting a custom packet with
    more than 260 bytes and sending it to a Modbus master-slave. A successful buffer
    overflow attack may occur if the devices are not correctly set up to reject such
    packets. Using systems to detect and prevent intrusions with deep packet inspection
    capabilities or industrial firewalls is a frequent countermeasure to reduce such
    security threats. Such networks are able to recognize as well as avoid exact threats
    that are concealed within the communication flow [108]. In this regard, Liang
    et al. suggest a multi-feature data clustering optimization model-based corporate
    system intrusion detection system that achieves a detection rate of 97.8% and
    reduces false positives by 8.8% [109]. An autonomous progressive neural network
    and the support vector machine are combined in Constantinides et al.âs novel network
    intrusion prevention system based on incremental ML frameworks and exhibit robust
    and scalable accomplishment appropriate for industrial uses as Table 4 shows the
    overall main threats with possible solutions in case of application layer protocols
    [110,111]. Table 4. Main security threats and required solutions in application
    layer protocols [110,111]. Modbus protocols, such as TCP design, also use ML-based
    intrusion detection techniques. A data preprocessing technique is presented by
    Deng et al. based on the frequency of coils and function codes for the Modbus
    protocol that are seen in Modbus TCP traffic. They used a support vector machine
    model to identify aberrant Modbus TCP traffic patterns [112]. In addition, intrusion
    detection and prevention technologies based on the cloud can potentially protect
    industry networks. An exact cloud-based design that makes use of software-defined
    networking, network function virtualization, and service function chaining is
    proposed by Brugman et al. This method uses a virtual private cloud hosted on
    Amazon Web Services to send messages to a public cloud for assessment, offering
    scalability, resilience, and visibility in identifying and preventing cybersecurity
    threats [108]. 3.4. Attacks by Supply-Chain Threats on supply chains carry a significant
    danger, particularly when the IIoT is integrated into the Industry 4.0 supply
    chain. In this way, cybersecurity presents a significant difficulty. Malicious
    code implanted within hardware chips can be highly evasive and run unnoticed for
    an extended time. Safety concerns result from the IIoT environmentâs complexity
    and the involvement of several parties. The devicesâ many parts are produced by
    numerous suppliers, assembled by another vendor, and then delivered by another
    party. This difficult-to-avoid circumstance frequently results in safety flaws,
    like installing backdoors that could endanger a whole manufacturing range, as
    depicted in Figure 5. Risk management has given more consideration to other partiesâ
    involvement in the supply chain. They [113] studied supply chain hazards and suggested
    methods for managing risk in their study. They offer perceptions of the IoT supply
    chain risk landscape, highlighting its extreme diversity. Figure 5. Meaningful
    connections among many participants in the IoT supply chain ecosystem [113]. Given
    the identical protocols and traits, the description of supply chain risks associated
    with IoT also applies to the Industrial IoT context. Vendors can insert viruses,
    backdoor channels, or defective chips into their products. Identifying and managing
    supply chain risks might be difficult since they grow and spread throughout the
    intricate IoT ecosystem. It is challenging to analyze how gadgets and vendors
    communicate. Therefore, addressing hazards calls for a supply-chain approach.
    A distributed system and a centralized, top-down approach are both suggested.
    Although this work helps readers comprehend the hazards associated with supply
    chains, it fails to suggest any concrete technological protections for environments
    already exposed to such dangers that are unwilling to change their comprehensive
    risk mitigation approach. A further contribution in the article [114,115] provides
    a dynamic and self-adapting supply chain system that AI, ML, and genuine expertise
    drive4. This strategy intends to create a blueprint for Industry 4.0 supply chains
    of small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs), who frequently do not have the assets
    to manage digital security risks successfully. Table 5 shows the research emphasizes
    the limitations of current methods for assessing the impact of cyber risk on supply
    chain infrastructure. Industry 4.0â²s supply chain processes are poorly understood,
    which results in uneven measurements of supply chain security risks. Risk Analysis
    of IoT Supply chain Threats (RIoTS), a risk analysis technique for connected technologies
    like the Internet of Things, has been described in a separate paper [116]. Their
    strategy switches from focusing on vulnerabilities to modeling suppliers and components
    as a system. They suggest modifying attack tree approaches to consider vendor
    dangers and potential provider collaboration, exposing concealed dangers inside
    the IoT ecosystem. Numerous investigations primarily focus on supply chain attack
    risk prevention strategies. Table 5. The preventive measures of IIoT supply chain
    attacks [112,113,114,115,116]. 3.5. Attacks by Whole System Given their broad
    use and importance, attacks on SCADA systems are frequent in many industrial facilities
    worldwide. Addressing the security of SCADA systems is crucial due to the complexity
    and variety of these devices and their implementation in vital industries like
    water and energy. A detailed analysis of SCADA device attacks is provided in Reference
    [117], along with a particular solution for their prompt and efficient detection.
    The emphasis is on situations wherein assailants use a man-in-the-middle (MitM)
    assault on an Ethernet connections circle using the deviceâs root level ring (RLR)
    procedure, followed by a sneaky sensor threat, to exploit the fieldbus communication
    within the industrial EtherNet/IP protocol. A commercial computer network called
    Fieldbus is used for global control that operates in real-time and supports different
    network structures, including daisy-chain, stars, rings, branches, and trees.
    Gadgets use IO variables and communications that do not have particular formats
    and dimensions in fieldbus communication using the industrial EtherNet/IP protocol
    since the controllerâs manufacturer decides these. 4â20 mA measurements are also
    used for encoding analog sensor command signals. Therefore, to understand the
    shared information and utilize the advantages of the instruments, a hacker needs
    a thorough understanding of the systemâs architecture and access to device specs,
    engineering documents, and implementation designs. Utilizing multiplexed EtherNet/IP
    connections employing the User Datagram Protocol, also known as (UDP), sensors
    and control devices in the system are able to communicate wirelessly with one
    another. Multicast functions at the IP level, so all UDP messages with an identified
    target IP will be allowed, even though only gadgets adhering to a particular multicast
    address receive the multicast frames. Despite other datagrams inside the Class
    A to Class C address spaces, IPv4 multicast, which uses the Class D address space
    (224.0.0.0â239.255.255.255), does not guarantee accurate delivery of this data
    to the information receivers. Each address in the Class D address space designates
    a group of recipients interested in receiving the data via the IPv4 multicast
    data delivery method. A host can join a group by delivering a JOIN Internet Group
    Message Protocol (IGMP) message, enabling involvement with no time constraints
    or group ownership. Additionally, sending data to the group does not need a membership
    or the monitoring of transmitted data, making it extremely simple for an intrusive
    party to position itself as a man-in-the-middle (MItM). The assailant launches
    a covert sensor assault after determining the MItM placement. To change the behavior
    of specific processes without being detected by the systemâs tracking devices,
    this assault requires changing the settings of the sensors and actuators. Think
    about an instance where an untreated water storage reservoir has a sensor to monitor
    the level of water, an opening that opens when the sensor detects a level below
    0.5 m and closes when the level exceeds 0.8 m, and a pump whose operation is based
    on the Ultrafiltration (UF) process, where pressure or concentration gradients
    enable separation through a semipermeable membrane. The safety system requires
    that the pump be promptly turned off if the water level in the tank drops below
    0.25 m. The intruder wants to change the depth of the water without being detected
    by traditional anomaly-based monitoring systems. In order to update the functioning
    of the gadgets in accordance, this is accomplished by creating the proper packets
    that modify the sensor and actuator information while still assuring compliance
    with the Fieldbus communication. F. Mercaldo et al. has created an intelligent
    and straightforward method using time logic and high-level capabilities unique
    to SCADA architecture. To describe the behavior of the SCADA system and assess
    its resilience to an assault, they simulate the system logs using a network of
    synchronous automata. Beginning with separating SCADA system logs from other logs.
    The procedure records values that correspond to real-world measurements made by
    network controllers. Then, those notable results are divided into three groups:
    high, baseline, and low. The data is supplied into an automated system that employs
    automata, which are mathematical constructs that preserve machines with abstract
    finite states that can be used to solve challenging issues. An automated system
    changes states based on the input symbol and the transition function. An automaton
    is implemented and synchronized with a particular clock for each discrete scenario.
    A status table displays the system statuses in a temporal format for every situation
    evolution. The machines are randomly checked to find excess or underflow. Any
    divergence from the status table that is discovered denotes a system threat. Although
    several clever methods are being put out for effectively examining web traffic
    among gadgets in the IIoT [118,119,120], particular standards are suggested in
    the paper âBlockchain Security Architecture for IIoTâ [121]. This design, built
    on DL smart contracts, aims to improve the security and usefulness of industrial
    applications by giving SCADA equipment access to a decentralized, dependable peer-to-peer
    network. It closes a significant hole in the functionality of IIoT systems, especially
    regarding heterogeneous infrastructures built on blockchain. In order to perform
    sophisticated anomaly detection functions through smart contracts and enable secure
    network connection across trade devices within the system, the architecture uses
    the blockchain systemâs characteristics. A complex deep automatic encoding is
    incorporated into the suggested deep neural network intelligent instrumentâs code,
    providing a smart way to classify hazardous abnormalities in IIoT transactions,
    which frequently contain sophisticated cyberattacks. An auto-encoder is a coupled
    neural network architecture comprising an encoder and a decoder. Input data, such
    as network traffic between master and agent devices, is transformed into a compact
    and more dense representation known as a latent representation by the encoder
    network. The decoder network then reconstructs the original input using this hidden
    information. An automatic encoderâs job is to accurately recreate input data from
    a compressed and abstract representation it has learned. Using an autoencoder,
    the network can effectively compress the original data, filter out noise, and
    identify potential vulnerabilities associated with attacks in the SCADA Modbus
    protocol. Assault against industrial control systems, also known as ICS, frequently
    entails changing the programming language of programmable logic controller (PLC)
    devices or influencing the regulation of centrifuges to interfere with industrial
    machineryâs operation. The optimal power flow (OPF) algorithm, frequently employed
    in power plant controllers to find the best power systems management method while
    reducing expenditures and preserving the systemâs safety, is maliciously applied
    in one attack scenario described in [122]. Power line power and the permitted
    generator frequency span, for example (59.5â21.1 Hz for a 60 Hz rated power grid
    in the US), are two factors that are generally subject to constraints. The PLCâs
    programmable logic controller (PLC) transmits control signals to sensors responsible
    for power generation, system security margins, on/off commands, and other functions.
    Luis et al. maliciously alters the PLCâs optimal power flow (OPF) control algorithm
    in this research. Three changes are made: the safety margin state is eliminated,
    the cost minimization algorithm is changed to increase the hostile impact, and
    hidden conditions are added to prevent operators and SCADA devices from detecting
    malicious behavior. Various anomaly detection strategies have been implemented
    to handle behavioral aberrations by attacks. Even when the type of assault is
    unresolved, such efforts are made to detect aberrations. This entails contrasting
    the frameworkâs performance as it currently stands with a model or a set of parameters
    that describe typical functioning [123,124]. Network factors like operating conditions
    and average electrical power throughout periods are taken into account by behavioral
    analysis. Heuristic evaluation is one of the further investigation techniques
    used to find trends and recognize irregularities with no set of unfounded alarms
    [125,126,127]. System behavior can be abnormal in many ways, including individual,
    situational, aggregate, and protocol abnormalities. These anomalies display behavior
    that differs from the anticipated patterns and can be classified according to
    their traits and consequences. A simple anomaly detection strategy may not be
    sufficient when extremely sophisticated threats occur, like those discussed by
    Luis et al. There is a need for more intricate and advanced techniques. However,
    [128] suggests a straightforward yet efficient system capable of precisely identifying
    sophisticated attacks. The Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm, which intuitively
    accumulates the difference between a variable and its predicted value over time,
    is the foundation of the technique. Change occurs when the cumulative amount rises
    above a specific threshold. Equation (1) is used by the CUSUM method to identify
    changes. Sn stands for the cumulative value at sample n, xn for the observed data
    at sampling n, and wn for the anticipated mean of the observed data in the formula.
    A change is identified whenever Sn rises beyond a predefined threshold based on
    the relative size of the change and the noise in x. S n +1 =max(0,  S n + x n
    â Ï n ) (1) while S 0 =0, In the research run by Luis et al., the anomaly detection
    algorithm, based on the CUSUM approach, was successfully employed and validated
    for recognizing abnormalities. In this case, the algorithm continuously tracked
    the deterministic PLC control initiativeâs execution duration and produced alerts
    whenever adjustments were found. The program was successful in spotting early
    anomalies frequently linked to assaults. It obtained exceptionally accurate stages,
    identifying the majority of irregularities in a matter of moments and up to five
    minutes in the event of a crisis. The quick discovery considerably reduces the
    assailantsâ capacity to harm the equipment. Additionally, the methodologyâs ease
    of use makes it appropriate for integration into PLCs with limited resources,
    serving as an essential security safeguard for the entire IIoT environment. In
    overall Section 3, the fundamental idea of comprehensive cybersecurity connects
    several security attack categories. Our evaluated work and the publications we
    cited most likely emphasize the need for a multifaceted approach to security that
    takes into account both specific modes of attack and an entityâs overall security
    posture. Furthermore, studies and actual examples are likely to highlight the
    value of ongoing surveillance, the exchange of threat intelligence, and teamwork
    among cybersecurity experts and businesses in order to recognize, hinder, and
    counter developing attacks. In conclusion, our comprehensive approach to cybersecurity
    encompass various attack vectors, recognizing that attackers often exploit vulnerabilities
    across different layers and parts of the system. It requires ongoing vigilance,
    adaptation, and a strategic blend of technical, organizational, and human-centric
    countermeasures to safeguard against diverse and evolving security threats. 4.
    Discussion The widespread use of infrastructure protection and the viability of
    the offered solutions should not be taken for granted, given that the cyber security
    of the IIoT ecosystem is a complex issue, as previously discussed [129]. The intricate
    nature of the components engaged in the IIoT and the broad spectrum of weaknesses
    that may arise from the visible major obstacles while referring to complicated
    patterns, systems, or processes that might not develop simultaneously over time
    and become possible shortcomings of the overall networks. [130]. For older, un-upgraded
    systems in the high-complexity environment under study, the complicated relationship
    descriptions and the minute distinctions that set them apart exhibit multivariate
    standardization systems while maintaining high heterogeneity [7]. The intricacy
    and secrecy of supply chain attacks, which make them difficult to combat effectively,
    have made them stand out among the other dangers as a considerable worry [131,132].
    Approaches to risk management are frequently used to lessen such attacks. However,
    the existence of older industrial systems not initially developed with security
    as a precondition is a significant problem. This weakness significantly increases
    the risk of assaults, even if access control or encryption methods are later included
    [133,134,135]. Additionally, there are serious issues about the mechanisms for
    standardizing and harmonizing with already-instituted norms. Due to the dependence
    of many existing IIoT systems on their development businesses, it is challenging
    to modify or adapt their mechanisms, including the functions they support [7].
    Due to its real-time operation and rapid evolution, the IIoT also encounters challenges
    in managing data with time discrepancies and considering correlations and interdependencies
    with other devices in the data flow sequence [98,100,105]. In manuscript [136],
    the authors investigated malicious attacks in underwater wireless sensor networks
    (UWSNs) by using a lightweight key management framework. An elliptic-curve-based
    algorithm was utilized for the key distribution, while a certificate-revocation-list-based
    algorithm was used for key revocation. This method provides high security with
    small amount of communication overhead compared to already existing methods. To
    ensure the security, reliability, and accuracy of the data, these factors introduce
    new requirements. Encryption [113] and critical management strategies have been
    proposed and implemented in the IIoT context, providing strong security standards.
    They are constrained, nevertheless, in their ability to create procedures that
    are rapid and simple to use, making them appropriate for usage in low-resource
    devices. One major conclusion of this research is that their ML methods depend
    on device or network traffic data [106,116]. In manuscript [137,138], a novel
    method is proposed to investigate as well as identify the anomalous behavior of
    attacks in IIoT technology, called the transformer-based method. This method has
    good performance compared to conventional ML methods as well as deep learning
    approaches based on accuracy, precision, and recall. There is an advanced and
    important framework called the reference technique. It was proposed with the purpose
    of providing security against different outsourcing flaws in the current era including
    side channels as well as state preparation flaws, which are created by mode dependencies
    and some attacks like Trojan horses and pulse correlations. In manuscript [131],
    the authors adopted the reference technique for proving the security of four-phase
    measurement device quantum key distribution (QKD) by using laser pulses to fight
    against potential attacks. One of the advanced security objectives of information
    is cryptography, which has subobjectives including confidentiality, non-repudiation,
    integrity, and authenticity. In manuscript [132], the authors proposed a highly
    efficient quantum digital signature (QDS) protocol that uses asymmetric quantum
    keys. The authors successfully completed the demonstration of the complete function
    of a quantum security network, which met all required objectives of information
    security. Although the learned parameters lack certain variables from different
    usage or behavioral elements in the overall design due to the limited methods,
    the smoothing is insignificant. The main problems originate from the inappropriate
    sharing of current statistics with all automatic internal looping updates, since
    it is mistakenly assumed that the original model and all of its updated replicates
    have similar feature distributions. As mentioned, a more effective method is to
    progressively save analyses in stages and read the optimization parameters for
    each internal loop. 5. Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive description
    of attacks on Industrial IoT systems. It addresses these structuresâ essential
    qualities and shortcomings and thoroughly analyzes all potential solutions to
    alleviate these vulnerabilities, as recommended in recent research. As a result,
    our attempt serves as an accurate framework for comparison and a valuable scientific
    instrument for identifying and assessing risks in the dynamic industrial environment.
    Its insights significantly improve IIoT security and could assist in developing
    effective defenses against risks posed by the Internet of Things to industrial
    infrastructures. When considering the future development of this study, one important
    topic to look at is the analysis of new attack vectors or complex attack tactics
    that combine fresh attacks, including zero-day attacks. IIoT systems must keep
    informed of new attack vectors and actively respond to threats. Another significant
    development in this research is expanding the analysis of strategies with self-improvement
    and self-adaptation abilities to handle particular and undiscovered threats in
    IIoT contexts. Artificial intelligence and machine-learning-driven solutions can
    increase IIoT systemsâ resistance to shifting cyber threats. To ensure overall
    safety, looking into and evaluating additional protection measures designed especially
    for Industrial IoT systems would be helpful. Given the notable aspects of the
    IIoT, such as real-time operation, resource constraints, and various device types,
    customizable security solutions can offer more effective defenses against possible
    faults and attacks. By focusing on these research topics, the study could be expanded
    further and contribute to ongoing initiatives to improve the safety and resilience
    of Industrial IoT infrastructure in the face of emerging cyber threats. Future
    research can examine novel attack pathways and sophisticated attack strategies,
    such as zero-day assaults, to better understand the changing dangers to IIoT systems.
    Additionally, IIoT security can be strengthened against dynamic cyber threats
    by researching solutions that incorporate self-improvement and self-adaptation
    using artificial intelligence and machine learning. Given their distinctive qualities,
    such as real-time operation and resource limitations, Industrial IoT systems require
    specialized protective measures that must be carefully evaluated. Security systems
    that can be customized may provide stronger defenses. This study contributes to
    ongoing, existing initiatives targeted at bolstering the safety and resilience
    of Industrial IoT infrastructure in the face of rising cyber threats by delving
    into these research topics. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.I. and A.M.A.;

    Abstract: Mobile-health (m-health) is described as the application of medical
    sensors and mobile

    computing to the healthcare provision. While 5G networks can support a variety
    of m-health services,

    applications such as telesurgery, holographic communications, and augmented/virtual
    reality are

    already emphasizing their limitations. These limitations apply to both the Quality
    of Service (QoS)

    and the Quality of Experience (QoE). However, 6G mobile networks are predicted
    to proliferate over

    the next decade in order to solve these limitations, enabling high QoS and QoE.
    Currently, academia

    and industry are concentrating their efforts on the 6G network, which is expected
    to be the next major

    game-changer in the telecom industry and will signiï¬cantly impact all other related
    verticals. The

    exponential growth of m-health multimedia trafï¬c (e.g., audio, video, and images)
    creates additional

    challenges for service providers in delivering a suitable QoE to their customers.
    As QoS is insufï¬cient

    to represent the expectations of m-health end-users, the QoE of the services is
    critical. In recent

    years, QoE has attracted considerable attention and has established itself as
    a critical component of

    network service and operation evaluation. This article aims to provide the ï¬rst
    thorough survey

    on a promising research subject that exists at the intersection of two well-established
    domains, i.e.,

    QoE and m-health, and is driven by the continuing efforts to deï¬ne 6G. This survey,
    in particular,

    creates a link between these two seemingly distinct domains by identifying and
    discussing the role of

    6G in m-health applications from a QoE viewpoint. We start by exploring the vital
    role of QoE in

    m-health multimedia transmission. Moreover, we examine how m-health and QoE have
    evolved over

    the cellular networkâs generations and then shed light on several critical 6G
    technologies that are

    projected to enable future m-health services and improve QoE, including reconï¬gurable
    intelligent

    surfaces, extended radio communications, terahertz communications, enormous ultra-reliable
    and

    low-latency communications, and blockchain. In contrast to earlier survey papers
    on the subject, we

    present an in-depth assessment of the functions of 6G in a variety of anticipated
    m-health applications

    via QoE. Multiple 6G-enabled m-health multimedia applications are reviewed, and
    various use cases

    are illustrated to demonstrate how 6G-enabled m-health applications are transforming
    human life.

    Finally, we discuss some of the intriguing research challenges associated with
    burgeoning multimedia

    m-health applications.

    1. Introduction

    The healthcare industry has constantly adopted the latest technologies with the
    goal

    of improving the overall healthcare of the global population. The use of technology
    has sig-

    niï¬cantly changed the way in which healthcare is provided [1], and it has had
    far-reaching

    impacts on delivering healthcare facilities to the general population, including
    those living

    in remote locations and in underdeveloped countries [2]. The advancements in technology

    have enabled the diagnosis of complicated diseases, and currently, sophisticated
    medical

    treatments are carried out easily. For instance, advancements in medical imaging
    technol-

    ogy have led to an increased understanding of the internals of human physiology,
    and

    this technology has become an important tool for diagnosing patient diseases,
    and condi-

    tions [3]. One of the most important applied technologies in healthcare is communications

    technology. The use of network and communication technologies has, over the decades,

    providing numerous beneï¬ts to healthcare. The earlier communication technologies,
    such

    as wired telephone lines, fax technology and networking technologies, supported
    quick

    and easy communication lines for the exchange of simple diagnostic information
    such as

    patient reports, treatment options, prescriptions, etc. The advent of wireless
    communication

    and the advancements in internet and satellite communication technologies have
    provided

    a signiï¬cant boost to the delivery of healthcare [4]. They are necessary to revitalize
    pri-

    mary healthcare since they contribute to the personalized monitoring of chronic
    diseases,

    increase access to healthcare for rural populations, and optimize data measurement
    and

    management. Patients must have to visit hospitals; it is generally a time-consuming
    and

    labor-intensive process that involves the participation of both the patient and
    healthcare

    workers. It often requires the management of several different healthcare aspects,
    making

    this process even more confusing and overwhelming. Hence, researchers turned towards

    smart healthcare using technologies such as wearable sensors enabled technologies,
    artiï¬-

    cial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) [1,5â7]. Moreover, the
    authors in [8]

    conducted a comprehensive review of E-Health Practices and Technologies from 2014
    to

    2019. E-Health refers to a range of technologies that utilize the internet to
    enhance the

    provision of healthcare services and improve the overall quality of life. Given
    the scarcity

    of research on this subject, their study employs a systematic literature review
    of articles

    published between 2014 and 2019 to identify prevalent e-health practices across
    the globe,

    along with the primary services offered, diseases targeted, and supporting technologies

    employed in this ï¬eld.

    1.1. Objectives

    The objective of this survey paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis and
    un-

    derstanding of the impact of 6G networks on user quality of experience management,

    particularly in the context of healthcare applications. The paper aims to bridge
    the gap in

    existing research by examining the relationship between 6G networks, Quality of
    Experi-

    ence (QoE), and healthcare. The speciï¬c objectives of the paper are as follows:

    â¢

    To extend the previous study by exploring the broader aspects of 6G networks in
    the

    ï¬eld of smart health services and applications.

    â¢

    To investigate how 6G networks can transform healthcare lifestyles and enable
    intelli-

    gent healthcare communication.

    â¢

    To examine the advancements in cellular networks and technologies that contribute
    to

    the improvement of QoE in mobile health (m-health) multimedia applications.

    â¢

    To demonstrate multiple 6G-enabled m-health multimedia applications and their

    impact on human life.

    â¢

    To identify and discuss the research challenges associated with the development
    and

    deployment of multimedia m-health applications in the context of 6G networks.

    1.2. Contributions

    The literature on 6G networks presents numerous features, but there is a lack
    of re-

    search on managing user experience. It is believed that 6G will provide better
    and more

    personalized mobile experiences [9]. Advanced generations of networks demonstrated
    an

    evolution in terms of incorporating the userâs impression of the service. The
    consideration

    of network management was based on a QoS-based approach, where performance indica-

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    3 of 43

    tors were produced in terms of latency, jitter, and call drop percentage, among
    other metrics.

    However, combining voice with multimedia led to an expansion of evaluation to
    include a

    QoE perspective. This transition was prompted by a twofold developing reality
    at the time:

    network enhancements cannot be carried out without ï¬rst analyzing the impact on
    user

    perception and without ï¬rst acknowledging that elements other than network performance

    can inï¬uence user experience. QoS is concerned with network performance, but QoE
    is

    concerned with the performance as perceived by the users. Nowadays, network operators

    are placing greater emphasis on End-to-End (E2E) service quality in order to provide
    the

    best possible user experience. As a result, while migrating to 6G networks, it
    is critical that

    the developments in architecture maintain these quality criteria.

    This research is an extension to our previous study in [10], which only looked
    at

    a few aspects related to 6G in smart health services and applications. In our
    previous

    study, we brieï¬y identiï¬ed and discussed the role of 6G in smart health services
    and

    applications, the critical 6G technologies that are projected to enable future
    smart health

    services applications, and the multiple 6G-enabled smart health applications.
    Moreover,

    there was not much elaboration in terms of taxonomy classiï¬cation, diagrams, tabulations,

    discussion, recommendations and challenges, which could easily help researchers
    to build

    their future research in the ï¬eld. On the other hand, to further improve the impact
    of

    this study, we have expanded the work in [10] to an extent where we look at how
    6G

    could impact the future of healthcare lifestyles and demonstrate how 6G can be
    used for

    intelligent healthcare communications and speciï¬cally the QoE for m-health multimedia

    communications. We examine the advancements made in cellular networks to meet
    the

    demands of new m-health applications, such as high data rates, scalability, latency,
    and

    reliability. We shed light on several 6G technologies that are projected to enable
    future

    m-health services and improve QoE, including reconï¬gurable intelligent surfaces,
    extended

    radio communications, terahertz communications, enormous ultra-reliable and low-latency

    communications, and blockchain. Moreover, we demonstrate multiple 6G-enabled m-health

    multimedia applications along with various use-cases to show how 6G-enabled m-health

    applications are transforming human life. Finally, we discuss some of the intriguing

    research challenges associated with burgeoning multimedia m-health applications.
    To our

    knowledge, there is no publication in the literature where three major players,
    6G, QoE,

    and healthcare, are discussed together. Table A1 provides a list of survey research
    papers

    and their primary focus; there are many surveys and tutorials that cover either
    one or

    two topics among 6G, QoE, and healthcare. Our survey is far broader, covering
    all three

    technologies.

    Figure 1 provides the organization and systematic framework of the survey and
    is

    explained as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretical background of m-health
    and QoE.

    Section 3 provides the methodology adopted in conducting this research and also
    discusses

    the ï¬ndings and limitations. Section 4 provides an overview of QoE and the evolution

    of cellular generations. Section 5 covers the 6G features and advanced technologies
    that

    will transform the healthcare industry and signiï¬cantly contribute to QoE enhancement

    of m-health multimedia applications. In Section 6, some 6G-enabled applications,
    such as

    holographic communication, haptic technology, AI, AR, and VR, have been investigated.

    Section 7 identiï¬es various roadblocks to deploying 6G networks for healthcare,

    2. Theoretical Background

    In this section, an overview of the different aspects used to facilitate the investigation

    of our research are provided. These aspects are Mobile-health (m-health), Multimedia

    Communications in m-health, Quality of Experience (QoE) of Multimedia Communications

    in m-health, and the Role of 6G towards Multimedia Communications.

    2.1. m-Health

    The rapid increase in mobile phone penetration across the globe has led to the
    advent

    of applications that deliver services in different areas, including healthcare.
    Several nations

    across the globe are adopting mobile-based technologies for healthcare. The World
    Health

    Organization (WHO), in their report on mobile-based technologies for healthcare,
    declared

    that over 80 percent of their member nations had made efforts towards the adoption
    and

    implementation of mobile technologies for health in their countries [11]. These
    technologies

    are popularly referred to as m-health technologies, where medical sensors and
    mobile

    computing for healthcare were the original deï¬nitions of mobile health (m-health)
    [12].

    m-health works on the concept of any-time, anywhere access, exploiting the best
    connection

    features of emerging wireless communications and network technologies in a heteroge-

    neous environment. Hence, it provides an alternative to the traditional healthcare
    delivery

    system and assists this system by bridging the gap between terrestrial boundaries
    and rural

    and urban areas. However, it is largely driven by successful business and market
    sectors. It

    still aims to reach the tipping point for clinical adoption and healthcare delivery
    efï¬ciency.

    The three technology pillars of m-health, including telecommunications, computing,
    and

    medical sensing, drive this growing popularity. A massive number of smartphones
    and

    devices connected to a large number of mobile health applications are used worldwide
    by

    both patients and healthcare professionals. These services continuously generate
    structured

    and unstructured datasets, revealing new healthcare insights, but also creating
    some chal-

    lenges. Todayâs m-health apps are increasingly coupled to wearable sensors and
    Internet

    of Things (IoT) devices [6]. These applications are becoming common in everyday
    health,

    wellness, and clinical applications, including chronic disease tracking and management,

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    5 of 43

    remote patient data collection and monitoring, diagnostics and treatment, healthcare
    re-

    source management, patientsâ education and awareness as well as healthcare professionalsâ

    training [13].

    2.2. Multimedia Communications in m-Health

    The different types of data transmitted via m-health applications could include
    text,

    image, and video data. In recent years, there has been a signiï¬cant increase in
    medical

    imaging/videos for diagnostic purposes. Medical imaging technology advancements
    have

    resulted in portable scanning machines that have made producing medical images
    and

    videos easier. Subsequently, medical images and videos are also becoming an important

    part of the data transmitted via m-health applications [14]. Many use cases directly
    touch

    our lives and are now more complete and intuitive using multimedia technologies.
    Systems

    and services have been developed to use the beneï¬ts of multimedia technology,
    e.g., medical

    images and videos can be supplied to remote clinicians for consultation, and they
    can also

    be disseminated for educational and awareness purposes. As an added convenience
    in

    emergency situations, ambulances may be outï¬tted with portable scanners that capture

    and transmit diagnostic information to hospitals. Tele-consultation via video
    conferencing

    and remote patient monitoring sharing medical data can make individuals with chronic

    diseases see their doctors regularly and lessen the requirement for patientâphysician
    visits.

    Gesture recognition and speech recognition are two technologies that are frequently
    used

    in conjunction with telemedicine in the smart medical home. Informing patients
    about

    diagnosis, surgery, and treatment is critical to their understanding of medical
    processes.

    Many patients are being educated using visual, audio, interactive, and internet
    content to

    supplement traditional paper-based information. As a result, medical video streaming
    is

    becoming an increasingly important component of m-health applications.

    Multimedia services are time-sensitive, where efï¬cient network systems are required

    to ensure service quality [15]. Due to the potential loss in quality in the video
    between the

    source and the destination, the quality of video transmission in m-health applications
    must

    be maintained at high levels so that the change in quality remains imperceptible.
    Further,

    medical videos carry sensitive data that determine patient diagnosis, and at times
    a loss

    in quality may impact the diagnostic understanding that can be gleaned from the
    medical

    videos. Thus, it is crucial that the quality of video transmission from source
    to destination

    is maintained at high levels in m-health applications.

    2.3. QoE of Multimedia Communications in m-Health

    To ensure that the quality of video transmission is maintained, a quality assessment

    needs to be carried out at the destination. Quality assessment is a process that
    employs

    methods to measure the quality of the video received at the destination compared
    to that of

    the video at the original source. There are two approaches to quality assessment;
    one is

    measuring the Quality of Service (QoS), and the other is Quality of Experience
    (QoE) [16]. In

    networking and communication applications, the QoS is a method of assessing the
    service

    quality that the network provides [17]. It is a network-centric measure that measures

    the quality of the data transmission provided by the communication network. The
    QoS

    measurement includes metrics that measure the key performance indicators (KPIs)
    of

    a communication system. These KPIs include metrics such as the percentage of data

    transmitted, the amount of data lost during transmission, channel throughput,
    speed of

    data transfer, system fairness, etc. On the other hand, QoE is a user-centric
    evaluation

    approach that reï¬ects the degree of delight or annoyance of the user with the
    service

    used [18]. In the case of video transmission, the QoE of a user is the perception
    of the

    video quality by the end-user [19,20]. The QoE puts the focus of quality assessment
    on

    the userâs perspective and typically considers many factors surrounding the context
    of

    the application [21]. There are two broad categories of QoE evaluation: subjective
    and

    objective evaluations. Subjective evaluation methods are based on the Human Visual

    System (HVS), which largely depends on observation by human subjects. The subjective

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    6 of 43

    evaluation method uses an evaluation score known as the Mean Opinion Score (MOS),
    a

    mean score of the usersâ opinions about their perception of the videoâs quality.
    On the other

    hand, objective evaluation methods use mathematical models that act as quality
    metrics to

    measure the audio or video received quality, such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio
    (PSNR),

    Mean Square Error (MSE), etc. A list of subjective and objective QoE assessment
    metrics

    are listed in Tables 1 and 2, where more details and explanations about all these
    metrics can

    be found in [22,23]. Given that QoS primarily focuses on the technical elements,
    whereas

    QoE is centered around customer service and satisfaction, it is plausible to include
    QoS as

    an inherent component within the deï¬nition of QoE.

    The QoS achieved in networks is now being increasingly associated with the QoE
    of

    the application. Recently, achieving high QoE has become an important part of
    multimedia

    communications [24]. The important features that affect the QoS and QoE in medical
    video

    streaming applications from the perspective of healthcare professionals include
    bandwidth,

    packet delay, jitter and packet loss tolerance, quality of the image, frame rate
    of the video

    received, real-time streaming when required, the direction of ï¬ow (uplink/downlink),

    mobility, etc. [25]. Measuring QoE can be complex, as several factors need to
    be considered

    that inï¬uence the end userâs QoE. The authors in [26] term these factors as âInï¬uence

    Factorsâ (IF) and deï¬ne them as: âAny characteristic of a user, system, service,
    application,

    or context whose actual state or setting may have an inï¬uence on the Quality of
    Experience

    for the userâ. The m-QoE is the concept of traditional QoE seen from the perspective
    of

    healthcare applications. It is deï¬ned as the overall acceptability of m-health
    applications as

    perceived by end-users, where the end-users are the patients and healthcare profession-

    als [27]. The m-QoE perceived in m-health systems is generally inï¬uenced by the
    system,

    context, and human inï¬uence factors (IFs).

    2.4. The Role of 6G towards Multimedia Communications

    Smart healthcare must be able to monitor health, diagnose diseases, and treat
    patients

    remotely with services such as Hospital-to-Home (H2H) services, emergency services,

    ambulance services, Intelligent Wearable Devices (IWD), etc. These services send
    the

    patient data remotely over the internet and then analyze them at data centers.
    Healthcare

    networks must provide mobility, high capacity, low latency (1 ms), green communication

    for patient safety, and continuous connectivity availability with high reliability.
    For these

    requirements, the sixth generation of wireless communication (6G) is regarded
    as the ideal

    solution for hosting healthcare networks [28,29]. Figure 2 depicts the healthcare
    network

    architecture in 6G; this diagram depicts the networkâs key deployment tiers, including

    intelligent sensing, intelligent access, and intelligent cloud. This 6G architecture
    will enable

    many processes, such as security, ï¬exibility, and intelligent resource management.
    This

    ï¬gure displays the slicing architecture of 6G networks, where different network
    slices

    enable different applications. The devices in the sensing layer gather data and
    deliver it

    to the next level. At this level, the nodes, users and devices connect to the
    radio access

    networks technologies such as massive MIMO, small cells, and advanced modulation

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    8 of 43

    techniques are implemented. Lastly, in the cloud layer, intelligent resource allocation,

    network management and optimization are performed. These different layers provide

    ï¬exibility to the system on different levels, and a wide range of applications
    beneï¬t from

    the network. This ï¬gure envisions such a scenario, demonstrating all layers and
    their key

    technologies.

    Figure 2. The 6G healthcare network layers.

    The development of 6G communication technologies addresses some of the issues

    discussed in previous subsections, particularly in connectivity, data rates, network
    compat-

    ibility, and guaranteeing high levels of QoS and QoE for m-health applications
    [30â32]. A

    high data rate of at least 1 Tbps, extremely reliable, further-enhanced mobile
    broadband

    (FeMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC), long-distance and high
    mo-

    bility communications (LDHMC), ultra-massive machine-type communications (umMTC),

    and extremely low-power communications (ELPC) are all features of 6G technology.
    QoS

    also incorporates parameters such as mobile broad bandwidth and low latency (mBBLL),

    and massive low latency machine type (mLLMT), revolutionizing many applications.
    The

    6G technology must execute all desired characteristics to achieve good QoE. Thus,
    6G

    technology will be groundbreaking in many ï¬elds as providing high QoS and QoE
    will

    enable new applications such as telesurgery, holographic communications, augmented

    and virtual reality, ï¬ve-sense communications, and tactile internet. QoE will
    also play a

    vital role in intelligent transportation services and autonomous vehicles such
    as intelligent

    cars, drones, and ambulances [33]. One of the key goals of QoE in 6G is to allow
    service

    providers to assess the performance of their services and how speciï¬c service
    components

    contribute to that performance. From this viewpoint, we envision the research
    on the

    QoE of m-health multimedia to determine how various factors contribute to the
    QoE of

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    9 of 43

    the m-health application. Because of their nature, m-health applications differ
    from other

    applications. It is vital to determine how quality elements such as data, network,
    analytics,

    and so on affect the various stages of an m-health service and hence the service
    quality.

    3. Methodology and Findings

    hensive survey, and share the key ï¬ndings obtained from the literature review.
    This section

    also discusses the limitations of the conducted literature review.

    3.1. Methodology

    The methodology of conducting this literature review can be divided into four
    steps,

    as shown in Figure 3, and described as follows.

    Figure 3. Research methodology.

    â¢

    Step 1 Research Paper Extraction: A comprehensive search was conducted using

    academic databases, including IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, MDPI, Springer, and other

    relevant sources. The search aimed to identify publications related to 6G networks,

    3.3. Limitations

    In conducting this review, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the
    research

    methodology employed. By understanding these limitations, readers can gain a better

    understanding of the scope and external validity of the conclusions drawn. The
    aim of this

    paper was to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on QoE in 6G networks,

    particularly in the context of m-health applications.

    â¢

    Non-systematic Approach: Although efforts were made to collect papers from various

    sources, including IEEE Xplore, Elsevier, MDPI, Springer, and others, the lack
    of a

    formal systematic methodology might have resulted in potential omissions of relevant

    studies. As a result, the comprehensiveness and representativeness of the reviewed

    literature may be inï¬uenced.

    â¢

    Selection Biases: The selection of papers was based on the relevance of their
    content to

    the research topic. While efforts were made to include a diverse range of perspectives,

    it is possible that some papers were unintentionally excluded, introducing a potential

    selection bias. Moreover, the availability and accessibility of certain papers
    might have

    inï¬uenced their inclusion, leading to a bias in the representation of the literature.

    By acknowledging these limitations, we aim to provide readers with a transparent

    understanding of the potential biases and constraints associated with this narrative
    review.

    It is essential to recognize that while the conclusions drawn from this review
    are supported

    by the available literature, further research using systematic approaches and
    objective

    evaluations is warranted to provide more conclusive and refutable ï¬ndings.

    4. Overview: Quality of Experience and Cellular Generations

    This section provides an overview of the relationship between Quality of Experience

    (QoE) and cellular generations in m-health applications. It addresses the limitations
    of 5G,

    the evolutionary progress of m-health wireless systems and quality of experience,
    and the

    correlation between QoS and QoE.

    4.1. 5G Limitation for m-Health

    Mobile technologies ranging from the ï¬rst generation (1G) to the ï¬fth generation
    (5G)

    have already been developed and deployed as an enabler for supporting a diverse
    range of

    networks and applications, including IoT. Notably, due to inherent usage characteristics

    such as eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC services, the 5G technology has been demonstrated

    to provide different service opportunities to IoT ecosystems with high throughput,
    low

    latency, and energy-efï¬cient service provision [34]. However, 5G will be unable
    to fully ad-

    dress escalating technical demands such as autonomous, ultra-large-scale, highly
    dynamic,

    and fully intelligent services due to the unprecedented spread of smart devices
    and IoT

    networks. More importantly, as new IoT services and applications arise, such as
    remote

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    12 of 43

    robotic surgery and ï¬ying vehicles, further advances in current 5G systems are
    required to

    improve the quality of IoT service delivery and business [35]. The 6G wireless
    networks

    and the technological innovations that have accompanied them have recently gotten
    much

    attention from academia and industry and are expected to pave the way for the
    growth of

    the IoT and beyond [36,37]. Due to its superior features over previous network
    generations,

    such as ultra-low-latency communications, extremely high throughput, satellite-based

    services, massive and autonomous networks [38â40], 6G is expected to provide an
    entirely

    new level of service quality and improve the userâs experience in current IoT
    systems. In

    addition to enabling unprecedented capacity levels, 6G-based IoT networks will
    speed the

    development and implementation of IoT applications throughout the spectrum of
    data

    sensing, device connectivity, and wireless communication, among other areas. Figure
    5

    shows the evolution of cellular generations from 1G to 6G with their distinguishing
    fea-

    tures. This ï¬gure provides a synopsis of the evolution. It can be seen here how
    the last

    decade has brought a revolution in wireless communication by bringing applications
    such

    as multimedia, real-time communications, and high-deï¬nition video streaming. In
    the

    ï¬gure, we can see this evolution has resulted in various advanced services.

    Figure 5. Evolution of cellular communications: from 1G to 6G.

    Although the 5G network has signiï¬cantly improved the QoS over previous genera-

    tions, it would still be difï¬cult to fully meet the requirements of future m-health
    services [41],

    which are still in their infancy. The key performance indicators include parameters
    such as

    data rates, latency, network efï¬ciency, coverage extension, reliability, spectrum
    efï¬ciency,

    mobility and many more. The capabilities of 6G communication network as compared
    to its

    predecessor are shown in Figure 6, where the red indicates 5G and the blue as
    6G. The 5G

    networks will be unable to handle the massive amount of mobile trafï¬c generated
    by multi-

    media m-health applications due to higher screen resolution, machine-to-machine
    (M2M)

    communications, and mobile edge services. Because of the expansion of smartphones
    and

    tablets and the proliferation of mobile data services, the demand for mobile broadband

    (MBB) is increasing at a rapid pace. The services provided by 5G are insufï¬cient
    to meet

    the evolving needs of healthcare technology and emergency situations. In this
    regard, 6G is

    envisioned to bring new disruptive wireless technologies and sophisticated networking

    infrastructures that would enable the realization of many new m-health applications
    by

    holistically addressing such rigorous network demands compared to 5G [42]. With
    the

    emergence of advanced technologies (e.g., edge intelligence, terahertz (THz),
    and large-

    scale satellite constellations), 6G communication systems will help the healthcare
    sector

    grow toward a more efï¬cient, fully connected and intelligent system.

    Billions of people throughout the world now use mobile and wireless networks.
    There

    will be a bottleneck for m-health applications due to the inï¬ux of trafï¬c generated
    by all

    of these people being online simultaneously, which will put them at a competitive
    disad-

    vantage with other high bandwidth-demanding services. As a result, wireless technology

    innovation is critical to keep pace with the ever-increasing demands for spectrum
    efï¬ciency,

    energy consumption, mobility, ï¬awless coverage, and the wide range of QoS and
    QoE

    needs. The network resources must be coordinated end-to-end and cross-layer to
    meet the

    needs and expectations of individual users [43]. A 6G mobile network is anticipated
    to

    provide QoS, QoE, and quality of physical experience (QoPE), as well as reliability
    and

    security [35,44]. Due to rate-reliability-latency and sensitive m-health applications
    such

    as telepresence, telesurgery, etc., QoE is a critical performance metric for 6G.
    The 5G QoS

    measurements, including packet loss rate, end-to-end latency, and round-trip timings,
    are

    no longer effective for upcoming 6G wireless applications. QoE focuses on user
    pleasure,

    aesthetics, comprehension, and application manageability. As a result, in addition
    to QoS,

    the outcome of usage is a critical component in ensuring QoE. Network and service
    man-

    agement needs to be transformed by researching automation, cognitive operation,
    AI, and

    ML to increase QoE further. Quality is determined not only by network measurements
    in

    m-health multimedia applications, but also by other factors. Authors have focused
    on QoE

    in multimedia IoT apps in surveys such as [45â47], which is deï¬ned by how users
    utilize

    such applications. However, because 6G is still in its early stages, measuring
    performance

    metrics is susceptible to change at this time.

    Figure 6. Comparison of 6G and 5G capabilities.

    4.2. Evolution of m-Health Wireless Systems: 2G to 5G

    Over the years and with the evolution of wireless systems, numerous m-health services

    and applications have been successfully deployed worldwide, satisfying the vision
    of per-

    vasive connected healthcare. It is well-known that the evolution of wireless communication

    technologies has contributed signiï¬cantly to the progression of m-health systems,
    starting

    from 2G (GPRS) and 3G (UMTS, CDMA) through WiMAX to the existing 4G (LTE/LTE-A),

    current 5G and towards future 6G systems [27,48]. m-health services are beneï¬cial
    in

    areas with a shortage of medical health facilities, where hospitals are located
    far from large

    populations, or where medical care is costly. Satellite communication, cloud-based
    systems,

    and 4G and 5G cellular networks are all examples of innovative and advanced wireless

    and wired technologies used in m-health systems. Technology is altering traditional
    health-

    care services and saving lives by providing rapid diagnosis and alerting medical
    centers,

    such as advanced cellular technologies, smart small wearable gadgets that monitor
    and

    communicate data to patientsâ and medical assistantsâ smartphones [49,50].

    While security, dependability, latency, and physical size are all critical considerations

    for m-health systems, one of the most signiï¬cant barriers to the broad adoption
    of cellular

    networks in telemedical systems is a lack of bandwidth and performance [51]. The
    ï¬rst

    generation (1G) of analogue mobile phones aimed solely at voice communication.
    The

    2G Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMC) phones were designed primarily

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    14 of 43

    for digital voice transmission (GSM). General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is offered
    as

    a network overlay for GSM, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), and Time Division

    Multiple Access (TDMA) networks formed 2.5G. The initial GSM service only allowed

    for data rates up to 9.6 kbps per channel, and GPRS allowed approximately 14 kbps
    per

    channel. In theory, GPRS can combine up to eight channels, bringing the total
    bandwidth

    to 100 kbps. For the ï¬rst time, the primary objective of wireless phone service
    was data

    transmission rather than voice transmission. For end-users, the most crucial characteristic

    of GPRS was that it provided constant connectivity. Various services were made
    available

    over GPRS, including web browsing, the transfer of still photographs and video
    clips,

    document sharing, and remote collaborative working. These services contributed
    to the

    development of the worldâs ï¬rst usable medical systems, which were built on global

    accessibility. Enhanced Data for GSM Evolution (EDGE) was denoted by 2.75G. If
    the GPRS

    protocol was the ï¬rst step on the road to 3G, the EDGE protocol was the next step
    on the

    road. In theory, EDGE provided data rates of up to 384 kbps, while actual data
    speeds

    were lower. The ability of EDGE to operate on the current GSM spectrum was the
    main

    attraction of the technology.

    Increased data rate requirements and technological advancements necessitated the
    ad-

    vent of 3G technologies, with the primary air interface being wideband CDMA (WCDMA).

    This generation was named the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS).

    UMTS supported data transfer rates of up to 2 Mbps indoors (a low-mobility scenario),

    384 kbps outdoors (at the speed of slow-moving pedestrians), and 144 kbps for
    fast-moving

    mobile phones. The overall goal of UMTS was to provide seamless functioning through
    the

    employment of pico- and microcells indoors and in urban areas, macrocells outside
    and in

    rural regions, and, when necessary, satellite networks. When the 3G systems were
    being

    deï¬ned in their infancy, video telephony was envisioned as a breakthrough application.

    The 3G systems have been demonstrated to efï¬ciently support the amount of data
    necessary

    for medical applications [52]. The emergence of 3G wireless systems provided an
    initial

    platform for transmitting medical images and videos. The requirements after 3G
    started

    increasing rapidly as new systems required more bandwidth, steady performance,
    and a

    high QoS.

    The introduction of 4G technology was a turning point for m-health applications

    as it overcame the limitations of previous wireless communications generations.
    The

    amalgamation of 4G technology with healthcare brought in the concept of 4G health,

    which can be deï¬ned as m-health using personalized medical systems with adaptable

    functionalities and compatibility with future 4G network technologies. In the
    4G systems,

    the High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) protocol supported data rates of
    up to

    14.4 Mbps with a latency of around 100 ms. The 5G mobile communication technologies
    and

    their related IoT-connected ecosystem served as a catalyst for the development
    of m-health

    applications. Mobile health apps beneï¬ted from the unparalleled speed, capacity,
    and low

    latency levels provided by these technologies. Data rates of up to 10 Gbps are
    possible,

    representing a 10- to 100-fold boost over the 4G networks with one millisecond
    or less

    latency, more than 100 times the number of connected devices per square meter
    compared

    to its predecessor. Network coverage levels exceed 100 percent while maintaining
    a fairly

    constant network availability [12].

    4.3. Evolution of Quality of Experience: 2G to 5G

    QoS has traditionally been used to evaluate a systemâs overall performance in
    terms of

    its service to its users. The intent of the QoS was not to capture the subjective
    perception of

    quality or level of pleasure held by the user. The International Telecommunication
    Union

    (ITU) ï¬rst proposed the concept of QoS as experienced by the user in 2008 [53],
    stating that

    it is âinï¬uenced by the delivered QoS and psychological factors inï¬uencing the
    perception

    of the userâ. As a result of the signiï¬cant advances in information and communications

    technology, the term Quality of Experience (QoE) was coined at a later stage.
    According

    to [53], QoE is the total acceptability of an application or service as assessed
    subjectively

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    15 of 43

    by the end-user. As a result, the user-centric idea of QoE complements the notion
    of

    network-centric QoS. The primary goal of the QoE program is to assess customer
    percep-

    tions of quality and collect feedback to support the optimization of various technological

    aspects [33]. Voice as the primary service in the ï¬rst two wireless generations,
    measur-

    ing user impressions relied on mean opinion score (MOS)âa subjective measure widely

    employed in traditional phone networks. GSM enabled a signiï¬cant increase in mobile

    data rates leading to the GPRS and the EDGE that enabled the ï¬rst widespread adoption

    of Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS). It enabled multimedia service applications
    to

    prosper and provided increased speed, bandwidth, security, and mobility management

    while improving radio resource utilization [54]. UMTS deï¬ned the QoS requirements
    for

    multimedia wireless data servicesand necessitated the development of a new architecture

    capable of reducing the latency (100 ms) using end-to-end IP data communication.
    Ad-

    ditionally, 4G and LTE-A enabled improved mobile multimedia functions and increased

    user equipment ï¬exibility. The LTE-A enabled the efï¬cient sharing of multimedia
    resources

    across the eNodeB, the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), and the Content Provider via
    the Multi-

    media Broadcast Multicast Services (eMBMS) pioneered a new business model based
    on

    the LTE radio architecture. Additionally, by implementing the Mobility Management
    Entity

    (MME) on activated eMBMS on 4G networks, LTE-Broadcasting (LTE-B) was enabled,
    con-

    clusively enabling the simultaneous distribution of multimedia resources to several
    users

    at the same time, thereby enhancing QoS. The MBMS Signal Frequency Network (MBSFM)

    converts multimedia content sent from several eNodeBs to a multipath signal to
    increase

    the gain of the original content that is being multicast or broadcast. The eMBMS
    bearer

    contributes immensely to video compression methods and new multimedia technologies.

    eMBMS leverages MIMO technology to provide consumers with Multicast/Broadcast

    media content that supports a high level of QoE, such as High-Deï¬nition Video
    streaming.

    The 5G NR introduced new functionalities to improve QoE by merging the concepts

    of Network Slicing, Edge Computing, and the 5G QoS Flow. With the introduction
    of

    new features such as improved Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency

    Communications (URLLC), and massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC), new

    opportunities for service applications have opened up. Numerous m-health multimedia

    apps were made possible by these components. When considered in light of the ongoing

    discussions on 6G networks, QoE considerations take on new dimensions that have
    not

    been considered previously, particularly in light of the projected enhancement
    of the user

    context through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), in addition to
    tactile

    experiences. It becomes vital, as a result, to streamline the QoE investigation
    toward

    relevant and usable procedures.

    4.4. The Correlation between QoS and QoE in m-Health Applications

    In medical video streaming, especially for real-time diagnosis, it is crucial
    to have

    a highly reliable network that is predictable and performs as required, even in
    varying

    conditions. Furthermore, the wireless network should be able to support real-time
    trafï¬c

    management for the medical video streaming application. Trafï¬c management is important

    because real-time trafï¬c tends to be bursty in nature, and this may often lead
    to packet

    losses, which in turn implies the loss of information; hence, the video packet
    streams need

    to be well-managed. The loss of packets is not acceptable for medical applications
    because

    it may hinder the accurate reconstruction of the received videos, which may further
    affect

    the diagnosis process. Therefore, a medical video streaming platform must be able
    to

    support a maximum, average, and minimum set of trafï¬c parameters.

    The m-QoS aspects related to m-health applications have been investigated extensively

    in the literature. However, the m-QoE aspects are not yet well-explored. A challenge
    in

    m-QoE is that users generally have higher expectations in terms of quality received
    as

    the service is related to their health, and they are vulnerable to losing trust
    in the service

    provided by the m-health system. Therefore, in order to achieve high acceptability
    of

    m-health applications, the m-QoE aspects need to be determined and incorporated
    into the

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    16 of 43

    design. To determine the context of the m-health application, it is important
    to identify and

    analyze the clinical-related requirements and the inï¬uencing factors such as application

    area, application purpose, content type, and context of use.

    6G Technology promises to deliver high QoS [36,38], enabling a plethora of new

    applications making 6G technology a game-changer in numerous ï¬elds. Additionally,
    6G

    technology promises high QoE, which deï¬nes user-centric communications. m-health

    multimedia communications refer to clear and detailed signals, which can be audio,
    video,

    bio-signals, text, graphics, still images, interactive data, and so on. The optimization
    of the

    QoE during medical media transmission is one of the most signiï¬cant concepts to
    consider

    from the perspective of the end-users perception [55].

    Many studies have focused on determining the relationship between QoS parameters

    and QoE; few instances claim that QoS is the most critical factor in determining
    a userâs

    perceived quality [56]. Correlation models must be established to evaluate the
    relationship

    between QoS parameters and their individual and mutual effects on QoE [22,57].
    The

    correlation models proposed in the literature can be divided into general and
    speciï¬c

    models [58]. The prior one is shown in Figure 7. This ï¬gure talks about the general

    model of correlation between QoE and QoS. It considers QoS as a component in a
    series of

    QoE-determining variables and shows that QoE cannot be separated from QoS metrics
    as

    the networkâs state inï¬uences the user experience. Figure 7 shows where QoS is
    speciï¬c

    to the transmission, while QoE includes transmission as well as involves the end-userâs

    engagement. The ï¬gure illustrates prospective application scenarios of m-health,
    such as

    intelligent ambulance services, remote patient monitoring, telemedicine, etc.

    Figure 7. QoS and QoE in m-health applications.

    Alternatively, speciï¬c models investigate the impact of QoS parameters on QoE.

    QoS/QoE mapping calculates QoE values based on a set of measurable network KPIs
    from

    the QoS objective criteria, referring to the degree of service adequacy. Using
    appropriate

    mathematical models, QoE can be obtained from these measurements. Subjective user-

    centric aspects, which cannot be measured directly from the network but may impact
    the

    end-entire userâs experience, are included in the QoE inï¬uencing factors [59].
    Understand-

    ing the relationship between network-based QoS parameters and end-user-perceived
    QoE

    is crucial in the QoE management process [60].

    QoE cannot be separated from QoS metrics as the networkâs state inï¬uences the
    user

    experience [9]. However, the tendency to view the network as the primary element
    in

    determining QoE should be addressed. Research has been conducted on ï¬nding QoS

    parameters affecting QoE in telecommunication systems [61,62]; for example, the
    authors

    in [63] show how QoE has a logarithmic relationship with the throughput in transmission.

    Studies such as [64] improve the modeling of QoEâQoS interactions, but QoE consideration

    is still limited to what can be measured and managed through the network. The
    researchers

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    17 of 43

    in [65] classify multimedia as a key performance indicator for QoE and QoS analysis.
    A

    reliable and efï¬cient technique for analyzing QoE is designed to determine the
    trade-off

    between user perception and QoS entities [66]. Additionally, they addressed the
    fact

    that standard network performance metrics such as delay, jitter, and throughput
    do not

    accurately reï¬ect the complete user perception level. However, by combining QoE
    and

    QoS parameters, the desired result can be attained. Similarly, researchers in
    [67] provide

    a mechanism for energy conservation and QoS evaluation in healthcare and traditional

    wireless networks.

    Overall, 6G is planned to enable a wide range of m-health applications, making
    it more

    challenging to handle the unique QoS requirements of different apps while also
    ensuring

    the QoE of different users. The ability to derive complicated quantitative correlations

    between QoS parameters and KPIs is crucial for controlling QoS. In order to do
    this,

    Ref. [68] suggested a delay estimation approach based on neural networks. The
    input to the

    supervised learning technique is the trafï¬c load and the routing strategy, while
    the output

    of the supervised learning approach is the network delay. According to the ï¬ndings
    of the

    experiments, the NN-based estimator outperforms the standard M/M/1 model in terms
    of

    estimation accuracy by a signiï¬cant margin. Similar to this, Ref. [69] attempted
    to uncover

    the mapping relationships between QoS parameters and KPIs through a decision tree.
    The

    linear regression technique M5Rules is used to determine the quantitative inï¬uence
    of

    KPIs on QoS. Obtaining the QoE values takes a signiï¬cant amount of time, and as
    a result,

    understanding how various QoS parameters affect the QoE values is particularly
    crucial

    when computing QoE values quickly. The goal of [70] is to measure the QoE of a
    video

    streaming service using a supervised learning approach. Network metrics such as
    RTT,

    jitter, bandwidth, and delay are utilized as input to train the NN model, while
    the QoE is

    employed as an output. The SDN controller can adjust network parameters to increase

    QoE; on the other hand, Abar et al. [71] attempted to estimate QoE values from
    video

    quality characteristics. Four machine learning algorithms are investigated: the
    decision

    tree, the neural network, the K-NN, and the random forest. By applying MLP, Pierucci

    et al. [72] studied the relationship between user throughput and QoS factors to
    forecast

    usersâ QoE based on user throughput, the number of active users, and channel quality

    indicators, among other things. The simulation results reveal a high degree of
    accuracy

    in making predictions. As new applications, such as XR in 6G, have emerged, new
    QoE

    and QoS evaluation metrics are introduced. Existing research reveals that deep
    learning is

    promising in learning the complex relationships between them, allowing for more
    efï¬cient

    QoE insurance and resource utilization.

    According to the authors in [73], QoE is a broader concept that incorporates QoS

    metrics and user-related elements such as their behavioral, cognitive, and psychological

    states and the context in which these products and services are offered. These
    elements

    inï¬uence the overall QoE when using a particular application or service. Mobile
    computing

    environments are characterized by dynamic user behavior, as users interact with
    appli-

    cations or services in various situations. Consequently, when measuring and predicting

    QoE, it is critical to take into account metrics relating to users, their device(s),
    and the

    surrounding environment, as well as network QoS. User moods, screen size, social
    context,

    activities, and packet loss, are just a few examples of the types of information
    that can be

    collected and stored.

    5. 6G Features Significantly Enhancing the QoE of m-Health Multi-Media Applications

    As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, internet video streaming has already taken

    over a major portion of our daily lives through various applications such as webinars

    and video conferencing. However, issues such as video startup failures, pixilation,
    delays,

    or other sorts of image or audio quality degradation were commonly seen during
    the

    quarantine period in all parts of the world. All of these degradations are unacceptable

    in the context of m-health services. The need to deal with the explosion of multimedia

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    18 of 43

    services has been considered in the 6G network, which will provide greater QoS
    while also

    guaranteeing QoE.

    In this section, we provide greater discussions about 6G features which speciï¬cally

    discusses the following: the provision of enhanced video streaming using small
    cells

    solutions, the ï¬exibility of 6G high frequencies, the phenomena of the 3CLS services,

    the enhanced multimedia transmission services, the provision of network slicing
    and

    artiï¬cial intelligence, enhanced security and blockchain, reconï¬gurable intelligent
    surfaces,

    extended radio, and ï¬nally the massive ultra-reliable and low-latency communications.

    5.1. How Small/Tiny Cells Can Enhance the Video Streaming

    The deployment of small cells in an m-health wireless infrastructure would mean
    that

    patients and healthcare professionals on handheld devices would experience high
    QoS

    and QoE down at the street level, where it really matters. The expansion of video
    trafï¬c

    has increased the strain on spectral efï¬ciency, energy consumption, mobility,
    seamless

    coverage, and the various requirements for QoS and QoE. Medical multimedia applications

    will coexist and compete with conventional video trafï¬c to deliver healthcare
    services

    across mobile networks in a shared environment. To address the aforementioned
    issues, the

    adoption of tiny cell (e.g., small cell) technology as a communication platform
    for strong

    m-health systems is recommended.

    Small cells (e.g., femtocells) are low-power base stations (BSs) speciï¬cally designed
    for

    coverage enhancement in an indoor dense environment where there is limited macrocell

    network coverage. They are characterized by the low transmission power, high capacity,

    low cost and easily deployable features with a coverage range of some tens of
    meters. They

    can be readily installed by the users in a plug-and-play manner, with an option
    of restricting

    access to only a certain group of users present at home or in an ofï¬ce environment
    (i.e.,

    closed access). They perform the entire operational task in a completely autonomic
    and self-

    organized manner, including device conï¬guration, troubleshooting, and optimization
    [74].

    Due to the limited number of users permitted access to the small cell BS, each
    user can

    achieve high data rates. The demand for improved data rates along with spectral
    and

    energy efï¬ciency at any time in 6G motivates the exploration of frequencies above
    sub-6

    GHz. As 6G evolves, it will become essential to use frequencies beyond mmWave,
    in the

    terahertz (THz) range (i.e., referring to electromagnetic waves with frequencies
    between

    100 GHz and 10 THz) [75]. To take advantage of higher mmWave and THz frequencies,
    the

    6G cell size must be reduced from small to âtiny cellâ with a radius of only a
    few tens of

    meters. Small cells (e.g., femtocells and picocells) have a different radio range,
    and network

    characteristics, which enables them to transmit at a higher rate while reducing
    trafï¬c on

    macrocells [76].

    5.2. 6G Supports Higher Frequencies

    As discussed previously, 6G enables higher frequencies, which is advantageous
    for

    multimedia applications requiring high data rates. It also provides spectral and
    energy

    efï¬ciency, high mobility, and seamless coverage. Additionally, 6G will require
    the con-

    tinuance of Massive-MIMO technologies to offer high data rates efï¬ciently; frequencies

    above the radio spectrum (i.e., Terahertz) are strong candidates for use with
    Massive

    MIMO [35,54]. THz communications are envisioned as the driving technology for
    6G-IoT,

    demanding data rates of 100+ Gbps and latency of less than one millisecond. Receiving

    high data rates to the order of Gbps would let healthcare professionals view high-resolution

    medical images and videos in Ultra-High-Deï¬nition format. The THz band (0.1â10
    THz)

    appears to be a good candidate for future m-health needs, including picosecond-level

    symbol duration, integration of thousands of submillimeter-long antennas, and
    low in-

    terference without requiring complete legacy regulation [77]. Some beneï¬ts of
    the THz

    spectrum for 6G-enabled m-health systems include addressing spectrum scarcity
    issues in

    wireless communications, allowing ultra-high bandwidth and throughput, and enabling

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    19 of 43

    ultra-broadband applications such as virtual reality and Wireless Personal Area
    Networks

    (WPAN) to be implemented [78].

    In m-health wireless systems, the scalability of multiple medical sensors/devices

    and seamless connectivity are requirements that future 6G technology is anticipated
    to

    support. Body wearables and implants involve multiple biomedical/nano sensors
    and

    actuators that take physiological readings from the human body for m-health remote

    monitoring applications. 6G THz frequency bands can accomplish Internet of Nano-

    Things (IoNT) communication [68], where densely deployed nano-things continuously

    generate valuable data and forward it to data centers over a high-speed 6G communication

    network [79]. Similarly, the Tbps data rate needs for AR/VR services can be supported
    via

    THz transmission and Tiny cells [80]. Given the signiï¬cant free-space path loss
    associated

    with THz signals, including spreading and molecule absorption loss [81], the THz
    bands

    are better suited for short-range wireless communications, such as wireless backhaul
    for

    tiny cells. THz communication will evolve steadily over the next few years and
    will be

    critical in the 6G sector, with numerous promising technologies [82].

    5.3. 3CLS Services

    Overall, 6G will signiï¬cantly expand the wireless network depth from single infor-

    mation transmission to information transmission, storage, and processing, which
    helps in

    maximizing network utility and providing exceptional QoE for various services
    and appli-

    cations. As a result, sophisticated wireless sensing, communication, processing,
    caching,

    and control must all work together. With this convergence, the networks can make
    optimal

    decisions related to sensing and computing tasks [45]. In the previous ï¬ve generations
    of

    cellular systems, only the feature of wireless communication was available, but
    6G will

    provide a variety of services through the convergence of Communication, Computing,

    Control, Localization, and Sensing (3CLS) [35]. As a multi-purpose system, 6G
    has the

    potential to provide many 3CLS services, which are particularly interesting and
    even critical

    for applications such as extended reality (XR) services (encompassing augmented,
    mixed,

    and virtual reality (AR/MR/VR)), Connected Robotics and Autonomous Systems (CRAS),

    and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) that require tracking and control, as
    well as

    localization, computation, and other features.

    Using the same time-frequency-spatial resources, communication, location, and
    sens-

    ing services are all expected to coexist in 6G networks [83]. This coexistence
    will signiï¬-

    cantly improve spectrum efï¬ciency while also avoiding present regulatory obstacles.
    The

    cooperation between these services has signiï¬cant mutual beneï¬ts [84], e.g., location
    and

    context-aware communication. This context awareness will also assist m-health
    applica-

    tions in 6G networks by allowing multi-modal communication and service quality
    based on

    the present location or context. For example, based on the application needs,
    one can select

    a subset of terrestrial, aerial, and space elements using accurate context awareness
    [85].

    Applications such as Human-Centric Services (HCS) are predicted to rely on 3CLS
    services

    to provide effective communication and real-time processing of a huge number of
    data

    streams collected by sensors centered on humans [86]. Existing 5G technologies
    have not

    thoroughly investigated the interdependence between 3CLS in an end-to-end manner;
    thus,

    the development of 3CLS services is an essential driving trend toward the next
    generation

    of mobile communication networks [87]. Future mobile communication networks will

    need collective network intelligence at the networkâs edge to run AI and ML algorithms
    in

    real-time to provide 3CLS services [35]. In order to support AI-managed end-to-end
    3CLS

    design services, the network architecture should also be open, scalable, and elastic
    [35,88].

    5.4. Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services

    Current cellular IoT systems monitor service announcements even when ï¬rmware and

    software changes are infrequent. The 6G IoT devices would no longer need to watch
    service

    announcements but instead be paged to obtain multicast data resulting in a reduction
    in

    energy consumption [89]. The Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (eMBMS)

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    20 of 43

    bearer is a valuable addition to video compression protocols and new technologies
    devoted

    to video applications. It uses MIMO technology to deliver Multicast/Broadcast
    media

    material to users while maintaining a high level of QoE, for example, high-deï¬nition
    video

    streaming [54].

    Mobile cellular networks offer great potential to support vehicular services due
    to their

    high network capacity and widespread coverage, but still some challenges persist.
    Vehicular

    data should be routed through the base station (BS) ï¬rst, as centralized cellular
    networks

    have limited applicability for vehicle-to-vehicle communications [90]. In unicast
    mode, a

    vehicle transmits emergency information to a cellular BS, then unicasts it to
    the appropriate

    vehicles; this limits the downlink channel. MBMS and eMBMS are viable methods
    for

    disseminating emergency information [11]; eMBMS is typically used in conjunction
    with

    a single-frequency network, where multiple BSs broadcast simultaneously over the
    same

    channel [12]. Multiple vehicles can acquire emergency information concurrently
    utilizing

    the same frequency band. When multimedia content is sent from separate eNodeBs,
    the

    MBMS Signal Frequency Network (MBSFM) converts it into a multipath signal, which
    can

    then be used to improve the gain of the original content, that is multicast or
    disseminated.

    5.5. Network Slicing

    User demands for high-quality services have prompted telecom operators to invest
    in

    new cutting-edge network softwarization paradigms such as Software Deï¬ned Networking

    (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC),

    and Cloud/Fog Computing (C/FoC). Pressure from new emergent use cases such as

    ultra-high quality video (4K/8K), network-controlled D2D communications, Machine

    Type Communication (MTC), and Massive Internet of Things (MIOT) is also driving
    this

    transformation and system upgrading. The future networks will be cloudiï¬ed via
    SDN

    and NFV, enabling Internet Service Providers to customize services and provide
    QoE that

    matches consumer needs through sophisticated QoE control and management [45].

    Virtualization is a technology that provides virtual representations of things
    such

    as virtual computers, servers, memory, network services, etc. The NFV allows network

    functions to be separated from proprietary hardware appliances and run in software
    on

    standardized hardware. SDN adds intelligence and ï¬exibility to programmable networks,

    allowing ï¬ner-grained network-wide orchestration and management of operating appli-

    cations and services [91]. SDNs can have their QoE control and management planes

    built as software that runs on commodity hardware devices [45]. SDN and NFV aim

    to establish a future software-based networking solution that enables end-users
    to have

    ï¬exible and automated network connectivity and QoE provisioning. The use of AI
    in

    conjunction with SDN/NFV/NS allows for dynamic and zero-touch network orchestration,

    optimization, and management, accelerating the transition from 5G to autonomous
    6G

    networks. AI-assisted network optimization can track real-time network KPIs and
    make

    rapid adjustments to network parameters to maintain high QoE.

    Different strategies for QoE-centered management of multimedia streaming services

    are applied using SDN/NFV technologies. Maximum QoE for end-users is achieved

    through the best path calculations for each service ï¬ow. The video is broadcast
    through

    low-latency, high-throughput networks, which improves the attained video quality
    [92].

    The computation of optimal bitrates for clients to achieve QoE-fairness in the
    delivered

    video is performed by assigning different priorities to a video stream depending
    on the

    requested quality [93,94]. Allocation of network resources cost-effectively ensures
    that the

    highest possible level of user QoE fairness is attained. The underlying concept
    is to prevent

    quality instability, unfair bandwidth sharing, and network resource underutilization
    among

    DASH competing clients who share the same bottleneck network link to maximize
    network

    usage [95,96]. Coordination of actions and cooperative cooperation between layers
    are

    required to optimize network resources and improve the end-userâs QoE. Using SDN

    controllers, the QoE requirements can be set at the application layer and regulated
    at the

    network layer in such a conï¬guration [97]. In SDN-based networks, it is necessary
    to

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    21 of 43

    support effective multipath routing and accelerate the transmission of huge amounts
    of

    multimedia applications between end points while maintaining the QoE of end-users.
    The

    MultiPath TCP (MPTCP) enables load balancing, reliable communication, and improved

    network resource usage, which results in increased network throughput and improved

    QoE for end-users [98].

    5.6. Artiï¬cial Intelligence

    QoE models based on Machine Learning (ML) and Artiï¬cial Intelligence (AI) that

    consider video features can be extremely useful for m-health multimedia applications.

    AI-assisted network optimization can track real-time network KPIs and make rapid
    ad-

    justments to network parameters to maintain high QoE [36]. âPervasive intelligenceâ
    is

    proposed as one of the 6G networkâs ultimate goals, which aids in the formation
    of an

    auto-generating and auto-conï¬guration network paradigm [99]. The network is designed

    to conï¬gure processing algorithms, signaling autonomously, and protocol processes
    for

    future new use cases and more complex requirements, potentially reducing standardization

    efforts and costs in implementing new network infrastructures.

    AI-enabled RAN design is proposed in [100] to minimize the cost of standardization

    while maximizing the potential gain of AI-enabled network optimization. One AI
    scheduler

    controls all tasks of the RAN, including RRC, RRM, protocol function elements
    (PFEs)

    setting, and MAC layer scheduling. Deep learning, reinforcement learning, Q-learning,

    and other AI approaches can be used to learn the characteristics of the services
    [101]. The

    scheduler might be more efï¬cient and intelligent based on the prospective prediction
    of

    channels, data trafï¬c, QoS/QoE indicators, and so on at either the AI controller
    or AI

    scheduler. The non-real-time AI processing is handled by the RAN AI controller,
    which

    has logical interfaces with the CN, network operations, administration, and maintenance

    (OAM) platform, and BS. The AI controller may forecast user mobility, trafï¬c behavior,

    network loading ï¬uctuation, and other factors using big data analytics [102],
    which is

    then supplied to the BS to assist the AI scheduler with RRC, RRM, PFE orchestration,
    and

    real-time MAC scheduling.

    The AI controller and scheduler could use deep learning approaches based on his-

    torical and new data to ï¬gure out customized RRC and RRM functions set for a certain

    UE in a speciï¬c circumstance. Instead of regular dynamic scheduling, the network
    can

    allocate a reserved semi-static resource, such as semi-persistent scheduling (SPS)
    and con-

    ï¬gurable grant (CG) conï¬guration(s), to a device based on its trafï¬c pattern acquired
    from

    application-layer data. A serviceâs unique requirements for dependability and
    survival

    time might also be supplied, which would aid the scheduler in determining whether
    to use

    a duplication mechanism or repeat transmission for devices.

    5.7. Enhanced Security and Blockchain

    Achieving a high level of security and privacy in 6G-based IoT networks is a real

    challenge since 6G systems are distributed and, as a result, face higher risks
    of cyberattacks

    and threats. Additionally, maintaining data privacy in multilayer 6G open-sharing
    systems

    such as vehicular data sharing in automated vehicles is a crucial issue. In terms
    of security

    attacks, signals used for dedicated short-range communication in autonomous ambulances

    can be altered or controlled to jam the radar or cause collisions with other vehicles.
    Aside

    from that, smart wristbands are worn by restricted patients to monitor and track
    their

    movements around the hospital facility. However, the communication signals transmitted

    by wristbands are susceptible to jamming and spooï¬ng attempts. Overall, 6G will
    bring

    a new solution to the security paradigm, redeï¬ning it entirely. Blockchain [103],
    as an

    emerging disruptive technology, can provide novel solutions to such privacy and
    security

    concerns in 6G-IoT networks. The blockchain, in theory, is a decentralized, immutable,
    and

    transparent database in which no authority is required to administer the data.
    It is made

    possible by a peer-to-peer network structure, which gives each entity, such as
    an IoT device,

    an equal right to control and authorize the data recorded in the blockchain.

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    22 of 43

    Due to the sensitive nature of healthcare data, blockchain adoption is required
    to

    ensure utilitarianism and other normative issues of rights and duties [104]. There
    are

    signiï¬cant ethical concerns as this sector deals with individually identiï¬able
    and conï¬-

    dential health-related data. The veriï¬cation of health data in 6G-based healthcare
    systems

    can be accomplished using blockchain and its inherent smart contract technology
    [105],

    eliminating the need for a third party while maintaining a high conï¬dence level.
    The

    operational reach of blockchain-enabled systems may span multiple jurisdictions
    with

    varying medical and cyber-security requirements. So, if any blockchain-enabled
    healthcare

    application is to be applied across national or regional borders and provided
    via a high-

    speed network, standardization, transparency, and accountability are required
    [104,106].

    Apart from blockchain, federated AI, quantum machine learning, quantum computing,

    and THz communication will be used to ï¬ght against cyberattacks in 6G [107,108].
    THz

    communication is impenetrable to eavesdropping and jamming.

    Spectrum sharing is an expensive feature in 6G or lower cellular networks because

    large quantities of money are paid to spectrum regulators. The operator purchases
    bands

    and sub-bands and then uses or leases to other operators. Blockchain technology
    can be uti-

    lized for license shared access (LSA), and cognitive radio networks (CRN) can
    be used with

    blockchain to create a distributed MAC protocol for secondary network users [109].
    Further-

    more, spectrum sharing based on blockchain would enable network resource virtualization.

    The federal communications commission (FCC) has stated that because blockchain
    is an

    important component of 6G stacking applications, a blockchain-based spectrum-sharing

    service can be implemented in the 6G protocol stack [110].

    5.8. Reconï¬gurable Intelligent Surfaces

    Overall, 6G will enable a plethora of new possibilities and state-of-the-art applications

    requiring minimal latency and high-quality video and huge image data transmission.

    Reconï¬gurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and orbital angular momentum communication

    could serve as core technologies for the 6G radio interface, providing a solution
    to many

    physical layer constraints [9]. This new paradigm of programmable and software-deï¬ned

    metasurfaces will offer previously unimaginable technical solutions for unobtrusive
    and

    noninvasive sensing, which has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry
    [111].

    Recently, RISs have garnered signiï¬cant research attention for applications, including
    6G

    technology [112]. The RIS comprises arrays of passive scattering devices with
    artiï¬cial

    planar structures. Each element is enabled to reï¬ect the impinging electromagnetic
    wave in

    a software-deï¬ned manner using electronic circuits [113]. Due to their reconï¬gurability,

    RISs are a possible solution for assisting in the design and optimization of wireless
    systems

    by facilitating signal propagation, channel modeling, and acquisition, hence enabling
    smart

    radio environments advantageous for 6G-based applications.

    This integration of RIS enabled-Intelligent Walls (IW) will play a critical role
    in the

    development of the 6G communication ecosystem. Diverse factors necessitate seamless

    coverage and connectivity in healthcare settings. The hospitalâs complicated physical

    structure and sensitive equipment restrict network coverage. Currently, the hospital
    uses

    Wi-Fi networks for communication, but electromagnetic interference limits coverage
    in

    sensitive places [114]. In order to improve coverage and safeguard RF-prohibited
    areas,

    RIS can be installed on walls, ceilings, etc., in hospitals [115].

    Interconnected medical equipment and applications capture data and send it to
    health-

    care IT systems. Wearable healthcare devices must be charged periodically to stay
    active

    and transmit patient data to monitoring systems. The IW will be an indoor primary
    surface

    used to charge wearable gadgets wirelessly [116]. The IWâs sensor circuit would
    listen for

    the wearable deviceâs beacon signal and direct the ambient RF energy toward it
    when a

    battery threshold was met. Nevertheless, most wearable gadgets use backscatter
    communi-

    cation, which requires a separate transmitter nearby. Wearable devices cannot
    transfer data

    over extended distances due to power limits and limited data rate transmission.
    Thus, in

    IoMT applications, IW can be employed for both charging and rapid data transfer.
    Noninva-

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    23 of 43

    sive patient sensing is another case in healthcare [116,117]. The RF signals could
    be utilized

    as an illuminator of opportunity, combining an ambient signal from a BS with echoes
    from

    test subjects to collect information on their movements [118]. Using ambient signals,
    it

    can obtain high-resolution full-scene images and accurately detect human body
    postures

    and vital signs [116,119]. The AI-enabled controller attached to the IWs can process
    the

    data. A patient with heart attack symptoms or an elderly patient who falls over
    would

    order a secondary IW to redirect the ambient mm-wave signal to the specialized
    emergency

    response radio link. RIS can also provide great beneï¬ts for services such as localization

    and mapping [120].

    5.9. Extended Radio (XR)

    Overall, 6G will be supported by Extended Radio (XR) by having satellite communi-

    cation in conjunction with the terrestrial connection. The 6G technologyâs primary
    needs

    are a 1 THz operating frequency, and a 1 Tbps data throughput [108]. Existing
    5G tech-

    nology is primarily focused on metropolitan areas, with less emphasis on developing

    and rural areas. Thus, a broad swath of the population area is covered with deep
    indoor

    penetration, ensuring adequate equity for rural areas. Overall, 6G will provide
    an inter-

    connected communication network ranging from the ground and sky to the underwater

    environment and satellite communication to achieve global connectivity. Unlike
    todayâs

    IoT deployment, primarily based on terrestrial infrastructure, 6G communication
    utilizes

    diverse low and high-altitude platforms, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites,
    to

    form an aerial network framework that supports ultra-massive IoT connections via
    reliable

    wireless links. The aerial network is also supported by UAVs and balloons that
    act as

    ï¬ying BSs, providing coverage and connectivity for disaster-affected areas and
    supporting

    public safety networks and emergency scenarios requiring URLLC [121]. UAVs integrate

    with terrestrial BSs to provide direct air-ground links for collaborative sensing
    and data

    transmission in 6G-IoT contexts. Because of their quick response time, remote
    operating

    capability, and controllable agility, UAVs are well suited for emergencies, such
    as anti-terror

    battleï¬elds or catastrophe areas following earthquakes and ï¬oods [122]. When terrestrial

    infrastructure is rendered inoperable, UAVs can be launched to quickly restore
    wireless

    network coverage and communicate with the outside world [123].

    5.10. Massive Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications

    Remote health monitoring and other healthcare domains require low-latency com-

    munications (below 1 ms) with a reliability requirement of greater than 99.99%
    to achieve

    nearly real-time health provision and fast and reliable remote diagnosis. URLLC
    is pre-

    dicted to be achieved in the 6G era, which will allow for the support of future
    IoT services

    through low-latency and dependable communication [78]. For example, the mURLLC
    is ex-

    pected to support the timely and highly reliable delivery of massive health data
    to facilitate

    remote healthcare, with the goal of providing better medical services to patients
    in remote

    areas while also reducing regional imbalances in the health workforce. Smart factories

    can use mURLLC to automate mission-critical activities such as automatic production
    and

    remote robotic control. Its outstanding characteristics make mURLLC well-suited
    for sup-

    porting transportation systems by enabling high-reliability and timely data sharing
    among

    vehicles, infrastructure, and pedestrians. This contributes to improved smart
    ambulance

    systems and high efï¬ciency in vehicular networks. Because of this, mURLLC can
    provide

    an extensive range of mission-critical services, including fast fault diagnosis
    and accurate

    location, dependable fault isolation, system restoration, and remote decoupling
    protections.

    This section is summarized in Table 4, and an illustration of these technologies
    can be

    seen in Figure 8. The ï¬gure block lists the enabling technologies that will drive
    the evolution

    of 6G systems and play a signiï¬cant role in enhancing m-healthâs QoE as discussed
    in this

    section. The 6G will integrate the physical, biological and digital world together,
    as shown

    in this ï¬gureâs pictorial representation.

    Tiny Cells

    Work well with higher mmWave and THz frequencies. They are simple

    to install and conï¬gure, with the ability to restrict access to a speciï¬c set

    of users present at home or in an ofï¬ce environment.

    Higher Frequency

    High-frequency spectrum (THz) exploration is being pursued with the

    goal of achieving data rates of one terabyte per second (TB/s).

    3CLS

    In addition to the wireless communication that earlier generations of-

    fered, this generation adds computing, control, localization, and sensing.

    Supports various new applications.

    eMBMS

    Video compression methods and new technologies targeted to video

    applications beneï¬t from the eMBMS bearer. MIMO technology is used

    by eMBMS to provide consumers with Multicast/Broadcast media content

    that supports Quality of Experience (QoE), such as High-Deï¬nition Video

    streaming.

    Network Slicing

    Enables superior ï¬exibility, scalability, and specialization capacity for the

    provision of novel and specialized services. It simpliï¬es the process of

    updating and patching the program.

    Artiï¬cial Intelligence

    The use of artiï¬cial intelligence (AI) is proposed to enable self-sustaining

    wireless networks, providing a distributed (AI) architecture for model

    training in which each participating device learns the model locally and

    then communicates the updated model rather than the data. This ad-

    dresses issues such as privacy leakage, huge overheads, etc.

    Blockchain

    Numerous beneï¬ts of immutability, disintermediation, audibility, and

    non-repudiation are provided by blockchain technology, which enables

    decentralized and distributed management of a cryptographically se-

    cure digital ledger. Secure spectrum, resource, mobility, and interference

    management capabilities.

    RIS

    Smart reï¬ecting surfaces that can act as walls, roadways, doors, and

    entire buildings. RIS aids in maintaining a line of sight and obtaining a

    high-quality signal with less noise and interference from other users.

    Extended Radio

    6G is intended to integrate spaceâairâgroundâsea mode, enabling wireless

    communication in planes, UAVs, and other applications.

    mURLLC

    Provide extremely low latency. Ultra-high reliability, high availability,

    massive connectivity, and scalability.

    6. Applications Depending Heavily on 6G

    A summary of the applications is given in Table 5 and Figure 9. The ï¬gure summarizes

    the key m-health applications that belong to 6G and will become a reality with
    the deploy-

    ment of the 6G communication systems. The table is intended to serve as a guide
    for the

    applications that will be discussed in this section. The brief descriptions are
    highlighted in

    order to provide the reader with a foundational understanding of the applications,
    which

    will be further developed as the section unfolds.

    AR/VR and Holograph communications

    Human communication via holograms (3D pictures

    in thin air) to enhance remote communication. Holo-

    graphic communication is hampered by latency and

    excessive bandwidth, but 6G will overcome them.

    Perceptual AR/VR, URLLC and eMBB in 6G will en-

    able perceptual aspects. A great candidate for better

    remote healthcare applications.

    5 Sense communications and Tactile Internet

    Allows humanâmachine and machineâmachine in-

    teractions.

    Wireless Brain-Computer Interactions

    The brainâcomputer interface (BCI) facilitates com-

    munication between the brain and electronic equip-

    ment. High reliability, ultra-low latency, and a large

    data ï¬ow are required for this.

    Intelligent Ambulance Service

    Remotely control automobiles. These autos are also

    called semi-autonomous. Semi-autonomous vehi-

    cles require a reliable, low-latency wireless network.

    connected ambulances in future healthcare by en-

    abling real-time video streaming with high color

    resolution for trustworthy diagnosis.

    Remote Health Monitoring

    The combination of mURLLC and THz communica-

    tions provides a solution for remote health monitor-

    ing that allows for exceptionally low-latency data

    transmission and network connections between

    wearables and distant clinicians.

    manned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and blockchain inte-

    gration, which may provide both rapid and secure

    6.1. Holographic Communications, Augmented and Virtual Reality

    Overall, 6G will create new opportunities for many m-health applications, such
    as

    providing 3D services using holographic communication, which will revolutionize
    smart

    healthcare systems, especially telesurgery. Doctors will be able to diagnose patients
    re-

    motely using holographic communication, which will reduce the ï¬nancial and physical

    burden placed upon them by the medical system [107]. For improved diagnosis, augmented

    reality and holographic communication can be integrated. The primary goal of VR/AR
    in

    healthcare is to enable the transmission of high-resolution multimedia (video,
    audio, and

    voice) [124,125]. One of the drawbacks of 5G-enabled VR/AR in healthcare for multimedia

    transmission is the lack of a real-time platform for end-users [55]. AR enables
    viewing of

    the inside of a patientâs body, where doctors can adjust the depth of a speciï¬c
    body area and

    can be expanded to improve visibility. It will be extremely beneï¬cial while doing
    difï¬cult

    procedures/surgeries that involve a signiï¬cant degree of risk.

    Overall, 6G will enable the creation of a smooth and high-resolution display for
    remote

    medical education or diagnostics [126]. Combining AI and 6G approaches also enables

    seamless 360-degree video streaming at edge nodes with high packet delivery, seamless

    connectivity, interoperability, and convergence. The 6G network has traditionally
    favored

    highly interactive and unique video-coding techniques that enable the distribution
    of

    360-degree on-demand and live video at a quicker rate via edge devices, which
    is critical

    for VR/AR-enabled healthcare applications. Due to the rapid adoption of mobile
    edge

    computing and edge caching technologies and trends, 6G ensures that latency and
    load

    at the backhaul are distributed equally across end-users, whereas 5G does not
    [127]. To

    deliver these videos or holograms, current 5G KPIs such as data rate, bandwidth,
    and

    dependability become insigniï¬cant [128]. These services must be able to reproduce
    real

    experiences to the user; hence, QoE is of high importance. Overall, 6G guarantees
    high

    QoE, proving itself to be the best technology for hologram/AR/VR applications
    [129].

    6.2. Five Sense Communications and Tactile Internet

    It is anticipated that 6G will be capable of supporting a 5D communication system

    with ï¬ve senses, namely, sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste [130]. Additionally,
    6G

    demands an exceedingly high data throughput while also having incredibly low latency.

    Furthermore, the sensors must be capable of reproducing the ï¬ve senses from faraway

    locations to give users a realistic experience, and as a result, 6G is primarily
    concerned

    with the QoE [108]. Another feature that is projected to be available on 6G networks
    is

    the tactile internet, which will enhance the user experience by including factors
    such as

    weight, temperature, and speed [131]. Tactile internetworking will also combine
    a sense

    of touch or taste with audio, video, or other responses. Such considerations are
    critical in

    various situations when the need for prompt remote control is required. Remote
    surgery,

    manufacturing, and navigation are examples of such applications. It is a good
    example of

    service enhancements that encourage the usage of high-precision networking [9].

    The 6G networks will allow real-time data transfer, control, and feedback via
    touch.

    Using this method, one can simultaneously convey touch, sensations (sense), and
    informa-

    tion, allowing for a more interactive experience. In a smart healthcare system
    where an

    injured patient may only convey emotions through visualization, a smart headband
    can

    reconstruct brain impulses and display them as a 3D video of the patientâs imagination,

    which the caregiver may see in real-time using mobile networks. Furthermore, a
    group of

    people who do not speak the same language can communicate using their imaginations,

    and disabled people can utilize haptic communication to open doors or control
    gadgets.

    These haptic communication methods will allow them to express information through

    touch. It is one of the expected use cases for 6G networks, in which the network
    can sustain

    substantially higher data rates than 5G can.

    QoE has been extensively investigated and considered an important aspect of mul-

    timedia (engaging more than three human senses) [132]. Tactile internet communication

    may demand strict latency requirements, reliability, and user experience, which
    can be

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    28 of 43

    provided by 6G mURLLC to render an immersive, synchronized effect to the human
    senses.

    The 6G-driven communication architecture, consisting of a Radio Access Network
    and a

    Core Network, satisï¬es the fundamental requirements for realizing the 6G-enabled
    Tactile

    Internet [29]. The following are the essential tasks of the 6G RAN in the Tactile
    Internet

    ecosystem to achieve this goal: (i) radio access technologies (RATs) such as mmWave,

    massive MIMO, and full-duplex; (ii) tactile QoE/QoS for tactile applications (iii)
    efï¬cient

    packet delivery via reliable radio protocols and the physical layer; and (iv)
    novel medium

    access control (MAC) techniques that optimally control air-interface conï¬icts.
    The follow-

    ing are the primary functions of the 6G CN linked with the tactile internet: (i)
    dynamic

    provisioning of QoS; (ii) edge-cloud access; and (iii) security.

    6.3. Wireless Brain-Computer Interactions (BCI)

    Brainâcomputer interactions are another form of haptic communication in which

    humans interact with their environment via haptics and control it using digital
    gadgets

    such as brain-embedded wireless chips that respond to human emotions [35,133,134].

    Traditionally, BCI applications were limited to those healthcare scenarios in
    which humans

    use brain implants to operate prosthetic limbs or nearby computing devices. The
    recent

    applications of wireless BCI and implants will revolutionize this industry and
    provide

    new use-case scenarios that necessitate 6G connectivity. Individuals will interact
    with their

    surroundings and other people utilizing discrete devices, some worn, some implanted,
    and

    others embedded in the world around them, employing wireless BCI technologies
    instead

    of cellphones.

    The nervous system processes the data from the sensor system, which comprises

    receptors, neurons, etc. The format for comprehending is based on 6G wireless
    technology

    with a form of wireless biosignal processor that receives brain signals from computer

    equipment [135]. Following that, it analyzes, controls, and transforms these signals
    into

    electronic instructions that will be processed to determine the level of attention,
    locate the

    attention, and calculate the time required to complete the desired task, among
    others [35,41].

    The BCI is a process for controlling the items we use daily in our smart home
    to transform

    into a smart society, and these things are all related to the m-health systems
    [136]. Compared

    to 5G, wireless BCI services necessitate fundamentally different performance metrics,

    including guaranteed Quality of Physical Experience (QoPE), which incorporates
    QoS,

    QoE, and human perceptions. Wireless BCI services also require high speeds, ultra-low

    latency, and great reliability, making 6G the ï¬rst to enable a new class of applications
    that

    leverage several human cognitive senses. When considering future spectrum demands,
    BCI

    is expected to be one of many applications supported by future wireless networks
    [137].

    6.4. Intelligent Ambulance Services

    Overall, 6G is intended to produce self-driven, steering-less, completely AI-driven

    automobiles [138]. As a result of 6Gâs capacity to communicate in real-time, the
    automobiles

    will monitor passenger health, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature.
    In

    an emergency, intelligent automobiles will transform into intelligent ambulances.
    It is

    achieved by remote doctors employing mix-virtual reality/holograph communication
    over

    6G. In smart ambulances, real-time medical imaging data transfer demands high
    data rates,

    which ï¬eld hospitals often lack due to restricted or nonexistent network connectivity.

    Communication between intelligent ambulances with medical equipment and hospital

    workers requires exceptionally low latency [139]. Autonomous ambulances and teleoper-

    ated vehicles can also beneï¬t from edge intelligence supporting wide coverage
    to improve

    mobility [140]. A relatively recent concept called joint radar communication (JRC)
    can

    be used to enable reliable sensing, and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication
    in

    smart ambulances [141]. Furthermore, REM- and AI-assisted cognitive radios can
    solve

    handover concerns (delay, jitter) due to patient mobility with implanted medical
    devices.

    Additionally, 6G-based URLLC can be used to enable connected ambulances in future

    healthcare by allowing physicians and paramedical staff from the hospital to broadcast

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    29 of 43

    real-time video with high color resolution for reliable diagnosis at reasonably
    fast speeds

    (up to 100 km/h) [142]. For example, EEG and ECG data from clinical examinations
    can be

    collected aboard, and hospital doctors can deliver urgent indications to paramedical
    staff in

    the ambulance via URLLC-based real-time teleconsultation. In this case, an extremely
    short

    survival time (less than two milliseconds) must be guaranteed, despite the ambulanceâs

    fast speed. By leveraging the beneï¬ts of 6G networks and AI, the trafï¬c control
    system can

    investigate and assess the road trafï¬c load, topology, and accidents in real time,
    facilitating

    the intelligent ambulance services [143].

    6.5. Remote Health Monitoring of Patients

    Transmission of patient vital signs is an important part of m-health applications,

    and the amount and frequency of information that is transmitted are dependent
    on the

    patientâs needs. The 5G services are inadequate to meet the evolving healthcare
    technology,

    and remote healthcare privacy and security [139]. The 6G integration will revolutionize

    m-health technologies such as mURLLC, and THz communications could support ultra-low-

    latency healthcare data transmission and speed up medical network connections
    between

    wearables and remote doctors [144]. Healthcare domains such as remote health monitoring

    necessitate low-latency communications (below 1 ms) with a reliability requirement
    of

    greater than 99.999 percent to achieve near-real-time health provision with a
    fast and

    reliable remote diagnosis.

    An aging population is driving the development of novel healthcare provisions
    that

    move away from the traditional hospital-based system. These patients can be observed

    in their homes remotely using 6G technology by identifying critical events, such
    as the

    freezing of oneâs gait and wandering behavior. The IW would make it possible to
    monitor

    patients hidden behind large objects [116]. Furthermore, the placement of IW at
    specific

    locations throughout the house would direct the beams so that signals could reach
    the

    patient-monitoring equipment. In addition to generating multiple beams [145],
    the IW will

    be useful for monitoring multiple patients in a nursing home. The monitoring devices

    would typically relay back patient data to a hospital network server with the
    assistance of

    the IW.

    Continuous health monitoring is critical in healthcare, especially for patients
    with

    sudden diseases (e.g., cardiovascular diseases). In this system, the sensors transmit
    the

    measurements (based on patient-speciï¬c thresholds, timing and frequency as speciï¬ed
    by

    a healthcare provider) via a signal processing module that further transmits to
    different

    network destinations such as hospital servers, emergency stations, remote clinicians,
    and

    others. The 6G-based healthcare systems will pre-upload data-driven models that
    can

    detect abnormal health statuses. Noninvasive sensors can continuously collect
    patient

    physiological data and send it to the cloud. The cloud models will analyze the
    data and

    send an alert if sudden diseases occur. The 6G technology will be critical for
    real-time

    monitoring and disease notiï¬cation. It will also spur the development of hospital-to-home

    (H2H) services to replace ambulances [107].

    6G networks will allow for large amounts of data to be transmitted at a faster
    rate,

    allowing for network-assisted consultations with specialists. Overall, 6G will
    encourage the

    development of these smart medical services [146] and provide a strong enough
    network to

    respond on time [147]. Health-monitoring technology has the potential to reduce
    the need

    for patients to see their doctors in person [14]. Instead, the practitioner could
    conduct a

    teleconsultation via video conferencing, with the necessary medical data shared
    via remote

    monitoring systems.

    6.6. Telesurgery

    The advent of 6G networks will be a game-changer because it will reduce space
    and

    time constraints [148]. Critical applications such as remote surgeries are extremely
    sensitive,

    requiring a latency of less than one millisecond (nearly 0.1 ms) [149]. Remote
    robotic

    surgeries will necessitate extremely high data precision and reliability and a
    high data

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    30 of 43

    rate for data exchange and control signals between two remote healthcare facilities
    via the

    mobile network. Overall, 6G will be the most suitable candidate to meet these
    requirements

    because its vision is to provide at least 99.99999% data reliability and a 1 Tbps
    data rate.

    The latency requirements are the primary concern in the case of remote surgeries.
    Unlike

    previous generations of networks, the 6G should aim for both minimum and maximum

    latency requirements. During remote surgery, some aspects of the transmitted data
    must

    arrive at the destination within a speciï¬ed maximum latency, while others must
    arrive

    within a speciï¬ed minimum latency. The combination of these minimum and maximum

    latencies will result in coherent data at the receiver, which is a critical requirement
    for

    remote surgery [148]. Recently, a telesurgery system based on UAVs and blockchain
    was

    investigated in [150] in the context of 6G. The blockchain is integrated into
    the robotic

    system because of the security risks in existing mobile surgery networks. Each
    robot acts as

    a data node, allowing surgical data to be securely stored in the database ledger
    without

    needing centralized authority. Smart contracts, in particular, are being used
    to provide

    automatic authentication for health data requests and control over health data
    sharing

    during surgery [103].

    Meanwhile, using the THz bands in 6G-based healthcare networks, the mURLLC

    technology is ideal for meeting future requirements in terms of ultra-high data
    rates of

    medical data communications [151]. mURLLC is especially important in hospital-based

    telemedicine, where doctors can remotely monitor and manage surgery procedures
    using

    real-time video streaming from medical robotics and assistant devices connected
    by 6G core

    networks [28]. Computer-assisted operating room simulations in VR are highly beneï¬cial

    for both educational and clinical settings [14]. Using multimedia components to
    create

    real-time surgical procedure simulations in a controlled and realistic setting
    (i.e., a virtual

    theater) allows the operating surgeon to perform preoperative planning and practice,

    surgical education, and training. Where the surgeonâs technical skills often determine
    the

    surgical outcomes, such systems have proven useful. In particular, VR/AR for surgical

    planning and education has the potential for medical home applications (i.e.,
    virtual

    simulations aimed at increasing the emotional comfort of older and disabled patients

    at home).

    6.7. Wireless Body Area Networks and Molecular Communication

    Human Bond Communication (HBC) is the ability to integrate all ï¬ve sensory features

    of humans. In humans, information is exchanged through biochemical and physical
    pro-

    cesses that involve the synthesis, transformation, emission, propagation, and
    reception

    of molecules. This information exchange is referred to as molecular communication
    in

    telecommunication engineering [152]. With the advent of NanoThings, molecular
    com-

    munication has emerged as one of the most important research areas for revolutionizing

    Medical-IoT [153].

    Advanced nanotechnology has the potential to enable the manufacture of nanodevices

    such as nanorobots, implantable chips, and biosensors with critical applications
    in ï¬elds

    such as nanoscale sensing and biomedicine [154,155]. The application of nanotechnology
    in

    biomedicine, in particular, has generated interest due to its potential to perform
    tasks such

    as intelligent drug distribution through blood vessels and monitoring of body
    organs, both

    of which can signiï¬cantly improve human healthcare outcomes. Connecting nanodevices

    to the internet or forming networks (i.e., the Internet of Nano-Things) enables
    effective

    communication and information transmission. In biomedicine, the Internet of Bio-Nano-

    Things (IoBNT) enables the connection of nanodevices and biological entities.
    In the

    IoT, molecular communication enables the IoBNT by allowing biological molecules
    to

    communicate and transport information between nanodevices [154]. Additionally,
    when

    the IoBNT is combined with body area networks, which are short-range wireless
    networks

    comprised of wearable monitoring devices/sensors and sensing devices embedded
    in or

    on the body, comprehensive solutions for healthcare enhancements can be provided.

    7. Challenges

    Several challenges are associated with m-health multimedia data.Despite recent
    efforts

    to address QoE control and management difï¬culties and the rapid evolution of cellular

    communication systems, there are still signiï¬cant gaps in certain areas that require
    extensive

    research and investigation [45]. To address the provisioning of QoE to end users,
    additional

    research on multimedia m-health services should be conducted in the following
    critical

    areas that have received little attention in the past:

    7.1. Spectrum Management for the m-Health Multimedia Applications

    In future wireless networks, meeting the demands of formidable and diversiï¬ed

    6G use cases involves high resource efï¬ciency and more ï¬exibility and scalability
    [156].

    Resource expansion is critical as the networks are expected to go beyond their
    statistically

    assigned resources and take advantage of available resources based on spatial
    and temporal

    constraints. With new services and applications such as 3D holographic image and
    presence,

    5D communications, smart clothes and wearables, and completely autonomous vehicles,

    6G will take resource challenges to the next level [41]. Furthermore, as predicted
    by

    ITU-R, connectivity would reach an extreme level by 2030 [157], with nearly 120
    billion

    subscriptions, including M2M subscriptions, and exponentially growing trafï¬c [158].

    Managing 6G spectrum resources and interference issues demands updated spectrum

    management technology and appropriate sharing policies [159]. Effective management
    is

    critical for optimal resource utilization with high QoS and QoE. The 6G radio
    must be agile

    and adaptive beyond the 5G NR deï¬nition. It must be capable of utilizing multiple
    channel

    bandwidths across a wide spectrum, supporting cell-free communications, implementing

    ultra-massive MIMO, and operating on a discontinuous spectrum [35]. The requisite

    ï¬exibility can also be achieved by integrating network softwarization and network
    slicing

    more deeply into core and transport networks. Additionally, the stringent operational

    settings, ranging from ultra-reliable and low-latency scenarios to massive connectivity,

    necessitate a considerably more ï¬exible radio capable of spectrum sharing [36].
    In that

    context, capacity expansion via adaptive strategies such as spectrum sharing is
    critical in

    serving applications envisioned by the 6G ecosystem [160]. There are many survey
    articles

    about CRNs in the literature; however, most of them overlook the rigorous requirements

    of multimedia communications. Those considering multimedia transmission over CRNs

    failed to address the difï¬culties of QoS/QoE provisioning [161].

    Building a viable solution for dynamic spectrum allocation is a major issue in
    CRNs. A

    simpliï¬ed QoS uniform assumption for spectrum assignment must be explored to solve
    this

    problem. The explicit QoS needs of Secondary Users (SUs) for various m-health
    multimedia

    services must also be considered; otherwise, SUs will continually hand off to
    other channels

    in search of the best available channel, resulting in quality degradation. As
    a result,

    providing QoS and QoE for multimedia transmission over CRNs poses signiï¬cant issues.

    7.2. Standardizing QoE Mapping to Network Performance Indicators

    Despite the numerous research initiatives and remarkable progress made in recent

    years, m-health multimedia communication still has a number of unresolved concerns
    that

    need to be addressed. In the m-health services and IoT applications, user satisfaction
    with

    multimedia content is measured using subjective QoE indicators. In recent studies
    on QoE

    evaluation for multimedia applications, packet loss, MOS, DMOS, and user satisfaction
    are

    the key QoE indicators used. For M-IoT evaluation, other QoE indicators such as
    buffering

    time, data rate, interruption time, and failure rate should be employed [162].
    Jitter, end-to-

    end delay, bit error rate, and frame loss are the most commonly used network performance

    measures (QoS metrics) in M-IoT research. To improve multimedia quality and network

    services, both QoS and QoE measurements should be examined together [163].

    QoE management in 6G-enabled m-health will be a difï¬cult task, as QoE is expected

    to be maintained competently and autonomously for each patient and the accompanying

    needed service. As a result, a data-driven architecture for individualized QoE
    management

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    32 of 43

    in the next-generation healthcare network has been suggested. The suggested architecture

    must meet some requirements to capture the userâs subjective characteristics.
    A deï¬nable

    cognitive computing capability must be built into the architecture, and the design
    should be

    based on a data-driven model that can predict customer demand. To maintain a satisfying

    QoE, the architecture must efï¬ciently manage communication resources based on
    the QoS

    requirements, and the expected user-centric service [164].

    7.3. The Role of Contextual and Device Information in QoE

    Context awareness was initially studied in the context of pervasive computing,
    in

    which relevant information about the user and its environment, such as location,
    user

    identiï¬cation, etc., was obtained and used by the computing system to adapt accordingly.

    Numerous context-aware approaches for optimizing cellular network operations,
    including

    radio resource management, mobility management, and congestion control, have been
    de-

    veloped. Current RAN architectures are often optimized for a single RAT, which
    frequently

    under-utilizes available heterogeneous resources. Additionally, such an architecture
    cannot

    ensure consistent QoE for users traveling between various RANs. Context awareness

    becomes critical in these situations, allowing for more precise and intelligent
    adminis-

    tration. The 6G network must be planned to be entirely context-aware. The network

    must constantly be aware of all devices in its environment and their capabilities.
    Various

    open difï¬culties are associated with achieving total context awareness and administering

    such a system efï¬ciently. Several critical issues in this area include: managing
    conï¬icting

    changes in a system caused by multiple applications or network functions based
    on the

    same context, monitoring and collecting context information without overwhelming
    the

    core networkâs operation, and maintaining the acquired contextâs recentness by
    aligning

    the temporal scales of monitored information [44]. The context-aware quantized
    QoE

    model improves user experience while ensuring resource efï¬ciency, while the invalid
    action

    masking approach reduces invalid RATs to accelerate convergence [164].

    In recent years, video quality assessment studies have focused on incorporating
    the

    context awareness of the application in order to assess video quality. Context
    awareness

    includes considering factors such as the video content, video characteristics
    such as frame

    resolution, frame rate, etc., the delivery mechanism, the application in which
    it is used, the

    end userâs requirements, the devices on which the videos are streamed, etc. In
    medical

    video streaming, it is particularly important to consider the context of the system.
    This

    is because the quality of the video in m-health applications should not just be
    of good

    visual quality, but also retain its quality so that the video is suitable for
    diagnosis. Here,

    context can be deï¬ned as any information that aids in determining a userâs QoE.
    There are

    two types of context: static and dynamic [64]. Dynamic context evolves over time
    and is

    difï¬cult to predict, but static context does not change frequently. The userâs
    application

    choices, security needs, and cost are all examples of the static context. The
    context in

    real-world settings can be highly dynamic and stochastic, i.e., it can change
    rapidly and is

    uncertain and imperfect; have a variety of temporal characteristics; have several
    alternative

    representations, interconnected or distributed; and it may not be available at
    any given

    time. Context gathering and processing should be done as soon as possible because
    it can

    lose its correctness. User position, velocity, network load, battery power, memory/CPU

    utilization, presence, and signal-to-noise ratio are all examples of dynamic context.
    QoE

    can be considered as a function of contextual factors (represented as a vector).

    Measurement and prediction of QoE might include a vast parameter space with

    multiple context attributes and QoE parameters. Different context attributes may
    inï¬uence

    different QoE parameters. The QoE parameters can also interact with one another.
    As

    a result, choosing important context traits and QoE parameters and establishing
    links

    between them can be difï¬cult. These connections are frequently non-linear and
    difï¬cult to

    quantify. This needs the creation of unique QoE modeling methodologies that can
    effectively

    model various context features and QoE parameters. The new QoE models should be

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    33 of 43

    more than just conceptual; they should also address the issues of QoE measurement

    and prediction.

    7.4. Inï¬uence Factors (IF)

    In general, the m-QoE perceived in m-health systems is inï¬uenced by the system,
    the

    context and human Inï¬uence Factors (IFs), and these need to be taken into account
    during

    the design stage [9,165]. The ï¬rst refers to what can be called the userâs demographic

    composite. These factors include an individualâs age, gender, culture, personality,
    mood,

    and interests. Clearly, these are not static effects and are subject to change
    throughout time

    and space. Context modiï¬es human IFs by incorporating information about the userâs

    location, surroundings, time, activity, co-occupants of shared space, technical
    afï¬uence, and

    economic capabilities. Finally, system IFs are concerned with the content, the
    conï¬guration

    of the media, the network condition, and the device (or gear). A detailed understanding
    of

    the IFs and their impact on the QoE of a speciï¬c service is a key requirement
    for successful

    QoE management with the overall goal of optimizing end-user QoE while utilizing
    network

    resources efï¬ciently and retaining a contented user base. It is required to identify
    and

    comprehend many inï¬uence factors (IFs) and perceptual dimensions from the perspective

    of various players in the service delivery chain in order to ascertain their impact
    on QoE.

    This is a necessary precondition for QoE management since it establishes the parameters
    to

    be monitored, assessed and ultimately utilized to develop, test, and apply QoE
    control and

    optimization techniques.

    Because QoE is a relatively new term, content providers, service and network providers,

    as well as academics are confronted with new issues in delivering, evaluating,
    and control-

    ling QoE. Then, a preliminary step would be to investigate and analyze the QoE-inï¬uencing

    parameters (IFs) [25]. Due to the subjective nature of the QoE, it is difï¬cult
    to predict. Thus,

    prior to evaluating the overall service quality, it is necessary to ascertain
    the aspects that

    inï¬uence usersâ perceptions [26].

    7.5. Mobility Management

    Mobility management in 6G will be complicated as the networks will be extremely

    heterogeneous, multi-layer, large-dimensional, and dynamic [80]. To provide a
    positive

    user experience, optimize resource utilization, and reduce network signaling overhead,
    in-

    telligent mobility management is critical. It can be accomplished by learning
    and predicting

    user movement and optimizing handover settings. Numerous academics have attempted

    to understand and predict user mobility behavior using machine learning approaches.
    For

    example, in [28], the back-propagation NN is used to forecast the next cell a
    user will move

    towards by learning the userâs mobility model and then predicting the next cell.
    Addition-

    ally, the optimization of handover (HO) parameters is a critical problem for 6G
    networks,

    as it can affect various factors, including coverage capacity, energy usage, interference,
    and

    user experience. As a result, various works utilizing machine learning have been
    devoted

    to the subject.

    The 6G networks plan to support high speeds to counter mobility, but this will
    necessi-

    tate regular handovers. Additional service needs, such as high data ï¬ow, high
    dependability,

    and low latency, may complicate efï¬cient changeover [44]. When a mobile device
    requests

    video content, it is often issued from servers and subsequently traverses the
    mobile carrierâs

    CN and RAN. Many concurrent streams would create enormous demand on the backhaul

    side. Additionally, the unpredictable characteristics of the wireless channel
    (e.g., fading,

    multi-user interface, peak trafï¬c loads, etc.) may pose a challenge for monitoring
    user QoE

    by imposing additional stress on the cellular network. Nonetheless, distributing
    streaming

    content is a challenge, as the link between servers hosting the needed information
    and

    consumers can introduce delays in data transfer, impairing the user experience.
    By bringing

    content closer to the consumer via caching, numerous hurdles such as network load
    and

    latency can be addressed, resulting in an improved QoE [45].

    Sensors 2023, 23, 5882

    Handover decisions should be made carefully in these HetNets environments to

    guarantee that video applications meet their criteria for low packet loss and
    delay, as well

    as QoE support [166]. For example, a user traveling in a vehicle may pass through
    multiple

    geographical areas in a short period of time, necessitating repeated handovers
    in order to

    retain connectivity with the video service provider [167]. Thus, independent of
    the network

    circumstances and characteristics or the userâs mobility, the handover must occur
    without

    compromising the QoE, i.e., a video devoid of ghost effects, pixelization, or
    screen freezing.

    Handover methods in HetNets use radio (e.g., signal strength) or QoS context factors

    as a key metric for handover decisions. However, considering it alone or in combination

    with QoS is inefï¬cient for mobile multimedia. Determining, controlling, and improving

    the quality of multimedia applications is not limited to QoS techniques. Handovers
    in

    heterogeneous networks should address subjective characteristics of video content,
    such as

    user perception and pleasure. QoE must be quantiï¬ed and integrated into decision-making

    to improve handover decisions while meeting mobile user video service requirements.

    The current HetNets must adopt QoE-centric methodologies. Cognitive radio (CR)
    is a

    prospective candidate technology for enabling HetNets. HetNets based on CR can
    give

    better-suited QoE for multimedia applications that require a lot more bandwidth
    [161].

    8. Conclusions and Future Works

    The vision for the 6G network indicates that it will vastly surpass the 5G network
    in

    terms of meeting the high requirements of future use cases such as telehealthcare,
    aug-

    mented/virtual reality, and haptic internet. With customer demand for video services

    increasing, QoE is critical for service providers and network operators. This
    paper aims

    to draw attention to the complex elements of QoE in 6G networks and the limitations
    of

    current deï¬nitions in the context of m-health applications. We identiï¬ed some
    interesting

    technologies in 6G networks that will signiï¬cantly impact the healthcare business
    and

    improve the QoE for m-health applications. We provide an in-depth description
    of artiï¬cial

    intelligence, intelligent reï¬ecting surfaces, THz communications, blockchain,
    and extended

    radio, among other technologies, and how they will revolutionize m-health. We
    covered

    numerous healthcare applications that require 6G networks to deliver extreme data
    speeds,

    ultra-low latency, extreme dependability and availability, vast scalability, extreme
    power ef-

    ï¬ciency, and extreme mobility. In the end, we explore the difï¬culties that 6G
    will encounter

    while implementing new healthcare applications.

    In addition to the aforementioned aspects, it is crucial to address the existing
    gaps in

    medical data transmission within the context of 6G networks. While extensive research
    has

    been conducted in this area, the absence of a standardized format universally
    compatible

    with other wireless devices poses a signiï¬cant challenge. Future telemedicine
    designs

    should prioritize the resolution of concerns pertaining to scheduling mechanisms,
    data

    security, privacy considerations, and the adoption of advanced compression techniques

    for medical video streaming. Furthermore, the design of wearable medical devices
    must

    carefully consider factors such as energy efï¬ciency, radiation absorption rates
    from wireless

    sensors, and the provision of adequate skin protection, ensuring the safety and
    well-

    being of users. By addressing these critical issues, the implementation of 6G
    networks in

    healthcare applications can be further optimized to enhance the quality of experience
    for

    m-health services.

  explanation: This study proposes an energy-efficient resource allocation algorithm
    (EERAA) for CR-WSN-based smart irrigation systems. The algorithm's goal is to
    prolong the WSN's lifespan by reducing energy consumption while maintaining high
    average capacity. The algorithm performs power allocation and subcarrier assignment
    sequentially and considers the effect of intercarrier interference (ICI). The
    authors formulated the maximization of system capacity under realistic scenarios
    with power and interference constraints.
  extract_1: This paper presents an energy-efﬁcient resource allocation algorithm
    (EERAA) to prolong the lifetime of a WSN-based smart irrigation system under realistic
    scenarios. In the proposed algorithm, power allocation and subcarrier assignment
    are performed sequentially. Considering the impact of the intercarrier interference
    (ICI) caused by timing offset, the problem of maximizing network-averaged capacity
    is formulated considering power and interference constraints in realistic scenarios.

    the averaged capacity of the CR-WSN subject to the total power constraint and
    tolerable interference. Numerically, the proposed algorithm can reduce the network
    energy consumption by up to 30%, compared with conventional approaches, while
    maintaining a high level of system performance in terms of secondary users’ (SUs)

    The paper proposes using a hybrid deep learning model that combines LSTM (Long
    Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithms to forecast
    irrigation water requirements (IWR). The model takes into account various parameters
    such as maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation,

    water quality (IWQP) using a deep learning neural network.
  relevance_evaluation: 'The study is highly relevant to the point of autonomous planning
    and scheduling of variable rate irrigation (VRI) using machine learning and optimization
    techniques within the context of data collection to cloud: automation and real-time
    processing. The developed IWQP4Net model provides an effective method for predicting
    irrigation water quality, which is a key factor in optimizing VRI systems. By
    accurately predicting water quality, farmers can make informed decisions about
    irrigation schedules and water usage, leading to increased crop yields and reduced
    environmental impact.'

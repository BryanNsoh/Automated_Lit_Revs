    \ that leverages advanced technologies to\noptimize water usage in agricultural\
    \ practices. With the increasing global demand for food\nproduction and the growing\
    \ scarcity of water resources, efﬁcient irrigation techniques are\ncrucial for\
    \ sustainable agriculture. Smart irrigation systems integrate various components,\n\
    such as sensors, actuators, and data analytics, to enable precise monitoring and\
    \ control of\nirrigation processes. These systems utilize a network of sensors\
    \ to collect real-time data\non environmental factors, soil moisture levels, and\
    \ plant conditions [1]. The collected data\nare then analyzed and processed using\
    \ sophisticated algorithms to determine the optimal\namount and timing of water\
    \ application. By considering factors such as weather conditions,\ncrop requirements,\
    \ and soil characteristics, smart irrigation systems can provide precise\nand\
    \ targeted irrigation, minimizing water waste and maximizing crop yield [2,3].\n\
    One key advantage of smart irrigation is its ability to enable remote monitoring\
    \ and\ncontrol. Farmers can access the system through web-based platforms or mobile\
    \ applications,\nallowing them to monitor ﬁeld conditions and adjust irrigation\
    \ schedules from anywhere\nat any time. This remote accessibility enhances operational\
    \ efﬁciency and reduces the need\nfor manual labor, saving time and resources.\
    \ Moreover, smart irrigation systems can be\nintegrated with weather forecasting\
    \ systems to further enhance their effectiveness. By\nincorporating real-time\
    \ weather data, these systems can adapt irrigation schedules based\non predicted\
    \ rainfall or temperature changes, ensuring optimal water usage and reducing\n\
    reliance on manual adjustments. The beneﬁts of smart irrigation extend beyond\
    \ water\nconservation and crop productivity. By minimizing water usage, farmers\
    \ can reduce their\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1149. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13061149\n\

    overall operational costs, improve energy efﬁciency, and mitigate environmental\
    \ impacts,\nsuch as water pollution and soil erosion [1].\nA wireless sensor network\
    \ (WSN) is a network of many low-cost and power-limited\nsensors that are distributed\
    \ in an area to monitor and collect data about the physical or\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions. The sensors are outﬁtted with a diverse array of monitoring\ncapabilities,\
    \ including temperature, humidity, pressure, light, sound, and motion. They\n\
    establish wireless communication among themselves to establish a network. The\
    \ collected\ndata can then be processed, analyzed, and transmitted to a central\
    \ control unit or a remote\nserver for further processing and storage. The primary\
    \ advantage of WSNs is their ability\nto provide a real-time, continuous, and\
    \ ﬁne-grained monitoring of the physical world,\nwhich can be used in many applications,\
    \ such as environmental monitoring, smart cities,\nhealthcare, industrial automation,\
    \ and precision agriculture [4–7]. However, the design\nand deployment of WSNs\
    \ pose several challenges, such as limited power, bandwidth,\nprocessing capabilities,\
    \ communication and network management issues, security and\nprivacy concerns,\
    \ and the need for robust and energy-efﬁcient algorithms and protocols.\nNevertheless,\
    \ the widespread use of WSNs is expected to grow in the future as the Internet\n\
    of Things (IoT) continues to expand, providing new opportunities for innovation\
    \ and\nimproving the quality of life. Recently, several studies related to these\
    \ challenges have been\nconducted [7,8].\nCognitive radio wireless sensor networks\
    \ (CR-WSNs) are a type of WSNs that use\nCR technology to enhance the spectrum\
    \ utilization and power conservation [9–11]. In\nCR-WSNs, the sensor nodes are\
    \ equipped with cognitive radios that can sense the radio\nfrequency (RF) spectrum\
    \ and adapt the transmission parameters to avoid interference and\noptimize energy\
    \ consumption. This allows CR-WSNs to operate in a dynamic and hetero-\ngeneous\
    \ RF environment, where different types of wireless devices coexist and compete\
    \ for\nlimited spectrum resources. By using cognitive radio technology, CR-WSNs\
    \ can achieve\nhigher spectrum efﬁciency, better reliability, and longer network\
    \ lifetime compared with\ntraditional WSNs. CR-WSNs have various applications,\
    \ such as environmental monitor-\ning, smart irrigation, industrial control, healthcare,\
    \ and smart cities, where reliable and\nenergy-efﬁcient wireless communication\
    \ is critical [12–14]. In practical scenarios of CR\nnetworks, the estimation\
    \ algorithm design can be affected by channel sensing uncertainty\nresulting from\
    \ false alarms and misdetections. As a result, it is of interest to identify how\n\
    estimation algorithm quality is affected by channel sensing errors. As such, this\
    \ paper aims\nto investigate the impact of imperfect sensing on the performance\
    \ of CR-WSNs.\nOrthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [15] is widely\
    \ regarded as a top\ncontender for the physical layer of CR systems due to its\
    \ ﬂexible, reconﬁgurable subcarrier\nstructure that enables easy adaptation and\
    \ adjustment of system parameters. OFDM\nis also capable of avoiding interference\
    \ through the addition of the cyclic preﬁx, and it\noffers large bandwidth efﬁciency\
    \ through orthogonality, resilience to frequency-selective\nfading channels, and\
    \ simpliﬁed equalizer design. However, OFDM is very sensitive to\ntiming discrepancies\
    \ due to synchronization error. The shortage of OFDM comes from\nhigh side lobes\
    \ in ﬁlters’ frequency response, which, in turn, lead to high interference\nbetween\
    \ subcarriers, which is a major source that declines the performance of wireless\n\
    communication systems [16–18]. In the current literature, optimizing the radio\
    \ resources\nunder power and interference constraints in the CR system remains\
    \ an area of ongoing\nresearch. This paper seeks to enhance the SU’s average capacity\
    \ with the consideration\nof quality of service (QoS) of the primary users (PUs).\
    \ Hence, it is necessary to consider\nthe interference produced by side lobes\
    \ between primary users and secondary users.\nAdditionally, the transmit power\
    \ of each SU subcarrier can be adapted with the best\npossible resource allocation\
    \ algorithm in order to not affect the PU while transmitting\ninformation. Unfortunately,\
    \ there are few studies that have focused on this problem.\nTherefore, in this\
    \ paper, the trade-off of increasing transmission capacity while maintaining\n\
    an acceptable interference will be investigated.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1149\n\
    3 of 13\nResource allocation is a critical process that involves distributing\
    \ resources, such as\ntime, energy, bandwidth, and computational power, among\
    \ competing demands. Efﬁcient\nresource allocation is essential in various ﬁelds,\
    \ including communication systems, trans-\nportation networks, manufacturing processes,\
    \ and energy management [12,13]. Concerning\nWSNs, resource allocation is especially\
    \ crucial since the resources available are typically\nlimited, and the sensors’\
    \ energy consumption must be optimized to prolong the network’s\nlifespan. Proper\
    \ resource allocation can lead to several beneﬁts, such as improved system\nperformance,\
    \ reduced energy consumption, increased reliability, and enhanced scalability.\n\
    Furthermore, resource allocation can help to ensure that critical tasks receive\
    \ adequate\nresources, prevent network congestion, and reduce the risk of system\
    \ failure. In summary,\nresource allocation is vital for optimizing the use of\
    \ resources, achieving efﬁcient operations,\nand achieving the desired system\
    \ performance in various applications [19,20].\nThe resource allocation algorithm\
    \ will take place after the SUs are allocated to the\ndetected spectrum opportunities.\
    \ Based on convex optimization techniques, we derive the\nresource allocation\
    \ algorithm for the SU to achieve the highest capacity considering the\ninterference\
    \ constraint, along with the peak/average transmit power constraint of the SU.\n\
    In summary, this work introduces the following contributions:\n(1)\nWe present\
    \ a practical scenario for CR-WSNs; then we investigate how imperfect\nchannel\
    \ sensing impacts the performance of CR-WSN-based systems.\n(2)\nWe propose a\
    \ resource allocation algorithm that aims to enhance the SU average\ncapacity\
    \ while ensuring that the interference level at the PU is below an acceptable\n\
    level considering power constraint and ICI constraint.\n(3)\nTo solve the above\
    \ nonconvex optimization problem, the proposed algorithm is\npresented to search\
    \ for the optimal transmit power of the SU.\nThe detailed abbreviations and deﬁnitions\

    \ in Section 3. The proposed resource allocation and problem\nformulation are\
    \ presented in Section 4. Section 5 provides the simulation results and\ndiscussion.\
    \ Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusions.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1149\n4\
    \ of 13\n2. Related Work\nIn [12], the authors presented a resource allocation\
    \ scheme that utilizes a Stackelberg\ngame approach to optimize the SUs’ throughput\
    \ while satisfying the PU’s interference\nconstraint in a multiuser CR network.\
    \ The authors in [13] proposed a resource allocation\nscheme for CR-WSNs that\
    \ incorporates energy harvesting capabilities. The authors consider\na CR-WSN\
    \ with a single CR node and multiple energy harvesting nodes, and they express\n\
    the resource allocation formula as an optimization problem that maximizes the\
    \ network\nthroughput subject to energy neutrality constraints for the energy\
    \ harvesting nodes and\ninterference constraints for the PUs. In [21], the authors\
    \ proposed an effective resource\nallocation technique, namely, the Improved Pliable\
    \ Cognitive Medium Access Protocol,\ndesigned to address the challenges of multilevel\
    \ heterogeneity in CR-WSN.\nIn [22], a computationally efﬁcient resource allocation\
    \ algorithm in a multi-carrier-\nbased CR network is presented to maximize the\
    \ system capacity. The assumption made\nin this work is to neglect the interference\
    \ from PU to SU. The authors in [23] proposed a\ntrajectory design and resource\
    \ allocation scheme to maximize the achievable rate of an\nSU in an unmanned aerial\
    \ vehicle (UAV) CR system. They optimized the UAV trajectory,\ntransmit power\
    \ to satisfy practical constraints, and an interference temperature threshold.\n\
    The work in [24] focuses on the achievable rate analysis and resource allocation\
    \ of the\ncognitive low earth orbit (LEO) satellite system. Speciﬁcally, a joint\
    \ power allocation scheme\nwas proposed to maximize the sum rate of the IoT transmission\
    \ subject to performance\nrequirements and constraints of the legacy satellite\
    \ system. The quasi-concave nature of\nthe sum rate of the IoT users over the\
    \ satellite terminal receive power was proved, which\nallows for optimal receive\
    \ powers to be derived.\nAn energy-efﬁcient resource allocation approach in secure\
    \ CR networks was presented\nin [25]. The paper introduces an ergodic secure energy\
    \ efﬁciency problem for a CR network\nwith a PU, an SU, and an eavesdropper, and\
    \ presents a convex optimization problem for\npower allocation using fractional\
    \ programming and dual decomposition techniques. The\nproposed approach aims to\
    \ maximize the ergodic secure energy efﬁciency of the SU with\nconstraints on\
    \ the average interference power and average transmit power.\nIn [26], the authors\
    \ propose a resource allocation algorithm to improve the sum rate\nconsidering\
    \ power and interference constraints using a Rayleigh fading channel. However,\n\
    the scenario where the SUs communicate while facing channel sensing uncertainty\
    \ has not\nbeen considered in any of these works. Therefore, we propose an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ resource\nallocation algorithm (EERAA) to enhance the average capacity and prolong\
    \ the lifetime of\na WSN-based smart irrigation system under realistic scenarios.\
    \ In the proposed algorithm,\npower allocation and subcarrier assignment are performed\
    \ sequentially.\nOur approach differs from that in [26] by considering the capacity\
    \ reduction on all\nsubcarriers occupied by a PU, rather than just on the ﬁrst\
    \ adjacent subcarrier to the SU.\nFurthermore, we employ a coarse approximation\
    \ of the channel’s gain for the SU. The\nobtained results illustrate that the\
    \ average capacity of SUs is close to that of the perfect\nchannel knowledge scenario.\n\
    3. CR-WSN System Model\nA WSN-based smart irrigation system is a modern and innovative\
    \ solution for ef-\nﬁcient and sustainable agriculture. The system comprises a\
    \ network of sensors that are\ndeployed in the soil, plants, and environment to\
    \ monitor and collect data related to soil\nmoisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,\
    \ and other relevant parameters. These data are\nthen transmitted wirelessly to\
    \ a central control unit that processes the data and triggers the\nirrigation\
    \ system based on predeﬁned thresholds and algorithms. The WSN-based smart\nirrigation\
    \ system enables farmers to optimize water usage, increase crop yields, reduce\n\
    water wastage, and lower energy costs. Additionally, it is easily expandable and\
    \ can be\nadapted to achieve the speciﬁc requirements of various crops and farming\
    \ practices. With\nthe rise of climate change and water scarcity issues, WSN-based\
    \ smart irrigation systems\nare becoming increasingly popular and essential for\
    \ modern agriculture.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1149\n5 of 13\nThe CR-WSN-based smart\
    \ irrigation system model is illustrated in Figure 1 with an N\ncluster each with\
    \ one cluster head (CH) and many sensor nodes spread over an area with\nsize A.\
    \ The transmission between the sensor nodes and the CH within the cluster is carried\n\
    out using the unlicensed spectrum, while the transmission between the CH and the\
    \ sink\nnode takes place opportunistically through the licensed spectrum. The\
    \ licensed spectrum\nthat is being targeted includes M radio channels that exhibit\
    \ varying PU communications\nand signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) [27].\n \nthen\
    \ transmitted wirelessly to a central control unit that processes the data and\
    \ triggers \nthe irrigation system based on predefined thresholds and algorithms.\
    \ The WSN-based \nsmart irrigation system enables farmers to optimize water usage,\
    \ increase crop yields, re-\nduce water wastage, and lower energy costs. Additionally,\
    \ it is easily expandable and can \nbe adapted to achieve the specific requirements\
    \ of various crops and farming practices. \nWith the rise of climate change and\
    \ water scarcity issues, WSN-based smart irrigation \nsystems are becoming increasingly\
    \ popular and essential for modern agriculture. \nThe CR-WSN-based smart irrigation\
    \ system model is illustrated in Figure 1 with an \nN cluster each with one cluster\
    \ head (CH) and many sensor nodes spread over an area \nwith size A. The transmission\
    \ between the sensor nodes and the CH within the cluster is \ncarried out using\
    \ the unlicensed spectrum, while the transmission between the CH and \nthe sink\
    \ node takes place opportunistically through the licensed spectrum. The licensed\
    \ \nspectrum that is being targeted includes M radio channels that exhibit varying\
    \ PU com-\nmunications and signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) [27]. \n \nFigure 1.\
    \ CR-WSN-based smart irrigation system model. \nChannel Sensing \nThe first step\
    \ involves using CH nodes (i.e., SUs) to sense the transmission channel, \nto\
    \ decide whether it is currently available or busy by a PU. Energy detection methods\
    \ are \ncommonly used for this purpose, especially when the transmission modes\
    \ of PUs are un-\nknown. Assuming that \U0001D466௟ represents the PU’s signal\
    \ at a specific location, and \U0001D45B௟ repre-\nsents Gaussian white noise with\
    \ a mean of zero and a variance of \U0001D70E௡\nଶ for all \U0001D459, the CH’s\
    \ \nmeasurement can be denoted as \U0001D438௟. For each CH, a spectrum sensing\
    \ function is defined \nFigure 1. CR-WSN-based smart irrigation system model.\n\
    Channel Sensing\nThe ﬁrst step involves using CH nodes (i.e., SUs) to sense the\
    \ transmission channel,\nto decide whether it is currently available or busy by\
    \ a PU. Energy detection methods\nare commonly used for this purpose, especially\
    \ when the transmission modes of PUs\nare unknown. Assuming that yl represents\
    \ the PU’s signal at a speciﬁc location, and nl\nrepresents Gaussian white noise\
    \ with a mean of zero and a variance of σ2\nn for all l, the\nCH’s measurement\
    \ can be denoted as El. For each CH, a spectrum sensing function is\ndeﬁned by\
    \ establishing two hypotheses according to the measurement. In this mathematical\n\
    expression, the hypothesis checking for the channel sensing problem is performed\
    \ over M\nsymbol periods and can be expressed as follows [9]:\nH0 : El = nl\n\
    l = 1, 2, 3 . . . ..M\n(1)\nH1 : El = yl + nl\nl = 1, 2, 3 . . . ..M\n(2)\nAgriculture\

    \ while in Equation (2), H1 means\nthat the PU is present and using the channel.\
    \ The M received signal sample points are\ngathered by cognitive nodes (CH), allowing\
    \ for the detection statistics for energy detection\nto be expressed in the following\
    \ manner:\nE = 1\nM\nM\n∑\nl=1\n|zl|2\n(3)\nIf we assume that |El|2 with l = 1,\
    \ . . . .., M is composed of independently and identi-\ncally distributed random\
    \ variables, to verify the mean E for large values of M, we can use\nthe central\
    \ limit theorem. This is demonstrated in [26] as:\nE{Z} =\n\x1Aσ2\nn,\nunder H0\n\
    σ2\ns + σ2\nn,\nunder H1\n(4)\nwhere σ2\ns represents the PU’s signal variance.\
    \ It should be emphasized that the reliability\nof spectrum sensing is evaluated\
    \ using two metrics: the ﬁrst metric is the probability of\ndetection Pd, which\
    \ refers to the probability of an SU detecting the presence of a PU when\nthe\
    \ spectrum is actually used by the PU. The second metric is the false alarm probability\n\
    Pf , which represents the probability of an SU detecting the presence of a PU\
    \ when the\nchannel is free [9]. For instance, if H0 is the true hypothesis, then\
    \ P\n\b ˆH1\n\f\fH0\n\t\nindicates the\nprobability of a false alarm.\n4. The\
    \ Proposed Resource Allocation\nConcerning CR-WSNs, our attention is directed\
    \ to both energy consumption and SU\naverage capacity, which depends on its resource\
    \ allocation scenario done by CH nodes.\nThis paper proposes a resource allocation\
    \ algorithm that maximizes the average capacity,\ntaking into account both power\
    \ constraint and interference constraint [28]. Therefore, the\nenergy consumption\
    \ and ICI optimization are strongly interconnected with each other in\nthis case,\
    \ making it difﬁcult to solve it in general. To solve this issue, the successive\
    \ convex\noptimization technique presented in [29] is applied.\nWe consider CR-WSNs\
    \ with spectrum sharing between PUs and SUs as illustrated\nin Figure 2, with\
    \ the allocation of the PU (labelled “1”) and spectrum holes (denoted by\n“0”)\
    \ with cluster number Nc = 48 and FU = 18 subcarriers in each hole. We have utilized\n\
    the unambiguous interference formulas of OFDM, which previously obtained in [30]\
    \ and\nselected the cluster number and size based on the realistic values of WiMAX\
    \ 802.16.\n \nby establishing two hypotheses according to the measurement. In\

    \ the presence of a PU when the \nchannel is free [9]. For instance, if \U0001D43B\

    \ CR-WSNs, our attention is directed to both energy consumption and SU \naverage\
    \ capacity, which depends on its resource allocation scenario done by CH nodes.\
    \ \nThis paper proposes a resource allocation algorithm that maximizes the average\
    \ capacity, \ntaking into account both power constraint and interference constraint\
    \ [28]. Therefore, the \nenergy consumption and ICI optimization are strongly\
    \ interconnected with each other in \nthis case, making it difficult to solve\
    \ it in general. To solve this issue, the successive convex \noptimization technique\
    \ presented in [29] is applied. \nWe consider CR-WSNs with spectrum sharing between\
    \ PUs and SUs as illustrated in \nFigure 2, with the allocation of the PU (labelled\
    \ “1”) and spectrum holes (denoted by “0”) \nwith cluster number \U0001D441௖ =\
    \ 48 and \U0001D439௎ = 18 subcarriers in each hole. We have utilized the \nunambiguous\
    \ interference formulas of OFDM, which previously obtained in [30] and se-\nlected\
    \ the cluster number and size based on the realistic values of WiMAX 802.16. \
    \ \n \nFigure 2. Allocation of primary users and available subcarriers considering\
    \ 18 subcarriers allocated \nto each free sub-band. \nFigure 2. Allocation of\
    \ primary users and available subcarriers considering 18 subcarriers allocated\n\
    to each free sub-band.\nOne or more interferences can exist within a single spectrum\
    \ hole, as illustrated in\nFigure 2, where PUs and SUs utilize neighboring frequency\
    \ bands. We assume that the\nICI exists from the PU to the CH due to frequency\
    \ offset. Based on the OFDM ICI tables\nobtained in [31], it was observed that\
    \ “8” subcarriers (OFDM) induce the ICI to the channel.\nIn cases where a sequence\
    \ of intricate symbols is transmitted, the interference caused by\nAgriculture\

  explanation: 'The study focuses on autonomous planning and scheduling of variable
    rate irrigation (VRI) using machine learning and optimization techniques. The
    specific point in the literature review where this paper contributes is in the
    section on "Data Collection to Cloud: Automation and Real-Time Processing:"


    The paragraph within this section focuses on the challenges of real-time data
    transmission in IoT-based irrigation systems. By providing a concise summary of
    the key research findings and methods used in the paper, other researchers in
    the field can quickly grasp the paper''s relevance to their own work and decide
    whether to explore it further.


    Extract 1 summarizes the research methods and key findings, while Extract 2 provides
    some specific details about the machine learning models and their performance.


    Here is an improved explanation:


    The study aims to investigate how machine learning and optimization techniques
    can be applied to automate VRI scheduling in irrigation systems. This research
    is particularly relevant to the section of the literature review that discusses
    the challenges of real-time data transmission in IoT-based irrigation systems.


    The paper proposes using a hybrid deep learning model that combines LSTM (Long
    Short-Term Memory) and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithms to forecast
    irrigation water requirements (IWR). The model takes into account various parameters
    such as maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation,
    root depth, soil evaporation, and soil wetted fraction.


    The proposed model is evaluated using real-world data and compared with other
    machine learning models. The results show that the hybrid LSTM-CNN model outperforms
    other models in terms of accuracy and efficiency.


    In summary, the research provides a novel approach to automating VRI scheduling
    using machine learning and optimization techniques and is highly relevant to the
    section of the literature review that focuses on real-time data transmission challenges
    in IoT-based irrigation systems.'
  extract_1: '"In addition to what machine learning programs provide an estimate of
    ETo values for the previous and current agricultural seasons, it gives the possibility
    to predict the ETo values for the upcoming seasons using the so-called deep learning
    models, which are restricted to knowing the expected changes in temperature and
    the amount of precipitation related to global warming, from which it can be make
    good planning and management of irrigation water for the coming years with an
    attempt to correct the existing strategies to avoid the negative effects of global
    warming (Ferreira and da Cunha 2020a, b)."'
  extract_2: To the best of authors’ knowledge, the applied approaches are applying
    for first time for forecasting of IWR, further, no research has been published
    in the literature that analyses irrigation water requirement using a combination
    of climate data, soil data and crop data based novel artificial intelligence approaches
    applied. Thus, to overcome the gap in literature dealing with the importance of
    IWR prediction, the main objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate the potential
    of machine and deep learning models in forecasting IWR of snap beans, 2) develop
    multi-scenarios of the inputs variables (combinations) to study the impact of
    meteorological, crop and soil parameters on IWR and, 3) figure out the best scenario
    with best model performance in IWR prediction.

    \ \nthe focal aims of the investigation are to assess the potential of machine\

    \ and Hybrid CNN-LSTM. Ten variables including maximum and \nminimum temperature,\
    \ Relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, root depth, basal crop \ncoefficient,\
    \ soil evaporation, a fraction of surface wetted and, exposed and soil wetted\
    \ frac-\ntion were used as the input data for models with their combination, 8\
    \ input scenarios were \ndesigned. Overall models, the best scenario was scenario\
    \ 4 (relative humidity, wind speed, \nbasal crop coefficient, soil evaporation),\
    \ however, the best scenario for DNN and RF model \nwas scenario 7 (root depth,\
    \ basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, fraction of surface wet-\nted, exposed\
    \ and soil wetted fraction). While the weakest one was the group of climatic \n\
    factors in scenario 6 (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ \nwind speed, and precipitation). Among the models, the hybrid LTSM & CNN was\
    \ the \nmost accurate and the SVR model had the lowest estimation accuracy. The\
    \ outcomes of \nthis research work could set up a modeling strategy that would\
    \ set in motion the improve-\nment of efforts to identify the shortages in IWR\

    Published online: 10 March 2023\n1 3\n1 Introduction\nThe widespread climatic\
    \ changes in the twenty-first century and the negative impacts that \nfollow on\
    \ the available water resources have become one of the most important issues that\
    \ \ncast their shadows on the focus of contemporary environmental events and issues\
    \ (Smith \net al. 2012; UNEP 1999). The irrigated agriculture sector represents\
    \ the largest consumer \nof water in Egypt, representing 85% of the total water\
    \ share available to Egypt, which rep-\nresents 55.5 billion cubic meters. In\
    \ addition, the biggest problem is that most of the irri-\ngated lands apply surface\
    \ irrigation systems where the efficiency of application and dis-\ntribution of\
    \ water do not exceed 50%, which represents the biggest challenge that must be\
    \ \nfaced to reduce water losses (Monem 2021). Irrigated agriculture covers about\
    \ 25% of the \ncultivated area in the world, yet it contributes 50% of the global\
    \ food basket. Despite the \nincrease in production with irrigated agriculture,\
    \ it consumes 67% of the water in agricul-\ntural production and 87% of the water\
    \ is consumed in the irrigation sector (Smith et al. \n2012; Shiklomanov 1997).\
    \ The availability of food is the main element for the survival of \nthe human\
    \ race, although it faces many challenges, the main cause of which is humans,\
    \ \nperhaps the most prominent of which are the rapid population growth and climatic\
    \ changes \nresulting from global warming that affect the hydrological cycle (Bellido-Jiménez\
    \ et al. \n2021). Therefore, irrigation scheduling, which is determining the amount\
    \ of irrigation \nwater added and the time of its addition during the growing\
    \ season of the crop, is one of \nthe things that must be taken into account under\
    \ conditions of water scarcity (Kalboussi \net al. 2019).\nThere are many methods\
    \ used for irrigation scheduling, including visual and thermal \nmonitoring, soil\
    \ moisture content measuring devices, rainfall estimation devices, and refer-\n\
    ence evapotranspiration estimation, from which it is possible to estimate the\
    \ crop evapo-\ntranspiration by knowing the crop coefficient, through available\
    \ climatic data on local basis \nor through commercial scheduling programs available\
    \ through the international informa-\ntion network (Zhang et al. 2013). The actual\
    \ crop evapotranspiration (ETa) is considered \none of the main criteria for estimating\
    \ the amount of water consumed by the crop, and \nthus greatly affects the hydrological,\
    \ environmental and agricultural management, and then \nthe ETa is one of the\
    \ basic elements when designing and managing irrigation networks in \nthe agricultural\
    \ project. ETa is estimated through field measurements using lysimeters or \n\
    through empirical equations by estimating the reference evapotranspiration (ETo)\
    \ and the \ncrop coefficient (Djaman et al. 2018). The water balance method for\
    \ irrigation schedul-\ning includes estimating of the crop water consumption during\
    \ the growing season, which \nincludes the amount of water added, whether through\
    \ irrigation, precipitation and capil-\nlary rise, which subtracts the amount\
    \ of water losses, whether by evaporation from the soil \nsurface, deep percolation\
    \ the rootzone area, and runoff (Andales et al. 2014; Karam et al. \n2019a, b).\n\
    The estimation of ETo is one of the most important indicators used in irrigation\
    \ water \nmanagement and hydrological studies, and despite the difficult requirements\
    \ of the empiri-\ncal equations of ETo, it gives accurate values in addition to\
    \ its validity on various climatic \nconditions, which are the main indicators\
    \ in the empirical equations (Ferreira and da Cunha \n2020a, b; Pereira et al.\
    \ 2015a, b). In light of the limited climatic parameters available for \nestimating\
    \ ETo, fast and accurate methods that require least number of meteorological indi-\n\
    cators are considered among the most important requirements for irrigation water\
    \ schedul-\ning (Fan et al. 2021). The Penman–Monteith equation is the standard\
    \ equation for calculat-\ning ETo and is recommended by the United Nations Agriculture\
    \ and Food Organization. \n1558\nA. Mokhtar et al.\n1 3\nThe Penman Monteith equation\
    \ requires many daily meteorological parameters to calculate \nsuch as maximum\
    \ and minimum temperature, wind speed, net solar radiation, and rela-\ntive humidity.\
    \ However, under the conditions of limited climatic parameters available in \n\
    the study area, which requires the availability of methods that require less climatic\
    \ data, \nwhile maintaining the accuracy of the calculated values of ETo in the\
    \ same range to a large \nextent (Fan et al. 2019). The application of the Penman\
    \ Monteith equation faces many dif-\nficulties, especially in developing countries,\
    \ which face many challenges represented in the \nlimited monitoring stations\
    \ and their lack of regular distribution in each country, where the \nfocus is\
    \ in the areas of spread of irrigated agricultural areas in addition to the lack\
    \ of ability \nto measure all the climatic criteria required to apply the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation with \nthe required accuracy (Fan et al. 2021).\nRecently used computer\
    \ software’s models have shown high accuracy in estimating and \nforecasting ETo,\
    \ e.g. Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Fan et al. 2019). In recent years, \nthe\
    \ use of machine learning programs for ETo estimation has spread with making rela-\n\
    tionships between the inputs and outputs used in ETo estimation, which are mainly\
    \ mete-\norological data, which gives higher accuracy and power to apply machine\
    \ learning pro-\ngrams in ETo modeling (Ferreira and Cunha 2020a, b; Kumar et al.\
    \ 2011). The use of both \nRandom Forest (RF) and Generalized Regression Neural\
    \ Network (GRNN) to predict ETo \nproved highly accurate under local conditions\
    \ and across-stations applications, but RF was \nbetter than GRNN (Feng et al.\
    \ 2017). The common method of predicting ETo values using \nmachine learning models\
    \ is based on the use of former ETo values as input data (Ashrafza-\ndeh et al.\
    \ 2020; Landeras et al. 2009; Trajkovic et al. 2003). In addition, the use of\
    \ former \ndaily meteorological data used to estimate ETo through the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation in \naddition to the lagged ETo values greatly enhances the performance\
    \ of machine learning \nmodels and the accuracy of the forecasting ETo.\nIn addition\
    \ to what machine learning programs provide an estimate of ETo values for \nthe\
    \ previous and current agricultural seasons, it gives the possibility to predict\
    \ the ETo \nvalues for the upcoming seasons using the so-called deep learning\
    \ models, which are \nrestricted to knowing the expected changes in temperature\
    \ and the amount of precipitation \nrelated to global warming, from which it can\
    \ be make good planning and management of \nirrigation water for the coming years\
    \ with an attempt to correct the existing strategies to \navoid the negative effects\
    \ of global warming (Ferreira and da Cunha 2020a, b). By increas-\ning the forecast\
    \ period from 1 to 30 days, the accuracy of the resulting data decreases (Fer-\n\
    reira and da Cunha 2020a, b). Several deep learning models have been used to forecasting\
    \ \ntime series, including long short-term memory (LSTM) (Son and Kim 2020; Tian\
    \ et al. \n2018; Zhou et  al. 2019), and a one-dimensional convolutional neural\
    \ network can (1D \nCNN) (Barzegar et al. 2020). In addition to the above, Barzegar\
    \ et al. (2020) and Kim \net al. (2019) create hybrid software from both LSTM\
    \ and 1D CNN. Although deep learn-\ning programs have proven outstanding performance\
    \ in many fields, their use in the field of \nclimatic and hydrological studies\
    \ is still limited.\nTherefore, this paper aims to participate in saving water\
    \ tasks by forecasting irriga-\ntion water requirement (IWR) for green bean by\
    \ an on-field scale experiment, where there \nwasn’t common literature about modeling\
    \ of irrigation water requirement forecasting in \nversus of ETo estimation studies.\
    \ Moreover, the irrigation water requirements forecasting \ncould make irrigation\
    \ scheduling improved, and so give better solutions for decision mak-\ners. This\
    \ research is based on determining the most important criteria required to forecast\
    \ \nIWR of green bean to achieve the best irrigation scheduling in light of the\
    \ challenges of \nclimatic changes and water scarcity using six models (SVR, RF,\
    \ DNN, CNN, LSTM and \nCNN-LSTM) to forecast IWR. To the best of authors’ knowledge,\

    \ research has been published \nin the literature that analyses irrigation water\

    \ novel artificial intelligence approaches applied. Thus, \nto overcome the gap\
    \ in literature dealing with the importance of IWR prediction, the main \nobjectives\
    \ of this study are to 1) evaluate the potential of machine and deep learning\
    \ mod-\nels in forecasting IWR of snap beans, 2) develop multi-scenarios of the\
    \ inputs variables \n(combinations) to study the impact of meteorological, crop\
    \ and soil parameters on IWR \nand, 3) figure out the best scenario with best\
    \ model performance in IWR prediction.\n2  Materials and Methods\nThe workflow\
    \ of this study is showing in Fig. 1. The first phase of the workflow involves\
    \ \nthe climate, soil and crops data collection and the calculation of the IWR\
    \ during two sea-\nsons. Within the second phase, we applied five machine learning\
    \ models (SVR, RF, DNN, \nLSTM and CNN) and hybrid between LSTM and CNN to predict\
    \ the IWR based on 8 Sce-\nnarios (combinations of climate, soil and crop data).\n\
    2.1  Climate Conditions\nThe climatic variables (maximum air temperature, minimum\
    \ temperature of air, the aver-\nage air temperature, air relative humidity, and\
    \ the number of hours of sunshine) were daily \nrecorded during both growing seasons.\
    \ The maximum air temperature ranged during the \ngrowing season (October to December)\
    \ between 19–30 °C, while minimum air tempera-\ntures ranged from 11 to 21 °C\
    \ during growing season. The total rainfall was negligible \nFig. 1  Flowchart\

    2.2  Machine Learning Implementations\n2.2.1  Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nSVM\
    \ is a supervised learning algorithm, and it can also be used as a regression\
    \ model, \nmaintain all the main features that describe the algorithm (maximal\
    \ margin). SVR uses \na similar theory as SVM for classification method, with\
    \ a few slightly changes. The main \naim is minimizing error, individualizing\
    \ the hyperplane that increases the tolerance limit, \ntaking in consideration\
    \ that the part of error is tolerated. The approximated function in the \nalgorithm\
    \ of SVM is cleared as follows:\nwhere φ (x) is feature space of higher-dimensional\
    \ converted from the input vector x, ω is \nthe weights vector and b are a threshold,\
    \ which were estimated by minimizing the follow-\ning regularized risk function:\n\
    where C is the penalty parameter of the error,  di is the desired value, n is\
    \ observations \nnumber, and C 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\nL(di, yi) is the empirical error,\
    \ in which the function  Lε is determined \nas:\nwhere 0.5 Ѡ2 is the so-called\
    \ regularization term and ɛ is the tube size. The approximated \nfunction in Eq. (1)\
    \ is finally expressed in an explicit form by introducing Lagrange multi-\npliers\
    \ and exploiting the optimality constraints as:\n(1)\nf(휒) = 휔휑(휒) + b\n(2)\n\

    \ Forest (RF)\nThe RF model was developed by Breiman (2001) and used Breiman’s\
    \ “bagging” idea to \nensemble a collection of decision trees with controlled\
    \ variance. The RF model is com-\nmonly used for regression and predicting problems.\
    \ More detailed information can be \nfound at (Ferreira and da Cunha 2020a, b;\

    \ model has become a fundamental but recently still powerful \ndeep learning model\
    \ (Achieng 2019; Montes-Atenas et al. 2016). The DNN is an artifi-\ncial neural\
    \ network (Springmann et al. 2018) with multiple layers between the inputs, hid-\n\
    den layers and output layers to learn more complex nonlinear relationships between\
    \ inputs \nand output. The rectified linear unit (ReLu) was applied as activation\
    \ function which is \ncommonly employed (Ghimire et al. 2019; Achieng 2019).\n\
    The loss function in the DNN model is expressed as:\nwhere n is the number of\
    \ observation data, and T\n′ is the estimated value by the DNN \nmodel, which\
    \ can be defined below for a three-hidden-layer DNN model with the ReLu \nactivation\
    \ function:\nwhere ω1, ω2, ω3 and ω4 are the weights in the network,  b1,  b2,\
    \  b3 and  b4 are the bias \nterms.\n2.2.4  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n\
    CNN consists of a sequence of convolutional layers, the output of which is connected\
    \ only \nto local regions in the input. This is achieved by sliding a filter,\
    \ or weight matrix, over \nthe input and at each point computing the dot product\
    \ between the two (i.e., a convolu-\ntion between the input and filter). This\
    \ structure allows the model to learn filters that are \nable to recognize specific\
    \ patterns in the input data. Recent advances in CNNs for time \nseries forecasting\
    \ include (Mittelman 2015). Zuo et al. (2019) stated that the architecture \n\
    of a typical CNN consists of a convolutional layer pooling layer, and fully connected\
    \ layer. \nFinally, these abstract features are merged through the fully connected\
    \ layer, and an activa-\ntion function is used to solve the classification or\
    \ regression problem (Fig. 2).\n(4)\nf(x, 훼i, 훼∗\ni ) =\nn\n∑\ni=1\n(훼i − 훼∗\n\

    LSTM network contains different memory blocks which are linked through layers.\
    \ Each \nlayer includes a set of frequently connected memory pixels and three\
    \ multiplicative units, \nnamely the input, forget and output gates. LSTM has\
    \ the ability to automatically store and \nremove temporal state information.\n\
    2.2.6  Hybrid LSTM and CNN\nLSTM and CNN were trained with the same input, and\
    \ they were hybrid to forecast results, \nthe proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model uses\
    \ CNN layers for feature extraction from the input \ndata with LSTM layers for\
    \ sequence learning. The CNN and the LSTM are the most com-\nmonly used deep learning\
    \ models. Our main aim in designing the hybrid model of CNN and \nLSTM layers\
    \ is to exploit their characteristics for developing an efficient model for forecasting.\

    \ and NSE (Table 3).\nThere are noticeable differences between the models, but\
    \ also some similarities in rela-\ntion to individual scenarios. The performance\
    \ of the models is more favorable when the \nRMSE and MBE are closer to zero,\
    \ and NSE are closer to 1. In all models, the NSE values \nare higher than 0.75,\
    \ which shows that the models are well performed in IWR estimation. \nThe best\
    \ estimation of the models are mostly presented by the S4 scenario and after that\
    \ S7. \nThe weakest accuracy was obtained by SVR model with MBE = 0.007, RMSE\
    \ = 0.077 mm \nand NSE = 0.850, under the S4 input scenario. The most accurate\
    \ estimation was \nresulted by DNN model under S7 scenario, with MBE = -0.001,\
    \ RMSE = 0.055 mm and \nNSE = 0.824. In order to examine the correlation between\
    \ the actual and predicted IWR \nvalues, scatter plots were developed (Fig. 3).\n\
    The analysis showed that in the S1 scenario, the highest correlation was obtained\
    \ for \nthe LSTM and CNN models  (R2 = 0.9421,  R2 = 0.9119, respectively, the\
    \ lowest for SVR. \nS1 scenario takes into account air temperature (Tmax and Tmin)\

    \ scenario S2, where in addition to S1, \nrelative humidity (RH), the strongest\
    \ correlation between real and predicted IWR was also \nshown for the LSTM model\
    \  (R2 = 0.83225), and the weakest for SVR  (R2 = 0.6369). In the \nS3 scenario\
    \ (4 parameters: temperature, wind speed and Kcb), the best correlation between\
    \ \nactual and predicted IWR values  was determined for the LSTM & CNN hybrid\
    \ model \n (R2 = 0.7618). This is a relatively low correlation, which indicates\

    \ \nfrom the time series. Model accuracy (A) is defined as the percentage of correct\
    \ predic-\ntions for the test data, it denotes the degree of compliance of the\
    \ actual value with the \narithmetic mean of the results (predicted value) obtained\
    \ for the marked scenario and pre-\ndiction model. For accuracy, results above\
    \ 80% are considered good. In some scenarios and \nmodels, the obtained values\
    \  were higher than 1, which means that the prediction results in \nthese variants\
    \ may be burdened with a random error, which can be considered a random \nerror,\
    \ i.e., a type of measurement error that does not result from systematic and repeatable\
    \ \nfactors.\nIn the case of the CNN and DNN models in particular, overestimated\
    \ A values  were \nobtained, which may be related to a random error. For the S1-S4,\
    \ the best accuracy was \ndemonstrated by the SVR model. For the S5 forecast,\
    \ the LTSM model was the most accu-\nrate, while for the other S6-S7 forecasts,\

    \ is classified when 0.00 ≤ RSR ≤ 0.50, while unsatisfac-\ntory when RSR > 0.70.\
    \ The analyzes show that the lowest RSR values  (≤ 0.50), covering \nvery good\
    \ ranges of classification, were achieved by all models for the S4 scenario (Input:\
    \ \nRH, WS, Kcb, Ke in Table 2), and then by four models: LTSM, CNN, DNN and RF\
    \ for the \nS1 scenario (Fig. 4).\nThe LTSM, LTSM & CNN and DNN models additionally\
    \ achieved high perfor-\nmance in the S7 scenario, and the CNN and DNN models\
    \ also in the S2 scenario. \nThe SVR model was the only one that achieved very\
    \ good quality in only one S4 \nscenario. The SVR model was the only one that\
    \ achieved very good quality in only \none S4 scenario. In most models, the lowest\
    \ RSR was achieved in those scenarios \nwhere the lowest values  also reached\
    \ the RMSE criterion (Table 3), which proves that \nthe scenarios seem to be the\
    \ most optimal for IWR prediction. Unsatisfactory results \nwere achieved in those\
    \ scenarios where the RSR criterion > 0.70. The most common \nscenarios are: S3\
    \ (Input: Tmax, Tmin, WS, Kcb), S5 (Input: RH, WS) and S6 (Input: \nTmax, Tmin,\
    \ RH, WS, P), thus mostly scenarios that include climatic parameters as \ninput\
    \ to the model (Fig. 4). In the next stage (Fig. 5), radar charts were developed\
    \ to \ncompare the models in each scenario based on the SI criterion.\nThe SI\
    \ values  obtained for the models in various S1-S8 scenarios. According to \n\
    the value of the SI criteria, the performance of models can be divided into several\
    \ \nlevels. In the discussed case, the SI < 0.1 was not obtained, which would\
    \ classify the \nmodels as \"excellent\". Good (if 0.1 < SI < 0.2) and satisfactory\
    \ (if 0.2 < SI < 0.3) per-\nformance of most models was obtained for the S8 scenario,\
    \ which takes into account \nall the inputs: climate, vegetation characteristics\
    \ and soil data, and for the scenarios: \nS4 (takes into account 4 components\
    \ RH, WS, Kcb and Ke) and the S7 scenario \n(Root depth, Kcb, Ke, Fw and Few).\
    \ Satisfactory performance was achieved by the \nmodels in the S1 scenario, which\
    \ takes into account temperature data, Kcb and Ke, \nand in the S5 scenario, which\
    \ includes only two outputs, namely RH and WS. Poor \nperformance was achieved\
    \ by the SVR model for the S2 and S3 scenarios, and the \nRF and CNN models for\
    \ the S6 scenario, which takes into account only climatic \ndata. The models in\
    \ the S6 scenario show the least satisfactory performance (Fig. 5).\nThe LTSM\
    \ model, according to the Scatter index, achieved the best performance for S4\
    \ \nand the weakest for S6, the LTSM & CNN hybrid model for S4 and S1 / S6 respectively,\
    \ \nthe CNN model for S1 / S4 and S6 respectively, the DNN model for S4 / S7 and\
    \ S5, the \nSVR model for S4 and S3, while the RF model for the S7 and S6 scenarios.\
    \ Figure 5 shows \nthat, apart from the distinguished single cases related to\
    \ specific scenarios, the prediction \naccuracy in most of the developed models\
    \ regarding the SI value was good (0.1 < SI < 0.2) \nand satisfactory (0.2 < SI\
    \ < 0.3). Figure 6 shows the MAE values  for 6 different models for \n2 options:\
    \ under and over estimation.\nThe MAE is a measure of performance (model quality)\
    \ used to evaluate the perfor-\nmance of a model after finalization. Investigating\
    \ the models under and over estimations, \ni.e., the study of underestimating\
    \ and overestimating model estimates was carried out \nusing mean absolute error\
    \ (MAE). In the context of machine learning, absolute error refers \nto the magnitude\
    \ of the difference between the prediction of an observation and the true \nvalue\
    \ of that observation. The values  on two different data sets indicate that MAE\
    \ values  \nin under estimation in almost all models were higher than after Over\
    \ estimation, except \nfor the RF model, where higher MAE was achieved in over\
    \ estimation. The RF approach \nis another widely used decision tree method (Cavallo\
    \ et al. 2017; García Nieto et al. 2017, \n2018) which, using the classification\
    \ and regression tree procedure, combined with ran-\ndom node optimization and\
    \ packing (Breiman 2001) builds a forest of uncorrelated trees. \n1570\nA. Mokhtar\

    \   also has a greater impact on RF decision \nmaking, which affects goodness\
    \ of fit (Naghibi et al. 2017). The MAE values  decrease \nsignificantly after\
    \ over estimation in the case of the following models: LTSM, LTSM & \nCNN, CNN\
    \ and SVR) (they are within 0.05). This proves that over estimation can reduce\
    \ \nthe MAE values  for most tested models. The smallest MAE differences between\

    \ while the largest in \nthe SVR model. The use of the LTSM & CNN hybrid model\
    \ reduced the MAE between \nthe two options Under and over estimation.\n4  Discussion\n\
    The assessment of the amount of irrigation for individual types of crops requires\
    \ the analy-\nsis of a large number of parameters, which are often difficult to\
    \ obtain through direct meas-\nurement and observation are often considered burdensome\
    \ and costly for farmers. Hardly \nany country has a good system for measuring\
    \ and recording the total water consumption of \ncrops, and more than 40% of crops\
    \ are grown under irrigation conditions. Hence, in order \nto assess the future\
    \ situation in terms of obtaining high yields and maintaining ration-\nalization\
    \ in water abstraction for crops, it is necessary to model irrigation water require-\n\
    ments (Pulido-Calvo and Gutierrez-Estrada 2009; Döll and Siebert 2002). Modeling\
    \ of the \nirrigation water needs as a function of the irrigated area, climatic\
    \ conditions and type of \ncrops has a broader context, providing the basis for\
    \ estimating the future impact of climate \nchange, as well as demographic, socio-economic\
    \ and technological changes.\nFig. 6  Investigating the models’ under and over\
    \ estimations\n1572\nA. Mokhtar et al.\n1 3\nIn this study, various machine learning\
    \ models (SVM, RF, DNN, CNN, LSTM and \nhybrid LSTM & CNN) are investigated to\
    \ predict the IWR indispensable for the green bean \ncrops in Egypt. Importantly,\
    \ it presents the adaptation of typical deep neural network mod-\nels, which include\
    \ the DNN model and the convolutional neural network, long short-term \nmemory\
    \ network, and finally a combination of some of their variants. An important ele-\n\
    ment in the study was the selection of the scenario and model that obtains the\
    \ best perfor-\nmance for the conditions declared in the scenario. Indication\
    \ of the best predictive model \nfor IWR, with the given input data for modeling,\
    \ is of great importance for the selected \nresearch area that experiences extreme\
    \ droughts and the related needs for intensive irriga-\ntion of crops. Mokhtar\
    \ et al. (2021a, b) emphasizes that the droughts in the research area \nin 2015–2019\
    \ covered even 80–90% of the area, and 30% in 2010–2019 were affected by \nextreme\
    \ and very extreme droughts.\nThe reason for water shortages in the root zone\
    \ is primarily water consumption by \ncrops and evapotranspiration, while rainfall\
    \ and irrigation ensure water supply (Andales \net al. 2011; 2014; Karam et al.\
    \ 2019a, b). However, it should be emphasized that the actual \nevapotranspiration\
    \ of green bean crops, one of the dominant components in the water bal-\nance,\
    \ significantly reduces the size of its harvest, which on the other hand, with\
    \ increas-\ning evaporation, will require increased irrigation of the area. Due\
    \ to the complexity of the \nevapotranspiration process, it is most often estimated\
    \ on the basis of meteorological data \n(Pereira et al. 2015a, b; Ferreira and\
    \ Cunha 2020a, b). However, in this case, monitoring of \nall parameters is often\
    \ insufficient (El Bilali and Taleb 2020).\nIn the performed IWR prediction for\
    \ green bean crops in Egypt, the accurate predic-\ntion of IWR was largely dependent\
    \ on the number of input variables and their impact on \nthe modeling results\
    \ under certain scenario variants. According to Krupakar et al. (2016), \nthe\
    \ sources of parameters influencing the irrigation process tend to differ depending\
    \ on the \narea where agriculture is grown. In addition, there are new characteristics\
    \ that we obtain \nthanks to new technologies for terrestrial and satellite measurements.\
    \ The sources that \nmake irrigation water demand prediction possible can be broadly\
    \ categorized into meteoro-\nlogical factors, crop input and agricultural parameters.\
    \ Meteorological factors are impor-\ntant in determining the irrigation water\
    \ needs of crops as rain is the main source of water in \nsome areas (e.g., India).\
    \ Wind speed also affects the amount of irrigation needed, although \nnot as much\
    \ as the temperature (O’Toole and Hatfield 1983; Schlenker and Roberts 2009; \n\
    Krupakar et al. 2016).\nIn the presented work, the climate data was adapted to\
    \ the S6 scenario (Table 2), which \ntook into account the following parameters:\
    \ maximum and minimum temperature, rela-\ntive humidity, wind speed and precipitation.\
    \ In the case of having information only from \nthe group of climatic factors\
    \ (treated as input data), taking into account the S6 scenario, \nthe best prediction\
    \ was shown by the CNN model  (R2 = 0.8275), and the weakest SVR \n (R2 = 0.3).\n\
    One of the most important criteria for determining irrigation needs is soil type,\
    \ and dif-\nferences are seen when the amount of water required for different\
    \ crops on different soil \ntypes is compared. The models take into account factors\
    \ including the type of crop itself \n(Tolk et al. 1999) or other crop area factors\
    \ that change over time and affect the water \nrequirements of plants (Allen 2000).\
    \ According to Krupakar et al. (2016) the RNN model \nis robust enough to map\
    \ the differences in observations that occur due to various factors \nsuch as\
    \ global warming, faulty hardware, etc. In the presented study, if only data on\
    \ crops \nand soils were considered as predictors: root depth, basal crop coefficient,\
    \ soil evaporation, \nfraction of surface wetted and exposed and soil wetted fraction,\
    \ in the absence of climate \n1573\nPrediction of Irrigation Water Requirements\
    \ for Green…\n1 3\ndata, as presented in the S7 scenario, the best results were\
    \ obtained for a hybrid model \n(LSTM & CNN) and separately for LSTM and CNN.\n\
    The box plot was developed to show the error distribution in the test section\
    \ (Fig. 7). \nFor IWR prediction, the best models turned out to be LSTM, CNN,\
    \ LSTM & CNN and \nSVR for the S4, which takes into account the RH, WS, Kcb and\
    \ Ke parameters, and the \nDNN and RF models for the S7 scenario, which includes\
    \ root depth, Kcb, Ke, Fw and Few. \nIn the group with the S4, the LSTM and LSTM\
    \ & CNN models performed best because \nthey have the lowest values  of Q1, Q3\
    \ and IQR (Fig. 7), and the SVR model the worst. \nHowever, for the S7 scenario,\
    \ the DNN model turned out to be the best for IWR predic-\ntion. In the RF 7 model,\
    \ the lowest Q3 was obtained among the others, but the IQR was not \namong the\
    \ lowest and amounted to 0.09. The LSTM 4 and LSTM & CNN 4 have the same \nIQR\
    \ as the DNN 7 model and slightly lower compared to the RF 7 model (Fig. 7).\n\
    In all the models used, the error distribution is around zero, while the median\
    \ line shows \nthe normality of the error distribution, primarily for the LSTM\
    \ & CNN hybrid model S4. \nAdditionally, it should be noted that the models developed\
    \ for the S4 and S7 scenarios \nobtained the best results in the assessment at\
    \ the previous stage (Table 2). These scenarios \nare intermediate between the\
    \ use of all input variables (S8) and the smallest number of \ninput data represented\
    \ by the S5 scenario (RH and WS data).\nHowever, none of the models in the S6\
    \ scenario, which takes into account only climatic \ndata, was included in the\
    \ group of the best models distinguished on the basis of distribution \nof the\
    \ estimation errors of the IWR in the test section for the best model-scenarios\
    \ (Fig. 7). \nIn turn, research by Krupakar et al (2016) showed that ANNs models\
    \ perform well in predic-\ntion based on training but have a lower ability to\
    \ infer semantic meaning from the sequential \nflow. SVMs models are designed\
    \ to be tested on normal data, hence they cannot capture the \nessential sequential\
    \ information. According to Xie and Tang (2010), the factors influencing \nFig.\
    \ 7  Boxplots showing the distribution of the estimation errors of the IWR in\
    \ the test section for the best \nmodel-scenarios. Q1 and Q3 are lower and upper\

    A. Mokhtar et al.\n1 3\nthe amount of irrigation are complex and non-linear, and\
    \ the support vector machine (SVM) \nhas many advantages for non-linear small\
    \ samples. A forecasting model of irrigation water \nrequirement based on least\
    \ squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) was used in Tarim \nRiver Basin. These\
    \ authors demonstrated in their research that the prediction model based on \n\
    the LS-SVM has excellent generalizability and low error, which provides an efficient\
    \ method \nof forecasting irrigation water requirements (Xie and Tang 2010).\n\
    In turn, El Bilali and Taleb (2020), using correlation coefficients, showed the\
    \ inaccuracy \nof the SVR model in predicting the quality of irrigation water\
    \ for training and validation \nprocesses sequentially. Artificial neural network\
    \ (Springmann et  al. 2018), multiple linear \nregression (MLR), decision tree,\
    \ random forest (RF), stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and \nadaptive boosting\
    \ (AdaBoost) demonstrated good prediction accuracy. Krupakar et al. (2016) \n\
    emphasize that the models described for an irrigation prediction system are generally\
    \ devel-\noped and trained using a large amount of historical data (training data)\
    \ on objects or character-\nistics that influence the amount of water required\
    \ for irrigation. The new RNN LSTM model \nproposed by them can be used to obtain\
    \ better results, richer in semantic correlations found \nin the parameters used\
    \ in real-time data. When testing machine learning models in predicting \nirrigation\
    \ water, it is emphasized that they are efficient tools for accurately predicting\
    \ irriga-\ntion only using parameters that can be directly measured in a short\
    \ time. There have been \na lot of hybrid models that have been used for time\
    \ series prediction (Ruan 1997; Kavousi-\nFard 2013). Pulido-Calvo et al. (2003)\
    \ developed a hybrid model of combining CNNs with \nfuzzy membership function,\
    \ optimized by a genetic optimization algorithm to test the effi-\ncacy of irrigation\
    \ demand prediction, a Pulido-Calvo and Gutierrez-Estrada (2009) presented \n\
    improved irrigation water demand forecasting using a soft computing hybrid model.\n\
    For the prediction of irrigation for green bean crops in Egypt, the LSTM & CNN\
    \ hybrid \nmodel was proposed, which enhances the information potential for IWR\
    \ prediction. Deep \nlearning concerns multilayer neural networks, which simultaneously\
    \ act as a generator of \ndiagnostic features for the analyzed process and the\
    \ final function of a classifier or regres-\nsion system. It also makes it possible\
    \ to improve the accuracy of the system operation. The \nrecurrent network called\
    \ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a recursive network character-\nized by a long\
    \ memory of short patterns (Schmidhuber 2015; Greff et al. 2017). The levels of\
    \ \nthe LSTM and CNN models are often combined when forecasting time series. This\
    \ allows \nthe LSTM layer to account for sequential dependencies across time series,\
    \ while the CNN \nlayer additionally informs about this process through the use\
    \ of extended convolutions. Unlike \nLSTM, the CNN model does not keep memory\
    \ of previous time series patterns, and instead \ncan only train have based on\
    \ data entered over a specific period of time. Krupakar et al. (2016) \npropose\
    \ a novel methodology of using a sequence learning based recurrent neural network\
    \ \n(RNN) model that uses the LSTM activation function to model for irrigation\
    \ requirement so \nthat it doesn’t have memory problems on long input streams.\n\
    The IWR prediction results for Egyptian green bean crops, performed for different\
    \ scenario \nvariants, show the models’ ability to predict irrigation potential.\
    \ The proposed predictive irri-\ngation planning approach, compared to field studies,\
    \ makes it possible to reduce or prevent \nwater stress in crops. Predicting future\
    \ IWR values   from the results of predictive models can \nimprove the real-time\
    \ irrigation planning system depending on the meteorological situation \nand terrain\
    \ factors (plants, soil). Sustainable irrigation aims to adjust water availability\
    \ and \ndemand in terms of quantity and quality, space and time, at reasonable\
    \ cost and with accept-\nable environmental impacts, whereby forecasting water\
    \ demand is proving to be a valuable \nmanagement tool.\n1575\nPrediction of Irrigation\
    \ Water Requirements for Green…\n1 3\n5  Conclusions\nWater and food need crisis\
    \ is facing all over world, furthermore agriculture consume the larg-\nest amount\
    \ of water to cover plant requirement of water. Therefore, the current research\
    \ applies \nmachine models in order to predict the irrigation water requirement\
    \ for one of the most important \ncrops in Egypt (green bean) by actual field\
    \ experiment, which there weren’t common literature \nabout modeling of irrigation\
    \ requirement forecasting in versus ETo evaluation studies.\nThe main conclusions\
    \ were reported as follow; the scenario S4 (relative humidity, wind speed, \n\
    basal crop coefficient, the soil evaporation), is the best scenario for SVR, LSTM,\
    \ CNN and LSTM \n& CNN models, while the best scenario in DNN and RF model was\
    \ in scenario (S7) (root depth, \nbasal crop coefficient, the soil evaporation,\
    \ fraction of surface wetted, exposed and soil wetted \nfraction). The climatic\
    \ factors in scenario (S6) presented the highest  R2 for the CNN model and \n\
    the weakest result in the SVR model. Further, by taking into account only the\
    \ two predictors rela-\ntive humidity and wind speed, the performance of all models\
    \ ranged from very good to satisfac-\ntory fit for all models, while it was an\
    \ unsatisfactory fit for SVR.\nOn contrast, the hybrid LTSM & CNN model was the\
    \ best model for the IWR prediction. \nFinally, the models applied can improve\
    \ the irrigation planning with few available data. The cur-\nrent approach was\
    \ promising and has research value for other similar regions. Therefore, the future\
    \ \nwork will focus much more in predicting the irrigation water requirements\
    \ in other crops in other \nregions to draw a general picture of the predicting\
    \ of the irrigation water requirements in order to \nensure the water resources\
    \ management under the impact of the climate changes.\nAcknowledgements The authors\

  key_findings: The proposed hybrid LSTM-CNN model outperforms other machine learning
    models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in forecasting IWR. The best performing
    scenario for the model includes maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity,
    wind speed, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, fraction of surface wetted,
    and exposed and soil wetted fraction as input parameters.
  limitations: 'The paper does not explicitly mention any limitations, but some potential
    limitations include:


    * The model is trained and evaluated using data from a specific region, and its
    performance may not generalize well to other regions with different climatic conditions
    or soil types.

    * The model requires a significant amount of data for training, which may not
    be available in all cases.

    * The model may be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and it is important
    to tune the hyperparameters carefully to achieve optimal performance.'
  main_objective: The main objective of the study is to investigate the potential
    of machine learning and deep learning models in forecasting irrigation water requirements
    (IWR) of snap beans and to develop multi-scenarios of the input variables (combinations)
    to study the impact of meteorological, crop and soil parameters on IWR.

    Abstract: In the last few years, the Internet of Things, and other enabling technologies,\
    \ have been\nprogressively used for digitizing Food Supply Chains (FSC). These\
    \ and other digitalization-enabling\ntechnologies are generating a massive amount\
    \ of data with enormous potential to manage supply\nchains more efﬁciently and\
    \ sustainably. Nevertheless, the intricate patterns and complexity embedded\n\
    in large volumes of data present a challenge for systematic human expert analysis.\
    \ In such a data-\ndriven context, Computational Intelligence (CI) has achieved\
    \ signiﬁcant momentum to analyze, mine,\nand extract the underlying data information,\
    \ or solve complex optimization problems, striking a\nbalance between productive\
    \ efﬁciency and sustainability of food supply systems. Although some\nrecent studies\
    \ have sorted the CI literature in this ﬁeld, they are mainly oriented towards\
    \ a single\nfamily of CI methods (a group of methods that share common characteristics)\
    \ and review their\napplication in speciﬁc FSC stages. As such, there is a gap\
    \ in identifying and classifying FSC problems\nfrom a broader perspective, encompassing\
    \ the various families of CI methods that can be applied in\ndifferent stages\
    \ (from production to retailing) and identifying the problems that arise in these\
    \ stages\nfrom a CI perspective. This paper presents a new and comprehensive taxonomy\
    \ of FSC problems\n(associated with agriculture, ﬁsh farming, and livestock) from\
    \ a CI approach; that is, it deﬁnes FSC\nproblems (from production to retail)\
    \ and categorizes them based on how they can be modeled from\na CI point of view.\
    \ Furthermore, we review the CI approaches that are more commonly used in\neach\
    \ stage of the FSC and in their corresponding categories of problems. We also\
    \ introduce a set of\nguidelines to help FSC researchers and practitioners to\
    \ decide on suitable families of methods when\naddressing any particular problems\
    \ they might encounter. Finally, based on the proposed taxonomy,\nwe identify\
    \ and discuss challenges and research opportunities that the community should\
    \ explore to\nenhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization\
    \ of the FSC.\nKeywords: food supply chain; computational intelligence; fish farming;\
    \ agriculture; livestock; machine\nlearning; neural networks; deep learning; meta-heuristics;\
    \ fuzzy systems; probabilistic methods\n1. Introduction\nCurrently, one worldwide\
    \ challenge is how to sustainably guarantee global food needs\nin the face of\
    \ a growing population that is projected to be 9–10 billion by 2050 [1]. In this\n\
    sense, the enhancement of production and management of the current Food Supply\
    \ Chains\n(FSCs) is a crucial factor that contributes to accomplishing such an\

    \ the Internet of Things) play\nan active role in the digitization of FSCs [2].\

    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n2 of 34\nIntelligence (CI) seems to be a successful paradigm\
    \ to build intelligent systems that are\nable to leverage this high availability\
    \ of data. CI is the ability of a digital system or\nalgorithm to perform tasks\
    \ commonly associated with intelligent beings [3]. Within such\ntasks, we can\
    \ ﬁnd speech recognition, visual perception, decision-making, prediction, and\n\
    translation, among others [4]. Over the last few years, the number of academic\
    \ publications\nconcerning CI applied to FSC has rapidly increased [5–7]. Within\
    \ the most representative\nCI methods applied to FSCs, we ﬁnd Neural Networks,\
    \ Fuzzy Logic, Swarm Intelligence,\nor Probabilistic Reasoning.\nThe scientiﬁc\
    \ literature reports different studies that aim to review and order the\napplication\
    \ of CI methods in different FSC stages. The variety of CI methods has led to\
    \ the\nemergence of research papers (published between 2012 and 2020), which select\
    \ a partic-\nular family of CI techniques and review their application in speciﬁc\
    \ FSC stages [2,6–12].\nHowever, these papers focus on only one or two families\
    \ of CI methods at most, and in the\nmajority of cases, do not cover all FSC stages.\
    \ Therefore, there is a lack of comprehensive\nstudies that review the application\
    \ of the most important families of CI methods in all FSC\nstages (from production\
    \ to retail). Additionally, few efforts have been made to classify FSC\nproblems\
    \ from a CI perspective. Hence, there is no categorization of the typologies of\
    \ FSC\nproblems to help determine how they can be modeled from a CI view (e.g.,\
    \ optimization,\nuncertain knowledge handling, reasoning) and what CI methods\
    \ can be most suitably used\nto approach them. Thus, despite the progress made\
    \ in organizing and systematizing the\nexisting literature at the point where\
    \ CI and FSCs meet, to the best of our knowledge, no\ntaxonomy has been proposed\
    \ in this regard.\nWith the above-mentioned ideas in mind, we propose a novel\
    \ taxonomy of FSC\nproblems from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally, we focus on the\
    \ supply chain of agriculture,\nﬁsh farming, and livestock. The latter is justiﬁed\
    \ based on the fact that these supply chains\nprovide most of the food consumed\
    \ by the population of the world [13] and, therefore, they\nare the most studied\
    \ and researched FSCs in the scientiﬁc and academic literature. The\nmain contributions\
    \ of this article are:\n•\nA new taxonomy that provides a comprehensive view of\
    \ different FSC problems\nlocated in the chain stages typically studied in the\
    \ scientiﬁc literature (production,\nprocessing, distribution, and retail). This\
    \ taxonomy represents a new and broader\nproposal in order to identify and deﬁne\
    \ FSC problems that have been approached\nusing CI in the four aforementioned\
    \ stages. Besides, although some research articles\nhave described diverse FSC\
    \ problems, their deﬁnitions are not uniﬁed and vary\nfrom one paper to another.\
    \ Thus, this taxonomy also represents an effort to unify\nand consolidate deﬁnitions\
    \ of the FSC problems available in the literature, which\nrepresents a valuable\
    \ source of information for FSC researchers and practitioners\nworking in this\
    \ domain.\n•\nTo classify the FSC problems from a CI perspective. This classiﬁcation\
    \ allows FSC\nproblems to be mapped into common categories of problems in the\
    \ CI domain. Thus,\nwe provide a framework that helps display the similarities\
    \ and differences among\nFSC problems depending on how they can be modeled under\
    \ a CI perspective. To the\nbest of our knowledge, in this regard, no classiﬁcation\
    \ has been previously proposed.\n•\nTo establish a set of guidelines for the use\
    \ of CI in the FSC ﬁeld. These guidelines\naim to help FSC researchers and practitioners\
    \ to identify which FSC problems can\nbe addressed using CI, and the most appropriate\
    \ families of techniques to solve\nthem. Thus, these guidelines represent a ﬁrst\
    \ attempt to deﬁne a general framework\nto support the model selection problem\
    \ at the point where the ﬁelds of FSC and\nCI converge.\n•\nTo identify and discuss\
    \ challenges and research opportunities in the FSC domain,\nwhich are directed\
    \ towards more robust, explainable, interoperable, and accurate CI\nsolutions\
    \ that support FSC management and operation.\nThe rest of this paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 2 provides background in-\nformation on FSC and CI to facilitate\
    \ the understanding of the article. Furthermore, it\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n\
    3 of 34\nsummarizes other efforts directed at reviewing and categorizing the scientiﬁc\
    \ literature at\nthe point where FSC and CI meet in order to highlight how this\
    \ paper complements and\nenhances previous studies. Section 3 presents the proposed\
    \ taxonomy, its structure, and the\nclassiﬁcation of FSC from a CI perspective.\
    \ Afterwards, Section 4 gives FSC researchers and\npractitioners a set of guidelines\
    \ for the use of CI within the FSC domain. Lastly, Section 5\nsummarizes the main\
    \ conclusions and sets a research agenda for CI in the FSC ﬁeld.\n2. Background\
    \ and Motivation\nThis section provides some contextual and relevant background\
    \ information to facili-\ntate the understanding of the paper, and to assess similar\
    \ studies in this area. We start by\nintroducing the basic FSC stages examined\
    \ in this study (Section 2.1). Then, Section 2.2\npresents the main families of\
    \ CI approaches typically considered in FSC research. Finally,\nSection 2.3 reviews\
    \ similar works at the point where FSC and CI converge, which have\nidentiﬁed\
    \ and classiﬁed CI-based problems and methods. Section 2 ends with a discussion\n\
    of the main contributions of this research article.\n2.1. Food Supply Chain\n\
    FSC refers to the system that encompasses all activities, organizations, actors,\
    \ tech-\nnologies, information, resources, and services involved in producing\
    \ agri-food products for\nconsumer markets (e.g., fresh food, meat, and processed\
    \ food products) [14]. The upstream\nand downstream sectors form the supply of\
    \ agricultural inputs (such as seeds, fertilizers,\nfeed, medicine, or equipment)\
    \ to production, post-harvest handling, processing, transporta-\ntion, marketing,\
    \ distribution, and retailing [15]. They also include support services such as\n\
    extension services, research and development, and market information.\nBefore\
    \ the ﬁnal consumption of food products, FSC can include diverse stages wherein\n\
    production, processing, distribution, and retail are the stages most commonly\
    \ studied in\nthe scientiﬁc literature [16]. First, the production stage forms\
    \ the initial set of processes to\nobtain raw products derived from agriculture,\
    \ ﬁsh farming, or livestock. Agriculture refers\nto farming applications, including\
    \ the cultivation of soils for the harvest of crops [17]. Fish\nfarming involves\
    \ raising ﬁsh commercially in tanks or ﬁsh ponds, usually for consumer\nmarkets\
    \ [18]. Meanwhile, livestock is devoted to practices related to animal husbandry\
    \ for\nmeat, milk, eggs, or wool [19]. Continuing further down the production\
    \ chain, we ﬁnd\nthe processing stage, wherein the produced raw materials are\
    \ exposed to diverse transfor-\nmation processes (e.g., meat curing, washing and\
    \ disinfecting vegetables, fermentation),\nwhich allow consumable food products\
    \ to be obtained.\nOnce food products are ready to be delivered to the end-users,\
    \ the following FSC\nstages are distribution and retail. Their main purpose is\
    \ to connect the production and\nprocessing stages with the food users to complete\
    \ the supply chain loop [16]. Consequently,\nin the distribution stage, the processed\
    \ food is sent to distribution centers and warehouses.\nFrom such locations, different\
    \ distribution channels start to deliver the products to retail\nstores for sale.\
    \ Thus, retail is the end stage of the FSC and represents the link to consumers.\n\
    FSCs consist of a wide range of enterprises, ranging from smallholders, farmers’\n\
    organizations, co-operatives, and start-up companies to multinational enterprises\
    \ through\nparent companies or their local afﬁliates [14,15]. In this context,\
    \ FSC companies relate\nto each other through a variety of arrangements. Downstream\
    \ companies in the supply\nchain may engage in various types of relationships\
    \ with producers to secure access to\nagricultural products. They can impose standards\
    \ and speciﬁcations on producers with\nlittle involvement beyond a buying contract.\
    \ However, they can also become more actively\ninvolved, particularly through\
    \ contract farming, to coordinate production and ensure\nquality and safety [14].\
    \ In the new circular chain schemes, this type of relationship becomes\nmore complex,\
    \ involving more than one enterprise from the chain in the decision-making\nprocess\
    \ [20].\nCurrently, an appropriate and effective strategy to address this challenge\
    \ is the digiti-\nzation of FSCs, both of their internal processes and of their\
    \ relationships with other actors\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n4 of 34\nin the chain\
    \ [2]. Digitization has led to the generation of big volumes of data throughout\
    \ the\nentire supply chain. The exploitation of such data would allow FSC actors\
    \ to extract knowl-\nedge that could improve their internal processes in terms\
    \ of productivity and sustainability,\nas well as that of the FSC as a whole.\
    \ However, the data obtained through digitization\nusually contain complex and\
    \ intricate patterns that stand out as diverse challenges for\nprocessing and\
    \ analysis to extract value from it. Thus, CI arises as a solution that could\n\
    leverage and mine the underlying patterns of such data in order to obtain the\
    \ maximum\nvalue of the information, according to the analyses made.\n2.2. Computational\
    \ Intelligence Approaches\nCI is centered on the ability of a computer or algorithm\
    \ to learn speciﬁc tasks (e.g.,\npattern recognition, forecasting) from data that\
    \ is typically related to experimental observa-\ntions without human intervention\
    \ [3]. In the context of FSC, diverse IoT devices and data\nmanagement systems\
    \ sense and gather such data, which they then deploy in each supply\nchain stage.\
    \ After obtaining data, different CI approaches are used to process, analyze,\
    \ and\nextract information. In this section, we introduce the relevant background\
    \ information in\nrelation to families of CI-based methods that are typically\
    \ used in FSC applications. Fol-\nlowing the guidelines and classiﬁcation proposed\
    \ in [3], we have grouped the CI methods\ninto ﬁve families that are presented\
    \ in more detail below. They are CI-based Statistical\nLearning Methods, Artiﬁcial\
    \ Neural Networks and Deep Learning, CI-based Optimization\nMethods, Fuzzy Systems,\
    \ and Probabilistic Reasoning. These groups of CI-based methods\nare presented\
    \ below.\n2.2.1. CI-Based Statistical Learning Methods\nStatistical Learning Methods,\
    \ also known as Machine Learning (ML) methods are\nalgorithms that are able to\
    \ learn a speciﬁc task without being explicitly programmed. More\nformally, according\
    \ to Mitchell [21], these types of methods learn from experiences E,\nrelated\
    \ to a task T, and their performance is evaluated by a metric P. The performance\
    \ in T\nimproves according to P, with experience E. Classically, these methods\
    \ can be classiﬁed\naccording to the three basic learning approaches presented\
    \ below: unsupervised learning,\nsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\
    Unsupervised learning looks for patterns in data with no pre-existing labels.\
    \ Its\ncentral approach is usually focused on organizing X data points into speciﬁc\
    \ groups [22].\nData points that are in the same group should have similar properties,\
    \ while data points\nin different groups should have highly different features.\
    \ It is important to note that\nthese potential groups are not previously deﬁned\
    \ and it is the purpose of unsupervised\nlearning algorithms to discover them.\
    \ Some examples of unsupervised learning methods\nare hierarchical clustering,\
    \ k-means, anomaly detection techniques, among others.\nSupervised learning is\
    \ the other fundamental area of Statistical Learning Methods [23].\nIt consists\
    \ of algorithms that learn a function ( f : X 7→ Y) by training with a ﬁnite number\n\
    of input-output pairs, X being the input domain and X the output co-domain. This\
    \ learning\nstage can be seen as E in Mitchell’s deﬁnition [21], and the speciﬁc\
    \ task T usually involves\npredicting an output given a new and unseen input [24].\
    \ Common families of methods that\nstand out in supervised learning are decision\
    \ tree-based (e.g., Decision Tree, Extra Trees),\ninstance-based (e.g., K-Nearest\
    \ Neighbors), kernel-based (e.g., Support Vector Machine), or\nensemble-based\
    \ methods (Random Forest, AdaBoost).\nSupervised learning problems can usually\
    \ be divided into classiﬁcation and regres-\nsion [25,26]. In both cases, the\
    \ basis is an input data-set, X, and their difference is the\ntype of target variable,\
    \ Y, to be predicted. In the classiﬁcation case, Y is divided into\ndiscrete categories,\
    \ while in regression, the aim is to predict continuous values. Standard\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ problems can be either binary or multi-class problems [27]. In the former\n\
    case, an instance can only be associated with one of two values: the positive\
    \ or negative\nequivalent to 0 or 1; whereas, in multi-class problems, there are\
    \ more than two classes\nunder consideration. A multi-class problem means that\
    \ a given instance belongs to one of\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n5 of 34\nthe multiple\
    \ possible categories. Diversely, a supervised regression problem [28] consists\n\
    of ﬁnding a function that can predict, for a given example, a real value in R.\n\
    The third learning approach is reinforcement learning [29]. In this case, the\
    \ focus is\non developing a learning agent able to observe the environment and\
    \ obtain some input\nfrom it. Then, the agent makes an action and it changes to\
    \ a new environment, receiving an\nevaluation value (award or penalty) related\
    \ to the action made. Unlike the unsupervised\nlearning approach, the agent receives\
    \ guidance from an external evaluation. Moreover,\ndifferent to supervised learning,\
    \ in reinforcement learning, the agent is provided with an\nevaluation value regarding\
    \ the action made and not with a clear speciﬁcation about the\ncorrespondence\
    \ between input and output data. Relevant approaches within reinforcement\nlearning\
    \ are value-based [30], policy-based [31], and model-based [32].\nLastly, it is\
    \ important to note that Artiﬁcial Neural Networks are not considered within\n\
    this family of methods. We will treat them as a separate class of methods because\
    \ of their\nimportant role in CI.\n2.2.2. Artiﬁcial Neural Networks and Deep Learning\n\
    Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computing systems with an inner structure\n\
    that is based on a set of connected units, named neurons, as they are inspired\
    \ by a biological\nbrain. Just as is the case for animals, wherein two neurons\
    \ are connected by means of a link\n(synapses), the neurons of an ANN are connected\
    \ through edges that transmit signals from\none artiﬁcial neuron to another. The\
    \ signals transferred between neurons are represented by\nreal numbers, and the\
    \ output of each neural unit is computed by some non-linear function\nof the sum\
    \ of its inputs.\nEvery edge that connects two neurons (usually) has a weight\
    \ that is adjusted as the\nlearning process of the ANN is underway. The role of\
    \ such edges is to increase or decrease\nthe strength of the signal at the connection\
    \ of two neurons. Additionally, neural units are\naggregated into layers, and\
    \ they may carry out diverse transformations on the inputs that\nthey receive.\
    \ Thus, the purpose of ANNs is to process input data from the ﬁrst layer (input\n\
    layer) to the last layer (output layer), while approximating linear or non-linear\
    \ functions\nthat are generally unknown. The collection of neuron units arranged\
    \ in layers, edges, and\nweights forms a network topology that is usually called\
    \ an architecture (Figure 1). ANNs\nhave evolved into a broad family of architectures\
    \ that depend on the speciﬁc application\ndomain. The feed-forward neural network\
    \ is a type of classical architecture. In this network,\nthe input data moves\
    \ from the input layer directly through any hidden layers (intermediate\nlayers\
    \ located in-between the input and output layers) to the output layer.\nFigure\
    \ 1. Basic architecture of an ANN. It is composed of edges and neural units arranged\
    \ using\nan input layer (blue neural units), a hidden layer (white neural units),\
    \ and an output layer (yellow\nneural units).\nBecause of their ability to reproduce\
    \ and model nonlinear processes, ANNs have been\napplied in diverse supervised\
    \ learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning\nproblems. Application\
    \ areas may include time series forecasting, pattern recognition, signal\nclassiﬁcation,\
    \ among others. However, as more complex problems (e.g., image processing,\nspeech\
    \ recognition) have arisen in the last few years, further development in the ANN\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n6 of 34\narea is required to deal with resulting challenges.\
    \ The common denominator of these ﬁelds\nis the high complexity and enormous volumes\
    \ of data generated and managed in them.\nAs a result, a subset of ANNs, named\
    \ Deep Learning (DL) [33] has emerged to cope with\nthis complexity.\nA deep neural\
    \ network is a classical ANN composed of multiple layers between the\ninput and\
    \ output layers. Theoretically, DL architectures allow any non-linear function\
    \ to be\napproximated [34]. Therefore, this approach has become dominant in multiple\
    \ application\nﬁelds like computer vision [35] and natural language processing\
    \ [36]. Between the most\ncommon deep neural networks, we can ﬁnd recurrent neural\
    \ networks, convolutional\nneural networks, and long short-term memory neural\
    \ networks [37]. The main strength\nof this approach lies in its ability to learn\
    \ automatically from raw data and to learn more\ncomplex representations of data\
    \ than other Statistical Learning methods [38]. The latter\ncould be valuable\
    \ for research areas characterized by having complex data, which can\nbarely be\
    \ analyzed by human reasoning and classical data preprocessing approaches. The\n\
    other relevant characteristics of Deep neural architectures come from their architectural\n\
    ﬂexibility that enables data fusion, as they allow different data formats to merge,\
    \ combining\ndata from multiple sources and therefore extracting more valuable\
    \ knowledge. In other\nwords, DL facilitates the use of multi-dimensional data,\
    \ which is quite difﬁcult to achieve\nwith classical ANNs and ML methods.\n2.2.3.\
    \ CI-Based Optimization Methods\nThe growing computational capabilities and the\
    \ fact that some problems of great\npractical value (e.g., scheduling, routing,\
    \ facility location) can not be solved optimally\n(because they are NP-Hard problems)\
    \ has led to increased use of approximating algorithms.\nMeta-heuristics are a\
    \ suitable approach in situations where exact algorithms can not give an\nanswer\
    \ using a reasonable amount of time or memory [39]. These methods arose with the\n\
    idea of extracting the best parts of different successful heuristics to create\
    \ generic methods\nthat could be applied to a more signiﬁcant number of problems\
    \ and contexts. Due to the\nwide variety of meta-heuristics, different classiﬁcation\
    \ categories have been proposed [40].\nWe group these techniques according to\
    \ the next categories: Evolutionary Computation\n(EC) [41], Swarm Intelligence\
    \ (SI) [42], and other meta-heuristics (local search-based meta-\nheuristics [43]).\
    \ These groups are presented with more detail as follows.\nEC is a group of meta-heuristic\
    \ optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolu-\ntion. Within this family\
    \ of methods, they operate from an initial set of candidate solutions\n(initial\
    \ generation), which are updated in an iterative way. Then, each new generation\n\
    is generated by randomly removing candidate solutions according to predeﬁned criteria\n\
    and by inserting random changes. After a set of iterations, the population of\
    \ solutions\nwill gradually evolve to increase its competitiveness, framed by\
    \ a ﬁtness function that is\ndetermined by each algorithm. Following the described\
    \ procedure, EC algorithms can\nproduce highly optimized solutions for complex\
    \ real-world optimization problems like the\ntraveling salesman problem [44].\
    \ Some well-known examples of EC meta-heuristics are\nGenetic algorithms [45]\
    \ and Differential evolution [46], among others.\nThe second biggest category\
    \ of meta-heuristics is the category of Swarm Intelligence\n(SI). This approach\
    \ consists of a population of agents interacting with each other and their\nenvironment.\
    \ The agents follow a set of basic rules, and although there is no centralized\n\
    control structure guiding the agents on how they should behave, the interaction\
    \ between\nthem leads to the emergence of intelligent global behavior. SI is inspired\
    \ by biological\nsystems such as ant and bee colonies and is commonly used to\
    \ solve combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimization problems (e.g., shortest path\
    \ problems for delivery or optimization\nof unknown parameters in time series).\
    \ Two of the most well-known SI algorithms are Ant\nColony [47], and Particle\
    \ Swarm [48] methods.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n7 of 34\nThe third category groups\
    \ together the rest of the meta-heuristics, which are outside\nof the domains\
    \ of EC and SI but are still relevant for solving optimization problems. For\n\
    example, this is the case for local search-based meta-heuristics that are focused\
    \ on ﬁnding\na solution that maximizes a criterion among a set of candidate solutions.\
    \ These meta-\nheuristics move from one solution to another in the search space\
    \ of candidate solutions\nby applying local changes until an optimal solution\
    \ is found or a time budget is reached.\nWithin this category of meta-heuristics,\
    \ representative methods include Tabu Search [49],\nand Greedy Randomized Adaptive\
    \ Search Procedure (also known as GRASP) [50].\n2.2.4. Fuzzy Systems\nClassical\
    \ logic is based on the crisp set concept, where a group of objects is considered\n\
    to be a collection. In this sense, a crisp subset can be deﬁned from a broader\
    \ set where its\nelements belong to the subset according to some particular condition.\
    \ Thus, we can deﬁne\nthe concept of membership wherein a value of one is assigned\
    \ to the elements of the subset\nand a value of zero to the elements that do not\
    \ belong to that subset. Unlike crisp sets, a\nfuzzy set allows partial belonging\
    \ to a set through a degree of membership, denoted by\na function µ, that maps\
    \ all the elements in the set to a value in the real interval between\nzero and\
    \ one [51]. Then, as in the crisp case, a value of zero means that the element\
    \ under\nconsideration does not belong to the set, and a value of one represents\
    \ that the element\nbelongs entirely to the set. However, unlike in the crisp\
    \ case, a value greater than zero\nand lower than one represents a partial membership\
    \ to the subset. Consequently, the set’s\nmembership function is the relationship\
    \ between the elements of the set and their degree\nof belonging.\nHaving introduced\
    \ the basic notions of fuzzy sets, the next key concept is fuzzy\ninference systems.\
    \ A fuzzy system is a repository of fuzzy expert knowledge that can\nreason the\
    \ data in vague terms instead of precise Boolean logic. This expert knowledge\
    \ is a\ncollection of fuzzy membership functions and a set of fuzzy rules that\
    \ is formed as follows:\nIF (conditions are fulﬁlled) THEN (consequences are inferred).\
    \ The basic conﬁguration of a\nfuzzy system is shown in Figure 2, and it can be\
    \ divided into four main parts: a fuzziﬁer, a\nknowledge base, an inference engine,\
    \ and a defuzziﬁer [52].\nFigure 2. Structure and components of a Fuzzy System.\n\
    The Fuzziﬁer maps a real crisp input to a fuzzy function and, therefore, determines\n\
    the degree of membership of the input to a vague concept (categories using the\
    \ fuzzy sets).\nThe values of the input variables are mapped to the range of values\
    \ of the corresponding\nuniverse of discourse. The range and resolution of input-fuzzy\
    \ sets and their effect on the\nfuzziﬁcation process are considered to be factors\
    \ that affect the overall performance of\nthe system.\nThe knowledge base comprises\
    \ the knowledge of the application domain. It can be\nsplit into a database of\
    \ deﬁnitions used to express linguistic control rules in the controller\nand a\
    \ rule base that describes the knowledge held by the experts in the domain. Intuitively,\n\
    the knowledge base is the core element of a fuzzy controller as it will contain\
    \ all the\ninformation necessary to accomplish its execution tasks.\nThe Inference\
    \ Engine provides the decision-making logic of the controller. It deduces\nthe\
    \ fuzzy control actions by employing fuzzy implications and fuzzy rules of inference.\
    \ In\nmany aspects, it can be viewed as an emulation of human decision-making.\
    \ Finally, the\nDefuzziﬁcation process converts fuzzy control values into crisp\
    \ quantities; that is, it links\na single point to a fuzzy set, given that the\
    \ point belongs to the support of the fuzzy set.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n8 of\
    \ 34\nThere are many de-fuzziﬁcation techniques, the most famous being the center-of-area\
    \ or\ncenter-of-gravity.\n2.2.5. Probabilistic Reasoning\nProbabilistic Reasoning\
    \ states that users can infer plausible models to explain input\ndata. Thus, a\
    \ model can predict an output based on new, unknown input data, which allows\n\
    decisions to be made regarding future actions. In this context of predictions,\
    \ uncertainty\nplays a relevant role for three reasons [53]. First, uncertainty\
    \ can be introduced from noisy\ninput data into the training process of a model.\
    \ Secondly, input data can be consistent with\ndifferent models, and therefore\
    \ which model is more appropriate for the data at hand is\nuncertain. And third,\
    \ a model can have diverse parameters (e.g., the coefﬁcients of linear\nregression)\
    \ and/or different inner structures (e.g., the architecture of ANNs); hence, there\n\
    is uncertainty regarding the speciﬁcations for a concrete model [54].\nFrom a\
    \ general perspective, the basic foundations of Probabilistic Reasoning are\n\
    condensed in the Bayesian learning paradigm [54]. Primarily, probability distributions\
    \ are\nconsidered to represent all uncertainties that can interfere in a model\
    \ (e.g., noise in the input\ndata, the model’s parameters). Then, the basic rules\
    \ of probability theory are considered\nto infer unobserved quantities given the\
    \ observed data. Thus, the process of learning\nfrom data occurs through the transformation\
    \ of the prior probability distributions (deﬁned\nbefore having the input data)\
    \ into posterior distributions (after observing the data).\nThe assumptions mentioned\
    \ above are supported by two of the basic rules of prob-\nability theory. They\
    \ are the sum rule and the product rule, which can be expressed as\nP(x) = ∑y∈Y\
    \ P(x, y) and P(x, y) = P(x)P(y | x), respectively. Here x and y correspond to\n\
    observed or uncertain quantities, taking values in sets X and Y. P(x) is the probability\
    \ of x\nregarding the frequency of observing a particular value. P(x, y) is the\
    \ joint probability of\nobserving x and y, and P(y|x) is the probability of y\
    \ conditioned on observing a concrete x\nvalue. Keeping these two probability\
    \ theory rules in mind, x and y can be integrated into\nthe Bayes’ theorem to\
    \ describe the probability of an event based on the prior knowledge\nof conditions\
    \ that might be related to the event. In the context of Statistical Learning,\
    \ this\ntheorem is stated as P(θ | D, m) = P(D|θ,m)P(θ|m)\nP(D|m)\n. Here, P(D\
    \ | θ, m) is the likelihood of\nparameters θ in model m, P(θ | m) is the prior\
    \ probability of θ, and P(θ | D, m) is the\nposterior probability of θ given data\
    \ x.\nThus, learning is the transformation of prior knowledge or assumptions regarding\
    \ the\nparameters P(θ | m), through data D, into the posterior knowledge about\
    \ the parameters\nP(θ | D, m). Such a posterior distribution then becomes prior\
    \ knowledge for future data\npredictions. Within this framework, the most typical\
    \ methods used over the last few years\nwere Bayesian networks [55]. Other representative\
    \ techniques are Markov networks and\nRandom Fields [56].\n2.2.6. Summary of CI-Based\
    \ Approaches\nHaving presented the families of CI methods usually considered in\
    \ FSC, this section\nintroduces a summary of the methods presented above and their\
    \ strengths and weak-\nnesses (Table 1). First of all, we would like to point\
    \ out that this list of advantages and\ndisadvantages does not refer to a comparison\
    \ between the different categories of methods\nconsidered in this paper, as they\
    \ are often used to solve different types of problems and\ntherefore the comparison\
    \ is not straightforward. Instead, these strengths and weaknesses\nrefer to a\
    \ comparison between CI-based approaches versus non CI-based approaches that\n\
    are used to solve similar categories of problems.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n9 of\

    \ are two-fold. First, it reviews the related work at the\npoint where FSC and\
    \ CI meet, in order to identify previous contributions regarding the\nclassiﬁcation\
    \ of FSC problems, and the CI methods used to solve them. Having already\nintroduced\
    \ these previous studies, the ﬁnal part of this section is devoted to presenting\
    \ the\nmain novelty and contributions of this paper.\nIn 2012, Grifﬁs et al. [11]\
    \ focused on the distribution stage of an FSC to present an\noverview of CI-based\
    \ optimization methods that can play a relevant role for problems like\nvehicle\
    \ routing, supply chain risks, and disruptions. The authors emphasized how meta-\n\
    heuristic techniques provide near-optimal solutions to logistics problems. Following\
    \ this\nline of research, in 2016, Wari and Zhu [12] presented an updated survey\
    \ on applying meta-\nheuristics to solve optimization problems in the processing\
    \ (e.g., fermentation, thermal\ndrying, and distillation) and distribution (e.g.,\
    \ warehousing location, production planning,\nand scheduling) stages of an FSC.\
    \ More recently, in 2017, Kamilaris et al. [7] reviewed\narticles on smart farming\
    \ to show how digital technologies can enhance the circularity of\nthe FSC at\
    \ the production stage. They highlighted the problems that can be approached by\n\
    utilizing CI-based Statistical Learning, ANNs, and DL methods.\nComplementary\
    \ to the advances reported by Kamilaris et al. [7], in 2020, Sharma et al. [15]\n\
    and Misra et al. [2] carried out a bibliometric analysis and a review, respectively,\
    \ of CI-\nbased Statistical Learning applications over the whole FSC. Based on\
    \ their results, the\nauthors designed a series of recommendations to design and\
    \ deploy Statistical Learning-\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n10 of 34\nbased solutions\
    \ for data-driven decision-making processes in the FSC. In the same year,\nCamarena\
    \ [10] made a critical analysis of what can be done with Artiﬁcial Intelligence,\n\
    without emphasizing any single method in particular, for the transition to a sustainable\n\
    FSC. Lastly, the studies of Liakos et al. [6] and Saiz-Rubio and Rovira-Mas [9],\
    \ in 2018 and\n2020, respectively, presented comprehensive reviews of research\
    \ directed at the application\nof ML in the FSC production stage. The authors\
    \ surveyed how ML can help farmers make\nmore informed decisions on the management\
    \ of agriculture and livestock systems.\nFigure 3 presents a synthesis of the\
    \ studies described above and highlights how this\narticle complements and extends\
    \ the existing literature. Each cited paper is represented\nby a grey circle,\
    \ which can have one or two inner circles (green and blue). Green circles\nrepresent\
    \ FSC stages covered by a study, while blue circles depict the CI approaches\n\
    considered within it. The size of the circle is determined by the number of FSC\
    \ stages and\nCI techniques considered in each article. Thus, a green circle would\
    \ have the biggest size if\nthe paper to which it belongs addresses the four basic\
    \ stages of the FSC. The same logic is\nused for the blue circles: the more families\
    \ of methods a paper considers, the bigger the\ncircle’s size would be. Furthermore,\
    \ we can ﬁnd our research article in the center of the\nﬁgure in the violet circle.\n\
    Figure 3. Motivations and state-of-the-art concepts at the point where FSC and\
    \ CI meet.\nAccording to Figure 3 we can see that there are no research articles\
    \ that present a\ncomprehensive taxonomy at the point where FSC problems and CI\
    \ converge. This means\nthat there are no research studies that consider the problems\
    \ of the four basic FSC stages,\nnor the diversity of the CI methods that can\
    \ be applied to solve them. Instead, most of the\npapers focus on one or two FSC\
    \ stages, and they tend to review the role a unique CI family\nof methods has\
    \ over them. Therefore, we propose a new taxonomy that embraces the\ncomplete\
    \ FSC and the ﬁve families of CI methods most commonly used in the FSC stages.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n11 of 34\nFurthermore, our proposal extends the previous\
    \ classiﬁcation efforts by adding a new\ncategorization attribute, which indicates\
    \ the type of FSC problem being addressed from\na CI perspective. In addition\
    \ to increasing the classiﬁcation capacity of our taxonomy,\nthis attribute allows\
    \ us to establish a novel mapping between the FSC problems and the\ntypologies\
    \ of CI problems that can be used to approach the former ones. By doing so,\n\
    we contribute to facilitating the choice of the most convenient family of CI methods\
    \ to\nuse depending on the FSC problem at hand. This represents a valuable and\
    \ novel source\nof information for FSC researchers and practitioners who aim to\
    \ incorporate CI-based\nsolutions into their FSC applications.\n3. A Taxonomy\
    \ of CI-Based Problems in the Food Supply Chain\nThis section introduces details\
    \ of the taxonomy proposed. First, Section 3.1 presents\nthe methodology followed\
    \ to design the taxonomy. Then, Sections 3.3 and 3.4 show the\ntaxonomy’s structure\
    \ and describe its parts. Finally, Section 3.5 gives an overview of the\ncategorization\
    \ of FSC problems, from a CI perspective, using the taxonomy.\n3.1. Methodology\
    \ for the Design of the Taxonomy\nThis section introduces the methodology followed\
    \ to build the taxonomy proposed.\nFirst, we note that this research paper does\
    \ not aim to carry out a systematic literature\nreview or survey. Instead, our\
    \ scope lies in searching and reviewing the representative\nliterature to propose\
    \ a taxonomy that describes and categorizes FSC problems and how\nthey are solved\
    \ from a CI-based perspective. As such, the taxonomy proposed does not seek\n\
    to identify all details associated with the FSC problems to maintain its comprehensibility\n\
    and size. It is designed according to core characteristics that may alter the\
    \ complexity and\nmodeling of FSC problems from the CI perspective.\nWith these\
    \ ideas in mind, Figure 4 shows the methodology followed to build the\ntaxonomy\
    \ introduced in this research paper. This methodology follows a structure-based\n\
    literature review that includes the steps depicted in Figure 4. The ﬁrst step\
    \ is named Scope\n& Research Question, which aims to limit the areas of knowledge\
    \ to be consulted; that is,\nthe point where FSC and CI converge. For this step,\
    \ the research questions that guided\nour search were: “What are the most common\
    \ FSC problems reported in the literature?”,\n“What are the CI methods typically\
    \ used to approach these problems?”, “How can FSC\nbe categorized from a CI perspective?”,\
    \ and “Is there any taxonomy to categorize FSC\nproblems considering a CI approach?”.\n\
    Figure 4. Steps followed to build the proposed taxonomy.\nThe following step deﬁned\
    \ the search set-up. We deﬁne the keywords, periods,\nonline resources, and criteria\
    \ to search and review the scientiﬁc literature. The keywords\nconsidered were:\
    \ Food Supply Chain(s), agrifood, ﬁsh farming, agriculture, livestock,\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 6910\n12 of 34\nproduction, processing, distribution, logistics, retail,\
    \ computational intelligence machine\nlearning, deep learning, meta-heuristics,\
    \ fuzzy systems, and probabilistic methods. The\nperiod was between 2012 and 2020,\
    \ and the bibliographic resources searched were the\nWeb of Science, Scopus, and\
    \ Google Scholar. Finally, the main criteria for selecting and\nreviewing the\
    \ literature was that they be review or survey papers. The latter is based on\n\
    the fact that this type of paper offers a general and consolidated overview of\
    \ the state-of-\nthe-art concerning CI-based FSC problems reported in the literature.\
    \ Moreover, these types\nof papers allowed us to know if any taxonomy was previously\
    \ proposed to classify the\nFSC problems.\nThe next stage in Figure 4 is search,\
    \ select, and review. Using the search set-up\nmentioned above, we identiﬁed the\
    \ survey and review papers introduced in the Motivation\nSection 2.3. Next, we\
    \ analyzed the FSC problems considered in these papers, the FSC stages\nwhere\
    \ the problems were located, and the families of CI methods usually considered\
    \ to\napproach these FSC problems.\nBased on the ﬁndings mentioned above, we moved\
    \ to the ﬁnal step of the methodology\nshown in Figure 4. The objective was to\
    \ design a new taxonomy that embraces the\ncomplete FSC and the ﬁve families of\
    \ CI methods most commonly used in the FSC stages.\nThis taxonomy also intends\
    \ to expand the previous classiﬁcation efforts by adding a\nnew categorization\
    \ attribute, indicating the type of FSC problem addressed from a CI\nperspective.\
    \ Thus, we characterized how the FSC problems identiﬁed in the previous\nstep\
    \ can be modeled from a CI perspective. To do so, we considered the typologies\n\
    of problems in the CI domain (problem-solving, uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\n\
    knowledge discovery and function approximation, and communication and perception)\n\
    that better suited the families of CI methods considered in the studies reviewed.\n\
    Having built the taxonomy, we checked its robustness and ability to discriminate\n\
    papers that approached different FSC problems. To accomplish this aim, we extracted\n\
    relevant references cited by the review and survey papers previously identiﬁed,\
    \ as well as\nthe recent literature, and mapped them into the proposed taxonomy.\
    \ This is shown in the\nfollowing section, where the taxonomy is introduced, to\
    \ validate its classiﬁcation power.\n3.2. The Taxonomy Overview\nThe taxonomy\
    \ aims, ﬁrstly, to extend the previous classiﬁcation efforts on FSC prob-\nlems\
    \ to cover all stages of Agrifood supply chains; and, secondly, to add a new level\
    \ of\ncategorization that allows typologies of FSC problems to be mapped to typologies\
    \ of CI\nproblems. We can see the structure of the proposed taxonomy in Figure\
    \ 5. As we can see,\nin level one, the taxonomy includes the four basic stages\
    \ of an FSC that were introduced in\nSection 2.2.1; that is, production, processing,\
    \ distribution, and retail. Then, in level two, it\ncontains the different categories\
    \ of FSC problems that we can ﬁnd in each stage. It is impor-\ntant to clarify\
    \ that although these FSC problems have been reported previously, in related\n\
    studies [2,6–12], to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that their\
    \ deﬁnitions are\nuniﬁed and consolidated in one taxonomy. Lastly, in level three,\
    \ the taxonomy introduces\nthe typologies of problems from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally,\
    \ this level seeks to classify\nthe FSC problems depending on how they can be\
    \ modeled and solved by CI methods.\nHaving presented the structure of the taxonomy,\
    \ the following Section 3.3 details\nthe FSC problems identiﬁed for the production,\
    \ processing, distribution, and retail stages.\nThose problems represent the second\
    \ level of the taxonomy. They are formally deﬁned\nfrom a purely FSC perspective,\
    \ and we clearly state the key objective of each problem\nwithin the particular\
    \ chain stage where it is identiﬁed. Afterwards, Section 3.4 presents\nthe third\
    \ level of the taxonomy that contains the attributes to categorize the FSC problems\n\
    of level 2 under a CI approach. These attributes correspond to the four typologies\
    \ of CI\nproblems that are more commonly used in the literature to address FSC\
    \ problems. Finally,\nSection 3.5 introduces the classiﬁcation and mapping of\
    \ FSC problems according to how\nthey can be modeled by CI typologies.\nSensors\
    \ 2021, 21, 6910\n13 of 34\nFigure 5. A taxonomy of computational intelligence\
    \ in an FSC.\n3.3. Level 2: Identiﬁcation and Deﬁnition of Food Supply Chain Problems\n\
    In this section, we present the FSC problems identiﬁed for each of the FSC stages\n\
    shown in Figure 5, which corresponds to the second level of our taxonomy. These\
    \ problems\nare formally deﬁned in more detail below.\n3.3.1. Production Problems\n\
    The FSC production stage can be split into three main production systems: ﬁsh\n\
    farming, agriculture, and livestock. These three production systems and their\
    \ associated\nproblems can be observed in Figure 6 and they are deﬁned below.\n\
    Figure 6. FSC problems in the production stage.\nFish farming (also known as pisciculture)\
    \ is the production system concerned with\nraising ﬁsh in closed environments,\
    \ such as ponds or tanks, for human consumption. Nowa-\ndays nearly half of the\
    \ ﬁsh consumed in the word are raised in artiﬁcial environments [57].\nFish farming\
    \ production has a high degree of complexity as it involves interrelated physical\n\
    (e.g., water and nutrient supply), chemical (e.g., pH, oxygen), and environmental\
    \ (e.g.,\nwaste generated) elements. Therefore, the management of this process\
    \ requires advanced\nsensing, control, and communication technologies as well\
    \ as expert knowledge to make\nefﬁcient and sustainable decisions, and maximize\
    \ the productivity. Within this context, the\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n14 of 34\n\
    most typical CI-based processes reported in the literature are ﬁsh weight estimation\
    \ [58],\nproduction estimation, and optimization [59]. Their deﬁnitions are presented\
    \ below.\n•\nFish weight estimation: This process estimates ﬁsh weight considering\
    \ morphological\nfeatures (e.g., length, width, and mass).\n•\nProduction estimation\
    \ and optimization: This process is centered on the optimiza-\ntion of ﬁsh production\
    \ and forecasting of seasonal demand to adjust the production.\nTo accomplish\
    \ such aims, the optimization of production is carried out by monitoring\ncrucial\
    \ elements of ﬁsh ponds, like water oxygen levels, nutrients, and food supply,\n\
    which inﬂuence the growth of ﬁsh. Meanwhile, historical records of seasonal de-\n\
    mand are stored and continuously analyzed to determine the most suitable levels\
    \ of\nproduction depending on the year and season.\nThe following production system\
    \ considered in this study is agriculture, in particular,\nhorticulture. Horticulture\
    \ is the greenhouse industry dedicated to plant cultivation and\nprocessing of\
    \ different types of crops for food and commercial consumption (e.g., ﬂowers,\n\
    fruits and nuts, vegetables and herbs). The main challenges of these production\
    \ systems\nare to improve plant growth, yields, quality, nutritional value, and\
    \ resistance to insects,\ndiseases, and environmental stress.\nIn order to achieve\
    \ these improvements, different processes are managed to try and\nmaintain a balance\
    \ between efﬁciency, productivity, and sustainability, such as monitoring\nand\
    \ controlling indoor-outdoor climate conditions, crop management, and production\
    \ fore-\ncasting, among others. They are commonly approached in the specialized\
    \ literature [6,9,60]\nin open-ﬁeld agriculture and intensive horticulture. Within\
    \ the most representative pro-\ncesses, we ﬁnd the crop yield and harvest forecasting\
    \ [60–62], crop protection [63,64],\nweather prediction and irrigation management\
    \ [65,66], and site-speciﬁc nutrient manage-\nment [67,68]. These processes, which\
    \ are shown in Figure 6, are deﬁned as follows.\n•\nCrop yield and harvesting\
    \ prediction: This problem is focused on yield estimation\nto match crop supply\
    \ with demand and on crop management to increase productivity.\n•\nCrop protection:\
    \ This is based on the identiﬁcation and diagnosis of biotic (infesta-\ntions,\
    \ diseases, and weeds) and abiotic (nutrients, water deﬁciency) stress factors\
    \ that\naffect crop productivity.\n•\nWeather prediction and irrigation management:\
    \ This problem is mainly concerned\nwith weather forecasting for the optimal use\
    \ of water, which enables the design and\ndeployment of crop irrigation scheduling\
    \ and planning.\n•\nSite-speciﬁc nutrient management: This is based on the management\
    \ of soil quality\nto determine which nutrients need to be supplied in order to\
    \ maintain the chemical\ncharacteristics required for the crop under consideration.\n\
    Lastly, the third production system considered for the production stage is livestock.\n\
    This production system is dedicated to the growth and management of domestic animals\n\
    (e.g., cattle, sheep, and goats) raised in agricultural settings to generate food\
    \ products like\nmeat, eggs, or milk, among others. Livestock can be carried out\
    \ through either extensive or\nintensive systems. Extensive systems involve animals\
    \ roaming grasslands (usually under\nthe supervision of a herdsman). Diversely,\
    \ intensive livestock is located in closed infras-\ntructures and is equipped\
    \ with ICT technology, which enables animals to be monitored\nin real-time. Within\
    \ these production systems the most typical problems we come across\nare grassland\
    \ monitoring [69], animal welfare [70], animal behavior tracking [71], and\nlivestock\
    \ production prediction and optimization [72,73], as shown in Figure 6. The formal\n\
    deﬁnitions of these problems from an FSC perspective are listed below.\n•\nGrassland\
    \ monitoring: This problem is related to the accurate identiﬁcation of grass-\n\
    land inventories in order to discriminate between the most suitable types for\
    \ live-\nstock purposes.\n•\nAnimal welfare: This is focused on the pattern classiﬁcation\
    \ of ingestive behavior in\ngrazing animals for studies of animal nutrition, growth,\
    \ and health.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n15 of 34\n•\nAnimal behavior tracking:\
    \ This is based on the use of behavior analysis to detect\nearly signs of health\
    \ issues and promote early intervention.\n•\nLivestock production: This problem\
    \ is centered on predictions and estimations of\nfarming parameters to optimize\
    \ the economic-energy efﬁciency and sustainability of\nproduction systems.\n3.3.2.\
    \ Processing Problems\nOnce the raw materials of food products have been grown,\
    \ they are delivered to the\nnext step of the FSC, or ‘processing’. Different\
    \ industrial processes (e.g., washing, disinfect-\ning, packaging) are carried\
    \ out in this stage to transform the raw output of production into\nedible food\
    \ products. Depending on the production system under consideration and the\nfood\
    \ products obtained from them, diverse industrial processes can be followed to\
    \ obtain\nthe goods that move on to the distribution stage. However, in spite\
    \ of such production\nparticularities, we have identiﬁed a set of common problems\
    \ that could occur in the three\nproduction systems presented in the section above.\
    \ These problems are shown in Figure 7\nand they are: demand prediction [74],\
    \ production planning for distribution [75], prediction\nof post-harvest losses\
    \ [76], and manufacturing industry processes, such as cooking, drying,\nand others\
    \ [77].\nFigure 7. FSC problems in the processing stage.\n•\nDemand prediction:\
    \ This problem in concerneed with the demand prediction of food\nrequirements\
    \ to avoid overstocking, overproduction, and over-utilization of resources.\n\
    The key idea is to estimate the quantity of food products that will be sold to\
    \ deﬁne\nhow much raw material needs to be processed.\n•\nProduction planning\
    \ for distribution: This is centered on production planning to\nmatch distribution\
    \ requirements. This problem is mostly determined by the sale\nvolumes that a\
    \ particular food product is expected to have.\n•\nPrediction of post-harvest\
    \ losses: This is focused on making estimations of food\nlosses associated with\
    \ the processing procedures carried out after harvesting raw\nmaterials coming\
    \ from the production stage.\n•\nFood manufacturing industry: This is associated\
    \ with the optimization of the pro-\ncessing technologies required to transform\
    \ raw foods into edible food (e.g., thermal,\ndrying, contact cooking, microwave\
    \ heating, etc.). These processes are performed\nusing industrial machinery.\n\
    3.3.3. Distribution Problems\nIn the third step of the food supply chain, food\
    \ products ready for human consumption\nare received from the processing stage\
    \ to be delivered to end-consumers. Speciﬁcally,\nﬁnished products arrive at warehouses,\
    \ and from there, the shipment department is\nin charge of deﬁning the most suitable\
    \ strategy to deliver products to end-consumers.\nThe essential purpose is to\
    \ distribute food products on time by the date speciﬁed in the\nretail stage.\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n16 of 34\nFor this particular stage of the FSC, the most\
    \ common problems reported in the spe-\ncialized literature are shown in Figure\
    \ 8 and deﬁned below. These problems include vehicle\nrouting and ﬂeet management\
    \ [78,79], storage location assignment [80,81], prediction of\nsupply chain risks\
    \ and disruptions [82,83], shelf life prediction and maturity level [84–86],\n\
    demand forecasting [87], and last mile delivery [88].\nFigure 8. FSC problems\
    \ in the distribution stage.\n•\nVehicle routing and ﬂeet management: This is\
    \ focused on determining the most\noptimal route for the delivery of food under\
    \ different scenario constraints (e.g., size of\nthe ﬂeet, fuel availability,\
    \ etc.).\n•\nStorage location assignment problem: This problem is concerned with\
    \ deciding the\nmost suitable way to store food products in a set of warehouses\
    \ in order to cope with\ndaily demand operations.\n•\nPrediction of supply chain\
    \ risks and disruptions: This is concerned with the fore-\ncasting of potential\
    \ disruptions in the logistics of food products and their associated\nfood losses.\n\
    •\nShelf life prediction and maturity level: This problem is related to the forecasting\
    \ of\nshelf life based on data sensed during the distribution process.\n•\nDemand\
    \ forecasting: This consists of understanding demand behaviors and forecast-\n\
    ing user demand generated from the retail stage. Thus, it is possible to optimize\
    \ the\ndelivery routes and warehouse locations used during the distribution stage.\n\
    •\nLast mile delivery: This problem is dedicated to the delivery of food products\
    \ using\nthe local road transport network (last mile) of cities.\n3.3.4. Retail\
    \ Problems\nIn the ﬁnal part of the FSC, we ﬁnd the retail stage. At this point,\
    \ food products are\nreceived through the distribution channels, ready for sale.\
    \ This stage encompasses the\nconcept of an ’end-consumer’, which could be supermarkets\
    \ or clients that go to these\nplaces to buy food products. The most common problems\
    \ identiﬁed in the literature for\nthis stage of the supply chain are deﬁned below\
    \ and are also summarized in Figure 9.\nLastly, we characterized the retail stage\
    \ (Figure 5). Retail-related problems commonly\naddressed with CI, in this link\
    \ of the FSC, are diet and nutrition applications [89,90],\nfood consumption and\
    \ food waste [91,92], consumer demand, perception and buying\nbehavior [93,94],\
    \ dynamic discounting based on the sell-by date [95], and day demand\nprediction\
    \ and inventory management [74].\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n17 of 34\nFigure 9.\
    \ FSC problems in the retail stage.\n•\nDiet and Nutrition: This is based on estimating\
    \ nutrient values using the classiﬁcation\nof food dishes and dietary assessment.\n\
    •\nFood consumption and food waste: This problem is associated with the identification\n\
    and prediction of food waste based on the buying and storage behavior of end-customers.\n\
    •\nConsumer demand, perception, and buying behavior: This problem is focused on\n\
    determining consumer proﬁles in order to predict buying behaviors and support\
    \ the\nmanagement of shop counters.\n•\nDynamic discounting based on sell-by date:\
    \ This is centered on automated price\nchanges at supermarkets based on the sell-by\
    \ date. The objective is to offer larger\ndiscounts for items with the shortest\
    \ remaining shelf life.\n•\nDaily demand prediction and inventory management:\
    \ This problem consists of\npredicting daily demand to better manage product stocks\
    \ at supermarkets.\n3.4. Level 3: Typologies of CI Problems\nIn this section,\
    \ we introduce the attributes that represent the most typical typologies\nof CI\
    \ modeling approaches used in the FSC literature. The attributes correspond to\
    \ the\nthird level of the taxonomy shown in Figure 5, and they are presented below.\n\
    •\nProblem-solving: This category is related to problems of complex decision-making\n\
    processes that need to be solved, keeping two key objectives in mind: quality\
    \ of the\nsolution and the computational time required to solve it. As a common\
    \ denominator,\nthis attribute categorizes problems that are NP-hard. Thus, this\
    \ class embodies FSC\nproblems for which there is no certainty that the method\
    \ can optimally solve them\nin a polynomial time (time complexity [96]) with respect\
    \ to the input data size. This\ncategory includes, for example, optimization or\
    \ search problems such as the vehicle\nrouting problem in the transportation stage\
    \ of the FSC.\n•\nUncertain knowledge and reasoning: This category corresponds\
    \ to FSC problems\ncharacterized by having partially observable, non-deterministic,\
    \ vague, or imprecise\ndata. In such uncertain scenarios, this attribute represents\
    \ problems that can be\naddressed in two possible ways. First, by using an approach\
    \ that acts based on\nassumptions of uncertain input data in order to give a probabilistic-based\
    \ solution\nto the problem at hand. Or second, by representing and reasoning with\
    \ the partially\navailable information in a manner similar to the way that humans\
    \ express knowledge\nand summarize data. This second approach allows non-exact\
    \ data to be represented\nin linguist terms in order to make decisions within\
    \ certain margins of correctness.\n•\nKnowledge discovery and function approximation:\
    \ This class represents FSC prob-\nlems that are distinguished by having large\
    \ volumes of data, which enable under-\nstanding and useful knowledge to be extracted\
    \ from them. Such knowledge could be\nused to make either predictions of future\
    \ events or discrimination and recognition of\npatterns. These types of problems\
    \ can usually be addressed with methods that can be\ntrained using the available\
    \ data to learn a speciﬁc task.\n•\nCommunication and perception: This category\
    \ consists of FSC problems focused\non the automatic extraction, analysis, and\
    \ understanding of information obtained\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n18 of 34\nfrom\
    \ digital images, texts, or voice recordings. It is worth noting that within the\
    \ FSC\ndomain, most problems solved using a communication and perception approach\
    \ are\nfocused on designing and developing autonomous computer vision systems.\
    \ These\nsystems are able to process high-dimensional data to support decision-making;\
    \ from\nobject detection to video tracking and object recognition.\n3.5. Mapping\
    \ Process between Level 2 and Level 3: Classiﬁcation of FSC Problems from a\n\
    CI Perspective\nThis section presents the categorization of FSC problems previously\
    \ identiﬁed in\nSection 3.3 from a CI perspective. Speciﬁcally, every problem\
    \ is categorized according\nto the four typologies of CI problems that we described\
    \ above: problem-solving, uncer-\ntain knowledge and reasoning, knowledge discovery\
    \ and function approximation, and\ncommunication and perception. In addition,\
    \ using relevant work from the recent FSC\nliterature, we show how the taxonomy\
    \ is able to effectively and robustly discriminate these\npapers. Thus, Section\
    \ 3.5.1 is devoted to classifying the FSC problems coming from the\nproduction\
    \ stage. Then, Section 3.5.2 introduces the classiﬁcation of problems deﬁned for\n\
    the processing stage. Lastly, Sections 3.5.3 and 3.5.4 expose the categorization\
    \ of problems\nfor the distribution and retail phases, respectively.\n3.5.1. Classiﬁcation\
    \ of Production Problems\nFigure 10 presents the categorization of production\
    \ problems for the ﬁsh farming\nand livestock cases. The attributes of the taxonomy\
    \ are depicted on the left in Figure 10,\nwhereas the ﬁsh farming (in purple)\
    \ and livestock (in red) problems are found on the right.\nThe problems and attributes\
    \ are connected by gray bars that connect the ways in which a\nspeciﬁc problem\
    \ can be modeled from a CI perspective. Fish weight estimation, grassland\nmonitoring,\
    \ animal welfare, and animal behavior tracking are problems that are classiﬁed\n\
    using the communication and perception attribute. This is justiﬁed due to the\
    \ fact that\nthese problems are usually characterized by having image and video\
    \ records as input\ndata (non-structured data). Having such data implies the use\
    \ of automatic information\nextraction by means of computer vision systems, based\
    \ on DL, which allow extraction of\nhigh-dimensional patterns embedded in image\
    \ and video data [97–103].\nFigure 10. Fish farming and livestock problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\nThe production estimation and optimization and livestock\
    \ production problems in\nFigure 10 are classiﬁed using the knowledge discovery\
    \ and function approximation and\nuncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes.\
    \ Such categorization is determined by the\ncentral characteristics of these problems,\
    \ which are concerned with the prediction and\noptimization of production values\
    \ using historical data records (structured data) [104,105].\nBesides, production\
    \ forecasting contains uncertainties regarding external factors of the\nproduction\
    \ systems, which encourage the use of probabilistic methods, such as the studies\n\
    carried out by [106,107].\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n19 of 34\nFigure 11 shows the\
    \ categorization of agriculture problems. As we can seen, crop\nprotection, which\
    \ usually involves video and image records, is categorized as a com-\nmunication\
    \ and perception problem commonly used in DL methods like convolutional\nand recurrent\
    \ neural networks [108–110]. On the other hand, the remaining agricultural\nproblems\
    \ can be categorized under knowledge discovery and function approximation,\nproblem-solving,\
    \ and uncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes as explained below.\nIn terms\
    \ of knowledge discovery and function approximation, this attribute categorizes\n\
    problems focused on the prediction of greenhouse conditions for the optimal management\n\
    of crop production, nutrients, and irrigation supply. This can be done using supervised\n\
    learning techniques that forecast variables of interest like temperature, water,\
    \ or nitro-\ngen [6,111]. Secondly, the problem-solving attribute categorizes\
    \ the weather prediction and\nirrigation management and the site-speciﬁc management\
    \ problems. These problems can be\ndeﬁned as optimization scenarios in which we\
    \ can ﬁnd concrete values associated with\nweather, irrigation, and nutrients.\
    \ In this case, the most common approach to solving them\nis based on meta-heuristics\
    \ [112–114].\nFinally, the uncertain knowledge and reasoning attributes characterize\
    \ the same prob-\nlems that fall into the knowledge discovery and function approximation\
    \ attribute. The\ndifference lies in the fact that the agriculture problems are\
    \ approached as decision systems\nunder uncertainty. In this case, fuzzy logic\
    \ is the most suitable strategy to accomplish such\nan aim [115–117] Speciﬁcally,\
    \ the fuzzy approach allows us to evaluate whether particular\nactions need to\
    \ be taken according to sensed and predicted conditions coming from agri-\nculture\
    \ systems (e.g., optimal management strategies for the control of temperature\
    \ control\ninside greenhouse systems).\nFigure 11. Agriculture problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.2. Classiﬁcation of Processing Problems\nHaving\
    \ presented the production stage, Figure 12 features the categorization of prob-\n\
    lems in the processing stage. Any of the depicted FSC problems are classiﬁed using\
    \ the\ncommunication and perception attribute, mainly because the type of input\
    \ data they handle\nis not associated with images or video records. In contrast,\
    \ when the aim is to determine\nfuture scenarios based on the available data,\
    \ all problems tend to have historical data as\ntheir input data.\nPrecisely,\
    \ the knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute categorizes\nthe\
    \ prediction of post-harvest losses and demand prediction problems as being super-\n\
    vised learning problems, whose aims are to claasify and forecast the objective\
    \ variable.\nFor instance, we consider research from [8,118] to be within this\
    \ category. Following the\ntaxonomy’s attributes in Figure 12, the problem-solving\
    \ attribute can represent and model\ndemand predictions, the food manufacturing\
    \ industry, and production planning for dis-\ntribution problems. In this scenario,\
    \ they are classiﬁed as being optimization problems,\nwith the objective of optimizing\
    \ procedures related to the problems listed. An example, for\ninstance, could\
    \ be the optimization of industrial manufacturing processes, like heating and\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n20 of 34\ndrying, using meta-heuristic techniques. Examples\
    \ of studies categorized by the taxonomy\nof the previously mentioned approaches\
    \ are found in [119,120].\nLastly, the uncertain knowledge and reasoning attribute\
    \ system also classiﬁes produc-\ntion planning for distribution problems. Probabilistic\
    \ methods tend to be used to approach\nthese kind of problems as production planning\
    \ can incorporate uncertainty coming from\nprocesses that are not directly related\
    \ to the production process, which can cope with\nprobability theory [121]. An\
    \ example of this last situation could be a change in the delivery\ndate due to\
    \ delays attributable to the weather [122].\nFigure 12. Processing problems classiﬁed\
    \ by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.3. Classiﬁcation of Distribution Problems\nFigure\
    \ 13 exhibits the classiﬁcation of FSC problems in the distribution stage. Unlike\n\
    the two previous stages (production and processing), the predominant approaches\
    \ here are\nthe ones imposed by the problem-solving and knowledge discovery and\
    \ function approxi-\nmation attributes. The former attribute categorizes vehicle\
    \ routing and ﬂeet management,\nthe storage location assignment problem, and last\
    \ mile delivery problems, as they are\ndevoted to optimizing routing and delivery\
    \ situations. The purpose of these applications\nis to optimize, using meta-heuristics,\
    \ a concrete goal under different constraints; for in-\nstance, ﬂeet size, available\
    \ fuel, and others. Representative studies that fall in this category\nare [123–127].\n\
    The knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute includes prediction\n\
    of chain and disruptions, a shelf life prediction and maturity level, and demand\
    \ forecasting\nproblems. This attribute classiﬁes these problems under a supervised\
    \ learning perspective,\nwhere the aim is to predict expected values, such as\
    \ we can see in research carried out\nin [84,128–131]. For instance, potential\
    \ disruptions to the cold food products chain, or an\nestimation of how much product\
    \ volume needs to be distributed to meet retail demands.\nFigure 13. Distribution\
    \ problems classiﬁed by the proposed taxonomy.\n3.5.4. Classiﬁcation of Retail\
    \ Problems\nFinally, Figure 14 introduces the classification of problems in the\
    \ retail stage of\nthe FSC. In this last step, the communication and perception\
    \ attribute appears once\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n21 of 34\nagain to represent\
    \ the problems in which the input data correspond to non-structured\ndata, such\
    \ as images (dynamic discounting, daily demand prediction, and inventory\nmanagement)\
    \ [95,132–135]. For these particular cases, the problems can be modeled using\n\
    DL techniques to determining price discounts based on stock levels inside supermarkets\n\
    and by managing inventories according to food product existence.\nContrarily,\
    \ the knowledge discovery and function approximation attribute includes\nproblems\
    \ associated with the extraction of patterns (food consumption and food waste),\n\
    the prediction of future values related to consumer demand and buying behavior,\
    \ and the\ngeneration of healthy menus or estimating nutritional values. Research\
    \ articles on this\nattribute include [89,90,136–139]. Furthermore, this attribute\
    \ can also classify the dynamic\ndiscounting and daily demand prediction and inventory\
    \ management problems when\ntheir input data corresponds to structured information\
    \ like historical records.\nIn addition to the attributes mentioned above, the\
    \ uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\nand problem-solving attributes can be used\
    \ to categorize a couple of problems in the retail\nstage. Those problems are\
    \ consumer demand, perception, and buying behavior, as well\nas daily demand prediction\
    \ and inventory management. Consumer demand, perception,\nand buying behavior\
    \ can be approached with a probabilistic system [140–142], for instance,\nuncertainty\
    \ concerning what food products are expected to be bought. Meanwhile, daily\n\
    demand prediction and inventory management can be addressed with an optimization\n\
    paradigm [143,144]. For this case, the aim is to optimize stock levels in such\
    \ a way that\nfood waste can be decreased or even to avoiding over-stocking issues\
    \ completely.\nFigure 14. Retail problems classiﬁed by the proposed taxonomy.\n\
    4. Guidelines for the Use of Computational Intelligence Approaches in the Food\n\
    Supply Chain\nHaving presented and validated the taxonomy of FSC problems, this\
    \ section presents\na set of guidelines for researchers and practitioners in FSC\
    \ for the use of CI within this\ndomain (Figure 15). Concretely, we try to guide\
    \ the users to (1) select the typology of a\nCI problem that they are addressing;\
    \ and (2) identify what families of CI methods could\nbe more suitable for the\
    \ problem at hand. The latter does not mean that in all cases the\nfamily of methods\
    \ suggested is the most appropriate, as this may depend on the speciﬁc\ncharacteristics\
    \ of the problem being addressed.\nThe guidelines depicted in Figure 15 start\
    \ with a basic question posed to the user:\n“What is the purpose and modeling\
    \ characteristics of the problem at hand?” (it could be\ncommunication and perception,\
    \ uncertain knowledge and reasoning, knowledge discovery\nand function approximation,\
    \ and problem-solving). If the purpose is the automatic analysis\nand extraction\
    \ of information from digital images to decide on the action to be taken\nregarding\
    \ the management of food supply systems (communication and perception), the\n\
    suitable family of methods would be deep neural networks (e.g., convolutional\
    \ neural\nnetworks). This family of CI methods enables the creation of computer\
    \ vision systems,\nwhich allows the environment of object characteristics to be\
    \ perceived in a visual way.\nBased on this visual analysis, these systems communicate\
    \ or recommend actions that\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n22 of 34\nachieve desired\
    \ states or match predeﬁned conditions (e.g., identify the quality of potatoes\n\
    in order to evaluate the units that are either damaged or edible).\nFigure 15.\
    \ Guidelines for the method selection problem in the food supply chain. Pd: production,\
    \ Ps:\nprocessing, D: distribution, R: retail.\nIf the objective of the user is\
    \ to handle problems characterized by partially observable,\nnon-deterministic,\
    \ or imprecise data (uncertain knowledge and reasoning), fuzzy systems\nor probabilistic\
    \ methods are recommended. For the former CI approach, it is important\nto highlight\
    \ that fuzzy systems need to be paired with hardware (e.g., PID controllers)\n\
    to work properly in food applications. This is due to the fact that hardware components\n\
    allow decisions made by fuzzy systems to be translated into actions (e.g., management\n\
    of nutrients and irrigation supply inside a greenhouse system depending on conditions\n\
    associated with temperature). Probabilistic methods are suitable for making estimations\
    \ of\nrelevant variables (e.g., planning production according to seasonal demand)\
    \ in scenarios\nwith partially observable data.\nWhen the users’ aim is directed\
    \ at making predictions from historical data, making\nclassiﬁcations that discriminate\
    \ between data categories, or ﬁnding hidden patterns in data,\nthe best modeling\
    \ approach to use is knowledge discovery and function approximation.\nFirstly,\
    \ for predictions and classiﬁcations, the user should determine the type of input\n\
    data at hand. In general terms, the input data can be structured (e.g., historical\
    \ records,\ntabular data) or unstructured (e.g., video, images). In the former,\
    \ and depending on the\ndata size, the supervised learning techniques are the\
    \ CI methods to be used when facing\nsmall, medium, and large data no bigger than\
    \ 40–50 gigabytes. Supervised DL, how-\never, is the recommended approach for\
    \ big datasets. In terms of making predictions and\nclassiﬁcations when using\
    \ unstructured data, supervised DL would be the most suitable\nlearning approach;\
    \ while unsupervised ML or unsupervised DL are the recommended\nCI approaches\
    \ for pattern analysis. Finally, as we can see in Figure 15, the other category\n\
    of problems that users might face is problem-solving. In this case, the user’s\
    \ aim is to\noptimize particular values in order to achieve a desired level of\
    \ performance. As such,\nthe above-suggested approaches are therefore all meta-heuristics\
    \ (e.g., EC, SI, and local\nsearch-based techniques).\nIn addition to the analyses\
    \ presented above, the bottom part of Figure 15 also depicts\nwhich FSC stages\
    \ the four CI modeling approaches (and their associated methods) are\nusually\
    \ applied in. Fuzzy systems and probabilistic approaches are typically considered\
    \ for\ncontrol applications in the production, processing, and retail stages.\
    \ In contrast, optimiza-\ntion with meta-heuristics and prediction-classiﬁcation-pattern\
    \ analysis with ML and DL\nare modeling perspectives that are considered in the\
    \ entire FSC process. The contributions\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n23 of 34\nof\
    \ communication and perception approaches using DL methods tend to be more typically\n\
    focused on the production and retail stages.\n5. Conclusions\nThis ﬁnal section\
    \ introduces the main reﬂections drawn from the research carried out\nin this\
    \ paper. Section 5.1 introduces the summary and conclusions. Then, Section 5.2\
    \ details\na set of challenges and research opportunities to encourage further\
    \ exploration and use of\nthe possible contributions that CI might bring to the\
    \ FSC ﬁeld.\n5.1. Summary\nThis paper has proposed a new and comprehensive taxonomy\
    \ of FSC problems\nunder a CI paradigm for three representative supply chains:\
    \ agriculture, ﬁsh farming,\nand livestock. The taxonomy was built based on three\
    \ levels in order to categorize FSC\nproblems according to how they can be modeled\
    \ using CI approaches. The ﬁrst and second\nlevels are focused on identifying\
    \ the chain stage (production, processing, distribution,\nand retail) and the\
    \ speciﬁc FSC problem to be addressed (e.g., vehicle routing problems\nin the\
    \ distribution stage). The third level presents the typologies of FSC problems\
    \ from\na CI perspective, and aims to categorize FSC problems depending on how\
    \ they can be\nmodeled and solved by CI methods. In the third level of the taxonomy\
    \ we have deﬁned\nfour attributes, presented as follows, (1) problem solving,\
    \ which is in charge of classifying\nFSC problems focused on optimizing processes;\
    \ (2) uncertain knowledge and reasoning,\nwhich concers problems that have partially\
    \ observable, non-deterministic, incomplete, or\nimprecise data; (3) knowledge\
    \ discovery and function approximation, which has the role\nof categorizing problems\
    \ that aim to make predictions of future scenarios, classiﬁcation of\nvariables,\
    \ or analysis of patterns embedded in data; (4) communication and perception,\n\
    groups FSC problems that involve computer vision systems to sensing and suggesting\n\
    plausible actions to take in order to intervene in such environments.\nTo check\
    \ the robustness of the taxonomy, we categorized FSC problems with CI\nmethods,\
    \ especially in the production, processing, distribution, and retail stages. Here,\
    \ it is\nrelevant to highlight that we introduced a set of uniﬁed deﬁnitions for\
    \ these problems. As\na result, we were able to draw some interesting conclusions.\
    \ In the ﬁsh and livestock cases\nof the production stage, using the DL and the\
    \ communication and perception attribute\nsigniﬁcantly inﬂuences applications\
    \ (e.g., ﬁsh weight estimation, grassland monitoring,\nanimal welfare) where the\
    \ input data is determined by image and video records (non-\nstructured data).\
    \ In contrast, we have the case of classic ML, which is narrowed to FSC\nproblems,\
    \ and for which, the objective is to make production predictions using historical\n\
    data records (structured data). In the case of agriculture production systems,\
    \ the scope of\nthe CI approach is broader. Speciﬁcally, we found that DL, ML,\
    \ FL, and Meta-heuristics are\nmethods for modeling production problems related\
    \ to crop protection and yield, weather\nprediction, and irrigation and nutrient\
    \ management.\nIn the processing stage, ML, meta-heuristics, and probabilistic\
    \ methods are the CI\napproaches commonly used. In terms of ML, the aim is to\
    \ extract patterns and forecast\nobjective variables like demand prediction and\
    \ prediction of post-harvest losses. As for\nmeta-heuristics and probabilistic\
    \ techniques, they aim to optimize food manufacturing\nprocesses (e.g., heating,\
    \ drying) and production planning for distribution. Further down\nin the supply\
    \ chain, the predominant family of CI methods is meta-heuristics, found in\nthe\
    \ distribution link. This data-driven approach is devoted to optimizing the routing\n\
    and delivery problems under various constraints such as ﬂeet size and available\
    \ fuel.\nLastly, DL is the principal CI approach in problems with non-structured\
    \ input data (e.g.,\ndynamic discounting, diet, and nutrition) in the retail stage.\
    \ Classical ML has been used to\nextract patterns (food consumption and food waste)\
    \ and predict consumer demand and\nbuying behavior.\nThe taxonomy allowed us to\
    \ ﬁgure out which modeling approaches are more typically\nconsidered when dealing\
    \ with problems at the four supply chain stages. In this manner,\nSensors 2021,\
    \ 21, 6910\n24 of 34\nwe gave a general overview of well-established tendencies\
    \ regarding CI across the three\nsupply chains considered. Thus, the deﬁnition\
    \ and classiﬁcation of FSC problems helped\nus introduce guidelines for the incorporation\
    \ and use of CI in the food industry. These\nguidelines are built upon CI’s primary\
    \ purposes in the food supply chain: communication\nand perception, uncertain\
    \ knowledge and reasoning representations, knowledge discovery\nand function approximation,\
    \ and problem-solving. These guidelines aim to help non-expert\nCI users to identify\
    \ families of methods that can supply a solution for their particular CI-\nbased\
    \ needs in different FSC problems.\nIn summary, the taxonomy analysis suggests\
    \ that there is no family of CI methods\nthat best suits all FSC problems. However,\
    \ we state the need for a comparison framework\nthat allows the description and\
    \ analysis of the performance of different CI methods in\ndiverse supply chain\
    \ problems. In this context, the taxonomy presented sets up the basis\nfor a common\
    \ framework that, in further research, will facilitate experimentation in order\n\
    to determine which CI approaches are more appropriate for each type of FSC problem.\n\
    This may also help determine a suitable baseline of methods to make fair comparisons,\n\
    depending on the family of CI methods chosen for the FSC problem at hand.\n5.2.\
    \ Challenges and Research Opportunities\nAs industry 4.0 is ﬂourishing for the\
    \ FSC management and operation, emerging re-\nsearch paths arise for CI to yield\
    \ more robust, interoperable, and accurate methods [145,146].\nTherefore, this\
    \ section points out challenges and research opportunities that the community\n\
    should explore to enhance the contributions that CI can bring to the digitization\
    \ of the FSC.\nThese challenges are motivated by the gaps located at the intersection\
    \ of FSC and CI, which\nwere identiﬁed through the proposed taxonomy.\n5.2.1.\
    \ Data Fusion from Different Data Sources\nSigniﬁcantly, few CI methods can incorporate\
    \ data from different types of sources.\nBesides, in real scenarios, the data\
    \ available from a unique type of sensor might not be\nsufﬁcient to fully represent\
    \ the FSC problem that is intended to be addressed. For instance,\ndifferent Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., agricultural environment monitoring sys-\ntems,\
    \ GPS, cameras) provide diverse data for the optimum management of production\n\
    systems [147–149]. Amongst the relevant data for the aforementioned example, we\
    \ ﬁnd\ntemperature, humidity, localization coordinates, crop images, and others.\n\
    As a common denominator, all the data associated with the aforementioned variables\n\
    can have a different format, ranging from historical records in the form of tables,\
    \ to non-\nstructured data like images. Additionally, all of them offer valuable\
    \ information for the\npurpose at hand (e.g., prediction of crop production or\
    \ management of pest diseases). In\nthis context, the challenge lies in deﬁning\
    \ guidelines for the harmonizing and fusion of\ndata from diverse sources. Such\
    \ guidelines should consider that each FSC stage can add\nparticularities to the\
    \ data for the CI-based problem under consideration. How to properly\ncollect\
    \ and generate a single dataset with information obtained from varied and different\n\
    sources, which are fed into a CI method, is a research opportunity that must be\
    \ addressed\nto further enhance CI contributions in the FSC domain.\nIf the integration\
    \ process is not done correctly, inconsistencies will appear, resulting in\na\
    \ decrease in the performance of CI approaches [150]. Hence, merging data from\
    \ different\ninput sources presents a notorious problem that commonly attracts\
    \ more issues, such as\ninconsistent, duplicate, redundant, and correlated data.\
    \ One potential research direction\nto take to help cope with this challenge could\
    \ be designing automatic preprocessing\napproaches that fuse and harmonize data\
    \ sources to provide the accepted input format\nof CI methods. For the latter,\
    \ it is important to note that every CI approach requires\ndifferent input data\
    \ formats, which could split the design of the aforementioned automatic\ndata\
    \ preprocessing methods into diverse paths depending on the particular family\
    \ of CI\nmethods under consideration.\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n25 of 34\n5.2.2.\
    \ Real-Time Data and Incremental Learning\nIn supervised learning, the input data\
    \ is available before starting any training pro-\ncesses. Here, the task is to\
    \ build up a model from that data using a batch approach. The\nlatter means that\
    \ DL and ML methods use all available samples in the input data to build\nand\
    \ train a model to make predictions or classiﬁcations when new data comes into\
    \ the\ntrained model. Currently, most DL and ML applications are focused on the\
    \ batch learning\napproach, wherein data are given before training the ML models\
    \ [151]. In this context,\nmodel training and optimization processes are purely\
    \ based on the aforementioned in-\nput dataset, whose data distribution is supposed\
    \ to be static. Nevertheless, such a static\napproach is not the case for real\
    \ CI-based applications within the FSC.\nDL and ML methods must real FSC scenarios,\
    \ wherein different IoT devices continu-\nously generate new data streams. For\
    \ instance, dynamic discounts in the retail stage or the\nmanagement of greenhouse\
    \ systems whose conditions must be constantly monitored to\nguarantee the optimal\
    \ control of crops are examples of real-time data streams. Therefore,\nthe key\
    \ challenge is to design ML and DL methods that adapt to real-time data, and work\n\
    with limited resources (e.g., memory), while maintaining their predictive capacities.\n\
    Further research is needed to deal with the aforementioned challenge, and should\n\
    include the concepts of incremental learning [152,153] in the design and deployment\
    \ of\nDL and ML methods in FSC problems. Furthermore, although incremental learning\
    \ is a\nsuitable strategy when dealing with the adaptation of DL and ML to real-time\
    \ data streams,\nthe concept of incremental learning brings up other issues that\
    \ must be considered when it\nis included in the FSC context. These issues are\
    \ introduced in more detail below.\nThe ﬁrst issue is related to the concept of\
    \ drift, which is associated with changes in\nthe new input data’s statistical\
    \ properties (e.g., statistical distribution), which can highly\ninﬂuence the\
    \ performance of pre-trained DL or ML methods [154]. Secondly, we have\nthe stability-plasticity\
    \ dilemma that, in noisy environments, refers to when and how to\nadapt the current\
    \ model to the new data stream [155]. On the one hand, quick updates\nenable fast\
    \ adaptations of the model according to new data; however, at the same time, old\n\
    information that could be useful later in the process is forgotten just as quickly.\
    \ On the\nother hand, slow adaptations can be made, and old data is retained longer,\
    \ causing the\nmodel’s reactivity capacity to decrease; thereby, affecting the\
    \ model’s forecasting power.\nThus, deﬁning policies to balance the two scenarios\
    \ mentioned above is a relevant challenge\nto support the inclusion of CI approaches\
    \ in real-time data environments.\nFinally, the third challenge associated with\
    \ incremental learning is adaptive model\ncomplexity [156]. This issue is concerned\
    \ with the fact that as concept drift events become\nmore frequent, increasing\
    \ model complexity is required. Although the latter improves the\nmodel’s performance,\
    \ increasing its complexity leads to an increase in the need of more\ncomputational\
    \ resources, which are not always affordable or available in different domains,\n\
    such as FSC.\n5.2.3. Explainability of Computational Intelligence Methods\nNowadays,\
    \ CI systems have increased their capacity to carry out different tasks (e.g.,\n\
    predictions, classiﬁcation) with almost no human intervention and are achieving\
    \ high\nproﬁciency levels. In a narrow scope, if the only objective when evaluating\
    \ CI methods is\nperformance, such an object has clearly been achieved thanks\
    \ to this increasing capacity.\nNonetheless, when decisions derived from CI-based\
    \ techniques affect the dynamics of hu-\nman life (e.g., social, cultural, environmental\
    \ dimensions), understanding how CI systems\nhave achieved this performance becomes\
    \ necessary [157].\nWhile some CI approaches, such as fuzzy logic and ML methods\
    \ (e.g., rule-based\nlearners, decision trees), can provide different degrees\
    \ of interpretability and transparency\nof decisions made in their inner structure;\
    \ other methods cannot provide this information\n(e.g., black-box decision systems\
    \ [158]). In these cases, there are no clues regarding the\nsystems’ decisions\
    \ to obtain the ﬁnal result. One example is DL methods, whose complex\ninner structure\
    \ is full of intricate connections between layers and neurons and have a broad\n\
    Sensors 2021, 21, 6910\n26 of 34\nspace of hyperparameters. Therefore, understanding\
    \ where the high performance of DL\nmethods comes from is quite tricky.\nAs DL\
    \ is increasingly being employed in diverse FSC applications due to its per-\n\
    formance capacities, the demand for interpretability, explainability, and transparency\
    \ is\ngrowing between diverse FSC stakeholders. Such demand lies in the fact that\
    \ decisions\nmade based on CI systems can lead to actions, which can not be justiﬁed\
    \ or that require\ndetailed explanations [159] in order to enhance the management\
    \ of the supply chain. For\nexample, the shelf-life of perishable products needs\
    \ to be predicted in the distribution\nstage. However, understanding the factors\
    \ that inﬂuence the deterioration or preservation\nof food products is vital to\
    \ improve the management of distribution chains. The latter is\nknown as explainable\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (XAI) and is widely acknowledged as a crucial\nconcept\
    \ to be taken into account in the practical deployment of CI methods [160].\n\
    In this sense, as stated by [160], the challenge of XAI in different knowledge\
    \ domains,\nsuch as FSCs, is creating more explainable methods while maintaining\
    \ their output perfor-\nmance. Besides, it is crucial to facilitate stakeholder\
    \ understanding and trust in decisions\nsupported by CI systems whose outputs\
    \ become the basis for different actions along the\nwhole supply chain.\n5.2.4.\
    \ The Method Selection Problem\nAs shown in this research paper, depending on\
    \ the FSC problem at hand, different\ntypes of CI methods could be used. In this\
    \ sense, Section 4 provides helpful information\nto guide non-expert CI users\
    \ when choosing the most suitable CI family of methods\ndepending on the purpose\
    \ to be pursued (e.g., prediction, classiﬁcation, optimization). In\nthis context,\
    \ keeping in mind the no-free-lunch theorem [161] (which states that there is\n\
    no unique algorithm that can be competitive in all problems), the proposed guidelines\n\
    contribute to dealing with the model selection problem in the FSC area. Nevertheless,\n\
    having identiﬁed the most suitable families of CI methods, it is still difﬁcult\
    \ to choose the\nbest method within each family.\nFor instance, if the objective\
    \ is to optimize a food production process in the processing\nstage, the critical\
    \ question would be to ask what meta-heuristic approach is the most\nsuitable\
    \ for the considered problem. The answer to this question could be to use an\n\
    EC, SI, or local-based approach. However, solving such a decision requires a thorough\n\
    experimentation that demands a large amount of effort and is time-consuming [162].\n\
    Another similar example of the method selection problem is the case of ML. FSC\
    \ data\nallows different variables of interest to be predicted under diverse scenarios,\
    \ ranging from\nﬁsh farming production to agriculture. These characteristics of\
    \ the production context\ninﬂuence ML method performance, and selecting the most\
    \ appropriate method from a\npool of candidates is a time-consuming task. Thus,\
    \ the automation of choosing the best CI\ntechnique from a predeﬁned set of methods\
    \ of the same family is a crucial challenge that\ncould help increase inclusion\
    \ of CI into the FSC.\nCurrently, there are well-established automated approaches\
    \ focused on ML and DL.\nTherefore, we can use the automation of complete ML or\
    \ DL workﬂows, known as Auto-\nmated Machine learning (AutoML) [163] and Automated\
    \ Deep learning (AutoDL) [164].\nSuch approaches are considered to be promising\
    \ strategies to reduce human effort and\ntime cost of ML and DL in research areas\
    \ in which specialized knowledge is an asset\nthat is not always available or\
    \ affordable. Particularly, AutoML and AutoDL seek to ﬁnd\ncompetitive ML pipelines\
    \ (the workﬂow from data preprocessing to model selection) and\nneural network\
    \ architectures automatically without almost any human intervention. The\ncentral\
    \ purpose is maximizing or minimizing a performance metric on input data without\n\
    it having to be specialized in the problem domain where the data comes.\nAutoML\
    \ and AutoDL methods have been successfully used in other areas [165,166].\nHowever,\
    \ an extensive analysis to determine their strengths and weaknesses has not been\n\
    carried out in very diverse learning tasks, such as FSCs. Additionally, the concept\
    \ of\nAutoML and AutoDL could be extrapolated to an even broader space, such as\
    \ automated\nSensors 2021, 21, 6910\n27 of 34\ncomputational intelligence. In\
    \ this case, the focus would be on supporting non-expert\nusers in selecting other\
    \ CI techniques like meta-heuristics and its sub-families (e.g., EC,\nSI, local-based\
    \ approaches). In this context, the research challenge lies in the design and\n\
    development of automated methods for other families of CI methods, including fuzzy\n\
    logic, meta-heuristic, probabilistic methods, and others.\n5.2.5. Interoperability\
    \ and Deployment of CI with Information and\nCommunication Technologies\nCI is\
    \ only one part of the entire ICT ecosystem required to digitize processes in\
    \ the\nFSC. IoT technologies, information storage and management technologies,\
    \ data analytic\nand visualization tools, or decision support technologies are\
    \ other relevant components\nwithout which CI cannot reach its full potential.\
    \ All these technologies have switched the\nfocus from traditional automation\
    \ of FSC processes to a cloud-based paradigm where all\nICTs operate efﬁciently\
    \ and intuitively [167]. Within the cloud-based approaches, major\ntechnologies\
    \ must be able to interoperate with each other and themselves. Thus, such\ninterconnectivity\
    \ and exchange of information are some of the main challenges raised\nwhen incorporating\
    \ CI and other industry 4.0 approaches into the daily operation and\nmanagement\
    \ of FSCs [168].\nOne of the latent issues is the lack of standardization of the\
    \ data models with CI\nmethods. Ultimately the goal of Industry 4.0 in FSCs is\
    \ to incorporate semantic interoper-\nability, which enables systems to exchange\
    \ information with unambiguous meaning [169].\nHowever, the study of interoperability\
    \ standards for CI approaches is a research area that\nstill needs to be fully\
    \ exploited. The demand for these standards is also growing at a\npace never seen\
    \ before, as the current trend of Industry 4.0 is characterized by complex\nautomation\
    \ and production systems where CI works with a wide variety of standards,\ncomponents,\
    \ and services in a cloud-based environment [170]. Despite such challenges, re-\n\
    cent advances have been made in interoperability standards for cloud-based environments.\n\
    Some examples are the interoperable cloud-based manufacturing system [171], the\
    \ hybrid\nmanufacturing cloud framework [172], and the new generation artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence-driven\nintelligent manufacturing architecture [173].\nAnother\
    \ big challenge of CI in integration with ICTs lies in the manufacturing pro-\n\
    cesses of the FSC production stage. Nowadays, CI approaches are usually focused\
    \ on\nmaximizing accuracy without considering the resources they consume. Nevertheless,\
    \ with\nthe increasing demand of developing a globally low carbon economy, the\
    \ need to build an\nintelligent and environmentally friendly food industry is\
    \ becoming more urgent [174,175].\nIn this sense, CI approaches require that a\
    \ balance be struck between the computational\nresources they use, the energy\
    \ they consume, and the performance they can achieve in the\ntime-frame allowed\
    \ by food manufacturing processes [176]. Furthermore, the aforemen-\ntioned resources\
    \ are assets that are not always available in small- and medium-sized food\nindustries.\
    \ Therefore, more research is required to develop CI methods that are capable\n\
    of being deployed in IoT devices and smart manufacturing industries under different\n\
    constraints like energy efﬁciency and computational resources. In conclusion,\
    \ this research\npath could imply bringing in the concepts of edge computing and\
    \ fog computing [177] for\nthe efﬁcient inclusion of CI in food manufacturing\
    \ processes [178].\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.S.A.-Z., A.A.-V.\

  explanation: 'The paper investigates the application of Internet of Things (IoT)
    and 5G technology in the domain of automated irrigation systems for real-time
    management of tomato cultivation. The authors propose a framework that utilizes
    IoT sensors to collect soil moisture data and control the irrigation system intelligently
    based on the data collected. The framework also incorporates a mobile application
    that provides farmers with useful information and allows them to remotely monitor
    and manage the irrigation system.


    The authors evaluate the performance of their proposed framework through extensive
    experimentation and analysis of previously stored data. Their results indicate
    that the framework can significantly improve the efficiency of irrigation by reducing
    water usage and optimizing crop yields. They also highlight the benefits of using
    5G technology for real-time data transmission and remote management of the irrigation
    system.'

    devices can aid farmers in keeping track crop health and development while also\n\
    automating a variety of tasks (such as moisture level prediction, irrigation system,\n\

    DOI 10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years, no other invention\
    \ has generated as much\nexcitement in the computing world as the Internet. Because\
    \ of its\ntremendous strength and breadth of uses, it is virtually ubiquitous\n\
    in every sector of human endeavor (Kumar et al., 2017; Poyen et al.,\n2020; Terence\
    \ and Purushothaman, 2020). People and\norganizations have connected with amazing\
    \ agility and\nconvenience in recent years, thanks to a vast 5G network of\nwireless\
    \ sensor networks (WSNs), healthcare services, cellphones,\nand various sorts\
    \ of pervasive real-time monitoring systems\n(Lakshmiprabha and Govindaraju, 2019;\
    \ Hassan et al., 2021). The\nhuman population is expanding at an alarming rate,\
    \ but at the same\ntime, pollution is slowly depleting the earth’s water and land\n\
    supplies. Smart agriculture is seen as playing a crucial role in\nresponding to\
    \ these issues. Smart agriculture has the potential to\nvastly enhance both the\
    \ agroecological setting and the yield and\nquality of agricultural products while\
    \ simultaneously decreasing the\nneed for harmful chemical fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ (Zhang et al.,\n2022). The use of ICTs to automate and intelligently manage\n\
    agricultural cultivation and production is central to the concept\nof “smart agriculture.”\
    \ In particular, wireless communications play\na signiﬁcant role in the growth\
    \ of agriculture, and each new\ngeneration of wireless communication technology\
    \ propels farming\ntoward a higher level of intelligence.\nPeople and objects\
    \ may connect in real-time thanks to the 5G\nnetwork-based Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT), which provides important\nservices and value to millions of people across\
    \ the world (Guevara\net al., 2020; Biswal et al., 2021). 5G network-based IoT\
    \ has\ndeveloped organically into a gigantic technology platform. South\nAmerica\
    \ has initiated a yearly warm-season tomato yield that\nbelongs to the Solanaceae\
    \ family (Van Eck et al., 2019; Kumar\net al., 2022).\nDespite requiring high\
    \ amounts of fertilizer, tomato is a\npopular or demanding plant due to its health\
    \ signiﬁcance to the\nwhole world, with high levels of antioxidants such as carotenoid,\n\
    lycopene, and vitamins C and A and phenolic compounds, which\nprovide a wide range\
    \ of health advantages for the consumers\n(Campestrini et al., 2019; Samanta et\
    \ al., 2020; Chen P. et al.,\n2021). Tshiala and Olwoch reported that tomatoes\
    \ have been used\nin food preparation throughout the world as fresh vegetables\
    \ or as\nspices. It has a vital role in the Ethiopian marketing of vegetables\n\
    (Guodaar et al., 2020; Biswas et al., 2021). The production of\ntomatoes was used\
    \ as a job opportunity and as an income source\nfor producers.\nNutrient and water\
    \ supplies have a signiﬁcant impact on tomato\nquality, and their highest water\
    \ demand is quoted in an unpublished\npaper. Some poisonous elements and inorganic\
    \ substances that are\ndangerous to people can demonstrate water quality (Sanjuan-Delm´\n\
    as et al., 2020; Chen P. et al., 2021). This may be a problem for\nirrigation\
    \ using municipal wastewater. Although municipal\nwastewaters have been applied\
    \ as much as possible to irrigation,\nthey contain comparatively maximum sodium\
    \ quantities that can\nbe accumulated with this wastewater and have toxic effects\
    \ on plant\nsoils during optimized irrigation (Jayalakshmi and Gomathi, 2019;\n\
    Leuther et al., 2019; Casadei et al., 2021). The various types of crop\ngrowth\
    \ models are extremely useful in optimizing irrigation\npractices which are based\
    \ on physical or semi-empirical equations\nfor simpliﬁcation of the complex mechanism\
    \ and also having many\nparameters in the process (Sanjuan-Delm´as et al., 2020).\
    \ Because\nof its balance of simplicity, accuracy, and robustness, the AquaCrop\n\
    model developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)\nhas provided a\
    \ method for calculating crop yields and optimal\nirrigation scheduling for various\
    \ crops in different climates. In the\ncurrent real-time model, parameters like\
    \ soil moisture (SM), crop\ncultivation, leaf area index (LAI), or canopy cover\
    \ (CC) are\ncollected using various remote sensing devices. As a result, this\n\
    real-time cultivation process is an upgraded and fully dynamic\nversion of the\
    \ traditional models (Leuther et al., 2019; Chen P.\net al., 2021).\nA fast and\
    \ dependable Internet connection is necessary for\nagricultural IoT devices to\
    \ function. The current generation of\nmobile networks is failing due to insufﬁcient\
    \ connectivity in rural\nareas, and even in areas with high-speed access, failure\
    \ occurs due to\nmassive demand. According to a recent survey, nearly 80% of rural\n\
    areas, even in the United Kingdom, are outside of the 4G range. The\ncurrent degree\
    \ of network access in rural areas is insufﬁcient in most\nnations (Tang et al.,\
    \ 2021). In addition, in some developed\ncountries, there are multiple farms with\
    \ a large number of IoT\ndevices and machines that require a constant reliable\
    \ high-speed\nInternet connection to exchange a large amount of data, and the\n\
    technologies of the current generation of mobile networks cannot\ncope with these\
    \ demands (Singh et al., 2022). To fulﬁll these goals,\nmany promising technologies,\
    \ such as massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO), network slicing, and\
    \ smaller cells, are\nneeded to provide reliable connectivity over a larger distance.\n\
    Therefore, the smart mobile network is well suited to support\nsmart farming by\
    \ enabling wide coverage, low-energy\nconsumption, low-cost devices, and high\
    \ spectrum efﬁciency.\nUnfortunately, the IoT-based network’s usage of microwaves\n\
    (MWs) as carriers limits its ability to cover wide areas. The\nintroduction of\
    \ small base stations spaced at roughly 250 m\nintervals over coverage regions\
    \ that can be extended to any size\nallows for continuous connectivity, thanks\
    \ to the small cell\nconcept. In order to link the bigger areas, the related small\n\
    towers can be placed everywhere (on lamp posts, in trees, on\nroofs, on tops of\
    \ vehicles, etc.). Similar to 4G, this implementation\nmakes use of the massive\
    \ MIMO approach by equipping nodes\nwith many antennas for sending and receiving\
    \ data in order to\nincrease the network’s capacity. On the other hand, huge MIMO\n\
    makes signal interference more likely. Beamforming is used to\nincrease the throughput\
    \ of transmitted data and thereby solve this\nissue. Beamforming refers to an\
    \ antenna’s capability of directing\nfocused beams of radio waves at speciﬁc targets.\
    \ An advanced\nInternet connection provides very high (MW) operating\nfrequencies,\
    \ and the accompanying high bandwidth makes it\npossible for larger and more rapid\
    \ data transactions. In contrast\nto the static channels used by the 4G network,\
    \ the cognitive radio\napproach used by the smart network allows for device-speciﬁc\n\
    channel allocation.\nSingh et al.\n10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant\
    \ Science\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nIn 2017, for the ﬁrst time, the 5G RuralFirst\
    \ project successfully\nplanted and harvested a crop using autonomous tractors\
    \ to sow\nseeds, drones to monitor crops, and machines to apply water,\nfertilizer,\
    \ and pesticides. The entire procedure was carried out\nwithout the need for any\
    \ laborers. Another initiative, Hands Free\nHectare, claimed a successful harvest\
    \ in 2018 (Al-Ghobari and\nMohammad, 2011). With greater technological breakthroughs,\
    \ 5G\nis projected to promote precision farming. As IoT-based network\ncoverage\
    \ grows, agricultural sector producers will beneﬁt greatly,\nallowing them to\
    \ manage farms, animals, and other assets from the\ncomfort of their own homes,\
    \ thanks to their big capacity, fast data\nspeed, and low latency. Smart technology\
    \ will help to advance IoT\nsensor connectivity to the next level, paving the\
    \ way for\nunprecedented innovation in smart farming components.\nImplementing\
    \ technology to automate, track, and monitor\nagricultural processes is a wise\
    \ solution to the irrigation problem.\nThe traditional irrigation method is fully\
    \ automated by using IoT\nintegration modules. However, with an advanced network\
    \ on the\nhorizon, smart agriculture will take off with lightning-fast\ndata transfer.\n\
    To improve farm produce quality, smart farming combines\ntraditional agronomic\
    \ practices with the IoT. The application of\nnew technology in agriculture can\
    \ assist farmers in reducing labor\nand costs while increasing crop yield and\
    \ production. To facilitate\nall of these agricultural beneﬁts, the IoT includes\
    \ a wide range of\ncomponents under digital and automated technologies. So, IoT-\n\
    based connectivity will vastly increase the impact due to low latency,\nhigh bandwidth,\
    \ and support for many sensors communicating at\nthe same time.\nThe IoT technology\
    \ platform already helps to increase\nproductivity and ensure proper resource\
    \ utilization through\nprecision agriculture. The implementation of IoT, on the\
    \ other\nhand, will help to accelerate the entire process with machine-to-\nmachine\
    \ services. The real-time data transfer capabilities of the IoT\nmodule can aid\
    \ in the rapid operation of these solutions, making\ndecision-making quick, robust,\
    \ data-oriented, and real-time. With\nan IoT-based network, these devices can\
    \ send real-time data about\nthe need for optimal irrigation, spoilt crops, and\
    \ their location to\nfollow-up machinery. Farmers can save time and money by\n\
    harvesting crops quickly and effectively with automated irrigation\nfor tomato\
    \ crop cultivation.\nThe key contributions of this paper are as follows:\n•\n\
    An efﬁcient IoT-based framework is proposed for tomato\ncultivation.\n•\nMoisture\
    \ levels in the soil are predicted with the help of IoT\nmodules to optimize the\
    \ irrigation system.\n•\nA mobile application is also developed that can help\
    \ farmers\nby providing useful information.\nThe remaining parts of the paper\
    \ are arranged as follows. Section\n2 discusses the literature review. Section\
    \ 3 explains the things used\nfor designing smart farming solutions. Section 4\
    \ details the proposed\nsystem and the methodology. The simulation setup and results\n\
    analyses are described in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.\n2 Literature\
    \ review\nChen et al. (2019) discussed the proper utilization of water for\nthe\
    \ growth of tomatoes by using the fuzzy neural network with a\ngenetic algorithm\
    \ (GA). It predicted the volume of irrigation based\non the effect of greenhouse\
    \ and the growth of crops (Guha et al.,\n2021). Rodrı́guez et al (Rodr´ıguez-Ortega\
    \ et al., 2019). developed a\nsoilless technique to yield tomato crops through\
    \ the treatment of\nsalinity. Here, the salinity treatment was speciﬁcally used\
    \ to\nimprove the production of vegetables and nutritional imbalance\n(psychological\
    \ of plants) for crops. Zhai et al. (2015) proposed an\nidea for the cultivation\
    \ of tomatoes using saline water and the\nblossom-end rot technique. Implementing\
    \ these two yield methods\nenhanced the level of production.\nIn the study of\
    \ Shao et al. (2014), two levels of irrigation\ntechniques were designed for heavy\
    \ rain shelters and drainage\ntreatments for improving the productivity of crops.\
    \ An optimum\nirrigation management technique was designed for yielding quality\n\
    tomatoes through the proper arrangement of rain shelters (Keswani\net al., 2020;\
    \ Maroli et al., 2021; Mousavi et al., 2021). In the study of\nGil et al. (2019),\
    \ the smart grid system monitored the precision for\nirrigation of water on demand\
    \ using IoT. The authors added\ndesalination and solar energy processes in the\
    \ agricultural system\nfor efﬁcient cultivation.\nKrishna et al. (2017) designed\
    \ a smart farming method for\nintelligent water-saving irrigation using the Raspberry\
    \ Pi module\nand sensors. So, it automated the yielding of crops in a higher range\n\
    that regulates through IoT modules. Qiu et al. (2020) implemented\nan in-depth\
    \ process to collect phenotypic parameters for measuring\nthe growth of tomatoes.\
    \ This system precisely calculated the\ndeﬁciency of water level and fertilizer\
    \ with the help of a neural\nnetwork algorithm for the growth cycle of tomato\
    \ (Khamparia et al.,\n2020; Biswal et al., 2021). An intelligent irrigation system\
    \ was\ndeﬁned as the water requirement for the yielding of tomatoes\nduring a\
    \ various range of climate states by Mason et al. (2019). In\nthis study, smart\
    \ irrigation was used in an adverse situation through\nproper integration of the\
    \ IoT module, sensors, and connectionless\nenvironments (Chen M. et al., 2021).\n\
    In the agriculture industry, 4G/3G/NB-IoT wireless network\ntechnology is used\
    \ to connect IoT-based smart devices for the\npurposes of data sharing, precise\
    \ assessment, accurate calculation,\netc (Dell’Uomo and Scarrone, 2002). Although\
    \ the 3G/4G\nnetworking paradigm has shown much promise, there are still\nseveral\
    \ obstacles that may prevent it from being used to its full\npotential in the\
    \ agriculture sector. One of the main restraints is the\navailable working space.\
    \ Existing wireless networks do not reach out\nto rural areas or dense urban neighborhoods.\
    \ Channel\ncircumstances, resource allocation, ﬂuctuating data rates, and\nhandoff\
    \ problems between diverse networks all make it difﬁcult to\nfacilitate quality\
    \ of service (QoS) in 4G networks (Payaswini and\nManjaiah, 2014; Payero et al.,\
    \ 2017). Mobile devices in this network\nhave a short lifespan due to the utilization\
    \ of many antennas and\ntransmitters. Many modern agricultural sectors rely on\
    \ battery-\npowered technologies like drones and robots, but these have limited\n\
    usefulness in far-ﬂung crop ﬁelds. The number of IoT devices used\nSingh et al.\n\
    10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n03\nin\
    \ smart farming, as well as the amount of research done on these\ndevices, is\
    \ growing rapidly, necessitating greater intelligence, speed,\nscalability, secure\
    \ communication capabilities, and processing\npower to handle the numerous complex\
    \ computational tasks and\nheavily utilized services. Having ultralow latency\
    \ in addition to high\nconnection is necessary for IoT devices to achieve quick\n\
    performance and low costs.\nThe current 4G networks (LTE) are limited in their\
    \ ability to\nenable such functionalities because they only permit connectivity\n\
    through IP-based packet switching (Zhaogan et al., 2007). The shift\nto 5G cellular\
    \ networks will eliminate these problems caused by\nprevious generations of wireless\
    \ technology. Due to advancements\nin 5G connectivity, farmers now have the option\
    \ of remotely\npiloting a drone over extensive distances, either manually or via\n\
    predetermined checkpoints (Faraci et al., 2018; Sinha and\nDhanalakshmi, 2022).\
    \ A farmer can get high-deﬁnition video\nstreams and other critical sensory data\
    \ and telemetry from drones\nin real time over the 5G cellular network, which\
    \ is more efﬁcient\nand reliable than previous-generation mobile networks\n(Bhattacharya\
    \ and De, 2021). Due to 5G technology, drones will\nnot need to carry a lot of\
    \ computing power and instead can upload\ntheir data to the cloud, where it will\
    \ be processed more quickly.\nTo demonstrate the importance of smart agriculture,\n\
    Thilakarathne et al. (2023) show a cloud-enabled, low-cost\nsensorized Internet\
    \ of Things platform for monitoring and\nautomating processes related to a tomato\
    \ plantation in a\ncontrolled indoor setting. We hope that the information gleaned\n\
    from this study will be used as a foundation for advancing smart\nagriculture\
    \ solutions that boost productivity and quality and pave\nthe way for a more sustainable\
    \ future.\nUsman et al. (2022) present a 6G use case for plant health\nmonitoring\
    \ using a terahertz (THz)-signal-based integrated\nsensor and communication system.\
    \ Precision agriculture is best\nunderstood as a smart management system with\
    \ the capacity to\ntrack and regulate plant health and water levels on both a\n\
    microscopic and a macro scale. The objective is to maximize\noutput while minimizing\
    \ waste of scarce resources. THz-based\nsensing technology, which can evaluate\
    \ plant health on a cellular\nlevel, combined with wireless sensor networks installed\
    \ within\ncrops to monitor multiple variables while making intelligent\ndecisions,\
    \ could have signiﬁcant implications for agriculture. A\nsustainable communication\
    \ infrastructure that takes into account\nthe needs of dispersed and adaptable\
    \ agricultural settings is\nnecessary for the integration and operation of such\
    \ a macro–\nnano-sensor system.\n3 Materials and methods\nThe growth and productivity\
    \ of plants depend mainly on how\nmuch water is formed during the seedling phase.\
    \ During this time,\nwater demand has an important effect on crops, which have\
    \ many\nenvironmental aspects like temperature, quality of soil, etc. The\napplication\
    \ of IoT in agriculture is limitless, which provides various\nintelligent devices\
    \ to improve yielding performance and proﬁt\n(Gomathy et al., 2020; Sivakumar\
    \ et al., 2020). However, there are\nvarious issues with investing in smart cultivation\
    \ and also difﬁculty\nin the development of agriculture-related IoT apps (Kamienski\n\
    et al., 2019; Conesa et al., 2021).\na) Hardware unit:\nThe information will inﬂuence\
    \ the development of IoT\nsolutions for farming, and there is a need to select\
    \ sensors to\ncreate the custom device that will collect data for the proposed\n\
    solution (Althar and Samanta, 2021; Guha and Samanta, 2021;\nZhang et al., 2021).\
    \ However, the quality of the sensors has a crucial\npart in production which\
    \ depends on the exactness of the collected\ndata and its consistency.\nb) Brain\
    \ unit:\nSmart agriculture should be used as data analytics for a design\nsolution\
    \ that will be helpful if yeomen cannot make sense of it, so\nthere is a need\
    \ to use powerful data analytics techniques and relate\npredictive algorithms\
    \ and machine learning methods for\ncollecting data.\nc) Maintenance unit:\nHardware\
    \ maintenance is a signiﬁcant challenge for IoT-based\nagriculture, while the\
    \ sensors are commonly used in the crop ﬁeld.\nThere are more chances for damaged\
    \ sensors, which needs to be\naddressed by making a smart device that is robust\
    \ and easy to\nsustain. Otherwise, it needs to be replaced with another sensor.\n\
    d) Mobility stage:\nSmart farming applications can be remotely monitored through\n\
    a smartphone or desktop computer for transmitting related yielding\ninformation\
    \ to the owner (Maheswari et al., 2021; Mekala et al.,\n2021). The integration\
    \ of devices should be autonomous and also\ncover enough wireless range to communicate\
    \ and send data to the\ncentral server.\ne) Infrastructure unit:\nA solid and\
    \ robust internal infrastructure needs to ensure that\nthe intelligent cropping\
    \ process performs well and securely handles\nthe data load in it.\nIf the process\
    \ disables the security, someone easily breaks the\nentire system and steals related\
    \ data or controls intelligent devices.\n3.1 Agricultural/crop production system\n\
    The cultivation model can be used to monitor or calculate the\namount of native\
    \ agricultural products, depending upon the\ncultivated area and supported by\
    \ the decision support system\n(Nagarajan and Minu, 2018). Figure 1 shows the\
    \ agricultural/crop\nproduction prediction factors.\nThe number of exports and\
    \ imports of agricultural products can\nbe derived from the prediction model of\
    \ the National Statistical\nOfﬁce’s (NSO) statistics database as depicted in this\
    \ section. The\nagricultural product crop and yielded area models are worked under\n\
    the production of the smart agricultural prediction model, which\nevaluates the\
    \ updated method as well as the predecessor observation\nmethod to reinterpret\
    \ it.\nlnAx,t = a0 + a1lnRPx,t−1 + a2lnRPy,t + a3lnAx,t−1\n(1)\nSingh et al.\n\
    10.3389/fpls.2023.1239594\nFrontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n04\nwhere\
    \ Ax,t is seeding in x yield design at t year, Ax,t−1 is seeding\nin x yield design\
    \ at t−1 year, RPx,t−1 is the marketplace value in x\nyield design at t−1 year,\
    \ and RPy,t is the market place value in y yield\ndesign at t year.\nY Dx,t =\
    \ b0 + b1WT1\nx,t + b2WT2\nx,t\n(2)\nwhere Y Dx,t is the crop in x yield design\
    \ at t year, WTx,t\n1 is the\nweather (temperature) in x yield design at t year,\
    \ and WTx,t\n2 is the\nclimate (amount of rainfall) in x yield design at t year.\n\
    The quantity of domestic products is the summation of\nagricultural products of\
    \ all individual yield areas and each\nfunctional value of it (Gurunath et al.,\
    \ 2018; Mohanty et al., 2019;\nBenyezza et al., 2021). The agricultural product\
    \ amount is the\nmultiplication of the ﬁeld with the crop model.\nThe demand method\
    \ of the crop is the multiplication of the\ndemand method per method in addition\
    \ to the demands of the\nwhole community. The resource purposes of agricultural\
    \ products\ndepend on export and import scenarios and other supporting\nfactors,\
    \ as depicted in Figure 1. The above equations must follow\n“Nerlove’s partial\
    \ adjustment model,” and the regional weather\ninformation can help concede the\
    \ prediction although there are\nsome missing values (El-Zawily et al., 2019).\n\
    3.2 Challenges in the purpose system\nDespite the many advantages that the 3G/4G\
    \ networking\nparadigm offers, there are still several obstacles that prevent\
    \ it\nfrom being used to its full potential in the agriculture industry.\nSpace\
    \ constraints pose serious problems. Current wireless networks\nare unable to\
    \ reach more remote places or crowded metropolitan\nneighborhoods. Supporting\
    \ the quality of service (QoS) in 4G\nnetworks is difﬁcult due to channel conditions,\
    \ resource\nallocation, varying data rates, and handoff problems between\nheterogeneous\
    \ networks. Due to the heavy use of antennae and\ntransmitters in this network,\
    \ the lifespan of mobile devices is short.\nIn order for Internet of Things devices\
    \ to deliver quick performance\nat low prices, ultralow latency must be paired\
    \ with a strong\nconnection. Due to the limitations of IP-based packet switching\n\
    connectivity on the existing 4G network (LTE), such features are\nnow unavailable.\
    \ These issues, which have plagued earlier\ngenerations of cellular networks,\
    \ will be eradicated with the\ntransition to IoT-based networks.\nDue to its massive\
    \ data capacity and speeds greater than 10 Gbps,\nIoT-based connection will be\
    \ able to link billions of devices. For both\ndownload and upload speeds, 5G networks\
    \ are expected to be up to 100\ntimes faster than their 4G and 4G LTE predecessors.\
    \ 5G can connect\nbillions of devices due to its increased bandwidth, in addition\
    \ to its large\ndata capacity and speeds faster than 10 Gbps. The download and\
    \ upload\nspeeds of IoT-based networks will be up to 100 times faster than those\
    \ of\n4G and 4G LTE networks. Consequently, a 2-h movie that would take 6\nmin\
    \ to download on 4G would take less than 4 s to download on an\nadvanced network.\
    \ Technical speciﬁcations for 5G are being developed\nby the International Telecommunication\
    \ Union (ITU). The uplink peak\ndata rate is 10 Gbps, and the downlink peak data\
    \ rate is 20 Gbps per\nmobile station. Therefore, an IoT-enabled network is used\
    \ for the\nInternet of Things-based smart irrigation system, which allows for\n\
    remote monitoring of soil moisture and watering.\n3.3 Mobile application\nA mobile\
    \ application is accessed by farmers on farms. Using this\napplication, we can\
    \ make predictions utilizing insight data and the\ncollected cultivation insights\
    \ data (Dhanush et al., 2017; Hota et al.,\n2020; Maheswari et al., 2021). The\
    \ mobile application will provide\ncrop-relevant information like crop health\
    \ alerts, pest control, and\nwarehouse inventory managing warnings as shown below.\
    \ The key\nfeatures of mobile applications are as follows:\n•\nobserving yield\
    \ health facts (nutrient levels, pH levels, etc.)\nthrough the functionality of\
    \ yield inspection (Ahmadi et al.,\n2019),\n•\nthe application of organizing fertilizer\
    \ and insecticides for\nthe farm (Kiryushin, 2019),\n•\nautomating the irrigation\
    \ system and controlling water\nlevels as well as soil health over the farm (Al-Ali\
    \ et al.,\n2019; Li et al., 2020), and\n•\ntracing yield records and checking\
    \ warehouse details (bin\ninventories) (Quitaleg and Ortiz, 2020).\nFIGURE 1\n\

    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n05\n3.4 Impact of water quality on\
    \ tomato yield\nTomato yield is a broad view that encompasses the interactions\n\
    of various single-quality attributes. Irrigation water salinity\nenhanced tomato\
    \ amounts, fruit thickness, soluble solids, total\nacid, vitamin C, and the sugar–acid\
    \ ratio (Magán et al., 2008).\nFresh tomato yield, canopy diameter, fruit water\
    \ content,\ntomato ﬁrmness, and calcium and nitrogen concentrations\ndecreased\
    \ as water salinity levels increased, whereas increasing\nsalinity levels increased\
    \ texture strength (Shao et al., 2014). In\naddition, saline water irrigation\
    \ increased tomato fruit’s total\nsoluble solids and acidity (pH) by 11.1% and\
    \ 6.9%, respectively.\n3.5 Role of the contactless IR sensors for\ntomato crop\
    \ growth measurement\nThe contactless IR sensors are used to produce infrared\n\
    radiation to measure the plant’s growth from its stem, whereas\nthe radiation\
    \ is converted into some amount of electricity and is less\nthan 10 cm from the\
    \ target. In the proposed system, sensors are\nplaced more than 10 cm from the\
    \ plant, which will measure growth\nby using a method based on the speculation\
    \ of infrared energy. The\nIR sensors are ﬁtted with infrared ﬁlters to avoid\
    \ outside disturbing\nlight. IR sensors are ﬁtted to measure the thickness growth\
    \ of\ntomato crops through the analog output voltage. The energy\nradiations of\
    \ infrared sensors are transformed into distance data,\nwhich is not directly\
    \ propositional to distance data.\n4 Proposed system and methods\nThe evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) crop is described as the amount of\nwater necessary for the perfect growth\
    \ of various crops in\nconnection with the lack of water by evapotranspiration\
    \ which is\ndiscussed in this system. The demand for yielding waters refers to\n\
    an optimally developed harvest, so that a consistent, disease-free\ncrop is actively\
    \ cultivated and completely sheltered. An advanced\nnetwork can connect billions\
    \ of devices due to its increased\nbandwidth, in addition to its large data capacity\
    \ and speeds faster\nthan 10 Gbps. The download and upload speeds of smart networks\n\
    will be up to 100 times faster than those of 4G and 4G LTE\nnetworks. So, this\
    \ method is advantageous in addition to IoT\nmodules, which gives a perfect way\
    \ to produce tomatoes in the\nseasonal and non-seasonal periods. The cultivation\
    \ process is\nmainly inﬂuenced by the following situations like weather, yield\n\
    type, and development stage of the harvest, which is depicted in\nFigures 2, 3.\n\
    The proposed system is integrated with the following\ncomponents which are described\
    \ below:\ni. Arduino Uno microcontroller:\nIt is an open-source microcontroller\
    \ that can be programmed\nby writing C or C++ code to control the overall system\
    \ automation.\nAfter installing and programming the Arduino, it is ready to collect\n\
    the number of inputs from IR moisture soil sensors and also provide\na remote\
    \ command to control the irrigation system. However, this\nmicrocontroller remotely\
    \ controls the overall execution process.\nii. NIR-soil moisture sensor:\nSoil\
    \ moisture is a main attribute of soil and an important soil\nproperty that plays\
    \ a vital role in a variety of farming activities,\nhydrological processes, and\
    \ environmental concerns. A near-\ninfrared (NIR) reﬂectance sensor is created\
    \ for the calculation of\nmoisture levels in the soil by implementing two light-emitting\n\
    diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths: one with a wavelength of\n1,945 nm and\
    \ a strong water absorption band and the other with a\nwavelength of 1,850 nm\
    \ and a weak water absorption band. It is\nlinked to an Arduino controller to\
    \ record the moisture level of the\nsoil. Accordingly, it gives instructions to\
    \ the water controller for\nirrigation in the tomato cultivation land.\niii. Pinolex\
    \ drip automatic water controller:\nThe smart ﬂower irrigation timer is an efﬁcient\
    \ way to manage\nand control tomato crop irrigation needs. When you go on vacation\n\
    or anywhere, an automatic water timer is set by the Arduino\nmicrocontroller,\
    \ which is useful for watering tomato cultivation.\nIt ﬁts a 3/4-inch (19 mm)\
    \ thread tap. It can water the plants\nregularly, even when no one is at home,\
    \ and thus improve their\nsurvival rate.\niv. Wi-Fi access point:\nFIGURE 2\n\
    The proposed system for the smart irrigation of tomato yields.\nSingh et al.\n\

    \ high-speed Ethernet wire links a router to an access point,\nwhich transforms\
    \ a connection-oriented signal into a\nconnectionless signal. Connectionless connectivity\
    \ is typically the\nonly available option for base stations, which use Wi-Fi to\
    \ establish\nlinks with destination devices. As a result, the Wi-Fi service is\
    \ linked\nto the 5G Internet, and it then provides a direct link with the end\n\
    user to remotely monitor and control automatic irrigation as well as\ntomato crop\
    \ cultivation.\n4.1 Working principle of the model\nThe purpose model generally\
    \ performs the operation in the\nfollowing steps:\nStep 1:\nFirst of all, the\
    \ NIR contactless sensor observes the moisture\nlevel of the soil. As a result,\
    \ it is connected near the tomato plant to\ncollect soil moisture. A ﬁeld’s soil\
    \ moisture status is critical for\nmaking planting, fertilizer application, and\
    \ irrigation decisions.\nStep 2:\nSecondly, the moisture levels are observed through\
    \ the Arduino\nUno module, which is also linked with a Wi-Fi access point to send\n\
    all the data to the mobile applications with the help of 5G\ntechnology. The 5G\
    \ network helps to gather the moisture levels\nthrough the cloud service and automatically\
    \ regulates the\nirrigation system.\nStep 3:\nWhen the moisture level is monitored\
    \ through the mobile app,\nthen the drip irrigation system is smartly controlled\
    \ through the\n5G-enabled IoT module (Arduino Uno microcontroller).\n4.2 Evaporation\
    \ and\ntranspiration processes\nEvaporation and transpiration happen at the same\
    \ time, and\nthere is no way to talk about them separately. The fraction of solar\n\
    radiation that reaches the cropped soil surface is used to calculate\nevaporation.\
    \ However, once the crop has matured to the point that\nit completely covers the\
    \ soil surface, transpiration becomes the ﬁrst\nprocess. IoT module sensors properly\
    \ calculate the moisture level of\nthe soil with the help of the calculation process\
    \ of ET.\nEvapotranspiration is commonly deﬁned in mm/time, and\nwater quantity\
    \ lost from a cropped plane is deﬁned in water\ndepth units. Because 2 hectares\
    \ has an area of 20,000 m2 and 2\nmm equals 0.002 m, a loss of 2 mm of water corresponds\
    \ to a loss of\n10 m3 of water per hectare. Finally, 2 mm day−1 corresponds to\
    \ 10\nm3 ha−1 day−l.\nThe quantity of energy received per unit area can also be\
    \ used to\ncharacterize water depths, with energy referring to the amount of\n\
    heat or energy required to evaporate free water. The latent heat of\nevaporation\
    \ (l) varies with the temperature of water. At 21°C, for\nexample, l is approximately\
    \ 2.50 MJ kg−1. To put it another way,\n2.50 MJ is required to evaporate 2 kg\
    \ or 0.002 m3 of water.\n4.3 Impact of weather on the yielding\nwater requires\
    \ reference crop\nevapotranspiration ETo\nThe main impact of weather information\
    \ on crop water\nrequirements is sunshine, temperature, moisture, and wind speed.\n\

    Frontiers in Plant Science\nfrontiersin.org\n07\nThe reference crop evapotranspiration\
    \ deﬁnes the evaporation energy\nof the atmosphere (ETo). Reference crop evapotranspiration,\
    \ also\nknown as reference evapotranspiration, is the evapotranspiration\nrate\
    \ from a reference surface that is not deﬁcient in water and is\nexpressed as\
    \ ETo.\nETo values measured in distinct locations or climates are\nequivalent\
    \ because they indicate identical reference surfaces.\nThese variables inﬂuencing\
    \ ETo can be parameters for climate,\nwhich can be measured using climate information.\
    \ ETo intimates at\na given location, the evaporating energy of the atmosphere.\n\
    In this research domain, different techniques are available for\ncalculating ETo.\
    \ It is tested either by an evapotranspiration pan or\ntheoretically by using\
    \ calculated weather information.\n4.3.1 Saucepan (pan) evaporation technique\n\
    The saucepan evaporation technique allows an environment to\nmonitor the combined\
    \ inﬂuence of temperature, moisture, wind\nspeed, and sunlight on the reference\
    \ yield evapotranspiration ETo.\nThe various evaporation pans are class A evaporation\
    \ pan and\nSunken Colorado pan. The evaporation saucepan is used in the\nfollowing\
    \ equation:\nETo = Kpan \x01 Epan\n(3)\nwhere Kpan is the pan coefﬁcient, Epan\
    \ is the pan evaporation,\nand ETo is the reference yield evapotranspiration.\n\
    4.3.2 Blaney–Criddle technique\nThe Blaney–Criddle method is a theoretical technique\
    \ to\ndetermine the reference yield evapotranspiration ETo, and more\nliterary\
    \ techniques have been used, but many of them were locally\ncalculated. If the\
    \ process is accessed locally, if it is available or if\nlocal procedures are\
    \ not available, then the theoretical method is\nused for the calculation.\nETo\
    \ = P(0:46Tmean + 8)\n(4)\nTmax = omonth(max)\nNdays=month\nTmin = omonth(min)\n\
    Ndays=month\nTmean = Tmax+Tmin\n2\n(5)\nWhere ETo = 1 month of average period,\n\
    Tmean = regular temperature, and\nP = regular proportion of yearly day time periods.\n\
    4.4 Impact of yield type on yield water\nrequires Kc\nThe single crop coefﬁcient\
    \ Kc plays a signiﬁcant role in crop\ncharacteristics as well as the averaged\
    \ effects of soil evaporation.\nAverage crop coefﬁcients are more relevant and\
    \ convenient than Kc\ncomputed on a daily time step using a separate crop and\
    \ soil\ncoefﬁcient for normal irrigation planning and management,\ndevelopment\
    \ of basic irrigation schedules, and most hydrologic\nwater balance studies (Farg\
    \ et al., 2012). The impact of yield type on\nthe yielding water requires dealing\
    \ with the yield type and the\ndevelopment yield stage on water needs. The ﬁeld\
    \ is harvested\nbetween the relationship of reference grown yield and grown yield.\n\
    ETY ield = ETo \x01 Kc\n(6)\nwhere ETYield = yield evapotranspiration process\
    \ (month/day),\nKc = yield inﬂuence, and ETo = reference evapotranspiration. Here,\n\
    ETYield and ETo are stated in equal units in month/day.\n4.4.1 Manipulation of\
    \ the overall growing stage\nFrom the beginning of transplantation to the last\
    \ day, the\noverall growing stage of the crop is determined. It is primarily\n\
    inﬂuenced by the following:\n•\nthe various harvest and its multiplicity,\n•\n\
    the condition of the weather, and\n•\nthe different stages of planting on the\
    \ ﬁeld.\n4.4.2 Manipulation of growth stages\nThe manipulation of the overall\
    \ growing stages of yield is\ndivided into four stages:\n•\nthe analysis of the\
    \ yield ﬁrst stage,\n•\nthe observation of the yield development stage in a ﬁeld,\n\
    •\nthe mid-time cultivation stage, and\n•\nthe late-time growth stage of the crop.\n\

    \ the complete growing\ntime of tomato crop, which is 638 mm.\n5 Simulation setup\
    \ and results analysis\nIn the proposed system, the related experimental data\
    \ are received\nthrough the installed soil moisture and humidity sensor from the\n\
    tomato crop ﬁeld. The NIR REES52 Soil Sensor is used to collect the\npercentage\
    \ of moisture in the soil. Based on this,an irrigation process is\nautomated with\
    \ a developed mobile application which is depicted in\nFigure 4. By using this\
    \ app, the status of soil moisture and the growth of\nplants can be dynamically\
    \ observed, and the irrigation method can also\nbe controlled. Similarly, the\
    \ plant growth parameters like maximum\nheight, width, and diameter of the stem\
    \ of the tomato plant are\nmeasured using an infrared sensor. This is tested in\
    \ a regional area\n28 m in length and 7 m in width, but the experimental site\
    \ is portioned\ninto two rows, and tomatoes are planted 4 m in length and 1.2\
    \ m in\nwidth zone. On the other hand, 50-cm-high PVC plates are applied for\n\
    separation from communities, and a 50-cm row spacing is followed for\nthe plantation\
    \ of tomatoes. Data are captured continuously from the\nﬁeld of cultivation. The\
    \ fog nodes are implemented for sensing data in\nthe area of cultivation. The\
    \ overall implementation of the proposed\nwork is depicted in Figure 5.\nThe cultivation\
    \ time to the collection period is from 1\nNovember 2020 to 18 April 2021, as\
    \ depicted in Figure 6, but it is\ndrawn from the above data (Table 4), which\
    \ is deﬁned in step 5. The\ncultivation of the tomato growth period is evaluated\
    \ as the crop\nsowing period to seedling period (November 1 to December 5), the\n\
    development stage of the crop period (December 6 to January 15),\nthe mid-time\
    \ stage (ﬂowering) of the growth period (January 16 to\nFebruary 5), and the late-time\
    \ stage of growth (fruiting and mature\npicking) period (February 6 to March 30).\
    \ The analysis of irrigation\ndata for tomato cropping depends on the relevant\
    \ factor of the soil\nmoisture sensor at 22 cm depth. This measure predicts the\
    \ volume\nof irrigation.\nBy the observation of moisture level from the above,\
    \ Table 5\nshows a dynamic way of the automatic required level of irrigation\n\
    for tomato cultivation (Figure 7).\nTable 6 shows a feature-wise comparison of\
    \ this paper with the\nexisting literature. The existing work has been mostly\
    \ considered\nunder normal cultivation methods. However, in the proposed work,\n\
    it is found that 5G technology is integrated with the IoT module. As\na result,\
    \ the irrigation system is working intelligently for\nthe cultivation.\nIn Table\
    \ 7, we can see how the 5G network stacks up against\nother existing network generations.\
    \ High-deﬁnition video streaming\nand telephony were made possible on the road\
    \ by 4G networks, an\nimprovement above 3G. As network trafﬁc has increased, the\n\
    theoretical maximum for 4G speeds has been reached. According\nto the ITU, the\
    \ most recent 5G use cases fall into one of three\ncategories: ultrareliable low\
    \ latency communications (URLLC),\nmassive machine type communications (mMTC),\
    \ and enhanced\nmobile broadband (eMBB).\nTable 8 shows that Odisha is in the\
    \ ﬁfth position all over India.\nThis table shows only the seasonal production\
    \ of tomatoes in India.\nIf the display of tomatoes is required to produce in\
    \ non-seasonal\nduration (August to October), then the state Odisha is considered\
    \ in\nthe third position. The implementation of the intelligent cultivation\n\
    method improves the situation in the production table.\nTable 9 shows the exportation\
    \ of tomatoes from India to other\ncountries. The export is done in the seasonal\
    \ duration of\nproduction, but it is required to export in a non-seasonal period\n\
    through intelligent irrigation techniques. Table 10 shows the\nimportation of\
    \ tomatoes to India in the case of seasonal duration.\nThe IoT-based intelligent\
    \ irrigation method provides a technique to\ncultivate tomatoes in the non-seasonal\
    \ period, so that there is no\nneed to import from outside of the country, which\
    \ gives better\nperformance than the traditional cultivation process.\n6 Conclusion\
    \ with future work\nIn this approach, traditional ﬁelds such as agriculture require\n\
    technology (here, smart farming) to achieve higher crop yields with\nless human\
    \ intervention in a limited time frame. Smart farming, on\nthe other hand, necessitates\
    \ signiﬁcant investment, improved\ncoverage and connectivity, and more bandwidth\

    Abstract: The agro-industrial sector consumes a signiﬁcant amount of natural resources\
    \ for farming\nand meat production. By 2050, population growth is expected, generating\
    \ more demand and,\nconsequently, more consumption of scarce resources. This challenging\
    \ scenario is a concern of the\nEuropean Commission, revealed in the Green Deal\
    \ commitment and by the United Nations’ 12th\ngoal of sustainable development.\
    \ Thus, organizations must increase productivity and be more\nsustainable as soon\
    \ as possible. Internet of Things (IoT) is introduced as a solution to facilitate\n\
    agro-food companies to be more eco-efﬁcient, mainly facing difﬁculties on farms,\
    \ such as food\nloss and waste, best efﬁciency in management of resources, and\
    \ production. The deployment of\nthis technology depends on the stage of maturity\
    \ and potential of implementation. To assess and\ncharacterize companies, with\
    \ respect of IoT implementation, a survey was applied in 21 micro, small\nand\
    \ medium agro-food companies, belonging to milk, honey, olive oil, jams, fruticulture,\
    \ bakery\nand pastry, meat, coffee, and wine sectors, in the central region of\
    \ Portugal. As results, this paper\nreveals the stage of maturity, level of sophistication,\
    \ potential, opportunities, solutions, and barriers\nfor implementation of IoT.\
    \ Additionally, suggestions and recommendations to improve practices\nare discussed.\n\
    Keywords: agro-food industry; IoT implementation; sustainable agriculture; smart\
    \ farming; chal-\nlenges and solutions; potential and barriers\n1. Introduction\n\
    The agro-industrial sector uses about 20% of global land, 70% percent of water,\
    \ and\n32% of total energy produced [1]. Population growth is creating more demand\
    \ and putting\npressure on this sector. The number of global inhabitants is estimated\
    \ to reach nine billion\npeople by 2050, which means 30% more people than at present\
    \ and an increase of 60% in\nfood demand [2–4].\nThis scenario is even more challenging\
    \ when considering the United Nations’ (UN)\nreport on sustainable development\
    \ goals. This study reveals the importance of production\nand consumption for\
    \ humanity. However, this draws attention to the unsustainable use\nof natural\
    \ resources, with alarming numbers of material footprint growths at rates of\n\
    about 17% between 2010 and 2017. Another concern is electric and electronic waste,\
    \ which\nhas been increasing faster than recycling can process. Another aspect\
    \ is the signiﬁcant\nproportion of food that is lost along the supply chain before\
    \ it reaches the consumer, which\nAppl. Sci. 2021, 11, 3454. https://doi.org/10.3390/app11083454\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\nAppl. Sci. 2021, 11, 3454\n2 of 18\ncan\
    \ be 13.8% on average, considering after harvesting and during transport, storage\
    \ and\nprocessing stands [5]. However, if loss and waste through the entire food\
    \ supply chain\n(FSC), farming (production), postharvest, processing, distribution\
    \ and consumption is\nconsidered, this number could be up one third of all food\
    \ produced. It is important to\nhighlight that food loss and waste contributes\
    \ to problems with food security and natural\nresource management [1].\nSustainability\
    \ is a broad concept that addresses most aspects of human life, playing\nan important\
    \ role in social, environmental and economic aspects. The European Green\nDeal\
    \ provides an action plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40%, at least,\
    \ when\ncompared to 1990, increase the share of renewable energy by 32%, and improve\
    \ energy\nefﬁciency by 32.5% by increasing the efﬁcient use of resources by changing\
    \ to a clean, circu-\nlar economy, restoring biodiversity, and cutting pollution\
    \ [6]. The EU aims to be climate\nneutral by 2050, and, in the next few years,\
    \ this political commitment will become laws\nand thus a legal obligation. As\
    \ such, these changes have to be considered by companies,\nespecially micro, small,\
    \ and medium enterprises (MSMEs) of the agro-industrial sector,\ntransforming\
    \ their processes to be more eco-efﬁcient [7].\nThis picture leads to some questions:\
    \ (1) How to improve efﬁciency using the Internet\nof Things (IoT)? (2) Are MSMEs\
    \ prepared to use this technology? (3) Which are the\nopportunities and barriers\
    \ for IoT implementation? A mixed method approach was\nchosen to address these\
    \ questions, consisting in a combination of literature review, general\ninterviews,\
    \ and expert site visits, as well as a detailed interview, in order to carry out\n\
    this research.\nIn combination with the literature review, a survey was carried\
    \ out, in two phases, to\nassess Portugal’s proﬁle with respect to IoT implementation.\
    \ Phase 1 was a survey devoted\nto assess the potential and maturity of IoT solution\
    \ implementation, with twenty-one com-\npanies. In Phase 2, ﬁve companies were\
    \ chosen based on the answers provided in Phase 1\nto perform a detailed survey,\
    \ considering a realistic project, budget, and customer expecta-\ntions to assess\
    \ IoT implementation. This approach aims to assess, in real case scenarios,\n\
    IoT opportunities and solution implementations, and to overcome the lack of information\n\
    in the literature. Additionally, this sample provides an overview of the IoT status\
    \ in Por-\ntuguese agro-industry companies, which are composed mainly of MSMEs.\
    \ The results of\nthe literature research and surveys are shown and discussed\
    \ in the following sections.\n2. Background\nThe background of Portugal’s agro-industry\
    \ context is provided in this section. Addi-\ntionally, the main results of the\
    \ literature review related to IoT, applied in the agro-industry,\nare discussed.\n\
    2.1. Portugal’s Agro-Industry Context\nPortugal has about 10 million inhabitants,\
    \ of which 30.1% live in predominantly rural\nregions, and the country had a nominal\
    \ GDP of 212 billion Euros in 2019. In percentage\nterms, compared to the European\
    \ Union with its 27 member states, the total population\ncorresponds to 2.3%,\
    \ the rural population corresponds to 3.5%, and the total GDP is 1.5%,\nas shown\
    \ in Table 1 [8].\nTable 1. Portugal and EU: comparative GDP, population and rural\
    \ population, in 2019 [7].\nRegion\nNominal GDP\n(Million EUR)\nTotal Population\n\

    \ production value was 6.796 million Euros, with participation\nof crops being\
    \ 61.2% and the production of animals and their derivatives being 38.8%, in\n\
    2019. In percentage terms, compared to the European Union with its 27 member states,\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 3454\n3 of 18\ntotal production outputs corresponds to 2.0%,\
    \ crops corresponds to 2.1% and total animals\nis 1.8%, as shown in Table 2 [8].\n\

    \ can be applied in the agro-food sector to provide sustainability,\ncompetitiveness\
    \ and increase efﬁciency in different operations along all FSCs. Several\nstudies\
    \ point to the Internet of Things (IoT) as a key solution to improve an organization’s\n\
    performance, unlocking the potential they already have; however, in many cases,\
    \ these are\nhidden, not measured, not processed or even just ignored [9].\nConsidering\
    \ the questions that this framework aims to answer, the literature review\ndesign\
    \ started by the deﬁnition of keywords and the selection of scientiﬁc databases.\
    \ The\nchosen keywords were: IoT OR “internet of things” AND review AND Agro-industry\n\
    OR “smart farming” OR “precision agriculture”. The selected scientiﬁc databases\
    \ were\nScience Direct and MDPI. Papers selection was based on the most recent\
    \ ﬁve years, title\nanalysis and content, resulting in 33 relevant publications.\
    \ Additionally, some exploratory\nresearch was conducted to reinforce this research.\
    \ The main results of IoT application in\nagro-industry are grouped by subject\
    \ and summarized in Table 3.\nTable 3. Main results of IoT applied in agro-industry.\n\

    The next sections highlights the main concepts related to the current study.\n\
    2.2. Internet of Things (IoT)\nThe Internet of Things, or IoT, allows physical\
    \ objects to be identiﬁed and tracked\nthrough the collection of relevant data,\
    \ which will be transformed into useful information\nand transmitted over a network,\
    \ enabling the creation of alerts for situations that may\nrequire some type of\
    \ correction. This concept provides agility and visibility in tracking\nand sharing\
    \ information, facilitating the planning and in the control of processes. Thus,\
    \ an\nobject capable of establishing connection through the Internet and that\
    \ communicates with\nother objects in a network is considered a “thing”. Its application\
    \ can improve efﬁciency in\nseveral ﬁelds, such as, households appliances, electronics,\
    \ furniture, agriculture, industrial\nmachinery [10,11]. In general, IoT architecture\
    \ is composed of four layers, considering the\nmain components of IoT solutions:\
    \ perception, transport, processing and applications.\n•\nPerception/smart device:\
    \ this layer enables to connect physical devices in a digital\nnetwork, allowing\
    \ real-time information to be collected and processed. Sensors can\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2021, 11, 3454\n4 of 18\nperform measurements of temperature, air quality, speed,\
    \ humidity, pressure, ﬂow,\nmovement, electricity, etc.\n•\nTransport: after measurements\
    \ are done, the results must be transmitted. This layer\nenables Internet connection\
    \ through networks and protocols, such as WiFi, global\nsystem for mobile communications\
    \ (GSM), Bluetooth, etc.\n•\nProcessing: the collected and transmitted information\
    \ becomes data and needs to be\nstored, ﬁltered, processed, and analyzed.\n•\n\
    Application: this is the interface layer, allowing monitoring, decision-making,\
    \ control-\nling, regulating, command, etc. Concepts are changed when, for example,\
    \ they are\napplied to agriculture, turning a simple a farm into a smart farm.\n\
    Some other authors refer to IoT with three layers [12] and others with ﬁve layers\
    \ [13].\n2.3. Smart Farming and Precision Agriculture\nSmart farming can be understood\
    \ as the application of supplementary technologies to\nagricultural production\
    \ techniques to help minimize waste and increase productivity. The\napplication\
    \ of IoT in farming allows to boost the production process through plantation\n\
    monitoring, soil and water management, irrigation scheduling, pest control, delivery\n\
    tracking; using data from temperature, luminosity, humidity, pressure, ground\
    \ chemical\nconcentration, and images, which are collected by sensors and cameras,\
    \ using unmanned\nﬂying equipment (UAV), agricultural information management systems,\
    \ global positioning\nsystems (GPS) and communication networks. This integration\
    \ results in the optimization\nof scarce resources.\nPrecision agriculture has\
    \ its concept linked direct to precision, which means, to manage\nprecisely resources,\
    \ such as energy, soil, water, fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides, among\n\
    others, using different methods and techniques [14]. To achieve the best management,\n\
    the most correct information is fundamental. Thus, IoT is noted as a solution\
    \ to optimize\nagriculture and for precision agriculture.\n2.4. Unmanned Aerial\
    \ Equipment (UAV) or Drones\nOne of the most versatile IoT devices are the Unmanned\
    \ Aerial Equipment (UAV). This\nunmanned vehicle is usually composed of a ground\
    \ controller and a communication system.\nUsually, its function in agriculture\
    \ is related to aerial surveillance in precision agriculture\nfor monitoring weeds,\
    \ vegetation growth, irrigation, crops, etc. [15]. To enhance system\nefﬁciency,\
    \ other technologies can be aggregated, such as artiﬁcial intelligence (machine\n\
    learning or deep learning), mobile edge computing, and software-deﬁned networks\
    \ [16].\nAssociated with specialized sensors, UAVs are becoming powerful sensing\
    \ systems that\ncomplement IoT-based techniques [15].\n2.5. Artiﬁcial Intelligence/Data\
    \ Driven Decisions\nThe use of IoT brings a huge amount of information and variables.\
    \ This information\nmust be treated, otherwise it is useless. The process for\
    \ optimization includes system\nmodeling, which sometimes is difﬁcult due to the\
    \ number of variables. There are algorithms\nthat are specialized to overcome\
    \ these difﬁculties. In the agro-industry, the most common\nare deep learning\
    \ and machine learning, based on big data. An example is the greenhouse\nmicroclimate,\
    \ which is complex, multiparametric, non-linear and depends on a set of\nexternal\
    \ and internal factors. Artiﬁcial neural networks have been used to reduce energy\n\
    consumption [17]. Other artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) applications are related,\
    \ for example, to\nthe detection of diseases in crops, to distinguish plant or\
    \ ﬂower types [18], optimization for\nUAVs [16], and the detection of insects\
    \ [19].\n2.6. Big Data\nAs result of collecting data from different sources, a\
    \ huge set of data is generated and\nis combined as big data [9,20]. From the\
    \ farmer’s perspective, big data can add value to\ndecision making. Data processing\
    \ and analytics involve the transformation of farm decision\nAppl. Sci. 2021,\
    \ 11, 3454\n5 of 18\nmaking, from a traditional decision to a precise data-driven\
    \ decision [21]. However, the data\nhave some challenges, related to their transmission,\
    \ storage and processing security. Block\nchain is noted as a technology that\
    \ can improve security. Despite large opportunities due\nto digitalization and\
    \ digital tools to boost productivity and environmental improvement,\nthey are\
    \ limited by some issues, including data governance, a lack of skill in how to\
    \ handle\nand interpret data, and unclear return on investments in new technologies,\
    \ from farmer’s\npoint of view [9].\n2.7. Block Chain\nThe block chain concept\
    \ is based on a decentralized, distributed ledger for storing\ntime-stamped transactions\
    \ between many computers in a peer-to-peer network. Thus,\nany involved record\
    \ cannot be tampered with retroactively. This concept allows block\nchain users\
    \ to audit and verify transactions, independently and transparently. Nowadays,\n\
    this technology is applied in cryptocurrencies, processing records called “blocks”,\
    \ which\nare connected using cryptographic techniques. Each block must have a\
    \ hash code of the\nprevious block, a timestamp, and a set of conﬁrmed transactions\
    \ [22,23].\nThis technology has many applications in precision agriculture and/or\
    \ smart agricul-\nture. The adoption of IoT brought a need to develop smart peer-to-peer\
    \ systems capable\nof verifying, securing, monitoring, and analyzing agricultural\
    \ data. These data must be\nsecure and reliable. Block chain is changing the classical\
    \ methods of storing, sorting and\nsharing agricultural data into a more reliable,\
    \ immutable, transparent and decentralized\nmanner. However, the adoption of blockchain\
    \ in smart farming or precision agriculture\nstill needs to mature to become a\
    \ reality. Currently, there are several projects using this\ntechnology. A total\
    \ of 40% are in the concept phase, 53% are in the pilot phase, and 7% do\nnot\
    \ have available information [22,23].\n2.8. Robotics\nAgricultural activities\
    \ involving robotics exhibit a high degree of technology and\nautonomy to perform\
    \ tasks. This degree of autonomy between a simple IoT device and a\nrobot differs.\
    \ Currently, most common applications in agriculture are linked to harvesting\n\
    and weeding, followed by diseases detection and seeding [14]. Technological advances\n\
    in machine vision, GPS, laser technologies, actuators, and mechatronics have allowed\n\
    the implementation of robotic systems in agro-industry [24]. Several robotic harvesting\n\
    systems have been developed for cucumber, strawberry, tomato, asparagus, grain,\
    \ lettuce,\nmushroom, and orange crops, among others. Additionally, the integration\
    \ of IoT, cloud\ncomputing and robotics is developing rapidly. Several sensors\
    \ are applied in robotics,\nmachine vision being one of the most important. Unfortunately,\
    \ the number of applications\ncompletely developed which are used in real scenarios\
    \ is still limited [12].\n2.9. IoT in Agriculture\nIoT applied in agriculture\
    \ can reshape all concepts, transforming traditional farm-\ning into smart farming\
    \ (or Agriculture 4.0). It uses different types of sensors to collect\ndata (e.g.,\
    \ temperature, humidity, light, pressure, presence, etc.), and enables precision\n\
    agriculture. Precision agriculture uses data-driven decisions with a base of information\n\
    technology to ensure that crops and soil receive exactly what is necessary for\
    \ optimum\nheathy and productivity [10,25–31]. Figure 1 summarizes most of the\
    \ challenges in farming\nand livestock production, subdivided into monitoring,\
    \ measuring, tracking, and control-\nling. The most important and common variables\
    \ for production are connected to each\nof these sections. On the right side,\
    \ different approaches based on IoT solutions through\ndigitalization of a “thing”\
    \ [32] are shown. Each of these solutions can generate a huge\namount of data,\
    \ called big data [33,34], which is collected in real-time and processed by\n\
    optimization AI-based algorithms for data driven decisions and other technologies\
    \ [16,17],\naiming at monitoring, measuring, tracking or controlling, allowing\
    \ to improve production\nresults [10,11,13,15,18,19,24,25,35–44]. Block chain\
    \ is an emerging technology and is con-\nAppl. Sci. 2021, 11, 3454\n6 of 18\n\
    sidered a solution for the cybersecurity of IoT devices [22]. Several approaches\
    \ like robotics\nare considered as solutions as well [12,14].\nFigure 1. Main\
    \ challenges and IoT solutions.\nIn the rest of the FSC, IoT can signiﬁcantly\
    \ reduce constraints, loss and waste during\npostharvest, processing, distribution,\
    \ and consumption. While in postharvest, processing\nand in distribution, improvement\
    \ is mostly linked to logistics; in the consumption level, it\ncould change a\
    \ consumer’s perception or behavior, using intelligent packaging. In all FSCs\n\
    food loss and waste can be reduced with the implement of IoT [45].\nDespite of\
    \ all beneﬁts that IoT technology can bring to organizations, as previously\n\
    noted, the main barriers for its implementation from a MSME farmer’s perspective\
    \ are\ninfrastructure, knowledge, costs, risks, and cybersecurity. Most papers\
    \ point to IoT\nas a solution and discuss technical issues and applications related\
    \ to it. Just a few pa-\npers consider a farmers’ reality in a generic approach.\
    \ This research is summarized in\nTable 4 [4,11,46].\nThus, the best results and\
    \ success depend, not only on the application of IoT, but also\non the approach,\
    \ choosing the right solution according to an organization needs. Thus,\nit is\
    \ very important to discover an actual framework for MSME farming organizations\n\
    in the central region of Portugal, and answers research questions 2 and 3. To\
    \ assess the\nsophistication and the potential for IoT transferability for companies,\
    \ a survey was carried\nwith 21 organizations. Additionally, 5 companies were\
    \ be chosen for a more detailed survey.\nThus, this study reveals the maturity\
    \ stage, sophistication, potential, opportunities,\nsolutions and barriers of\
    \ IoT deployment, through a case study performed in the central\nregion of Portugal,\
    \ within the scope of the project Development of Technological Capabil-\nities\
    \ for the Industrial Application of the Internet of Things (IOTEC) [47]. The results\
    \ of\nthe survey and discussions will be presented in subsequent sections. Section\
    \ 3 includes a\ndescription of the Materials and Methods. It includes details\
    \ of the two-step survey. The\nsample characteristics are provided, as is the\
    \ structure of each questionnaire. Section 4\npresents the results and includes\
    \ a discussion. It includes an analysis of the Phase 1 survey,\ndevoted to assessing\
    \ the potential and maturity of IoT solution implementation, as well as\nthe Phase\
    \ 2 survey to the assess a real scenario of IoT opportunities and solution implemen-\n\
    tation. Section 5 provides some suggestions and recommendations for the digitalization\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2021, 11, 3454\n7 of 18\nof the agro-food companies, based on an analysis\
    \ of the results of the surveys. Section 6\ndescribes the main conclusions of\
    \ the study.\nTable 4. Brief description of main IoT challenges (adapted from\
    \ [4,11,46]).\nBarriers\nBrief Description\n(Cyber)security\nOperational risks\
    \ are related to natural causes, such as animal attacks, rain,\nlightning, or\
    \ even regular maintenance, could cause stoppage at a farm.\nAdditionally, hacker\
    \ attacks are linked to accessing sensitive information,\nhijacking cloud information\
    \ or databases, or even blocking wireless signals.\nCost\nImplementation and operation\
    \ are the main costs for IoT in agriculture.\nThe implementation costs consist\
    \ of hardware costs, such as IoT\ndevices/sensors, base station infrastructure,\
    \ and gateways. Furthermore,\nrunning costs include an uninterrupted subscription\
    \ for the management\nof IoT devices, the exchange of information among other\
    \ services, and\ncentralized services that provide information/data collection.\n\
    Lack of knowledge\nMost farmers are uneducated in IoT, which creates a great barrier\
    \ to\nunderstanding how technology could contribute to improve production.\nFurthermore,\
    \ it increases the costs of training to qualify people to use IoT\non their farms.\n\
    Interoperability\nSeveral IoT devices, standards and protocols are necessary to\
    \ enable\ncommunication between devices from different manufacturers.\n3. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nTo assess the current state of agro-industry with respect to IoT\
    \ implementation for com-\npanies in the central region of Portugal, a survey\
    \ was selected as the methodology, which\nwas divided in two steps, each one with\
    \ its own objectives and activities, as shown below:\nPhase 1: Assess the potential\
    \ and maturity pf IoT solution implementation.\n•\nDeﬁnition of sample;\n•\nStructuring\
    \ script;\n•\nConducting interviews;\nPhase 2: Assess real scenario for IoT opportunities\
    \ and solution implementation.\n•\nSelection of ﬁve companies for a deeper questionnaire\
    \ to assesses opportunities and\nconstraints of IoT implementation.\n3.1. Phase\
    \ 1: Assess the Potential and Maturity of IoT Solution Implementation\nAn inquiry\
    \ with several questions was made to assess the potential and maturity of IoT\n\
    solution implementation. Additionally, the survey reveals the sophistication of\
    \ interviewed\ncompanies. Detailed information about each step is shown in subsequent\
    \ sections.\n3.1.1. Deﬁnition of the Stratiﬁed Sample of Agro-Food Companies\n\
    The initial stage included the following methodological tasks:\n•\nLimit of the\
    \ sample of agro-food companies for questioning;\n•\nCreation of an “Alternative\
    \ Business Exchange”, in order to ensure, in due time,\neventual failures/possibility\
    \ of refusing to answer and/or last-minute impossibili-\nties/imponderables of\
    \ the pre-selected sample, even after due diligence of\n(re)conﬁrmation;\n•\n\
    Survey and validation of e-mail contacts from the group of companies in the agro-\n\
    food sector, in order to guarantee a sample with validated responses from at least\
    \ 21\ncompanies in the central region of Portugal.\nAs the cluster of agro-industrial\
    \ organizations of the central region in Portugal, Inov-\nCluster’s associates\
    \ were potential companies for this part of the study [48], which was\nalso in\
    \ line with IOTEC project objectives. The contact list was analyzed, and after\
    \ starting\nAppl. Sci. 2021, 11, 3454\n8 of 18\nthe survey it was veriﬁed that\
    \ some contacts no longer corresponded to the initial phone\nnumbers and some\
    \ of the initially contacted companies were closed.\nNotwithstanding these constraints,\
    \ the information provided, associated with the\nadopted survey method, enabled\
    \ an important methodological advance, namely allowing\nthe survey to be directed\
    \ to all companies that fell into the desired category and whose\nheadquarters\
    \ were located in the central region of Portugal. These options increased the\n\
    likelihood of obtaining more favorable response rates and guaranteed representativeness\n\
    in the sampling process.\nFigure 2 shows the percentage of small businesses in\
    \ the subsector of the agro-food\nsegment surveyed in the central region of Portugal.\n\
    Figure 2. Distribution of surveyed companies by sector of activity.\nIt was veriﬁed\
    \ that most of the companies that were made available to collaborate\nin the characterization\
    \ study belonged to the dairy sector, followed by the olive oil and\nhoney sectors.\n\
    Additionally, information about company sizes is shown in Figure 3. Half of the\n\
    companies surveyed were micro-enterprises with fewer than ﬁve employees, with\
    \ 40% of\nthe companies being from the small business category. Only 10% of companies\
    \ surveyed\nalready had a size, considering the number of workers, which corresponded\
    \ to a medium-\nsized company. This result highlights the reality of the agro-food\
    \ industry, not only in the\ncentral region, but also in the whole country, which\
    \ is composed mainly of micro and small\nenterprises, many of them being family\
    \ businesses.\nFigure 3. Distribution of surveyed companies by workers.\nThe main\
    \ constraints found in the course of the study were:\n•\nDifferent segments, processes\
    \ and work shifts cause difﬁculties in making contact. As\nexample, the productive\
    \ section of bakery and pastry companies work during night\nAppl. Sci. 2021, 11,\
    \ 3454\n9 of 18\nlimiting the contact possibilities. Additionally, in agricultural\
    \ activities, the work\nshift is during the day, without interruptions. In both\
    \ cases, there are difﬁculties in\ncontacting via telephone as well as with scheduling;\n\
    •\nReduced sensitivity to the issues raised, as the business fabric in these sectors,\
    \ with\nnumerous family holdings, shows a strong dismay or perception of the issues\
    \ at stake\n(low qualiﬁcations and advanced age of those/workers, learning from\
    \ work itself).\nAfter overcoming these constraints and validating the contacts,\
    \ the survey was con-\nducted in person or by telephone.\n3.1.2. Structuring the\
    \ Script and Building the Questionnaire\nThis stage comprised the deﬁnition of\
    \ the script for face-to-face/telephone interviews,\nsupported by a multitude\
    \ of issues directly related to the sophistication of companies in the\nagro-food\
    \ sector and their appetite for the use of multimedia tools. The survey consisted\
    \ of\n31 questions that aimed to enable the characterization of the sophistication\
    \ of agro-food\ncompanies and their production process. The interviews were held\
    \ throughout 2018.\nThis stage focused on the face-to-face and telephone interview\
    \ process. We tried to\nestablish a procedure for the collection of information\
    \ via telephone, and face-to-face inter-\nviews were used when phone contact was\
    \ impossible or interviewees were unavailable.\nAfter compiling the 21 carried\
    \ out face-to-face/telephone surveys, the data were\ncollected with an online\
    \ application in a comma-separated values (CSV) format, compatible\nwith spreadsheet\
    \ software, and were exported.\n3.2. Phase 2: Assess Real Scenario for IoT Opportunities\
    \ and Solution Implementation\nThe main objectives of this topic were to identify,\
    \ by sector of activity, which parts of\ncompanies received more investment, potential\
    \ for implementation of IoT, identiﬁcation of\nopportunities, budget, return of\
    \ investment, and expected results in order to assess if the\nproject was realistic\
    \ within a company’s budget and calendars. In addition, to identify the\nmain\
    \ implementation restrictions.\nSelection of 5 Companies to Deeper Questionnaire\
    \ Assessing Opportunities and\nConstrains of IoT Implementation\nThis selection\
    \ was made based on the previous questionnaire, which showed differ-\nences in\
    \ company maturity. However, this criterion was not the only one considered, since\n\
    even companies with a low maturity show high potential for transferability of\
    \ IoT. The\nIoT implementation process should start gradually and incrementally\
    \ over a period of\ntime, and between 6 months and 2 years, depending on the maturity\
    \ of the company, may\nbe necessary.\nThe main objectives of this questionnaire\
    \ were to identify, by activity segment, which\nparts of companies receives more\
    \ investment, potential for implementation of IoT, identiﬁ-\ncation of opportunities,\
    \ budget, return of investment, and expected results, according to\nthe state\
    \ of each company. A survey of the opportunities was carried out by contacting\
    \ the\nselected companies that, based on the questionnaire, were selected: Delta\
    \ Cafés, Massimo\nZanetti Beverage Iberia, Fumeiros da Guarda, Sabores da Guarda\
    \ and Claro’s Beekeeping.\n4. Results and Discussion\n4.1. Phase 1: Assess the\

    \ just over half of the companies in the agro-food sector\nthat were part of the\
    \ inquiry process have an organized information system, whether it\nconsists of\
    \ a data network, servers, or even connectivity. At this point, there is a need\n\
    for the development of information and communication technology and implementation\n\
    strategies in companies in this sector.\n4.1.2. Does the Company Use Planning\
    \ and Decision Support Tools?\nIn Table 5, item 2 indicates the use of planning\
    \ and decision support tools. A percent-\nage of companies (over 60%) indicated\
    \ that they do not use any decision support tools.\nNowadays, there is a set of\
    \ computational tools and decision support information aimed at\nimproving processes\
    \ and activities in companies, which can enable cost reduction with raw\nmaterial\
    \ acquisition, storage, logistics, up to the deﬁnition of a price depending on\
    \ a set of\nfactors associated with production and planning. All these characteristics\
    \ allow companies\nto have greater soundness in decisions. In general, companies\
    \ that answered afﬁrmatively\nto this question indicated that they make use of\
    \ a company resource planning software,\nwhich is essentially an enterprise resource\
    \ planning (ERP). In general terms, an ERP system\nis a software platform developed\
    \ to integrate various departments of a company, enabling\nAppl. Sci. 2021, 11,\
    \ 3454\n11 of 18\nthe automation and storage of all business information, that\
    \ is, the ERP system enables\na unique, continuous and consistent ﬂow of information.\
    \ Data integration can follow a\nfunctional approach, e.g., integrating ﬁnance,\
    \ accounting, human resources, manufacturing,\nmarketing, sales, purchasing systems,\
    \ among others, and from a systemic perspective,\nincorporating transaction processing\
    \ systems, management information systems, decision\nsupport systems, etc.\n4.1.3.\
    \ Does the Company Record the Relationship between the Different Items or\nBatches\
    \ Used as Raw Materials and Used Items or Batches of Finished Products,\nthrough\
    \ Computers?\nIn Table 5, item 3 shows whether the companies surveyed record,\
    \ and how, the\nrelationship between different items or lots used as raw materials\
    \ and used ﬁnished items\nor lots. About 70% made this registration using a computer.\n\
    4.1.4. Perform Efﬁcient Handling Including Expiration Date, Temperatures, etc.?\n\
    In Table 5, item 4 shows the proportion of companies surveyed that performs efﬁcient\n\
    handling, including expiration date, temperatures, among other parameters. In\
    \ this case,\n67% of companies indicated performing efﬁcient handling at this\
    \ level. However, only 20%\nof the companies that responded afﬁrmatively indicated\
    \ that this process was carried out\nfor the entire chain, using computer systems\
    \ supported by human resources. The remaining\nafﬁrmative answers indicated that\
    \ this process was carried out in its entirety manually.\n4.1.5. Is There Any\
    \ Kind of Control to Guarantee the Transport, Storage and Exhibition\nUntil the\
    \ Sale of the Products?\nIn Table 5, item 5 analyzes the traceability of products,\
    \ i.e., if there is any type of control\nto ensure transportation, storage and\
    \ exposure until the sale of the products is performed.\nJust over half of the\
    \ companies surveyed answered in the afﬁrmative (52%) this issue\nshows the need\
    \ for sophistication on the part of these companies to carry out traceability\n\
    throughout the product chain, ensuring the maintenance of organoleptic characteristics,\n\
    in addition to undeniable food safety. The only control carried out by the companies\
    \ that\nresponded in the afﬁrmative was temperature control.\n4.1.6. Is There\
    \ a Need for Real-Time Data Collection?\nThis issue, closely linked to the capabilities\
    \ of companies to know in real time how\ndifferent activities are unfolding along\
    \ the product chain, from production, storage for sale,\ninfers the need for real-time\
    \ data collection. This will take a set of sensors, communication\nsystems and\
    \ data acquisition and processing. In Table 5, item 6 shows this need, and about\n\
    70% responded afﬁrmatively. These same companies indicated that the parameter\
    \ which\nrequires real-time data collection was temperature.\n4.1.7. Is the Company\
    \ Connected to Automated Production Systems?\nThis issue is related to the previous\
    \ one. In Table 5, item 7 shows this need, to which\nabout 70% answer afﬁrmatively.\
    \ These same companies indicated that the parameter which\nrequired real-time\
    \ data collection was temperature.\n4.1.8. Are Advanced Control Systems Necessary?\n\
    In Table 5, item 8 shows the need for advanced control systems for production\
    \ ac-\ntivities for the companies surveyed. Only 43% of companies answered this\
    \ question in\nthe afﬁrmative, indicating that these systems are intended for\
    \ granular control of costs\nand production.\n4.1.9. Does the Company Perform\
    \ Data Analysis during the Production Process?\nIn order to evaluate the sophistication\
    \ of management of the production process, this\nquestion aimed to analyze the\
    \ appetite of companies to perform data analysis during the\nAppl. Sci. 2021,\
    \ 11, 3454\n12 of 18\nproduction process. As shown in Table 5, item 9, 81% of\
    \ the companies stated that they\nperformed data analysis during the production\
    \ process.\n4.1.10. Should the Results of These Analyzes Be Cross-Checked with\
    \ the Traceability of\nProduction Information?\nFollowing questions to assess\
    \ sophistication, companies were asked whether they\ncross-referenced the analysis\
    \ of collected data results during the production process with\nthe traceability\
    \ of production information. In this case, 57% of companies claimed to carry\n\
    out this task, as shown in Table 5, item 10.\n4.2. Phase 2: Assess Real Scenario\
    \ for IoT Opportunities and Solutions Implementation\nAiming to provide IoT solutions,\
    \ this second phase survey of opportunities was carried\nout by contacting ﬁve\
    \ selected companies, based on an analysis of the ﬁrst questionnaire:\nDelta Cafés,\
    \ Massimo Zanetti Beverage Iberia, Fumeiros da Guarda, Sabores da Guarda\nand\
    \ Claro’s Beekeeping.\nThe choice was made to precisely describe agro-food companies\
    \ from Portugal. Thus,\ncompanies from different segments and maturity stages\
    \ were chosen. According to this\nanalysis, it was observed that the adaptability\
    \ rate may take longer due to the complexity\nof the technology to be implemented.\
    \ To this end, a model of identiﬁcation of opportunities\nwas designed according\
    \ to each company.\nTable 6 describes the mains features of companies, such as\
    \ designation, sector of\nactivity, awareness of IoT, sector of major investment\
    \ in company, potential for IoT imple-\nmentation and expected time for IoT implementation.\
    \ In this manner, this table reveals an\noverview of agro-food business in Portugal.\n\
    Notice that all companies interviewed were aware of IoT technology. Most of them\
    \ had\nmajor investments in production, except Fumeiros da Guarda. All of them\
    \ had potential\nto implement IoT solutions. However, some time is necessary to\
    \ prepare people and\ninstallations to receive this technology, only Delta Cafés\
    \ was ready to receive it immediately.\nTable 7 shows the main advantages of implementation\
    \ of IoT solutions in each com-\npany. Better relationships with customers was\
    \ expected by all companies, except for Claro’s\nBeekeeping. Fumeiros da Guarda\
    \ e Sabores da Soalheira expected increase of food safety\nwith better controls.\
    \ Delta Cafés expected efﬁciency in technical assistance, anticipation of\nproblems,\
    \ to speed up maintenance, cutting downtimes, etc. Massimo Zanetti Beverage\n\
    Iberia just expected monitoring of work status and Claro’s Beekeeping was interested\
    \ in an\nincrease in productivity, with better monitoring, controls and, also,\
    \ alarms that can inform\npossible problems.\nTable 6. Main features of agro-food\

    Suggestions and recommendations are provided for the digitalization of agro-food\n\
    companies, based on an analysis of the results of the surveys applied to the sample\
    \ of\ncompanies in the agro-food sector in the central region of the country.\
    \ Note that the number\nof companies that have a high level of sophistication\
    \ relating to the use of information\nand communication technologies, information\
    \ systems, decision support systems, control\nsystem, regulation, command and\
    \ measurement of production processes, is still reduced.\nTable 8 shows IoT opportunities\
    \ for each company, as well as each speciﬁc requirement\nfor IoT application.\
    \ The opportunities are directly linked to the needs of each company,\ndue to\
    \ internal processes which can be improve with IoT solutions. The requirements\
    \ are\nlinked to the speciﬁc reality of company, with their strengths and weakness.\n\
    All IoT opportunities or solutions are related to monitoring and data register,\
    \ and also,\naccess data as graphs in order to analyze them. Only Claro’s Beekeeping\
    \ was interested in\nthreshold alarms to inform the company about possible problems.\
    \ Basic requirements for all\ncompanies were related to preparation of people\
    \ and installations to receive this technology.\nDeployment, tests, procedures,\
    \ training, and maintenance are also a general concern.\nFigure 4 shows a critical\
    \ analysis of the level of sophistication in the sample of agro-\nfood companies\
    \ surveyed. Given the complete and cross-examination of the results of the\nsurvey,\
    \ it was found that half of the companies had a zero level of sophistication,\
    \ while\n15% of the companies had a low level. Only 10% of the companies analyzed\
    \ currently have\na high level of sophistication.\nFigure 4. Sophistication level\

    \ is an urgent need to increase the sophistication of\nagro-food companies in\
    \ terms of information and communication technologies, information\nsystems and\
    \ decision support systems. The aim of contributing to the improvement of\ninformation\
    \ management processes with subsequent gains in production, quality, reduction\n\
    of waste, response time, result in an increase in competitiveness. Thus, the suggestions\
    \ and\nrecommendations identifying opportunities for improvement originated by\
    \ this analysis\nare transversal to all ranks, and are summarized as:\n•\nPromote\
    \ the updating of systems, in order to consider an internal network, which\nenhances\
    \ the organization in the face of corporate e-mail and ease of communication\n\
    via the Internet between employees of the company;\n•\nPromote frequent use of\
    \ ﬁnancial management tools, not just billing software;\n•\nPromote the use of\
    \ customer relationship management (CRM);\n•\nPromote the use of integrated enterprise\
    \ resource planning (ERP);\nAppl. Sci. 2021, 11, 3454\n15 of 18\n•\nPromote the\
    \ use of information and communications technology (ICT) tools in quality\nmanagement-oriented\
    \ processes;\n•\nPromote the use of ICT tools in product traceability, monitoring\
    \ of the company’s\nproductive activities, monitoring energy consumption;\n•\n\
    Promote the use of decision support tools in different areas of the company.\n\
    These results are important to understand and highlight the potential of IoT imple-\n\
    mentation in the sample of agro-food MSMEs that can be extended to the country\
    \ scale.\nAdditionally, the next section will discuss possible opportunities and\
    \ solutions for such\na niche.\n6. Conclusions\nPopulation growth is creating\
    \ more demand and putting pressure on agro-industry.\nThe food demand forecast\
    \ is estimated 60% more by 2050. Due to this challenging scenario,\nthe UN and\
    \ EU share concerns about how scarce resources are to be managed, in terms of\n\
    food loss and waste, land, water, energy, emissions, and so on. The European Commission\n\
    is working on a Green Deal in order to reduce emissions. Thus, initial commitments\
    \ could\nbecome laws and obligations, pushing companies to adapt and be more eco-efﬁcient.\n\
    IoT is a technology that can revolutionize agro-food business, in terms of efﬁciency,\n\
    mitigating challenges like monitoring, controlling and tracking of crops and animals\
    \ on\nfarms, and allowing precision agriculture. Additionally, changing old concepts\
    \ of farming\nto new ones, like Agriculture 4.0 or smart farming, where data are\
    \ collected in real-time\nand processed using optimization algorithms of artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence based in data-driven\ndecisions and other technologies, aiming\
    \ to optimize production results.\nThis survey assesses the potential implementation\
    \ of IoT technology. It was applied\nto 21 agro-food companies, belonging to the\
    \ milk, honey, olive oil, jams, fruticulture,\nbakery and pastry, meat, coffee,\
    \ and wine sectors, which are located in the central region of\nPortugal. Additionally,\
    \ this study helps, on basis of company characterizations, to propose\nactions\
    \ and measures that promote the development, economic growth, employment by\n\
    increasing competitiveness in the economy and traditional sectors.\nThe analysis\
    \ of results for the ﬁrst stage points to a low level of sophistication, which\n\
    means low maturity for IoT implementation. However, it also indicates the possibility\
    \ of\nenormous potential for efﬁciency growth by applying IoT solutions. Efforts\
    \ need to be\nmade to transfer knowledge to farmers, unlocking the potential they\
    \ already have, but in\nmany cases remains hidden, not measured, not processed\
    \ or even just ignored, caused by a\nlack of information.\nDeeper analyses were\
    \ performed in a second survey stage, with of ﬁve companies, to\nassess a real\
    \ scenario of IoT implementation. This approach revealed many opportunities\n\
    for IoT solutions, mainly for monitoring and measuring variables of production\
    \ that can\npossibly lead to better decisions by managers. Further, the results\
    \ highlight the constraints\nat human resources and facilities levels that cannot\
    \ receive the technology now, and need\nat least 6 months until 2 years to start\
    \ any deployment.\nIn general, there is a great potential for implementation of\
    \ IoT in Portugal, but also\ngreat challenges. to The lack of knowledge related\
    \ to IoT technologies by the company’s\nhuman resources is highlighted. This condition\
    \ can be mitigate by knowledge transfer and\ntraining, Maturity of sophistication\
    \ is another concern, since installations are the basis to\nreceive new technology.\
    \ Thus, suggestions and recommendations identifying opportunities\nfor improvement\
    \ that can be started right now are: renew or install communications\nsystems,\
    \ use of CRM and ERP, use of ﬁnancial tools, use of ICT tools to allow traceability,\n\
    monitoring of a company’s productive activities, monitoring energy consumption\
    \ and\nthe use of decision support tools in different areas. Future research work\
    \ will include\na larger sample of companies in order to improve characterization,\
    \ generalization and\nrepresentativeness of Portuguese agro-industry MSMEs.\n\

    Abstract: Soil temperature is an essential factor for agricultural, meteorological,\
    \ and hydrological\napplications. Direct measurement, despite its high accuracy,\
    \ is impractical on a large spatial scale due\nto the expensive and time-consuming\
    \ process. On the other hand, the complex interaction between\nvariables affecting\
    \ soil temperature, such as topography and soil properties, leads to challenging\n\
    estimation processes by empirical methods and physical models. Machine learning\
    \ (ML) approaches\ngained considerable attention due to their ability to address\
    \ the limitations of empirical and physical\nmethods. These approaches are capable\
    \ of estimating the variables of interest using complex nonlinear\nrelationships\
    \ with no assumptions about data distribution. However, their sensitivity to input\
    \ data\nas well as the need for a large amount of training ground truth data limits\
    \ the application of machine\nlearning approaches. The current paper aimed to\
    \ provide a review of ML techniques implemented\nfor soil temperature modeling,\
    \ their challenges, and milestones achieved in this domain.\nKeywords: soil temperature;\
    \ direct measurement; empirical methods; physical models; machine learning\n1.\
    \ Introduction\nSoil temperature is an essential environmental parameter in earth\
    \ sciences, such as me-\nteorology and climate change; soil processes, such as\
    \ evaporation, inﬁltration, and nutrient\ncycling; and agricultural purposes,\
    \ such as precision farming and irrigation scheduling at\nmany developmental stages.\
    \ As an important meteorological parameter, soil temperature\ncontrols the heat\
    \ transfer from the soil to the atmosphere and vice versa. In addition,\nagriculture\
    \ applications including potential evapotranspiration, root development, crop\n\
    growth, and yield of crop are affected by soil temperature variations. Soil temperature\n\
    also plays a remarkable role in determining hydrological parameters, such as evaporation,\n\
    precipitation, and inﬁltration of water through soil.\nAccurate estimation of\
    \ soil temperature is complicated because of the physical, chem-\nical, and biological\
    \ processes governing the soil-plant-atmosphere system [1]. Since soil\ntemperature\
    \ is highly localized and can be difﬁcult to measure directly, indirect methods\
    \ of\nassessing soil temperature using more easily measured variables such as\
    \ air temperature\nand readily available weather data gained much attention.\n\
    Generally, estimation methods for soil temperature are classiﬁed into three groups\n\
    (1) in situ measurements, (2) satellite observations, and (3) model-based estimates.\n\
    The most reliable method is in situ measuring using local instruments such as\
    \ ther-\nmistors, thermocouples, thermocouple wires, and averaging thermocouples,\
    \ which can\nprovide accurate estimates of soil temperature. Although in situ\
    \ measurements, which\nare necessary to validate the two other methods, can provide\
    \ soil temperature with a\nrelatively high degree of accuracy, the low density\
    \ of sensors and ﬁne spatial resolution of\nsampling restrict the use of point\
    \ (or ﬁeld) observations to map the soil temperature over\nSustainability 2023,\
    \ 15, 7677. https://doi.org/10.3390/su15097677\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2023, 15, 7677\n2 of 26\na wide geographical area because of expensive\
    \ equipment. In other words, continuous\nmonitoring of soil temperature at different\
    \ depths requires a variety of sensors installed at\nshort distances to represent\
    \ the spatial heterogeneity in soil temperature. However, high\ncosts of installation\
    \ and maintenance, equipment requirement, special expertise, and point\nmeasurement\
    \ limit the application of these ﬁeld soil temperature sensors.\nTherefore, satellite\
    \ sensors received signiﬁcant attention over the past few decades. Yet,\nscaling\
    \ issues and measurement depth, despite current advances, are the most considerable\n\
    challenges of remote sensing techniques.\nThe model-based approach, including\
    \ empirical and physical models, can retrieve\nsoil temperature by surface information\
    \ and weather-forcing variables. Empirical models\nuse statistical regression\
    \ techniques and parametric functions to map the soil temperature\nthrough in\
    \ situ measurements. These models are simple to implement without a speciﬁc\n\
    background. Although these models are useful to model soil temperature dynamics\
    \ with\nan acceptable accuracy, the need for suitable reference samples of the\
    \ desired target variable\nfor calibration and validation of results restricts\
    \ the use of the models due to the costly and\ntime-consuming process of in situ\
    \ measurements. Moreover, the estimation accuracy of\nreference samples can be\
    \ affected by errors during the measurement process. The statistical\nregression-based\
    \ relationship between input and output is site dependent; therefore, empir-\n\
    ical relationships, despite their fewer input data requirements, are valid only\
    \ under speciﬁc\noperational conditions in which the samples were collected [2–4].\
    \ Furthermore, varying\nenvironmental conditions in addition to some matters such\
    \ as nonlinearity, outlier data,\nmulticollinearity, and heteroscedasticity can\
    \ decrease the estimation accuracy of statistical\nmodels due to the lack of physical\
    \ structure.\nPhysical models, including agronomical models, hydrological models,\
    \ earth system\nmodels, and land surface models (LSMs), are based on assumptions\
    \ that simplify the\nreal phenomena, which leads to more general use in comparison\
    \ to collections of in situ\nmeasurements. However, these simplifying assumptions\
    \ lead to uncertainty in estimating\nthe soil temperature at the continental or\
    \ global scales. Physical models suffer from high\ncomplexity, intensive input\
    \ data requirement, and high computational cost in estimating\nnear-real-time\
    \ soil temperature, which makes accurate estimation of physical parameters\nchallenging\
    \ [5]. Additionally, errors due to forcing data and parameters potentially lead\
    \ to\nuncertainties in the long-term monitoring of soil temperature. Although\
    \ data assimilation\ntechniques such as the land data assimilation system (LDAS)\
    \ can improve the accuracy of\nestimates, errors due to the physics of these models\
    \ are inevitable [6].\nWith the signiﬁcant progress in computer technology, various\
    \ machine learning (ML)\ntechniques, known as computational artiﬁcial intelligence-based\
    \ (AI) models with a dy-\nnamic input-output mapping approach, were developed\
    \ to address the aforementioned\ndrawbacks. These data-driven models are mathematical\
    \ representations built based on\ntraining data to estimate target variables by\
    \ analyzing data attributes. They are capable\nof approximating complex nonlinear\
    \ relationships, including nonlinear, nonmonotonic,\nand multimodal relationships,\
    \ with limited assumptions about data distribution as well\nas predeﬁned conceptual\
    \ relationships between input and output data because of their\nadvanced learning\
    \ strategies. Due to this property, a wide range of diverse datasets with\nunknown\
    \ probability density functions can be used to estimate variables of interest\
    \ using\nML with better performance than other parametric methods [2] Moreover,\
    \ multi-source\nusage makes ML models suitable for large-scale studies such as\
    \ climate and hydrology\nstudies. Since ML techniques rely on the relationships\
    \ between model inputs and desired\noutputs, they can accurately represent earth\
    \ processes without an explicit structure.\nUnlike empirical models, ML-based\
    \ outputs can be applied as important information\nsources to retrieve soil temperature\
    \ in unsampled areas [7,8]. In addition, these methods\nwith high computational\
    \ speed and high adaptability to different inputs and conﬁgurations\nare superior\
    \ to LSMs and Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) models [9]. However,\n\
    ML methods need a large number of samples with known target labels to capture\
    \ the\nSustainability 2023, 15, 7677\n3 of 26\nvariability of complex systems.\
    \ Other challenges are overﬁtting the models to the training\ndata as well as\
    \ low convergence during the learning process [10].\nIf an ML-based model is sufﬁciently\
    \ trained to represent the physical process, it can\nprovide accurate predictions\
    \ of data not included in the training process, i.e., the general-\nization concept\
    \ [11]. Thus, introducing physical principles and constraints into machine\nlearning\
    \ techniques can improve the estimation accuracy of the model by reducing the\n\
    optimization search space to physically based possibilities [12–14]. Furthermore,\
    \ apply-\ning a penalty to the optimization process because of inconsistent predictions\
    \ can drive\nthe optimization process to reduce error and generate physically\
    \ meaningful results. In\naddition to the training process, ML models are highly\
    \ dependent on input variables that\nare correlated with soil temperature, including\
    \ climatic variables such as air temperature\nand precipitation, soil properties\
    \ such as soil texture and land cover, and vegetation in-\ndices [15,16]. In other\
    \ words, the quality and quantity of training data signiﬁcantly affect\nthe performance\
    \ of ML models. As a result, the ML models are incapable of capturing\nthe relationships\
    \ between data and generalizing appropriate patterns to new datasets for\nsmall\
    \ datasets, resulting in an overﬁtted model. In contrast, noisy data may lead\
    \ to the\nmodel underﬁtting to the training datasets if a relatively simple learning\
    \ structure is used.\nFurthermore, limited datasets representing speciﬁc conditions\
    \ cause the model to fail to\nrecognize true underlying patterns. A data preprocessing\
    \ process, such as bias reduction,\ndata normalization, and data size increment,\
    \ can mitigate these issues, in addition to the\nfeature selection process that\
    \ determines which data are appropriate for input.\nThe advent of ML-based soil\
    \ temperature prediction occurred when [17] used relative\nhumidity, wind speed,\
    \ and air temperature, as inputs in both single-layer and multi-\nlayer neural\
    \ networks to predict soil temperature, thereby providing a foundation for\nmachine\
    \ learning as a method for soil temperature estimation using climate variables.\
    \ Since\nthen, many studies proposed other ML models and input variables for soil\
    \ temperature\nprediction. Given that ML models were successfully used to retrieve\
    \ soil characteristics for\ntwo decades, the current research addresses the application\
    \ of different machine learning\nmethodologies in predicting soil temperature.\
    \ These predictive models along with decision-\nsupport systems can alleviate\
    \ the time and operational costs associated with instrumental\nmeasurements. The\
    \ remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, different\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence-based models are classiﬁed into four main categories: (i) artiﬁcial\n\
    neural networks, (ii) deep learning, (iii) kernel models, and (iv) hybrid models,\
    \ in which\nthe studies carried out by these methods are assessed in detail. The\
    \ limitations and future\nperspectives are also discussed in Section 3.\n2. AI-Based\
    \ Models for Soil Temperature Estimation\n2.1. Artiﬁcial Neural Networks\nAn artiﬁcial\
    \ neural network (ANN), which is a universal approximator for nonlinear\nmapping,\
    \ classically comprises three layers including input, hidden, and output layers,\
    \ as\nshown in Figure 1. The model can learn the multivariate non-linear relationships\
    \ between\nthe input and output without physical concepts and generalize them\
    \ to other points [18,19].\nThus, ANNs eliminate the need for an explicit conﬁguration\
    \ of physical relationships by\ndeﬁning the input–output relationship, which prevents\
    \ the models from errors caused by\nincorrect associations. Moreover, these models\
    \ beneﬁt from a relatively low computational\ncost due to the one-time calibration.\n\
    The most widely used variants of ANN include feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs)\n\
    or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), radial basis neural networks (RBNN), and generalized\n\
    regression neural networks (GRNNs). Despite the different structures of ANN models,\
    \ all\nof them consist of two functional components, i.e., learning and optimization\
    \ processes for\nclassifying inputs to hidden layers and to outputs, respectively.\
    \ The first component, known as\nthe input-hidden component, detects nonlinearity\
    \ in the input data and classifies inputs into\nhidden layers by a learning algorithm\
    \ (supervised or unsupervised). The second functional\ncomponent, known as the\
    \ hidden-output component, includes an optimization process to find\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 7677\n4 of 26\nthe best match between the classified inputs and targets.\
    \ The classified inputs are mapped to\nthe outputs by linear projection, which\
    \ adjusts the model parameters by a negative gradient\nalgorithm by minimizing\
    \ the mean square error between the ANN output and target data.\nANNs are capable\
    \ of dealing with a large amount of data because of the separate training\nprocess\
    \ of the components. In addition, an adaptive procedure can be used to recursively\n\
    update the parameters when the observational data of interest are sufficient.\n\
    (FFNNs) or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), radial basis neural networks (RBNN),\
    \ and \ngeneralized regression neural networks (GRNNs). Despite the different\
    \ structures of \nANN models, all of them consist of two functional components,\
    \ i.e., learning and optimi-\nzation processes for classifying inputs to hidden\
    \ layers and to outputs, respectively. The \nfirst component, known as the input-hidden\
    \ component, detects nonlinearity in the input \ndata and classifies inputs into\
    \ hidden layers by a learning algorithm (supervised or unsu-\npervised). The second\
    \ functional component, known as the hidden-output component, \nincludes an optimization\
    \ process to find the best match between the classified inputs and \ntargets.\
    \ The classified inputs are mapped to the outputs by linear projection, which\
    \ adjusts \nthe model parameters by a negative gradient algorithm by minimizing\
    \ the mean square \nerror between the ANN output and target data. ANNs are capable\
    \ of dealing with a large \namount of data because of the separate training process\
    \ of the components. In addition, \nan adaptive procedure can be used to recursively\
    \ update the parameters when the obser-\nvational data of interest are sufficient.\
    \ \n \nFigure 1. Structure of the ANN model. \nANNs are the most popular type\
    \ of AI models for approximating hydrological and \nenvironmental components such\
    \ as soil temperature with a long-term history. For exam-\nple, ref. [20] compared\
    \ the performance of three AI-based models, i.e., MLPs, GRNNs, and \nRBNNs, as\
    \ well as multiple linear regression (MLR) in modeling monthly soil tempera-\n\
    tures at different depths. They assessed the effect of climatic data, including\
    \ relative hu-\nmidity, solar radiation, wind speed, and air temperature, on the\
    \ resulting soil temperature \nby GRNN, among which the air temperature was identified\
    \ as the most effective variable. \nAccording to the results, RBNN performed better\
    \ than MLP and GRNN in estimating soil \ntemperature at depths of 5 and 10 cm,\
    \ while MLR and GRNN models presented the best \naccuracy at 50 and 100 cm, respectively.\
    \ In addition to climatic data, the effect of periodic-\nity on model accuracy\
    \ in the training, validation, and test periods was investigated, lead-\ning to\
    \ a decrease in the root mean square error (RMSE) of GRNN, MLP, RBNN, and MLR\
    \ \nby 19, 15, 19, and 15 %, respectively. \nFigure 1. Structure of the ANN model.\n\
    ANNs are the most popular type of AI models for approximating hydrological and\n\
    environmental components such as soil temperature with a long-term history. For\
    \ example,\nref. [20] compared the performance of three AI-based models, i.e.,\
    \ MLPs, GRNNs, and\nRBNNs, as well as multiple linear regression (MLR) in modeling\
    \ monthly soil temperatures\nat different depths. They assessed the effect of\
    \ climatic data, including relative humidity,\nsolar radiation, wind speed, and\
    \ air temperature, on the resulting soil temperature by\nGRNN, among which the\
    \ air temperature was identiﬁed as the most effective variable.\nAccording to\
    \ the results, RBNN performed better than MLP and GRNN in estimating soil\ntemperature\
    \ at depths of 5 and 10 cm, while MLR and GRNN models presented the best\naccuracy\
    \ at 50 and 100 cm, respectively. In addition to climatic data, the effect of\
    \ periodicity\non model accuracy in the training, validation, and test periods\
    \ was investigated, leading to\na decrease in the root mean square error (RMSE)\
    \ of GRNN, MLP, RBNN, and MLR by 19,\n15, 19, and 15 %, respectively.\nRef. [21]\
    \ used several data-intelligent ML models, i.e., ANN, extreme learning machine\n\
    (ELM), and M5 Model Tree (M5 Tree), to estimate monthly soil temperatures at 5,\
    \ 50, and\n100 cm. The models were trained by meteorological information obtained\
    \ from two stations\nin Turkey, including air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ wind speed, solar radiation, and\nperiodicity. The ELM model, with the highest\
    \ accuracy and lowest error, was considered\nthe most accurate model at a depth\
    \ of 50 cm.\nEven though climatic data may be unavailable in some regions, most\
    \ studies use\nmeteorological parameters as input data to estimate soil temperature.\
    \ For example, ref. [22]\nemployed geographical information, i.e., latitude, longitude,\
    \ and altitude as well as the cal-\nendar month, to estimate monthly soil temperature\
    \ at depths of 5, 10, 50, and 100 cm using\nSustainability 2023, 15, 7677\n5 of\
    \ 26\nANN, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and gene expression programming\n\
    (GEP). According to the results, the ANFIS model provided the most accurate estimates,\n\
    followed by the ANN and GEP. Ref. [23] predicted the monthly soil temperature\
    \ at a depth\nof 10 cm by ANN over a large spatial domain with complex terrain\
    \ in southwestern China.\nThe independent variables included geographical information\
    \ obtained from a digital\nelevation model and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) derived from\nsatellite imagery. Compared to multiple linear regressions,\
    \ ANNs improved the RMSE,\nmean absolute error (MAE), and R2 by about 44%, 70%,\
    \ and 18%, respectively.\nUsing Earth observation satellite data, ref. [24] evaluated\
    \ the predictive capability of\nfeed forward back propagation neural network (FFBPNN)\
    \ for land surface temperature by\npast land surface temperature (LST) values\
    \ as well as geographical characteristics. They\nconﬁrmed the ability of ANN to\
    \ learn and predict a non-linear complex dataset.\nThe aforementioned studies\
    \ modeled soil temperature on a monthly time scale while\ndaily or sub-daily resolutions\
    \ are more advantageous for agricultural purposes. Moreover,\nthe applicability\
    \ of these models is limited due to the lack of environmental and atmospheric\n\
    data used for soil temperature estimation. To address these issues, ref. [25]\
    \ employed ANN\nand wavelet neural network (WNN) models to forecast soil temperature\
    \ 1–7 days ahead\nby only surface air temperature data with hourly temporal resolution.\
    \ The results showed\nthat a wavelet transform, which decomposes the inputs into\
    \ low and high-frequency\ncomponents, can improve the prediction accuracy of soil\
    \ temperature.\nThe methods of ELM, GRNN, backpropagation neural networks (BPNN),\
    \ and random\nforests (RF) were exploited to derive half-hourly soil temperatures\
    \ at depths of 2 cm, 5 cm,\n10 cm, and 20 cm from datasets of air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, solar radiation,\nwind speed, and vapor pressure deﬁcit [26].\
    \ Despite the desirable performance of all the\nmodels, the ELM model with a high\
    \ computational speed showed more accurate results at\ndifferent soil depths.\
    \ Ref. [27] used the MLP model, RF, Gaussian process (GaP), and M5P\nmodels to\
    \ estimate daily soil temperature in arid regions by climate data obtained from\n\
    two stations, which included sunshine, wind speed, relative humidity, and air\
    \ temperature.\nIt was found that the MLP model with RMSE ranging from 3.3 to\
    \ 6.3 ◦C performed\nbetter than the other models in estimating soil temperature\
    \ at a depth of 5 cm. Ref. [28]\nemployed MLP and MLR models to estimate the daily\
    \ soil temperature at 5, 10, 20, 30, 50,\nand 100 cm by daily meteorological data,\
    \ including relative humidity, solar radiation, air\ntemperature, and precipitation.\
    \ The results showed the superiority of MLP to MLR as well\nas the higher effectiveness\
    \ of air temperature and humidity over other variables. Ref. [29]\napplied MLP\
    \ and ANFIS models to estimate the daily soil temperature at two stations\nin\
    \ Illinois, USA. A variety of weather data, including air temperature, relative\
    \ humidity,\ndew point temperature, potential evapotranspiration, wind speed,\
    \ solar radiation, and soil\ntemperature at 10 and 20 cm depths were used to model\
    \ the soil temperature. The input\ndata for air temperature, wind speed, and solar\
    \ radiation were recognized as the best data\ncombination for both models. In\
    \ addition, it was found that the MLP model outperformed\nANFIS for both stations\
    \ at depths of 10 and 20 cm. Ref. [30] exploited ANN, MLR, and\nGEP to estimate\
    \ the multi-depth daily soil temperature at a station with a semiarid climate\n\
    in Iran. To adopt the best input data, they used 12 combinations of meteorological\
    \ data\nincluding relative humidity, wind speed, extraterrestrial radiation, sunshine\
    \ hours, and\nminimum and maximum air temperatures. Although all models were able\
    \ to estimate\nsoil temperature, the ANN model exhibited the best performance.\
    \ Ref. [31] applied ANN,\nWNN, and GEP models to estimate the daily soil temperature\
    \ at different depths in Iran\nbased on single-station measurements. At all depths,\
    \ air temperature, radiation, and\nsunshine hours had the greatest effect on the\
    \ soil temperature prediction. The results\nrevealed that the best performance\
    \ belonged to WNN with the lowest RMSE and highest R;\nhowever, the estimation\
    \ accuracy as well as the effect of climatic factors decreased with\nincreasing\
    \ soil depth.\nSince neural network (NN)-based soil temperature models are location-speciﬁc,\
    \ they\ncannot be extended to other locations because of the unique relationships\
    \ between soil\nSustainability 2023, 15, 7677\n6 of 26\ntemperature and climate\
    \ conditions at the training location. However, it is possible to build\nspatially\
    \ distributed temperature models if sufﬁcient temperature data are initially known.\n\
    In this regard, ref. [32] used an ensemble approach using machine learning techniques\
    \ such\nas ANN, decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to predict\
    \ spatially distributed\nland surface temperatures from a given dataset of land\
    \ temperature at known locations. The\nstatistical indices showed good performance\
    \ of the proposed model built by DT, variable\nridge regression (VRR), and conditional\
    \ inference tree (CIT).\nSome studies evaluated the efﬁciency of ML models for\
    \ predicting soil temperature\nonly at shallow depths, while the relationship\
    \ between effective parameters and soil\ntemperature changes with the depth of\
    \ the soil temperature sample, leading to a need for\nmulti-depth evaluation.\
    \ In this regard, ref. [33] used an ANN and a co-active neuro-fuzzy\ninference\
    \ system (CANFIS) to predict the soil temperature at two locations in Iran at\
    \ depths\nfrom 5 to 100 cm using only air temperature data. The resulting models\
    \ performed better\nfor shallower sample depths, and stations in dry climates.\
    \ The authors hypothesized that\nmoisture in humid climates may act as a thermal\
    \ insulator, interfering with the relationship\nbetween the air and soil temperatures.\
    \ Ref. [34] modeled soil temperature at depths from\n5 to 100 cm at Mersin station,\
    \ Turkey, by using ELM, ANN, classiﬁcation and regression\ntrees (CRT), and the\
    \ group method of data handling (GMDH). They also investigated\nthe models’ sensitivity\
    \ to the input variables, including air temperature, solar radiation,\nwind speed,\
    \ relative humidity, and soil temperature. According to the results, the ELM\n\
    performed best among all the models. The models for shallow soil temperature performed\n\
    best and were found to rely only on the climate input of air temperature; while\
    \ at deeper\ndepths, more input variables (namely wind speed and solar radiation)\
    \ were required.\nThe aforementioned studies used input data that associate concurrent\
    \ climate pa-\nrameters, and each individual set of measurements stands on its\
    \ own, with no inherent\nconnection in time to other data points. This data structure\
    \ makes it necessary to introduce\nother techniques to account for time-related\
    \ behavior. The simplest technique to account\nfor seasonal cycles in soil temperature\
    \ is to include the month of the year and, optionally,\nthe day as well, as another\
    \ input parameter. With this approach, ref. [35] investigated soil\ntemperatures\
    \ in Adana, Turkey, at ﬁve depths from 5 to 100 cm. The soil temperature was\n\
    modeled using linear regression (LR) and nonlinear regression (NLR) as well as\
    \ a feedfor-\nward neural network using different input sets depending on the\
    \ season: air temperature,\ndepth, and month were used year-round, and in the\
    \ hot season atmospheric pressure,\nand solar radiation inputs were added. The\
    \ results revealed the superior performance\nof FFNN over linear and nonlinear\
    \ models. In addition, the results did not show any\nchange in the model performance\
    \ with sample depth for the neural network. Ref. [36]\nmodeled soil temperature\
    \ data from across Turkey using ANN, ANFIS, and MLR models.\nThe study found that\
    \ monthly soil temperature could be predicted using monthly mini-\nmum and maximum\
    \ air temperatures, soil depth, calendar month number, and monthly\nprecipitation.\
    \ The models were built using all soil temperature data from different soil\n\
    depths and climate regions, which would implicitly have different relationships\
    \ with the\nclimate input variables. The success of the models, especially the\
    \ ANFIS model, indicates\nthat these differences could be accounted for using\
    \ the inputs of climate variables and\nsoil depth, allowing for a model that was\
    \ not intrinsically tied to a single location or soil\ndepth. [37] used ANN models\
    \ to predict soil temperature at locations across Turkey using\nthe input climate\
    \ parameters of solar radiation, sunshine duration, and air temperature;\nlocation\
    \ parameters of altitude, latitude, and longitude; and time parameters of month\n\
    and year. The best performing model was for the 20 cm depth, and the 100 cm depth\n\
    model performed marginally worse. The inclusion of the year in the input is an\
    \ interesting\nchoice: it limits the models’ applicability to make predictions\
    \ for the future, where the\nyear will, by nature, be outside the range used for\
    \ training the model. However, within\nthe range of historical data, using year\
    \ as an input variable allows the model to account\nfor changes in seasonal patterns\
    \ from year to year. Including only the month and day in\nthe input variables\
    \ inherently assumes that the seasonal patterns do not vary from year to\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 7677\n7 of 26\nyear; however, natural variation in weather patterns\
    \ as well as climate change contradict\nthis assumption.\nAnother way of accounting\
    \ for time without assuming identical yearly patterns is to\nuse a sliding window\
    \ approach. With this method, the soil temperature at a given time\nis modeled\
    \ with an input of climate variables from the same time and from one or more\n\
    previous time steps. Ref. [38] modeled the soil temperature at two study sites\
    \ in Iran\nusing MLPs and support vector machines (SVMs) with and without optimization\
    \ via the\nﬁreﬂy algorithm (FFA). The input climate variables (air temperature,\
    \ wind speed, relative\nhumidity, and sunshine hours) from the current day, the\
    \ previous day, and, in some models,\nthe day prior to that were all used as model\
    \ inputs. The study concluded that using two\ndays of previous data led to the\
    \ best results, and the models that used FFA outperformed\nthe standalone models\
    \ without optimization. Ref. [39] investigated two stations in different\nclimate\
    \ regions of Iran, with sampling depths ranging from 5 to 100 cm. They used seasonal\n\
    autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), a linear stochastic approach,\
    \ with\nseasonal standardization and spectral analysis in preprocessing. This\
    \ model was compared\nto three machine learning models, i.e., ELM, self-adaptive\
    \ evolutionary ELM (SaE-ELM),\nand ANFIS, and was shown to outperform them. The\
    \ SARIMA model showed no loss of\nquality for deeper soil temperatures and performed\
    \ moderately better at deeper depths.\nOne difﬁculty in the sliding window approach\
    \ is that it makes assumptions about the\nlag time between the causal climate\
    \ variable and the effect on soil temperature (namely, lag\ntimes equal to or\
    \ less than the window length). The actual lag times may be long or follow\ncomplex\
    \ patterns. Along with building several machine learning models to predict hourly\n\
    soil temperatures at their sites in Iran, ref. [40] used wavelet decomposition\
    \ to assess the\ncoherence between various climate parameters and soil temperature.\
    \ They observed that\nair temperature and soil temperature were highly coherent\
    \ at a periodicity of 4 to 8 h for\na soil depth of 5 cm, and 8 to 16 h at depths\
    \ of 10 and 30 cm. Relative humidity and soil\ntemperature were coherent at a\
    \ periodicity of 16 to 64 h for 5 cm depth, and 4 to 8 h for\n10 and 30 cm depths.\
    \ While most studies examine soil temperature over larger time scales\n(i.e.,\
    \ daily, not hourly), the different periodicities between different climate variables\
    \ and\nsoil temperatures imply that the best sliding window models of soil temperature\
    \ would\nneed to include data from many different previous time steps. Furthermore,\
    \ the fact that\nthe periodicity of different climate variables changed in opposite\
    \ directions upon changing\nthe soil depth indicates that the sliding window would\
    \ have to be different for models\npredicting temperatures at different depths.\n\
    Compared with other artiﬁcial intelligence models, ANNs can better extract the\
    \ hidden\nfeatures of big data. However, they are usually based on single data\
    \ feature extraction\nwithout accounting for the spatiotemporal patterns of the\
    \ data, which leads to a decrease\nin the prediction accuracy of soil temperature.\
    \ In this regard, increasing the neural network\ndepth can improve the optimization\
    \ rate and model expression such as in deep learning\n(DL) models [41], which\
    \ are discussed in the next section. A list of studies related to soil\ntemperature\
    \ estimation by ANN models is given in Table 1.\nTable 1. A list of studies carried\

    \ network models are incapable of processing big data and have\nlimited generalization\
    \ ability and scalability. Moreover, their slow training process and\neasy falling\
    \ into local optima are other weaknesses of standard neural networks. There-\n\
    fore, ref. [42] developed deep learning (DL) models to deal with large multi-feature\
    \ data\nthrough a multiple hidden layer structure. Compared to traditional neural\
    \ networks, DL\nmodels, which are known as large-sized neural networks, as shown\
    \ in Figure 2, have\nstrong computing power which can automatically extract high\
    \ level features from low level\ninput data by intermediate layers with learning\
    \ complex nonlinear functions in different\nﬁelds such as search engines and image\
    \ recognition. Since soil has extremely complex and\nnonlinear structural characteristics,\
    \ DL models are more effective in analyzing soil particle\nsize and soil texture\
    \ than traditional models [16,43]. In addition, these methods simulate\nland-atmosphere\
    \ interactions without complex knowledge governing physical models.\nThese models\
    \ can efﬁciently process future data with a high computational speed and\nintegrate\
    \ more data to improve prediction accuracy through additional learning. However,\n\
    an inappropriate sample size of the input data may cause overﬁtting, thereby decreasing\n\
    the prediction accuracy.\nThe most common DL models for environmental prediction\
    \ include spatial models\n(Convolutional Neural Networks, CNNs by [44]), temporal\
    \ models (Long Short-Term\nMemory networks, LSTMs by [45]) and spatial–temporal\
    \ models (Convolutional LSTM,\nConvLSTM by [46]).\nThe CNN, as a classical data-driven\
    \ DL model, provides a powerful feature extraction\ntool to improve the predictive\
    \ process by identifying the spatial features of data in multiple\narrays. However,\
    \ the CNN model, with decreasing number of layers, performs poorly in\nfeature\
    \ extraction. To address this issue, ref. [47] developed the residual network\
    \ (ResNet)\nby introducing the residual block to construct deep neural networks.\n\
    LSTM models, which are a type of recurrent neural networks (RNN), are applied\n\
    to deal with sequential data in order to predict the time series of target variables\
    \ by\nlearning from past observations. Therefore, these models, which are able\
    \ to simulate\nnonlinear dynamic systems with minimal input data, retain the advantageous\
    \ information\nof long-term time series data across multiple time steps. Although\
    \ RNN is well suited for\nsimulating time series data because it preserves the\
    \ information of previous time steps\nSustainability 2023, 15, 7677\n10 of 26\n\
    through internal self-looped cells, the problem of gradient disappearance occurring\
    \ in the\nlong-range memory of the original RNN restricts its applicability in\
    \ predicting targets.\nTo overcome this problem, ref. [45] used a gate mechanism\
    \ to obtain information in an\nRNN-based LSTM network model. However, LSTM neglects\
    \ the learning of backward\nfeatures, which leads to the development of the Bidirectional\
    \ LSTM (BiLSTM) network\nmodel by combining backward and forward LSTMs.\neasy\
    \ falling into local optima are other weaknesses of standard neural networks.\
    \ There-\nfore, ref. [42] developed deep learning (DL) models to deal with large\
    \ multi-feature data \nthrough a multiple hidden layer structure. Compared to\
    \ traditional neural networks, DL \nmodels, which are known as large-sized neural\
    \ networks, as shown in Figure 2, have \nstrong computing power which can automatically\
    \ extract high level features from low \nlevel input data by intermediate layers\
    \ with learning complex nonlinear functions in dif-\nferent fields such as search\
    \ engines and image recognition. Since soil has extremely com-\nplex and nonlinear\
    \ structural characteristics, DL models are more effective in analyzing \nsoil\
    \ particle size and soil texture than traditional models [16,43]. In addition,\
    \ these meth-\nods simulate land-atmosphere interactions without complex knowledge\
    \ governing phys-\nical models. These models can efficiently process future data\
    \ with a high computational \nspeed and integrate more data to improve prediction\
    \ accuracy through additional learn-\ning. However, an inappropriate sample size\
    \ of the input data may cause overfitting, \nthereby decreasing the prediction\
    \ accuracy. \n \nFigure 2. Structure of the DL model. \nThe most common DL models\
    \ for environmental prediction include spatial models \n(Convolutional Neural\
    \ Networks, CNNs by [44]), temporal models (Long Short-Term \nMemory networks,\
    \ LSTMs by [45]) and spatial–temporal models (Convolutional LSTM, \nConvLSTM by\
    \ [46]). \nFigure 2. Structure of the DL model.\nThe CNN and LSTM models only\
    \ capture spatial and temporal variations, while the\ntarget variables have a\
    \ correlation between space and time. This problem was solved via\nthe ConvLSTM\
    \ model, which is a combination of the CNN and LSTM models. Unlike the\nCNN and\
    \ LSTM models, ConvLSTM using the output of the previous layer as the input for\n\
    the next layer is capable of extracting both temporal and spatial features by\
    \ a convolution\nlayer at the same time without decreasing the map size.\nSome\
    \ researchers exploited CNN, LSTM, and ConvLSTM models to estimate and pre-\n\
    dict the soil temperature. For example, ref. [48] modeled soil temperature using\
    \ persistence\nforecast (PF), BPNN, LSTM, and CNN trained with data decomposed\
    \ using ensemble em-\npirical mode decomposition (EEMD). They investigated three\
    \ sites in Switzerland, at depths\nbetween 5 and 30 cm. The EEMD-based models\
    \ provided the best results, and no model\nperformance differences were noted\
    \ between depths. Ref. [49] built on this work, focusing on\nthe proposed EEMD-Conv3d\
    \ model and extending it to predict spatiotemporally distributed\nsoil temperature\
    \ by air temperature data. The model showed the best performance among the\nConv\
    \ (2d and 3d), ConvLSTM, EEMD-Conv2D, and EEMD-ConvLSTM models.\nRef. [50] predicted\
    \ the soil temperature in Ottawa, Canada, at depths between 0 and 7 cm.\nThey\
    \ used a wide variety of models and input variables in order to form a comprehensive\
    \ view\non the best possible models for soil temperature prediction. Their modeling\
    \ methods included\nLRs, k-NNs, DT-based models, SVMs, stacking methods, MLP,\
    \ DL, and ANFIS models. The\ninput variables were the air temperature, precipitation,\
    \ surface pressure, evaporation, wind\nspeed, dew point temperature, solar radiation,\
    \ and thermal radiation. The three best-performing\nmodels were the DL model,\
    \ MLP, and stacking model; the choice of the best model among the\nthree depended\
    \ on the size of the dataset and the computational requirements. These three\n\
    models were used in a sensitivity analysis to determine the most relevant input\
    \ parameters,\nwhich were identified as air temperature and solar radiation.\n\
    Ref. [51] used 30 measurement stations across the US, representing different climates.\n\
    BiLSTM was used to model soil temperatures at these locations, which trains models\
    \ with\ndata points from both previous and future time steps. BiLSTM outperformed\
    \ the other\nSustainability 2023, 15, 7677\n11 of 26\nmodels at all but the shallowest\
    \ depth, demonstrating that using climate variables and time\ndata together eliminate\
    \ the decreased effectiveness of models at deep depths. The study\nalso explicitly\
    \ shows the correlation of different climate variables with soil temperatures\n\
    at different depths, all of which decrease with increasing depth except for month\
    \ and day.\nThis is in keeping with the result from ANNs that using current climate\
    \ variables without\ntime data leads to less accurate models at greater depths.\n\
    Ref. [52] proposed an embedded network prediction model based on the gated recurrent\n\
    unit (GRU), a modified type of LSTM, to learn the features of the historical soil\
    \ temperature\nat local and global scales. By comparing the model with ANN, ELM,\
    \ and LSTM, it was\nconcluded that the proposed model outperformed the other models\
    \ in predicting multi-depth\nsoil temperature at different time points, including\
    \ 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h.\nRef. [53] compared the performance of ML-based models,\
    \ including the DL model\nand RBNN, with conventional approaches for soil temperature\
    \ interpolation in southeast\nCanada. According to the results, the spline deterministic\
    \ spatial interpolation method, even\nwith increasing the spline nonlinearity,\
    \ failed to provide the spatial distribution for the soil\ntemperature and soil\
    \ water content. On the other side, the ML models could capture the\nspatial variability\
    \ of soil temperature even in sharp transition areas. It should be noted that\n\
    deep learning, with a normalized RMSE of 9.0% and R2 of 89.2%, outperformed the\
    \ RBNN. A\nlist of studies related to soil temperature estimation by DL models\

    \ play a signiﬁcant role in machine learning because of their simplicity\nand\
    \ generality. Various kernel function embedded models were developed to capture\n\
    non-linear relationships among which the support vector machine (SVM) is a well-known\n\
    kernel model. This model was originally developed for classiﬁcation purposes in\
    \ which a\nclassiﬁcation hyperplane is obtained by maximizing the margin between\
    \ different classes\nas shown in Equation (1) [54].\nwx + b = 0\n(1)\nwhere w\
    \ is a weighting vector, x is the independent input vector, and b indicates the\
    \ bias.\nTo distinguish negative and positive samples, the hyperplane provides\
    \ two dashed lines\nw·x + b = −1 and w·x + b = 1 with a maximum distance of\n\
    2\n∥w∥. The optimization function\nis also expressed as follows:\n\x1A\nmin 1\n\
    2∥ w ∥2\nyi(wxi + b) ≥ 1, i = 1, 2, . . . l\n(2)\nwhere y is the dependent output\
    \ vector and l is the number of samples.\nSVMs models, which are based on the\
    \ statistical learning theory, can solve inverse\nproblems by past data to obtain\
    \ variables of interest forward in time. To predict the variables\nof interest,\
    \ these models formulate quadratic optimization by structural risk minimization\n\
    (SRM) instead of empirical risk minimization (ERM), which is their outstanding\
    \ charac-\nteristic, to ensure a global optimum [55]. This ML-based approach,\
    \ considered a sparse\nmethod without being affected by dimensionality, utilizes\
    \ the generation error bound and\nintensive loss function, leading to precise\
    \ predictions. Furthermore, SVMs can resist noises\nand generalize concepts under\
    \ limited data conditions [56]. However, kernel function\nselection is a challenging\
    \ stage of their learning process. In addition, the scale and speed of\nthe learning\
    \ process can be other limiting factors of SVM, especially for real-time data.\n\
    SVM models, because of their high processing speed and the need for fewer training\n\
    data besides appropriate performance, recently gained attention for extracting\
    \ geo-/bio-\nphysical parameters. For example, ref. [57] developed an SVM-based\
    \ model comprising an\nannual average soil temperature prediction model and a\
    \ daily soil temperature amplitude\nprediction model to retrieve the daily soil\
    \ temperature. The annual average of humidity,\nwind speed, radiation, soil, and\
    \ air temperature are employed to train the annual average\nsoil temperature prediction\
    \ model and the daily soil temperature amplitude prediction.\nSustainability 2023,\
    \ 15, 7677\n13 of 26\nDespite the signiﬁcant role of soil temperature in meteorological,\
    \ ecological, and hy-\ndrological processes, studies did not address soil temperature\
    \ evaluation with ﬁne temporal\nresolution in data-scarce regions. Furthermore,\
    \ most studies employed air temperature\nas an input training dataset to estimate\
    \ soil temperature while a signiﬁcant correlation\nwas observed between soil temperature\
    \ drop and soil moisture rise. To this end, ref. [58]\nexploited the SVM model\
    \ along with an extreme gradient boosting system (XGBoost),\nRF, and MLP to predict\
    \ the spatiotemporal variability of soil temperature in the Indian\nHimalayan\
    \ Region (IHR) by hourly and half-hourly time series data, including rainfall,\n\
    soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure\
    \ deﬁcit,\nand solar radiation. Different input data combinations were utilized\
    \ to estimate the soil\ntemperature: Meteorological parameters, Meteorological\
    \ parameters + rainfall, Meteorolog-\nical parameters + soil moisture, and Meteorological\
    \ parameters + rainfall + soil moisture.\nAmong the models, XGBoost showed the\
    \ best performance, followed by RF, MLP, and SVM.\nMoreover, the addition of soil\
    \ moisture, unlike rainfall, to meteorological data improved\nthe estimation accuracy\
    \ signiﬁcantly.\nIn addition to classiﬁcation, SVM can be used for regression\
    \ purposes, which is\nknown as support vector regression (SVR). The basis of SVR\
    \ is the iterative process of the\nsequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm\
    \ [59]. Similar to SVM, SVR, which can\ncapture nonlinear relationships between\
    \ input and output variables, is used to estimate soil\ntemperature due to its\
    \ robustness to noise and generalization ability under conditions with\nlimited\
    \ reference samples [60]. Ref. [61] investigated soil temperature at depths from\
    \ 10 to\n100 cm at ﬁve different locations across Iran, ranging from hyper-arid\
    \ to hyper-humid. SVR\nmodels were built with and without an input corresponding\
    \ to the month of the year, and\nthe models containing the month parameter were\
    \ found to be more accurate, especially in\ndeeper layers. Furthermore, the results\
    \ showed that SVR models were better in deep layers\nthan in shallow ones while\
    \ MLR models could predict daily soil temperature at surface\nlayers with relatively\
    \ good accuracy.\nRef. [62] assessed the accuracy of SVR and Elman neural network\
    \ (ENN) as well as\nSVR and ENN coupled with the ﬁreﬂy algorithm (SVR-FFA and\
    \ ENN-FFA) and the krill\nherd algorithm (SVR-KHA and ENN-KHA) in modeling soil\
    \ temperature at depths of 5, 10,\n20, 30, 50, and 100 cm. Various meteorological\
    \ data combinations were evaluated under ﬁve\nscenarios, which included (air temperature),\
    \ (air temperature, sunshine), (air temperature,\nsunshine, relative humidity),\
    \ (air temperature, sunshine, relative humidity, wind speed),\nand (air temperature,\
    \ sunshine, relative humidity, wind speed, pressure deﬁcit). With the\nbest performance\
    \ at 10 cm soil depth, all models showed a decrease in error from 5 to\n10 cm\
    \ and an increase from 10 to 100 cm. Additionally, optimization algorithms provided\n\
    relatively satisfactory results in modeling soil temperature, especially at lower\
    \ depths.\nRef. [63] estimated the daily soil temperature at depths of 5, 10,\
    \ 20, and 50 cm for\ntwo stations with semiarid and humid climates in Turkey by\
    \ Bayesian Tuned Support\nVector Regression (BT-SVR), Bayesian Tuned Gaussian\
    \ Process Regression (BT-GPR), and\nLSTM models. A variety of daily meteorological\
    \ indicators, including cloudiness, air\ntemperature, relative humidity, precipitation,\
    \ and pressure, were used as input variables,\nand soil temperature at different\
    \ depths was the output variable. To increase the accuracy,\nthe study used a\
    \ novel scheme based on the Bayesian optimization method to optimize the\nparameters\
    \ of kernel functions of the GPR and SVR models. A number of kernel functions\n\
    were used for GPR, such as constant, linear, polynomial, squared exponential,\
    \ rational\nquadratic, power, and Matern-3, as well as linear, polynomial, Gaussian,\
    \ and sigmoid\nfunctions for SVR. Among the models, the BT-GPR model exhibited\
    \ the highest accuracy\nfor both stations at depth of 5 cm. Table 3 presents a\

    \ with dynamic, non-stationary, and\nnon-linear data by AI methods, the single\
    \ models suffer from insufﬁcient accuracy in some\ncases of environmental simulation.\
    \ To overcome the limitations of any single method,\ncoupled prediction models\
    \ were developed to improve the accuracy in both the prediction\nand optimization\
    \ stages by incorporating the superior features of individual models.\nAdaptive\
    \ neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), which are a combination of ANN\nand fuzzy\
    \ logic, comprise an important category of hybrid models (Figure 3). These models\n\
    map input variables to output targets through an ensemble of membership functions\
    \ and\nif-then rules. Although ANFIS can predict target variable dynamics with\
    \ limited input\nrequirements and acceptable prediction accuracy, the long-term\
    \ generalization capability\nof NN is restricted by the ad hoc nature of fuzzy\
    \ logic rules. Moreover, additional pre-\nprocessing requires extensive time and\
    \ frequency domain computations. However, ANFIS\nis one of the most popular models\
    \ for simulating and predicting environmental compo-\nnents such as soil temperature.\
    \ Ref. [64] built several ANFIS models for soil temperature\nprediction to explore\
    \ different optimization schemes. Using only air temperature as an\ninput variable,\
    \ the models predicted soil temperature at locations in North Dakota, U.S., at\n\
    10 cm depth. The optimization schemes were the PSO, SSA, grey wolf optimizer (GWO),\n\
    genetic algorithm (GA), dragonﬂy algorithm (DA), grasshopper optimization algorithm\n\
    Sustainability 2023, 15, 7677\n15 of 26\n(GOA), and a proposed hybrid SSA-GOA\
    \ algorithm including a mutation phase (mSG). The\nproposed optimization scheme\
    \ resulted in a model with improved predictive power over\nother ANFIS models,\
    \ though the convergence time was longer than for most optimization\nschemes except\
    \ GOA.\nSustainability 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n17 of 27 \n \n \nFigure 3.\
    \ Structure of the ANFIS model. Input and output layers (pink), Fuzzification\
    \ and defuzzi-\nfication layers (yellow), product and normalization layers (green).\
    \ \nIn addition to ANFIS, researchers developed other hybrid models by combining\
    \ \nANN, SVM, DL, etc. For example, two ML-based models, FFBPNN and GEP, a time-se-\n\
    ries-based model, fractionally autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA),\
    \ and \ntwo hybrid models, FFBPNN-FARIMA and GEP-FARIMA, were used to estimate\
    \ the \ndaily soil temperature at depths of 5, 10, 50, and 100 cm [71]. To generalize\
    \ the models to \ndifferent climate classes, the stations were selected in arid,\
    \ semi-arid, and very humid \nclimates. At all depths, the ML-based models outperformed\
    \ the time-series-based model, \nand the hybrid models were superior to classical\
    \ models. \nIn order to overcome the generalization issues of classical standalone\
    \ models, opti-\nmization algorithms, such as GA, GWO, and PSO were integrated\
    \ into the models to de-\nvelop strong knowledge-based predictive systems. In\
    \ this regard, some researchers ad-\ndressed the lack of optimization algorithms\
    \ by developing optimized AI techniques. Ref. \n[72] evaluated the performance\
    \ of three hybrid models including SVM, MLP, and ANFIS \nboosted by the slime\
    \ mold algorithm (SMA), PSO, and spotted-hyena optimizer (SHO) in \nforecasting\
    \ daily soil temperature at 5, 15, and 30 cm in a semi-arid region of Punjab,\
    \ India. \nSince the performance of ML models highly depends on the input variables,\
    \ a gamma test \n(GT) was performed to determine the optimal input dataset for\
    \ ML models, resulting in \nan optimal combination of relative humidity, wind\
    \ speed, solar radiation, and air temper-\nature. Among the models, SVM-SMA provided\
    \ the best accuracy in predicting the soil \ntemperature at depths of 5, 15, and\
    \ 30 cm, respectively. To improve the ELM performance \nin estimating the daily\
    \ soil temperature at depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 cm, ref. [73] \nused\
    \ the SaE algorithm to optimize the parameters of ELM’s hidden node. The input\
    \ var-\niables included the daily minimum, maximum, and average air temperatures\
    \ because of \ntheir high correlations with soil temperature data at all depths.\
    \ Despite the desirable be-\nhavior of both ELM and SaE-ELM against ANN and genetic\
    \ programming (GP), the hy-\nbrid model showed slightly better performance with\
    \ a lower mean absolute bias error \n(MABE) and a higher correlation coefficient\
    \ (R). Ref. [74] employed a hybrid multi-layer \nperceptron algorithm integrated\
    \ with the firefly optimizer algorithm (MLP-FFA) to pre-\ndict soil temperature\
    \ at multiple depths, including 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm, using soil \ndepth,\
    \ periodicity (or the respective month), atmospheric pressure, air temperature,\
    \ and \nsolar radiation as model predictors. They compared the results with MLP\
    \ model and \nfound MLP-FFA model had better performance than the standalone MLP\
    \ model. Ref. [75] \nemployed ENN, which is a type of dynamic recurrent neural\

    \ a historical record of 1827 days of soil temperature data from two\nsites in\
    \ Illinois, US, each with data at 10 and 20 cm depths. The data were extended\
    \ using\nMLP and ANFIS with and without PSO as well as auto-regressive moving\
    \ average (ARMA).\nTo account for seasonal variation, some models were built using\
    \ data preprocessed with\nspectral analysis or wavelet decomposition to remove\
    \ the seasonal periodic component.\nThe ARMA model combined with spectral analysis\
    \ outperformed the AI techniques for\nboth depths.\nRef. [66] applied ANFIS, dynamic\
    \ evolving neurofuzzy inference system (DENFIS),\nWNN, and multivariate adaptive\
    \ regression spline (MARS) to predict land surface temper-\nature using NDVI,\
    \ normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference\nbareness\
    \ index (NDBaI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), urban index (UI), and\n\
    elevation. According to the results, ANFIS showed the best performance in training\
    \ and\ntest periods with RMSE of 0.78 ◦C and 0.36 ◦C, respectively.\nIn [67],\
    \ the performance of ANFIS model against a time-series-based model, i.e., bi-\n\
    linear model, was evaluated for daily soil temperature retrieval at different\
    \ soil depths\n(5, 10, 50, and 100 cm) by daily recorded soil temperature. Furthermore,\
    \ two hybrid\nmodels built by combining ANFIS with bi-linear and wavelet analyses\
    \ were developed to\nimprove the retrieval accuracy of soil temperature. Based\
    \ on the soil temperature results,\nthe ANFIS model demonstrated better performance\
    \ than the bi-linear model as well as\nthe hybrid models were superior to classical\
    \ models. In addition to local evaluation, an\nexternal analysis was implemented\
    \ to assess the performance of ANFIS in modeling soil\ntemperature at 5 and 50\
    \ cm depths by soil temperature data at 10 and 100 cm, respectively,\nand vice\
    \ versa, denoting the positive effect of soil temperature data at another depth\
    \ in\nretrieving soil temperature at target depth.\nRef. [68] evaluated the applicability\
    \ of ANN, ANFIS, and GP in simulating monthly\nsoil temperature at different depths\
    \ by using weather data at two stations in Turkey. The\nclimatic data used to\
    \ model soil temperature were air temperature, relative humidity, solar\nradiation,\
    \ wind speed, and soil temperature at different depths (10, 20, and 100 cm). The\n\
    results illustrated the superior performance of GP in comparison with ANN and\
    \ ANFIS\nin estimating the soil temperature at 10, 50, and 100 cm. By including\
    \ periodicity (month\nSustainability 2023, 15, 7677\n16 of 26\nof the year) as\
    \ another input variable, considerable improvement was achieved in the\naccuracy\
    \ of the models.\nRef. [69] used ANN, CANFIS, WNN, and wavelet transformation\
    \ combined with\nCANFIS (WCANFIS) to retrieve soil temperatures at 5, 10, 20,\
    \ 30, and 100 cm by air\ntemperature data. The results indicated the suitable\
    \ performance of WCANFIS followed by\nANN, CANFIS, and WNN. In addition, the minimum\
    \ and maximum errors were obtained\nfor the depth of 20 and 100 cm, respectively.\
    \ Long-term soil temperature data are required\nto model soil temperature, which\
    \ restricts the prediction models in most situations due\nto insufﬁcient stations\
    \ recording soil temperature [35]. To address this gap, ref. [70] used\nshort-time\
    \ soil temperature data recorded by thermal sensors along with air temperature,\n\
    environmental parameters, and soil properties to model soil temperature at 5 and\
    \ 10 cm by\nANN, ANFIS, and MLR. The air temperature was found to be the most\
    \ effective parameter\nin soil temperature modeling. In addition, the best performance\
    \ belonged to ANFIS,\nfollowed by ANN and MLR, respectively.\nIn addition to ANFIS,\
    \ researchers developed other hybrid models by combining ANN,\nSVM, DL, etc. For\
    \ example, two ML-based models, FFBPNN and GEP, a time-series-\nbased model, fractionally\
    \ autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA), and two\nhybrid models, FFBPNN-FARIMA\
    \ and GEP-FARIMA, were used to estimate the daily soil\ntemperature at depths\
    \ of 5, 10, 50, and 100 cm [71]. To generalize the models to different\nclimate\
    \ classes, the stations were selected in arid, semi-arid, and very humid climates.\n\
    At all depths, the ML-based models outperformed the time-series-based model, and\
    \ the\nhybrid models were superior to classical models.\nIn order to overcome\
    \ the generalization issues of classical standalone models, op-\ntimization algorithms,\
    \ such as GA, GWO, and PSO were integrated into the models to\ndevelop strong\
    \ knowledge-based predictive systems. In this regard, some researchers\naddressed\
    \ the lack of optimization algorithms by developing optimized AI techniques.\n\
    Ref. [72] evaluated the performance of three hybrid models including SVM, MLP,\
    \ and\nANFIS boosted by the slime mold algorithm (SMA), PSO, and spotted-hyena\
    \ optimizer\n(SHO) in forecasting daily soil temperature at 5, 15, and 30 cm in\
    \ a semi-arid region of\nPunjab, India. Since the performance of ML models highly\
    \ depends on the input variables,\na gamma test (GT) was performed to determine\
    \ the optimal input dataset for ML models,\nresulting in an optimal combination\
    \ of relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and\nair temperature. Among\
    \ the models, SVM-SMA provided the best accuracy in predicting\nthe soil temperature\
    \ at depths of 5, 15, and 30 cm, respectively. To improve the ELM\nperformance\
    \ in estimating the daily soil temperature at depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and\n\
    100 cm, ref. [73] used the SaE algorithm to optimize the parameters of ELM’s hidden\
    \ node.\nThe input variables included the daily minimum, maximum, and average\
    \ air temperatures\nbecause of their high correlations with soil temperature data\
    \ at all depths. Despite the\ndesirable behavior of both ELM and SaE-ELM against\
    \ ANN and genetic programming\n(GP), the hybrid model showed slightly better performance\
    \ with a lower mean absolute\nbias error (MABE) and a higher correlation coefﬁcient\

    \ In addition, the highest accuracy was achieved at\nthe full-input pattern for\

    3. Input Dataset\nThree general categories of input variables are used to train\
    \ ML-based models, includ-\ning climate data, time series of soil temperature,\
    \ and a combination of soil temperature\ntime series and climatic data. Climate\
    \ variables applied to ML models are relative humidity\n(average, maximum, and\
    \ minimum), solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature (average,\nmaximum, and\
    \ minimum), vapor pressure deﬁcit, sunshine hours, precipitation, dew point\n\
    temperature, potential evapotranspiration, evaporation, atmospheric pressure,\
    \ and cloudi-\nness. According to the studies, air temperature was identiﬁed as\
    \ the most effective variable\nin predicting soil temperature [20,28,31,50,70,73].\
    \ The importance of climate variables such\nas solar radiation, relative humidity,\
    \ precipitation, and soil moisture is disputed between\ndifferent studies; this\
    \ may be because the effect of moisture on soil temperature varies with\nthe soil\
    \ depth and the type of climate. However, most studies demonstrated that both\n\
    relative humidity and solar radiation are more effective than other variables\
    \ [28,31,40,50].\nMoreover, [58] showed a signiﬁcant correlation between soil\
    \ temperature and soil moisture\nthan soil temperature and precipitation.\nThe\
    \ models using climate parameters are less effective at greater depths, where\
    \ above-\nground climate has a decreased impact and the effect of previous temperatures\
    \ is corre-\nspondingly increased. It can be due to the relationships between\
    \ climate parameters and\nsoil temperature change with the soil depth. Therefore,\
    \ the inclusion of periodicity (number\nof days, months, and years) as another\
    \ input variable led to a considerable improvement\nin estimation accuracy, especially\
    \ at deeper soil depths [20,61,68]. In addition, combining\ncurrent climate conditions\
    \ with temporal information is recommended for the best results\nfor deep soil\
    \ temperature predictions [24,51].\nSustainability 2023, 15, 7677\n20 of 26\n\
    4. Conclusions and Future Outlook\nSoil temperature is a key factor affecting\
    \ the physical, chemical, and biological prop-\nerties of soil. In addition to\
    \ meteorological variables, soil temperature depends on to-\npographic conditions\
    \ and soil characteristics. The complex interactions between these\nvariables\
    \ make the estimation of soil temperature challenging.\nDirect measurement of\
    \ soil temperature by instruments such as thermistors, thermo-\ncouples, and thermocouple\
    \ wires on a large spatial scale is impractical because it is an\nexpensive and\
    \ time-consuming process. Therefore, soil temperature is mainly estimated\nusing\
    \ physically and statistically based models with a tradeoff between resolution,\
    \ accuracy,\nand computational efﬁciency.\nPhysically based models, despite their\
    \ wide use in soil temperature estimation, are\ncomplex with intense data requirement.\
    \ On the other hand, the empirical approach is\na simple method that requires\
    \ less input data; however, the statistical regression-based\nrelationship between\
    \ input and output is site dependent. The limitations of the above\nmethods led\
    \ to the development of data-driven ML techniques, such as ANN, DL, and\nSVM,\
    \ to estimate the soil temperature at multiple depths.\nANNs, as the most widely\
    \ used data-driven models, are capable of capturing nonlinear\ndata trends but\
    \ these models are used to extract single data features without learning\nspatiotemporal\
    \ patterns. DL techniques can address this issue by increasing the depth\nof neural\
    \ networks. However, the prediction accuracy may decrease as a result of an\n\
    inadequate sample size of the input data. Although the use of kernel function\
    \ embedded\nmodels such as SVMs ensures a global optimum, the selection of kernel\
    \ functions restricts\ntheir application. These traditional ML models have some\
    \ drawbacks, including ANN’s\nlow generalization performance, ANFIS’s need for\
    \ accurate weighting of the membership\nfunction, ELM’s large training datasets\
    \ requirement, and SVM’s high sensitivity to hyper-\nparameter selection, which\
    \ limit their applications.\nThe best ML technique for soil temperature retrieval\
    \ generally depends on training\ndatasets, model structure, and target level of\
    \ accuracy. Based on studies carried out\nto estimate soil temperature, DL models,\
    \ such as BiLSTM and LSTM, showed better\nperformance than other models. After\
    \ that, ANFIS exhibited the best performance followed\nby SVM, WNN, ELN, and ANN.\
    \ On the other hand, most studies found that hybrid\nmodels, which are mostly\
    \ standalone models boosted by optimization algorithms, were\nsuperior to classical\
    \ models. In addition to hybrid models with optimization schemes,\na new generation\
    \ of standalone AI-based models has the potential to offer promising\nalternatives\
    \ to traditional models because of their ﬂexibility.\nIn addition, combining current\
    \ climate conditions with time information is necessary\nfor the best results,\
    \ especially for deep soil temperature predictions. In this regard, im-\nproving\
    \ both machine learning and statistical methods to account for periodicity increases\n\
    the accuracy of the soil temperature prediction. If modeling for deeper soil depths\
    \ can\nbe brought up to the standard currently achieved by models for shallow\
    \ depths, it may\nbe possible to reduce the number of climate variables needed\
    \ as input. This can simplify\nthe process of soil temperature prediction and\
    \ make the models more generalizable to\ndifferent climates. For this purpose,\
    \ there are several approaches. The simplest approach\nis to add the month to\
    \ the set of input climate variables. This method should be easy to\nimplement\
    \ for any model using the current climate conditions for prediction. It relies\n\
    on seasons being relatively consistent in terms of temperature and timing from\
    \ year to\nyear. Another approach is the sliding window approach, which uses climate\
    \ variables\nfrom previous time steps as the additional input variables. The current\
    \ conditions are,\nthus, situated in a broader context in time without any assumptions\
    \ about the season. The\nsliding window approach relies on choosing a window that\
    \ is appropriate for the lag time\nbetween climate conditions and their effect\
    \ on soil temperatures. In complex models, lag\ntimes between climate variables\
    \ and soil temperatures may not be the same, nor may lag\ntimes between a variable\
    \ and soil temperatures at different depths. Future studies should\naddress these\
    \ issues. Moreover, remote sensing observations of soil properties such as\nSustainability\
    \ 2023, 15, 7677\n21 of 26\nmoisture content and vegetation cover can be combined\
    \ with machine learning models\nas a future perspective to achieve more accurate\
    \ soil temperature estimation. In addition,\nthe transferability of models over\
    \ different regions and climates can be more explored to\ndetermine the effective\
    \ factors on the model’s performance in soil temperature retrieval\nacross various\
    \ soil types and climates.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.M., H.S.,\

    Copy Abstract The construction industry has witnessed the increasing use of digital
    tools and smart solutions, particularly, in the realm of buildings energy automation
    within the concept of smart cities. While to truly realize the potential benefits
    of smart cities, a broader scope of smart initiatives is required to support the
    transition from smart buildings towards smart neighbourhoods, appreciated as the
    critical unit of urban development. To support this interplay of smart solutions
    between buildings and neighbourhoods, this article aims to collect and review
    all smart solutions presented in existing scientific articles, technical literature,
    and realized European projects. These solutions are classified under two main
    sections of buildings and neighbourhoods, which are investigated through five
    domains: buildings energy-related uses, renewable energy sources, water, waste,
    and open space management. Showcasing the quantitative outcomes demonstrates the
    potential benefits of implementing smart solutions from buildings to neighbourhoods.
    Moreover, this research concludes that the true enhancement of energy conservation
    goes beyond the buildings’ energy component and can be genuinely achieved by integrating
    intelligent elements of the neighbourhood, due to their strong interdependencies.
    Future research is recommended to focus on assessing the effectiveness of these
    solutions towards resource conservation. Keywords Smart building; smart energy

  key_findings: Smart solutions can enhance energy conservation by integrating intelligent
    elements of the neighborhood due to their strong interdependencies. Future research
    should focus on assessing the effectiveness of these solutions towards resource
    conservation.
  limitations: The paper's focus on smart solutions in general, rather than specifically
    on automated irrigation management systems, may limit its relevance to the specific
    point being addressed.
  main_objective: To collect and review smart solutions for buildings and neighborhoods
    presented in scientific articles, technical literature, and realized European
    projects, classified into five domains.

  publication_year: 2023
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is not directly relevant to the point focus on autonomous
    planning and scheduling of VRI using machine learning and optimization techniques.
    However, it does include a section on smart water management, which aligns with
    the broader theme of automated irrigation management systems.

  explanation: "**Precision Irrigation**\n- Automated systems for delivering water\
    \ to crops based on specific requirements.\n- Involves monitoring crop and soil\
    \ conditions, scheduling irrigation, and controlling water application.\n- Aims\
    \ to optimize water usage, reduce environmental impact, and improve crop yields.\n\
    \n**Key Components of Precision Irrigation System:**\n- **Monitoring:**\n    -\
    \ Soil moisture sensors to measure soil water content.\n    - Plant sensors to\
    \ assess plant water status (e.g., leaf water potential, sap flow).\n    - Weather\
    \ stations to collect climate data (e.g., temperature, humidity, rainfall).\n\n\
    - **Decision Support:**\n    - Software algorithms that analyze sensor data and\
    \ determine irrigation schedules.\n    - Adaptive decision support systems adjust\
    \ schedules based on real-time feedback.\n\n- **Irrigation Control:**\n    - Variable\
    \ rate water application systems (e.g., moving sprinklers, drip irrigation).\n\
    \    - Automatically adjust water flow to match crop water needs at specific locations\
    \ within the field.\n\n**Benefits of Precision Irrigation:**\n- Improved crop\
    \ yields: Precise water delivery optimizes plant growth.\n- Reduced water usage:\
    \ Eliminates overwatering, leading to water conservation.\n- Enhanced environmental\
    \ sustainability: Minimizes water runoff and leaching of nutrients, protecting\
    \ water quality.\n- Reduced energy consumption: Optimizes pumping and irrigation\
    \ equipment operation.\n- Reduced labor costs: Automates irrigation processes,\
    \ freeing up labor for other tasks.\n\n**Limitations of Current Precision Irrigation\
    \ Systems:**\n- High cost of equipment and installation.\n- Limited economic benefits\
    \ in some applications (e.g., field crops with low water requirements).\n- Technical\
    \ complexities in data management and system maintenance.\n\n**Future Directions:**\n\
    - Further advancements in sensor technology for improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness.\n\
    - Development of adaptive decision support systems that can account for real-time\
    \ crop and environmental conditions.\n- Greater adoption of precision irrigation\
    \ techniques to achieve sustainable water use in agriculture."

    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\
    \ monitoring methods.\nPlant-Based Measurement\nAdvantage\nDisadvantage\nPlant\

    \ and difﬁcult to implement in\nhumid climates\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n\
    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n13 of 29\n6.1.2. Simulations\nCrop simulation models\
    \ based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics\nand\
    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\

    \ \nThese factors may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    Abstract: With the increasing worldwide population and the requirement for efﬁcient\
    \ approaches to\nfarm care and irrigation, the demand for water is constantly\
    \ rising, and water resources are becoming\nscarce. This has led to the development\
    \ of smart water management systems that aim to improve the\nefﬁciency of water\
    \ management. This paper pioneers an effective Irrigation Water Quality Prediction\n\
    (IWQP) model using a convolution neural architecture that can be trained on any\
    \ general computing\ndevice. The developed IWQP4Net is assessed using several\
    \ evaluation measurements and compared\nto the Logistic Regression (LR), Support\
    \ Vector regression (SVR), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)\nmodels. The results show\
    \ that the developed IWQP4Net achieved a promising outcome and better\nperformance\
    \ than the other comparative models.\nKeywords: irrigation system; water quality;\
    \ deep learning; convolutional neural network prediction\n1. Introduction\nThe\
    \ United Nations (UN) has asserted that access to safe domestic potable water\
    \ is\nan essential human right and a step towards improving people’s living standards.\
    \ An\naccessible, adequate, clean, and safe drinking water supply is one of the\
    \ main aspirations\nof the Millennium Development Goals (UN-MDGs), and it is one\
    \ of the core aims of the\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [1]. The UN-MDGs\
    \ concluded that water sustains\nlife, but safe and clean drinking water is a\
    \ hallmark of civilization. In order to ensure that\nconsumers receive the required\
    \ quality of water supplied from treatment plants, there is\na need to deter,\
    \ detect and minimize any threats to the water supply such as accidents,\nbackﬂow,\
    \ vandalism, hazardous material releases, and terrorism. Natural disasters such\n\
    as waterborne disease outbreaks, bushﬁres, and ﬂoods can also affect the quality\
    \ of water\nsupplied. The supply of safe potable water to consumers implies that\
    \ there must be proper\nsecurity setups and safeguards in terms of how rapidly\
    \ to react to disasters and when they\noccur [2].\nA signiﬁcant amount of freshwater\
    \ is used in farming and agriculture, especially for\nirrigation. Due to a lack\
    \ of affordable clever irrigation technologies, developing nations use\nmore water\
    \ than industrialized nations to produce the same output. For instance, India\
    \ has\nonly 4% of the world’s freshwater resources to service 17% of the global\
    \ population, but\nsome of its key agricultural products require two to four times\
    \ more water than those of\nother nations such as China and the USA [3]. Therefore,\
    \ there is an urgent need to develop\nsmart methods and systems based on sophisticated\
    \ technologies for the efﬁcient use of\nfresh water.\nMany studies have used Deep\
    \ Learning (DL) approaches for irrigation water sys-\ntems [4–7]. The Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) was used by the authors of [8] to collect data from\nthe ﬁeld\
    \ on a variety of variables, including soil moisture, soil temperature, weather,\
    \ and\nenvironmental conditions. Their strategy optimizes the nee and thereby\
    \ uses less energy\nwith the aid of different information. The collected data\
    \ from the IoT devices were saved in\nthe cloud, and they then employed ML models\
    \ for precise irrigation systems.\nWater 2023, 15, 1657. https://doi.org/10.3390/w15091657\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/water\nWater 2023, 15, 1657\n2 of 11\nIn [9], an\
    \ intelligent irrigation system for precision agriculture based on DL neural\n\
    networks is explored. The developed method can maintain its functionality better\
    \ over time\nand in any weather conditions. It uses an extended short-term memory\
    \ network (LSTM) to\nforecast the irrigation schedule, the spatial spread of water\
    \ needed to irrigate the arable\nland, and the volumetric soil moisture content\
    \ for the following day. In [10], the authors\nused IoT sensors to collect soil\
    \ moisture, temperature, humidity, and time data, and then\nthey used that data\
    \ as inputs to LR, Random Forest (RF), SVR, and Convolutional Neural\nNetwork\
    \ (CNN) techniques to classify the produced data from the IoT. Based on the results,\n\
    the RF model performed the best compared to the other techniques.\nIn the study\
    \ of [11], the regression analysis method showed better results than the\ncorrelation\
    \ for monitoring water quality and predicting trends in water quality variation.\n\
    In [12], an automation approach for the farm irrigation system was reported based\
    \ on\nIoT and ML. The authors established a distributed wireless sensor network\
    \ (WSN), where\nvarious sensors cover each region of the farm, and then these\
    \ data were transmitted\nto a server. They then used stored data were used to\
    \ predict irrigation patterns using\nML methods.\nIn order to estimate the inﬁltrated\
    \ water in the furrow irrigation system, the authors\nof [13] applied the SVR,\
    \ Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy\nInference System\
    \ (ANFIS), Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), and Multivariate Linear\nRegression\
    \ (MLR) models. The results showed that the Fireﬂy Algorithm (FA) has a high\n\
    ability to boost the accuracy of the implemented models. The authors in [14] present\
    \ a\nmachine learning (ML) algorithm-based smart system to anticipate irrigation\
    \ needs by\nsensing ground parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity,\
    \ and water level.\nThe authors in [15] discussed the recent contributions of\
    \ both DL and IoT for precision\nagriculture. They also proposed a boot-strapping\
    \ method of transfer learning, where ﬁne-\ntuned VGG16 is improved by newly built\
    \ fully connected layers. The results showed that\ntheir improvement method accomplished\
    \ better accuracy than the other models used in\ntheir work.\nIn [16], a stacking\
    \ model of ML combined with feature selection methods was investi-\ngated to accurately\
    \ calculate the required amount of water for a plant. The relevance of the\nfeatures\
    \ was determined by using RF, state-of-the-art feature elimination, and SelectKBest.\n\
    An ensemble of CART, gradient boost regression, and XGBoost regressors was suggested\n\
    based on the best subset of characteristics. Several crops, such as tomatoes,\
    \ grapes, and\nlemons, were used to train and test the models, which incorporated\
    \ information on the\nweather, soil, irrigation, and crops. The feature selection\
    \ results showed the signiﬁcance of\nevapotranspiration, depletion, and shortfall\
    \ levels in maximizing the model’s accuracy.\nIn [17], the authors investigated\
    \ several ML-based methods and their performance to\ncalculate Water Quality Index\
    \ (WQI) using a dataset collected from the Kim Hai irrigation\nsystem. They applied\
    \ several feature selection methods to pick key parameters fed to the\nML models.\
    \ Results conﬁrmed that a combination of feature selection along with ML has\n\
    been an effective choice for calculating the WQI. In [18], Long Short-Term Memory\
    \ LSTM,\nCNN, and hybrid CNN-LSTM models, were examined in order to forecast water\
    \ quality.\nThe results showed that the hybrid model had a high ability to capture\
    \ low and high levels\nof water quality variables compared to LSTM and CNN alone.\
    \ As a result, improved water\nquality prediction still requires more sophisticated\
    \ prediction algorithms to deliver an\neffective approach with high performance.\
    \ The main contributions of this paper can be\nsummarized as follows:\n1.\nIntroduced\
    \ an effective Irrigation Water Quality Prediction (IWQP) approach based on\n\
    an efﬁcient CNN architecture which comprises two convolution layers, a max-pooling\n\
    layer, a dropout layer, and two dense layers;\n2.\nExamined and compared the performance\
    \ of IWQP4Net with the LR, SVR, and kNN\nmodels using different evaluation measurements\
    \ and visualizations methods;\n3.\nDemonstrated the efﬁciency of the developed\
    \ IWQP4Net for IWQP and its superiority\nover the other competitive models.\n\
    Water 2023, 15, 1657\n3 of 11\nThe remaining parts of this paper consist of four\
    \ sections. Section 2 presents an\noverview of the dataset used in this work and\
    \ the developed IWQP approach. Section 3\nprovides the evaluation measurements\
    \ used to evaluate the introduced IWQP model.\nSection 4 discusses the experimental\
    \ results of this work. Finally, Section 5 presents the\nconclusion of this paper.\n\
    2. Methods and Material\n2.1. Dataset\nOn the basis of the input data, which is\
    \ the historical data of other water-measurement\nindices, the spatiotemporal\
    \ water quality is to be forecast in terms of the “power of hy-\ndrogen (pH)”\
    \ value for the following day. The United States Geological Survey publishes\n\
    this dataset [19]. Depending on the water system they are a part of, such as the\
    \ water\nsystem of Atlanta, the Savannah River’s watershed, and others, high-level\
    \ prior spatial\ninformation is given. It comprises training data collected for\
    \ 423 days (1 December 2014 to\n28 January 2016), and testing data collected for\
    \ 282 days (25 March 2017 to 1 January 2018).\nThe input data comprises daily\
    \ samples taken from 37 water stations and that were used to\ncalculate the pH\
    \ levels in Georgia, USA. Due to the complexity of the water system, the\nprecise\
    \ connections between each location through water streams, or spatial connectivity,\n\
    are unknown. Eleven standard parameters, including temperature, speciﬁc conductance,\n\
    and the volume of dissolved oxygen, are used to predict the pH value for each\
    \ water\nstation. The input data at any time instant is spatially arranged as\
    \ a matrix of dimension\n(37 × 11), where rows correspond to different water stations\
    \ and columns correspond to\ndifferent features affecting the pH value. Hence,\
    \ the training input data has a dimension\nof (423 × 37 × 11), and a concatenation\
    \ of 423 days of spatial matrices. Similarly, the test\ninput data has a dimension\
    \ of (282 × 37 × 11). The output comprises the pH value for\n37 water stations\
    \ for each day. Hence, the training and test output data dimensions are\n(423\
    \ × 37) and (282 × 37), respectively. A statistical summary of input and output\
    \ training\nand testing data is presented in Table 1. It can be assumed that both\
    \ data are generated from\nthe same distribution and, hence, can be used to train\
    \ and evaluate the CNN for IWQP.\nTable 1. Statistical summary of training and\

    DL methods have attracted signiﬁcant research interest due to their response capability\n\
    to many data forms in diverse contexts, such as prediction and classiﬁcation issues.\
    \ They\nhave been successfully applied to smart homes [20], image segmentation\
    \ [21], self-driving\nvehicles [22], agriculture [23], and to many others. These\
    \ techniques teach a device to\nanalyse inputs using several layers, similar to\
    \ human brain processing, to aid in data\nclassiﬁcation and prediction, simulating\
    \ the brain’s capacity to process information and\nreach the right judgments [24].\
    \ In this work, the water quality dataset requires a quality\nvalue to be predicted\
    \ for each water station. This indicates that the given problem is\nWater 2023,\
    \ 15, 1657\n4 of 11\nmultivariate regression, with 37 outputs to be predicted\
    \ simultaneously. Figure 1 shows\nthe overall system ﬂow used in this work to\
    \ predict the water quality in terms of pH value\nin the irrigation system framework.\
    \ The input data is already divided into training and test\nsubsets. We use only\
    \ the training subset for model generation and validation, while the\ntesting\
    \ subset is used to evaluate the generalized performance of the model using three\n\

    \ noted that the ﬂattened layer, the fourth layer shown in the\nIWQP4Net architecture,\
    \ is non-trainable and has no parameters. It can be understood as a\ncylindrical\
    \ convolution layer with a unity valued kernel function of size (1 × 1) and the\n\
    number of ﬁlters equal to the total number of coefﬁcients in the previous convolution\
    \ layer\noutput. The resulting dimension is 300 (15 × 2 × 10). The large number\
    \ of parameters\nin the CNNs keeps them at risk of overﬁtting. In this work, training\
    \ examples are 423,\nwhich a large CNN model can easily memorize. To avoid overﬁtting\
    \ and increase general-\nization [26,27], a dropout layer with 40% of the input\
    \ being randomly set to 0 is added in\nthe sequential model. This is another example\
    \ of a non-trainable layer. It is followed by\nanother dense layer with 60 neurons\
    \ that acts as a reduction layer to ﬁlter out important\nfeatures for the current\
    \ regression task. Finally, an output layer with the number of neurons\nequal\
    \ to the number of water stations is added to get the ﬁnal water quality prediction.\

    trainable parameters of the IWQP4Net. This puts the network at risk of overﬁtting.\
    \ During\ntraining, the optimum hyper-parameter set for the network was guided\
    \ by the loss curves\nfor training and validation. The learning rate and batch\
    \ size are searched over a logarithmic\nrange, while epochs are varied linearly.\
    \ For large learning rates, the loss function is noisy;\nhence, the CNN is unreliable\
    \ due to the high variance problem. This variance can be\nreduced up to a level\
    \ by increasing the batch size, but the predicted MAPE was high.\nAfter reducing\
    \ the learning rates to very small values, the optimum solution was obtained\n\
    after several hundreds of epochs. Figure 3 shows the training and validation loss\
    \ for the\ndeveloped IWQP4Net’s optimum hyper-parameters, as mentioned in Table\

    \ on the vertical axis of all four models\nfor training and testing data. Each\
    \ scatter plot is superimposed with a regression line with\nthe regression equation\

    \ and the testing MAPE is the worst. A similar visualization can be seen in\n\
    Figure 4.\nThe scatter plot for LR training shows the best performance with a\
    \ minimal deviation\nfor the regression line, but testing scatter plots show a\
    \ very high deviation from the\nregression line. Scatter plots for the IWQP4Net\
    \ model show a good match between the\nobserved and predicted water quality. The\
    \ SVR and kNN models show slightly higher\ndeviation from the regression line\
    \ than the developed model.\nThe prediction error analysis is examined to understand\
    \ the behavior of all four\nprediction models. Figure 5 shows the histograms (bin\
    \ width = 0.005) of prediction error\n(WQpre − WQobs) of all four models for training\
    \ and testing data. Kernel density (KDE)\nplots superimpose all histograms with\
    \ Gaussian kernel and bandwidth calculated using\nScott’s method [28]. As stated\
    \ above, an impulsive training error and an almost ﬂat (very\nhigh standard deviation)\
    \ testing error characterizes the overﬁtted LR model. The training\nhistogram\
    \ and KDE plots of IWQP4Net provide a high concentration with lower prediction\n\
    errors. Similar behavior can also be seen in the testing data with a slight bias\
    \ toward the\nvalue for predicted water quality. The kNN model also shows a concentration\
    \ of training\nand testing errors toward lower values with a slightly higher standard\
    \ deviation than the\ndeveloped method. The SVR model shows a signiﬁcantly large\

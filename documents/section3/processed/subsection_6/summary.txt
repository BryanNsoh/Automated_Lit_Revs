Abstract—Agricultural productivity is a critical component of 
sustainable 
economic 
growth, 
particularly 
in 
developing 
countries. Morocco, with its vast agricultural potential, is in need 
of advanced technologies to optimize crop productivity. Precision 
farming is one such technology, which incorporates the use of 
artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze data from 
various sources and make informed decisions about crop 
management. In this study, we propose a web-based crop 
recommendation system that leverages ML algorithms to predict 
the most suitable crop to harvest based on environmental factors 
such as soil nutrient levels, temperature, and precipitations. We 
evaluated the performance of five ML algorithms (Decision Tree, 
Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support 
Vector Machine) and identified Random Forest as the best-
performing algorithm. Despite the promising results, we faced 
several challenges, including limited availability of data and the 
need for field validation of the results. Nonetheless, our platform 
aims to provide free and open-source precision farming solutions 
to Moroccan farmers to improve agricultural productivity and 
contribute to sustainable economic growth in the country.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
Agriculture is a crucial sector in Morocco, accounting for a 
significant portion of the country's GDP and employing a large 
percentage of the population. However, the sector faces several 
challenges, including water scarcity, unpredictable weather 
patterns, and a lack of access to information and resources [1]. 
Recently, an increasing interest has been observed for 
developing crop recommendation systems to address these 
challenges and improve agricultural productivity in the country 
[2]. 
Crop recommendation systems use predictive techniques to 
suggest the most suitable crops for a given location and set of 
conditions. These systems rely on data from various sources, 
such as satellite imagery, weather forecasts, soil analyses, and 
historical crop yields, to make accurate predictions [3]. By 
providing farmers with personalized recommendations, crop 
recommendation systems can help them make informed 
decisions about crop selection and improve their yields and 
profits [4]. 
The objective of this paper is to present a predictive 
approach to improving agricultural productivity in Morocco 
through crop recommendations. Specifically, we will develop a 
crop 
recommendation 
system 
that 
utilizes 
prediction 
techniques to suggest the most suitable crops for a given 
location and set of conditions. 
In order to achieve this objective, we will initially examine 
the current body of literature related to crop recommendation 
systems as well as the difficulties encountered by the 
agricultural sector in Morocco. After this, we will outline the 
approach we employed to construct our system, which 
including the dataset, prediction techniques, and evaluation 
metrics. Following this, we will detail the outcomes of our 
study, including the precision of our forecasts and the efficacy 
of our crop recommendation system. Lastly, we will analyze 
the implications of our research on enhancing agricultural 
productivity in Morocco and suggest potential avenues for 
future research. 
The structure of the paper is as follows. Firstly, an 
introduction is provided, followed by a succinct AI in precision 
agriculture summary, focusing primarily on Machine Learning 
(ML) as a component of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The paper 
also includes a concise literature review that highlights recent 
developments in the field. The research methodology is then 
presented, which involves an experimental evaluation of our 
research using various ML algorithms such as Decision Tree, 
Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and 
Support Vector Machine. A discussion comes after this section. 
Finally, the key findings of the study are summed up as a 
conclusion of this paper.

PRECISION FARMING OVERVIEW 
Precision farming is an agricultural management approach 
that uses technology to optimize crop yields and reduce waste. 
Its objective is to provide farmers with real-time data and 
information on their farms and livestock, in order to take 
accurate actions that can result in maximized crop yields and 
limited losses. 
AI helps in analyzing data from various sources and 
making informed decisions about crop management [5]. ML, a 
subfield of AI, has proven to be particularly useful in precision 
farming due to its ability to automatically learn patterns from

large datasets and make predictions based on those patterns [6]. 
Fig. 1 presents the key component of precision farming. 
Precision farming involves the use of a range of IoT 
sensors that gather various indicators associated with farming 
[7]. These indicators can include various environmental 
parameters such as soil moisture, nutrient levels, pH, 
temperature, humidity, light, and weather conditions. Other 
indicators may also relate to livestock, such as veterinary well-
being, feed intake, and weight gain. These indicators can be 
used to optimize various aspects of crop and livestock 
management, 
including 
irrigation, 
fertilization, 
disease 
prevention, and pest control [8]. 
The data collected by these sensors is transmitted to the 
technical staff. Various data analytic methods are then applied 
to interpret and derive useful insights from the collected data. 
The resulting information is exploited to take accurate and 
timely actions. To provide a better understanding, Fig. 2 
illustrates the various stages involved, including the automated 
collection of data and the processing operations by agribots 
according to the insights derived from the processed data. 
One area where ML has been applied in precision farming 
is crop yield prediction. ML algorithms can analyze data from 
sensors, such as satellite imagery, weather stations, and soil 
sensors, to make accurate predictions about crop yields [9]. For 
example, a study [10] used ML to predict winter wheat yields 
in China based on satellite imagery and weather data.  
Another application of ML in precision farming is crop 
disease detection. By analyzing images of crops, ML 
algorithms can identify signs of disease or stress and alert 
farmers to take action [11]. For example, a study [12] used ML 
to identify cassava disease in Tanzania based on images 
captured by drones. The authors found that their ML model 
was able to accurately identify diseased plants, even in cases 
where the symptoms were not visible to the human eye.

ML can also be used to optimize crop management 
decisions, such as irrigation and fertilization. By analyzing data 
on soil moisture, nutrient levels, and weather patterns, ML 
algorithms can suggest the optimal amount of water to apply to 
a crop [13]. For example, a study by [14] demonstrates that the 
integration of active canopy sensing and machine learning 
improves the prediction accuracy of the corn nitrogen nutrition 
index by accounting for genetic, environmental, and 
management factors. 
In conclusion, ML has significant potential in precision 
farming due to its ability to analyze large datasets and make 
accurate predictions. By applying ML to tasks such as crop 
yield prediction, disease detection, and crop management 
optimization, farmers can improve their yields and reduce 
waste.

Table I displays that numerous scientists have created 
Artificial Intelligence AI-based solutions suitable for different 
agriculture areas including crop selection and cultivation 
techniques. These solutions are often presented in the form of 
predictive systems and recommendation platforms, using state-
of-the-art techniques. While these approaches have potential, 
they do not necessarily address the need for real solutions that 
can be implemented in the field at low cost and can help 
farmers and decision-makers optimize their resources and 
maximize profits. 
It is interesting to note that few studies have focused on this 
issue in recent years, with most studies providing only 
theoretical overviews and practical implementations. The 
challenge is to find a way to make these solutions available for 
all, and make them more visible to a larger audience, such as 
farmers. Our study provides a step-by-step explanation of how 
to address these problems and offers examples of how to make 
these technologies available for free. 
IV. 
METHODS AND RESULTS 
A. System Conception 
To design our crop recommendation system, we initiated 
the first step by preparing a crop recommendation dataset. We 
used Moroccan climate, fertilizer and precipitations data [30] 
then preprocessed it in order to make extensive explorations. 
We worked with a dataset consisting of 1800 entries and eight 
variables. Next, we conducted an exploration of the data to 
understand its nature. Finally, we used ML techniques counting 
NB, DT, RF, SVM, and LR to extract the best features and 
build our ML models. 
Fig. 3 provides a detailed illustration of the steps taken in 
designing 
the 
architecture 
and 
developing 
the 
crop 
recommendation system. 
After completing the models building step, we proceeded to 
evaluate their performance. Once the evaluation was complete, 
we then moved on to deploy the model with highest 
performance as a web application, which forms a basis of our 
crop recommendation system. 
After completing the evaluation, the next step was to 
deploy the best selected model as a web application, which 
serves as the foundation for our crop recommendation system.

(b) Steps of recommendation system building. 
Fig. 3. Design process of the crop recommendation system. 
B. Dataset Preparation and Feature Selection 
The crop recommendation dataset we selected comprised 
several features, including content in soil of Phosphorus (P), 
Potassium (K) and Nitrogen (N), as well as soil pH value and 
moisture, precipitations, temperature and plant variety. The 
data collection consisted of 1800 entries, and an overview of 
the dataset statistics is presented in Table II. 
In terms of the relationship between the input parameters 
and target, we observed that certain parameters, such as 
Potassium, phosphorus and Nitrogen exhibit strong correlations 
of 0.6. This is a promising sign prior to the commencement of 
the prediction. There were also some phew negative correlation 
values between the indicators. This shows that the dataset is 
rich in information. 
From a biological perspective, the P K N levels play a vital 
role as important macro-nutrients that support plant growth. 
Potassium, is responsible for the plant’s natural functioning, 
while phosphorus aids in the maturation of fruits. Nitrogen 
contributes mainly to the growth of leaves. 
Fertilizer containing elements such as P K N and can be 
tailored to different crops based on their concentrations. These 
nutrients are essential for the growth and productivity of crops, 
and using fertilizer can make up for any deficiencies in the soil. 
By understanding the PKN ratios required for optimal plant 
development, farmers can manage fertilization and achieve 
better yields [31]. 
Other parameters in our data, including temperature, soil 
moisture and pH, and precipitations play important roles in 
crop selection. The pH value affects the existence of vital 
substances, while precipitations level is crucial in plant 
survival. Air temperature impacts photosynthesis, and soil 
moisture is essential for growth, but too much or too little can 
be detrimental. Our dataset includes several crop categories, 
such as apples, dates, corn, grape, pepper, orange, peach, 
potatoes, onions, tomatoes, olives, and watermelon, that can be 
predicted based on these features. The prediction of these crops 
yields is dependent on the parameters mentioned.

C. Predictive Models Development 
To develop our predictive ML models, we utilized the 
Python programming language. The data preprocessing stage 
involved importing the necessary libraries, including NumPy, 
Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. 
To train and test the models, we split the dataset into 
training and testing datasets, with a ratio of 70:30. We then 
employed five ML models (DT, NB, LR, RF, and SVM). 
To evaluate the accuracy of the models, we used precision, 
recall, F1 and accuracy metrics, which were calculated using 
the following formulas: 
           
  
      
 
(1)

(3) 
              
                
                 (4) 
Where    (true positive) is the number of correctly 
predicted positive values,    (false positive) is the number of 
falsely predicted positive values,    (true negative) is the 
number of correctly predicted negative values, and    (false 
negative) is the number of falsely predicted negative values. 
Additionally, we used k-fold cross-validation scores to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the different algorithms used in 
the predictive analysis, which provided a more robust 
assessment of the models' performance [32]. 
These scores helped us evaluate the effectiveness of the 
different algorithms used in the predictive analysis. 
V. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
A. Results of Prediction 
This section presents a discussion of the experimental 
results obtained for the performance of the ML algorithms used 
in our study. Table III provides a detailed summary of the 
precision, recall, accuracy, and k-fold cross-validation score 
results. 
Based on our results, the ML algorithms employed in our 
study exhibit varying levels of predictive capabilities in 
determining profitable crop based on inputs. Our analysis 
shows that RF has the highest performance in terms of 
accuracy, with a score of 97.18%. In comparison, other 
algorithms such as NB (96.36%), LR (95.62%), SVM 
(87.38%), and DT (86.64%) have lower accuracy scores. 
Fig. 4 illustrates a comparison of the accuracy for all ML 
models adopted in our analysis. 
The precision value assesses the ratio of accurate positive 
label predictions, indicates that NB and RF exhibit excellent 
performance. Conversely, DT has the lowest performance in 
this category. Regarding recall value, which assesses the ability 
of the ML models to correctly predict actual positives, RF once 
again outperforms the other models, while SVM and DT have 
the lowest scores. 
Regarding the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of 
precision and recall, RF attains the highest score of 97%, 
followed by NB at 96%, LR at 96%, SVM at 87%, and DT at 
83%. 
To estimate the overall performance of the models, we used 
K-fold cross-validation with a value of K=10. The results 
indicate that RF has the highest 10-fold cross-validation vale, 
while DT has the lowest performance. Although accuracy 
alone is not a reliable performance metric, considering other 
evaluation measures, it is apparent that RF surpasses the used 
ML techniques in forecasting the most appropriate crop.

B. Crop Recommendation Solution 
In our opinion, the market for precision agriculture 
solutions that are available at no cost and released under an 
open-source license is continuing to evolve, and considerable 
progress is needed for these solutions to compete with closed-
source solutions. However, the involvement of a network of IT 
specialists and interested parties, including farmers, has aided 
expansion of open-source alternatives. These communities can 
address any issues or doubts related to technology integration 
with ease [33-35]. Bearing this in mind, our main objective 
was to propose and design a crop recommendation system. 
Relying on the performance metrics mentioned earlier, RF 
demonstrated superior performance in comparison to the other 
ML models we used. Therefore, we plan to employ RF to 
predict the optimal crop based on the user's input parameters, 
such as P K N, soil moisture and pH, temperature, and 
precipitations. After selecting the best-performing model, we 
serialized/saved it Python’s built-in persistence model, namely 
pickle, for developing of the crop recommendation system. The 
various steps involved in designing and deploying the crop 
recommendation system are outlined in Fig. 5.

platform. 
To create the system, we utilized Flask as a Python micro 
framework used in applications development, which enables 
programmers to conveniently build Application Programming 
Interfaces (APIs) in Python language. To create interactive web 
pages for users, we used HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
and designed them using CSS. After that, we implemented the 
platform Flask micro web framework. Fig. 6 depicts the fully 
functional recommendation platform hosted locally. 
The working system along with the development 
environment are available on an uploaded directory online 
[36]. It consists of all code files used for the training and 
prediction, as well as the app code of the recommendation 
system and the frontend source code. 
In Fig. 6(a), the collected field data is entered manually at 
the Front end.

DISCUSSION 
After evaluating the performance results of the ML model 
training, we found that RF has the best performance among all 
the models. Despite the small training dataset of only 1800 
entries, RF still outperforms other models in terms of recall, 
precision, and other performance criteria, apart from accuracy. 
Therefore, we chose RF as the ML technique to use in building 
the recommendation system. 
Once the required inputs are submitted, the platform 
verifies for missing values and if the entries fall within 
acceptable thresholds before proceeding. The system then 
predicts the most appropriate crop to plant based on the input 
parameters. This enables farmers to make informed decisions 
for higher returns on investment and reduced wastage. This 
enables farmers to opt for knowledgeable choices that lead to 
increased profits and reduced waste. 
During the development of our crop recommendation 
system, we postulated that users would utilize pre-existing

meteorological data and the abundant IoT farming tools that 
are already deployed to obtain necessary information for 
submitting parameters to our platform. Since our platform is 
web-based, it is accessible from anywhere and from any 
device, providing a high level of convenience for the users. 
However, we acknowledge that the dataset we used for 
developing the system is constituted of Moroccan data, and 
crop growth can vary based on the context and circumstances 
of different territories. To provide our system to farmers 
globally, more data from various geographic locations may be 
required. As our system continues to develop, it can have the 
capability to compile information from various geographical 
territories, allowing users to enter their position along with the 
relevant data to predict suitable crops for planting. This paper 
displays the potential of using ML to design smart techniques 
at the service of agriculture, and it may set the stage for 
emerging 
studies to develop predictive platforms 
in 
conjunction with robotic technology. 
Investing in farming is critical for any economy, and 
selecting profitable crops is an important task that can 
guarantee the best production. Our proposed solution aims to 
help farmers select the best crop for their land and 
environmental context. With further improvements, like 
integrating IoT in automated data collection and using more 
parameters and key indicators from different locations, we can 
offer this technology to more farmers, especially those who 
want to implement technology-driven precision farming. 
While many organizations and startups are designing 
precision farming solutions, most of them are subscription-
based with high prices, free and open-source alternatives can 
be accessible for farmers to. It is crucial for farmers to be 
knowledgeable about these alternatives that can enable them to 
utilize technology at no cost, instead of making significant 
upfront investments. 
VII. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES 
Agriculture is a vital industry that feeds billions of people 
worldwide, and the use of technology has transformed 
traditional farming practices, resulting in improved yields and a 
higher quality harvest while reducing manual labor. Precision 
farming, powered by AI, is becoming increasingly popular due 
to its ability to collect field data and to assist farmers in taking 
informed actions to manage their cultivated lands. 
This study presents a web-based ML-driven crop 
recommendation system to assist users choose the most 
suitable crops to plant based on local environmental conditions. 
Although there are many commercial solutions available, 
alternatives also exist at freely and at no coast. 
The study demonstrates the combination of ML and 
precision agriculture and outlines the architecture of a web-
based platform. The platform could be improved by adding 
real-time monitoring capabilities by interfacing with existing 
data aggregation platforms from sensors and IoT. This would 
result in a more accurate and suitable prediction framework, 
making precision farming more accessible to farmers 
worldwide, ultimately helping to address the challenges of 
feeding the global population.

Abstract: With increasingly advanced remote sensing systems, more accurate retrievals of crop water
status are being made at the individual crop level to aid in precision irrigation. This paper summarises
the use of remote sensing for the estimation of water status in horticultural crops. The remote
measurements of the water potential, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, canopy 3D structure, and
vigour for water status estimation are presented in this comprehensive review. These parameters
directly or indirectly provide estimates of crop water status, which is critically important for irrigation
management in farms. The review is organised into four main sections: (i) remote sensing platforms;
(ii) the remote sensor suite; (iii) techniques adopted for horticultural applications and indicators of
water status; and, (iv) case studies of the use of remote sensing in horticultural crops. Finally, the
authors’ view is presented with regard to future prospects and research gaps in the estimation of the
crop water status for precision irrigation.

1. Introduction
Understanding the water status of crops is important for optimal management and application
of water to accommodate for inter and intra-ﬁeld variability to achieve a speciﬁc target, such as
maximum water use eﬃciency, yield, quality, or proﬁtability [1,2]. The importance of optimal water
management in agriculture in semi-arid or arid regions has become increasingly important in light
of recent water scarcities through reduced allocations, as well as increased demand due to greater
areas under production [3,4]. Climate change is expected to further intensify the situation due to
the increased frequency of heatwaves and drought episodes [5]. Climate change coupled with the
necessity to increase food production due to an increase in global population has placed pressure on
horticultural sector to improve eﬃciencies in resources use, e.g., water, for sustainable farming [6–10].
Horticultural crops will have to produce more ‘crop-per-drop’ in the face of limited water resources.
Informed management of water resources whilst maintaining or increasing crop quality and yield are
the primary goals of irrigation scheduling in horticulture. These goals can be achieved by improving
our understanding of the water status of the crops at key phenological stages of development.
Traditional decision-making for irrigation of horticultural crops includes using information from
a combination of sources such as historical regimes, soil moisture measurements, visual assessments of
soil and/or crop, weather data including evapotranspiration (ET), and measurements of crop water
status using direct-, proximal- or remote-sensing techniques [11–13]. Some growers undertake routine
ground-based measurements, e.g., pressure chamber, for estimation of crop water status to make
decisions on irrigation [14–16]. These ground-based measurements are robust; however, destructive,

cumbersome, and expensive to acquire a reasonable amount of data [14,16–18]. Consequently, the
measured leaf is assumed to represent the average population of leaves of the individual crop, and
a few crops are assumed to represent the average population of the entire irrigation block. As a
result, over- or under-watering can occur, which can lower yield and fruit quality [19–22]. This is
especially evident for non-homogenous blocks where spatial variability of soil and water status is
expected [23–25].
To address some of the limitations of ground-based measurements, remote measurement
techniques were introduced with capabilities to measure at higher spatial resolution, larger area, and
on a regular basis [26–29]. Remote sensing, in particular, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), presents a
ﬂexible platform to deploy on-demand sensors as a tool to eﬃciently and non-destructively measure
crop water status [30]. Using thermal and spectral signatures, remote sensing techniques can be used
to characterise a crop’s water status. Knowledge of crop water status allows growers to more eﬃciently
schedule irrigation (i.e., when and how much water to apply). In this regard, UAS platforms provide a
convenient methodology to monitor the water status across a farm, both spatially and temporally at
the canopy level [31–33]. The spectral, spatial, and temporal ﬂexibility oﬀered by UAS-based remote
sensing may in future assist growers in irrigation decision-making [34,35].
This review provides an overview of the application of remote sensing to understand the
crop’s water status (e.g., leaf/stem water potential, leaf/canopy conductance), soil moisture, ET, and
physiological attributes, all of which can contribute to understanding the crop’s water status to
implement precision irrigation. Although the key focus of this review is UAS-based remote sensing,
a comparison has been undertaken with other remote sensing platforms, such as earth observation
satellites, which are being increasingly used to acquire similar information. In the following sections,
we provide an overview of the most common remote sensing platforms in horticulture, various sensors
used for remote sensing, and several predictive indices of crop water status. Two case studies of remote
sensing in horticultural crops, grapevine and almond, are then presented followed by an overview of
the current research gaps and future prospects.
2. Remote Sensing Platforms
Ground-based direct or proximal sensors acquire instantaneous water status measurement from
a spatial location. For decision-making purposes, the data is generally collected from multiple
locations across a ﬁeld, which allows geospatial interpolation, such as kriging, to be applied [36–38].
This scale of data collection is, however, cumbersome, ineﬃcient, and error-prone, especially for water
status measurements of large areas [17]. Monitoring and observing farms at a larger spatial scale
prompted the launch of several earth observation satellite systems that typically operate at an altitude
of 180–2000 km [39]. Manned high-altitude aircraft (operating within few km) and, more recently, UAS
(operating under 120 m) ﬁlled the spatial gap between high-resolution ground measurements and
relatively low-resolution satellite measurements [40,41]. In the context of water status estimation for
horticultural crops, all the aforementioned remote sensing platforms are utilised depending on the
user requirements [23,42,43]. Each remote sensing platform has its own advantage and shortcomings.
The decision to obtain remote sensing crop water status data from one or more of these platforms will
depend on the spatial and temporal resolution desired. Satellite and manned aircraft can be useful
for regional-scale characterisation, whereas UAS can be more useful to map the intra-ﬁeld variability.
Vehicle-based ground systems also possess similar measurement capabilities, like remote sensing,
however, at a smaller scale [44,45]. These systems can move within the horticultural rows obtaining
water status measurements of adjacent plants while the vehicle is moving, enabling them to cover a
relatively larger area as compared to ground-based direct measurements [46–48].
2.1. Satellite Systems
The use of satellite systems for remote sensing started with the launch of Landsat-1 in 1972 [39,49].
The subsequent launch of SPOT-1 in 1986 and Ikonos in 1999 opened the era of commercial satellite
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140
3 of 35
systems that resulted in rapid improvement in imaging performance, including spatial and spectral
resolution [50]. Continued launch of satellites from the same families, with newer sensor models
and improved capability, resulted in the formation of satellite constellations (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel,
SPOT, RapidEye, GeoEye/WorldView families). The satellite constellation substantially improved the
revisit cycle of the satellite system [51]. Recently, the miniature form of the satellite termed Nanosat or
Cubesat has been developed, which can be deployed on the same orbit in a large number (20s–100s),
enabling frequent and high-resolution data acquisition (e.g., Dove satellite from Planet Labs) [52].
The earth observation satellite system, such as Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, RapidEye, and GeoEye,
have been used to study horticultural crops (Table 1). These satellite system oﬀer camera systems
with spectral bands readily available in visible, near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and
thermal infrared (TIR). The measurement in these bands provides opportunities to study a crop’s water
status indirectly via, for example, calculation of the normalised diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI),
crop water stress index (CWSI), and ET [8–10] at the ﬁeld- and regional-scales.

infrared, TIR = thermal infrared, Pan = panchromatic, C = coastal, Ci = cirrus, RE = red edge, WV = water vapour.
The reﬂected/emitted electromagnetic energy from the crop reaching the sensor is recorded at a
speciﬁc wavelength. The width of the observed wavelength expressed in full width at half maximum
(FWHM) is called spectral resolution. The number of observed bands and the spectral resolution
indicates the ability of the satellite to resolve spectral features on the earth’s surface. Commonly used
earth observation satellite systems possess between four and 15 bands with approximately 20–200 nm
FWHM spectral resolution. The bands are generally designated for the visible and NIR region with
extended capabilities in SWIR, TIR, as well as red edge region (Table 1). The most widely used band
combinations to study the water status of vegetation are the visible, NIR and TIR bands [23,25,53,54].
With the plethora of satellite systems currently available, user requirements on band combination
may be achieved by using multiple satellites. However, acquiring an extra or a narrower band to the
existing capabilities is not possible.
The ground distance covered per pixel of the satellite image is called the spatial resolution,
whereby, a higher spatial resolution indicates a smaller ground distance. Existing satellite systems,
due to their lower spatial resolution and large coverage, are suited to study larger regions [55]. For a
smaller observation area, such as a farm block, an irrigation zone, a single row of the horticultural crop,
or a single canopy, this spatial resolution is considered sub-optimal. Often, a pixel of the satellite image
comprises of multiple rows and multiple canopies of horticultural crops [42,56]. Thus, the spectral
response on a single pixel of the satellite image includes a mixed spectral signal from the canopy,
inter-row vegetation and/or bare soil. The mixed-pixel is particularly unavoidable in horticultural
crops with large inter-row surfaces, introducing errors in satellite-based estimations [42,56]. Improving
the spatial resolution from freely available Landsat/Sentinel satellites (spatial resolution 10–15 m) to
such as WorldView-3 (spatial resolution 0.3 m), does not necessarily resolve single canopies of many
horticultural crops.
Current satellite systems generally oﬀer a temporal resolution of about 1–2 weeks this resolution
corresponds to the satellite’s revisit interval (Table 1). For example, freely available Landsat-8 and
Sentinel-2 oﬀer revisit cycles of 16 and 5 days, respectively. Although the MODIS sensor on NASA’s
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140
4 of 35
Terra and Aqua satellites oﬀer a greater temporal resolution (1–2 days), its spatial resolution is relatively
coarse (250 m–1 km) to be valuable for horticulture [25]. The revisit cycle of satellites does not alone
represent the timeframe on which the data can be interpreted. For instance, post-data acquisition,
there are often delays in data transfer to the ground station, handling, and delivery to the end user.
The end user then needs to process the data before making an interpretation. Such processing can
be a combination of atmospheric, radiometric, and geometric corrections, where applicable [57,58].
Furthermore, as the agricultural applications of the satellite imagery are illumination sensitive and
weather dependent, conditions have to be optimal on the satellite revisit day to avoid data corruption
due to, for example, cloud cover [23,53]. Cloud corrupted data (~55% of the land area is covered by
cloud at any one time [59]) will require users to wait for the next revisit to attempt the data acquisition.
Time-series image fusion techniques, such as the spatial and temporal adaptive reﬂectance fusion
model, can improve the spatial and temporal resolution of the satellite data [60,61]. These fusion
techniques blend the frequent (however low-resolution) with higher-resolution (but infrequent) satellite
data [62,63]. The result combines the best aspects of multiple satellite systems to produce frequent and
higher-resolution data, which can be useful for timely monitoring of water status.
The clear advantage of the satellite system is the ability to capture data at a large scale and at an
aﬀordable cost (e.g., the user can download Landsat and Sentinel data for free). The compromise with
the satellite data is in spatial resolution, as well as the relatively long revisit cycle (in the order of days
to weeks), making the data less than ideal for speciﬁc applications, e.g., irrigation scheduling.
2.2. Manned Aircraft System
Operating within few kilometres above ground level, manned aircraft have been used to remotely
acquire agricultural data at higher spatial detail (compared to the satellites) and over a larger region
(compared to UAS) [42,64]. Light ﬁxed-wing aircraft and helicopters are the commonly used manned
aircraft employed in agricultural remote sensing. The ﬁxed-wing aircraft generally ﬂies higher and
faster, enabling the coverage of a larger area, whereas the helicopters are traditionally ﬂown lower
and slower, enabling a spatially detailed observation. A signiﬁcant advantage of the manned aircraft,
compared to UAS, lies in their ability to carry heavier high-grade sensors, such as AVIRIS, HyPlant,
HySpex SWIR-384, Specim AisaFENIX, and Riegl LMS Q240i-60 [65–67]. The use of manned aircraft is,
however, limited by high operational complexity, safety regulations, scheduling inﬂexibility, costs, and
product turnaround time. As a result, these platforms are barely used as compared to the recent surge
in the use of UAS, speciﬁcally for horticultural crops [68–70].
In horticulture, manned aircraft was used to characterise olive and peach canopy temperature
and water stress using speciﬁc thermal bands (10.069 µm and 12.347 µm) of a wideband (0.43–12.5 µm)
airborne hyperspectral camera system [71,72]. This work found moderate correlations (R2 = 0.45–0.57)
of ground vs. aerial olive canopy temperature measurements [72], and high correlations (R2 = 0.94)
of canopy temperature vs. peach fruit size (diameter) [71]. The advantage of manned aircraft for
remote sensing of a large region was highlighted in recent work that characterised regional-scale
grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) water stress responses of two cultivars, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, in
Australia [64]. Airborne thermal imaging was able to discriminate between the two cultivars based on
their water status responses to soil moisture availability (Figure 1).

2.3. Unmanned Aircraft Systems 
Both the fixed-wing and the rotary-wing variant of UASs are used in agricultural remote 
sensing. Each variant has its advantages and shortcomings vis-à-vis sensor payload, flexibility, and 
coverage. In this regard, the literature provides a list of state-of-the-art UAS [73], their categorisation 
[74], and overview of structural characteristics, as well as flight parameters [75], in the context of 
agricultural use. Depending on the number of rotors, a rotary-wing UAS can be a helicopter, a 
quadcopter, a hexacopter, or an octocopter, among others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can 
fly with a higher degree of freedom [76], while fixed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward at a 
certain speed to maintain thrust. As a result, rotary-wing UAS provides flexibility and specific 
capabilities, such as hovering, vertical take-off and landing, vertical (up and down) motions, or return 
to the previous location. On the contrary, fixed-wing UAS fly faster, carry heavier payloads, and have 
greater flying time enabling coverage of larger areas in a single flight [77]. Recently developed fixed-
wing UAS with vertical take-off and landing capabilities, such as BirdEyeView FireFly6 PRO, Elipse 
VTOL-PPK, and Carbonix Volanti, captures the pros of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing, making 
them a promising platform for agricultural purposes. In the context of precision agriculture, the 
application of UAS, their future prospects, and knowledge gaps are discussed in [53,78–81]. While 
many horticultural crops have been studied using UAS technology, the most studied horticultural 
crops are vineyards [31,82–84], citrus [85,86], peach [32,33], olive [18,87,88], pistachio [89,90], and 
almond [91–94], among others [95–99]. Some of the UAS types used for water status studies of 
horticultural crops are shown in Figure 2.

2.3. Unmanned Aircraft Systems
Both the ﬁxed-wing and the rotary-wing variant of UASs are used in agricultural remote sensing.
Each variant has its advantages and shortcomings vis-à-vis sensor payload, ﬂexibility, and coverage.
In this regard, the literature provides a list of state-of-the-art UAS [73], their categorisation [74], and
overview of structural characteristics, as well as ﬂight parameters [75], in the context of agricultural use.
Depending on the number of rotors, a rotary-wing UAS can be a helicopter, a quadcopter, a hexacopter,
or an octocopter, among others. Rotary-wing UAS are more agile and can ﬂy with a higher degree of
freedom [76], while ﬁxed-wing UAS needs to be moving forward at a certain speed to maintain thrust.
As a result, rotary-wing UAS provides ﬂexibility and speciﬁc capabilities, such as hovering, vertical
take-oﬀ and landing, vertical (up and down) motions, or return to the previous location. On the contrary,
ﬁxed-wing UAS ﬂy faster, carry heavier payloads, and have greater ﬂying time enabling coverage of
larger areas in a single ﬂight [77]. Recently developed ﬁxed-wing UAS with vertical take-oﬀ and landing
capabilities, such as BirdEyeView FireFly6 PRO, Elipse VTOL-PPK, and Carbonix Volanti, captures
the pros of both ﬁxed-wing and rotary-wing, making them a promising platform for agricultural
purposes. In the context of precision agriculture, the application of UAS, their future prospects,

Figure 2. Examples of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) used to study water status in horticulture 
crops: (a) hexacopter equipped with RGB, multispectral and thermal camera at The University of 
Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia (b) quadcopter equipped with a thermal and multispectral camera 
[100], (c) fixed-wing aircraft used for GRAPEX project to carry RGB, thermal and monochrome camera 
with narrowband filters [101], and (d) helicopter used for various studies of crop water status 
[18,92,102]. 
UAS offers flexibility on spatial resolution, observation scale, spectral bands, and temporal 
resolution to collect data on any good weather day. However, like satellite and manned aircraft, the 
UAS is inoperable during precipitation, high winds, and temperatures. By easily altering the flying 
altitude, the UAS provides higher flexibility to observe a larger area with lower spatial resolution or 
smaller area with much greater detail [103]. Temporally, the UAS can be scheduled at a user-defined 
time at short notice, thus accommodating applications that are time-sensitive, such as capturing vital 
phenological stages of crop growth. Spectrally, UAS offer flexibility to carry on-demand sensors and 
interchangeability between sensor payloads; thus, any desired combination of sensors and spectral 
bands can be incorporated to target specific features. 
UAS-acquired image data requires post-processing before it can be incorporated into the grower 
decision-making process. Mosaicking of UAS images currently has a turnaround time of 
approximately one day to one week, subject to the size of the dataset, computational power, and 
spectral/spatial quality of the product [104,105]. Spectral quality of the data is of optimal importance, 
whereas the spatial quality can be of less importance, such as for well-established horticultural crops. 
Higher spectral quality demands calibration of the spectral sensors and correction of atmospheric 
effects. Following post-processing of aerial images, the UAS-based spectral data have shown to be 
highly correlated with ground-based data [82,102,106]. 
The most common UAS-based sensor types to study the crop water status are the thermal, 
multispectral and RGB, while hyperspectral and LiDAR (Light detection and ranging) sensors are 
used less often [23,79,107]. Spectral sensors provide the capability to capture broader physiological 
properties of the crop, such as greenness (related to leaf chlorophyll content and health) and biomass, 
that generally correlate with crop water status [82,108]. Narrower band spectral sensors provide 
direct insight into specific biophysical and biochemical properties of crops, such as via photochemical 
reflectance index (PRI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which reflects a plant’s 
photosynthetic efficiency [109,110]. Thermal-based sensors capture the temperature of the crop’s 
surface, which indicates the plant’s stress (both biotic and abiotic) [53]. Generally, digital RGB camera 
and LiDAR can be used to quantify 3D metrics, such as the plant size and shape, via 3D pointclouds 
with sufficient accuracy for canopy level assessment [111–118]. 
3. Remote Sensor Types 
3.1. Digital Camera 
A digital camera typically incorporates an RGB, modified RGB, and a monochrome digital 
camera. The lens quality of the camera determines the sharpness of the image, while the resolution

UAS oﬀers ﬂexibility on spatial resolution, observation scale, spectral bands, and temporal
resolution to collect data on any good weather day. However, like satellite and manned aircraft, the
UAS is inoperable during precipitation, high winds, and temperatures. By easily altering the ﬂying
altitude, the UAS provides higher ﬂexibility to observe a larger area with lower spatial resolution or
smaller area with much greater detail [103]. Temporally, the UAS can be scheduled at a user-deﬁned
time at short notice, thus accommodating applications that are time-sensitive, such as capturing vital
phenological stages of crop growth. Spectrally, UAS oﬀer ﬂexibility to carry on-demand sensors and
interchangeability between sensor payloads; thus, any desired combination of sensors and spectral
bands can be incorporated to target speciﬁc features.
UAS-acquired image data requires post-processing before it can be incorporated into the grower
decision-making process. Mosaicking of UAS images currently has a turnaround time of approximately
one day to one week, subject to the size of the dataset, computational power, and spectral/spatial
quality of the product [104,105]. Spectral quality of the data is of optimal importance, whereas the
spatial quality can be of less importance, such as for well-established horticultural crops. Higher
spectral quality demands calibration of the spectral sensors and correction of atmospheric eﬀects.
Following post-processing of aerial images, the UAS-based spectral data have shown to be highly
correlated with ground-based data [82,102,106].

reﬂectance index (PRI) and solar-induced chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (SIF), which reﬂects a plant’s
photosynthetic eﬃciency [109,110]. Thermal-based sensors capture the temperature of the crop’s
surface, which indicates the plant’s stress (both biotic and abiotic) [53]. Generally, digital RGB camera
and LiDAR can be used to quantify 3D metrics, such as the plant size and shape, via 3D pointclouds
with suﬃcient accuracy for canopy level assessment [111–118].
3. Remote Sensor Types
3.1. Digital Camera
A digital camera typically incorporates an RGB, modiﬁed RGB, and a monochrome digital camera.
The lens quality of the camera determines the sharpness of the image, while the resolution of the
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140
7 of 35
camera determines its spatial resolution and details within an image. The RGB camera uses broad
spectral bandwidth within the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received at the
visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to retrieve dimensional properties
of the crop, terrain conﬁguration, macrostructure of the ﬁeld, and the spatial information. Based on
the dimensional properties, such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the resource need
practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to more quickly use available
water resources, resulting in crop water stress at a later stage of the season if irrigation is not suﬃcient.
The evolution of canopy structure within and between seasons can be useful to understand the spatial
variability within the ﬁeld and corresponding water requirements. The macro-structure of horticultural
crops, such as row height, width, spacing, crop count, the fraction of ground cover, and missing
plants, can be identiﬁed remotely, which can aid in the allocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain
conﬁguration in the form of a digital elevation model (DEM) generated from a digital camera can also
enable understanding of the water status in relation to the aspect and slope conﬁguration of the terrain.
3.2. Multispectral Camera
A multispectral camera oﬀers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic spectrum.
Most common airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which include rededge and NIR
bands in addition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g., Figure 3a,c). Conﬁgurable ﬁlter placement of
the spectral band is also available, which can potentially target certain physiological responses of
horticultural crops [102]. Spectrally, the airborne multispectral camera has been reported to perform
with consistency, producing reliable measurements following radiometric calibration and atmospheric
correction [123–125].
Their spatial resolution has been found to be suﬃcient for horticultural
applications enabling canopy level observation of the spectral response. For this reason, as well as
relatively low cost, multispectral cameras are used more frequently in horticulture applications.
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140

of the camera determines its spatial resolution and details within an image. The RGB camera uses 
broad spectral bandwidth within the blue, green and red spectral region to capture energy received 
at the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The images are used to retrieve dimensional 
properties of the crop, terrain configuration, macrostructure of the field, and the spatial information. 
Based on the dimensional properties, such as size, height, perimeter, and area of the crown, the 
resource need practices can be estimated [119–121]. Generally, a larger crop is expected to more 
quickly use available water resources, resulting in crop water stress at a later stage of the season if 
irrigation is not sufficient. The evolution of canopy structure within and between seasons can be 
useful to understand the spatial variability within the field and corresponding water requirements. 
The macro-structure of horticultural crops, such as row height, width, spacing, crop count, the 
fraction of ground cover, and missing plants, can be identified remotely, which can aid in the 
allocation of resources [113,122]. The terrain configuration in the form of a digital elevation model 
(DEM) generated from a digital camera can also enable understanding of the water status in relation 
to the aspect and slope configuration of the terrain. 
3.2. Multispectral Camera 
A multispectral camera offers multiple spectral bands across the electromagnetic spectrum. Most 
common airborne multispectral cameras have 4–5 bands which include rededge and NIR bands in 
addition to the visible bands, R-G-B (e.g., Figure 3a,c). Configurable filter placement of the spectral 
band is also available, which can potentially target certain physiological responses of horticultural 
crops [102]. Spectrally, the airborne multispectral camera has been reported to perform with 
consistency, producing reliable measurements following radiometric calibration and atmospheric 
correction [123–125]. Their spatial resolution has been found to be sufficient for horticultural 
applications enabling canopy level observation of the spectral response. For this reason, as well as 
relatively low cost, multispectral cameras are used more frequently in horticulture applications.

Chlorophyll and cellular structures of vegetation absorb most of the visible light and reﬂect
infrared light. The rise in reﬂectance between the red and NIR band is unique to live green vegetation
and is captured by vegetation spectral index called NDVI (Table 2, Equation (3)). Once the vegetation
starts to experience stress (biotic and abiotic), its reﬂectance in the NIR region is reduced, while the
reﬂectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress is reﬂected in the vegetation proﬁle and
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140

easily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this reason, NDVI has shown correlations with a wide
array of crops response including vigour, chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress,
and occasionally yield [34,82–84,127].
The rededge band covers the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between the red and NIR
bands where reﬂectance increases drastically. Studies have suggested that the sharp transition between
the red absorbance and NIR reﬂection is able to provide additional information about vegetation and
its hydric characteristics [128]. Using the normalised diﬀerence red edge (NDRE) index, the rededge
band was found to be useful in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration map [127]. Given the
sensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications, such as crops drought stress [107]. With regard to
the water use eﬃciency, a combination of vegetation indices (VIs) along with structural physiological
indices were found to be useful to study water stress in horticultural crops [34,82,129].
3.3. Hyperspectral
Hyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled at a narrower wavelength intervals
spanning from visible to NIR spectrum at a high to ultra-high spectral resolution (Figure 3d). Scanning
at contiguous narrow-band wavelengths, a hyperspectral sensor produces a three dimensional (two
spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral data cube. The hyperspectral
data cube is a hyperspectral image where each pixel contain spatial information, as well as the entire
spectral reﬂectance curve [130]. Based on the operating principle and output data cube, hyperspectral
sensors for remote sensing can include a point spectrometer (aka spectroradiometer), whiskbroom
scanner, pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131]. A point spectrometer, samples
within its ﬁeld of view solid angle to produce an ultra-high spectral resolution spectral data of a
point [130,132]. A whiskbroom scanner deploys a single detector onboard to scan one single pixel at a
time. As the scanner rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of the data cube, and as the
platform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a hyperspectral image [133]. A pushbroom
scanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous detectors arranged in the perpendicular direction of
travel and scans the entire row of pixels at a time. As the platform moves forward, the successive
rows form a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager using diﬀerent scanning
techniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene [135,136]. The point spectrometer
oﬀers the highest spectral resolution and lowest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible
hyperspectral sensors [137,138].
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140

starts to experience stress (biotic and abiotic), its reflectance in the NIR region is reduced, while the 
reflectance in the red band is increased. Thus, such stress is reflected in the vegetation profile and 
easily captured by indices, such as NDVI. For this reason, NDVI has shown correlations with a wide 
array of crops response including vigour, chlorophyll content, leaf area index (LAI), crop water stress, 
and occasionally yield [34,82–84,127]. 
The rededge band covers the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum between the red and NIR 
bands where reflectance increases drastically. Studies have suggested that the sharp transition 
between the red absorbance and NIR reflection is able to provide additional information about 
vegetation and its hydric characteristics [128]. Using the normalised difference red edge (NDRE) 
index, the rededge band was found to be useful in establishing a relative chlorophyll concentration 
map [127]. Given the sensitivity of NDRE, it can be used for applications, such as crops drought stress 
[107]. With regard to the water use efficiency, a combination of vegetation indices (VIs) along with 
structural physiological indices were found to be useful to study water stress in horticultural crops 
[34,82,129]. 
3.3. Hyperspectral 
Hyperspectral sensors have contiguous spectral bands sampled at a narrower wavelength 
intervals spanning from visible to NIR spectrum at a high to ultra-high spectral resolution (Figure 
3d). Scanning at contiguous narrow-band wavelengths, a hyperspectral sensor produces a three 
dimensional (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) data called hyperspectral data 
cube. The hyperspectral data cube is a hyperspectral image where each pixel contain spatial 
information, as well as the entire spectral reflectance curve [130]. Based on the operating principle 
and output data cube, hyperspectral sensors for remote sensing can include a point spectrometer (aka 
spectroradiometer), whiskbroom scanner, pushbroom scanner, and 2D imager (Figure 4) [130,131]. A 
point spectrometer, samples within its field of view solid angle to produce an ultra-high spectral 
resolution spectral data of a point [130,132]. A whiskbroom scanner deploys a single detector onboard 
to scan one single pixel at a time. As the scanner rotates across-track, successive scans form a row of 
the data cube, and as the platform moves forward along-track, successive rows form a hyperspectral 
image [133]. A pushbroom scanner deploys a row of spatially contiguous detectors arranged in the 
perpendicular direction of travel and scans the entire row of pixels at a time. As the platform moves 
forward, the successive rows form a two-dimensional hyperspectral image [40,134]. The 2D imager 
using different scanning techniques [130] captures hyperspectral data across the image scene 
[135,136]. The point spectrometer offers the highest spectral resolution and lowest signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) among the UAS-compatible hyperspectral sensors [137,138].

In horticultural applications, hyperspectral data, due to the high resolution contiguous spectral
sampling, possesses tremendous potential to detect and monitor speciﬁc biotic and abiotic stresses [139].
Narrowband hyperspectral data was used to detect water stress using the measurement of ﬂuorescence

and PRI over a citrus orchard [110]. PRI was identiﬁed as one of the best predictors of water stress for a
vineyard in a study that investigated numerous VIs using hyperspectral imaging [140]. High-resolution
thermal imagery obtained from a hyperspectral scanner was used to map canopy stomatal conductance
(gs) and CWSI of olive orchards where diﬀerent irrigation treatments were applied [18]. With the
large volume of spatial/spectral data extracted from the hyperspectral data cube, machine learning
will likely be adopted more widely in the horticultural environment to model water stress [141].
See Reference [54] for a comprehensive review of hyperspectral and thermal remote sensing to detect
plant water status.
3.4. Thermal
Thermal cameras use microbolometers to read passive thermal signals in the spectral range of
approximately 7–14 µm (Figure 3b). Small UAS are capable of carrying a small form-factor thermal
camera with uncooled microbolometers, which does not use an internal cooling mechanism and,
therefore, does not achieve the high SNR that can be found in cooled microbolometer-based thermal
cameras. An array of microbolometer detectors in the thermal camera receives a thermal radiation
signal and stores the signal on the corresponding image pixel as raw data number (DN) values.
The result is a thermal image where each pixel has an associated DN value, which can be converted to
absolute temperature. A representative list of commercial thermal cameras used on UAS platforms
and their applications with regard to agricultural remote sensing is found in the literature [23,53,73].
Thermal imagery enables the measurement of the foliar temperature of plants. The foliar temperature
diﬀerence between well-watered and water-stressed crops is the primary source of information for
water stress prediction using a thermal sensor [142]. When mounted on a remote sensing platform, the
canopy level assessment of crop water status can be performed on a large scale.
Thermal cameras are limited by their resolution (e.g., 640 × 512 is the maximum resolution of
UAS compatible thermal cameras in the current market) and high price-tag [53]. The small number of
pixels results in low spatial resolution limiting either the ability to resolve a single canopy or ability to
ﬂy higher and cover a larger area. If ﬂown at a higher altitude, the eﬀective spatial resolution may
be inadequate for canopy level assessment of some horticultural crops. For example, a FLIR Tau2
640 thermal camera with a 13 mm focal length when ﬂown at an altitude of approximately 120 m
results in a spatial resolution of 15.7 cm. For relatively large horticultural crops, such as grapevine,
almond, citrus, and avocado, the resolution at a maximum legal ﬂying altitude of 120 m in Australia
(for small-sized UAS) oﬀers an adequate spatial resolution to observe a single canopy.
Another challenge with the use of thermal cameras is the temporal drift of the DN values
within successive thermal images, especially with uncooled thermal cameras [143]. Due to the lack
of an internal cooling mechanism for the microbolometer detectors, DN values registered by the
microbolometers experience temporal drift i.e., the registered DN values for the same temperature
target will drift temporally. Thus, the thermal image can be unreliable especially when the internal
temperature of the camera is changing rapidly, such as during camera warmup period or during the
ﬂight when a gust of cool wind results in cooling of the camera. To overcome this challenge, the user
may need to provide suﬃcient startup time before operation (preferably 30–60 min) [102,143–145],
shield the camera to minimize the change in the internal temperature of the camera [142], calibrate the
camera [146–153], and perform frequent ﬂat-ﬁeld corrections.
3.5. Multi-Sensor
To carry multiple sensors, the total UAS payload needs to be considered that includes, in
addition to the sensors, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and global navigation satellite system
(GNSS) for the georeferencing purpose [40,154]. Higher accuracy sensors tend to be heavier, and in
a multi-sensor scenario, the payload can quickly reach or even exceed the payload limit. This has
limited contemporary measurements in earlier multirotor UAS requiring separate ﬂights for each of
sensor [126]. The use of ﬁxed-wing UAS has allowed carrying higher payloads due to the much larger

thrust-to-weight ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155]. Similarly, recent advancement in
UAS technology and lightweight sensors have enabled multirotor (payload 5–6 kg readily available) to
onboard multi-sensors.
Water status of crops is a complex process inﬂuenced by a number of factors including the
physiology of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and vigour of the crop, and meteorological
factors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this reason, a multi-sensor platform is used to acquire measurements
of the diﬀerent aspects of the crop for water status assessment [34,102,108]. The most common
combination of sensors found in the literature is the RGB, multispectral (including rededge and NIR
bands) and thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to investigate the water status of the crop
using various indicators, such as PRI, CWSI, ﬂuorescence, and structural properties, with the aim of
improving the water use eﬃciency [102,110,158–160].
4. Techniques of Remote Sensing in Horticulture
4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely Sensed Images
Georeferencing provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed images such that the pixels
representing crops or regions of interest on the images are correctly associated with their position on
Earth. The georeferencing process generally uses surveyed coordinate points on the ground, known
as ground control points (GCPs), to determine and apply scaling and transformation to the aerial
images [161]. Alternatively, instead of GCPs, the user can georeference aerial images by using the
accurate position of the camera, or by co-registration with the existing georeferenced map [105,162].
In the case of UAS-based images, the capture timing is scheduled to ensure a recommended
forward overlap (>80%) between successive images.
The ﬂight path is designed to ensure the
recommended side overlap (>70%) between images from successive ﬂight strips. Thus, the captured
series of images are processed using the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) technique to generate a 3D
pointcloud and orthomosaic [73,130] (see Figure 5). Commonly used SfM software to process the
remote sensing images are Agisoft PhotoScan and Pix4D. The commonly retrieved outputs from the
SfM software for assessment of horticulture crops include the orthomosaic, digital surface model
(DSM), DEM, and 3D pointcloud [113,126,163]. This technique of georeferencing can be applied to any
sensor that produces images, e.g., RGB, thermal, or multispectral cameras [126,164,165].

sensor [126]. The use of fixed-wing UAS has allowed carrying higher payloads due to the much larger 
thrust-to-weight ratio as compared to a rotary-wing aircraft [155]. Similarly, recent advancement in 
UAS technology and lightweight sensors have enabled multirotor (payload 5–6 kg readily available) 
to onboard multi-sensors. 
Water status of crops is a complex process influenced by a number of factors including the 
physiology of the crop, available soil moisture, the size and vigour of the crop, and meteorological 
factors [30,108,116,156,157]. For this reason, a multi-sensor platform is used to acquire measurements 
of the different aspects of the crop for water status assessment [34,102,108]. The most common 
combination of sensors found in the literature is the RGB, multispectral (including rededge and NIR 
bands) and thermal. Together, these sensors can be used to investigate the water status of the crop 
using various indicators, such as PRI, CWSI, fluorescence, and structural properties, with the aim of 
improving the water use efficiency [102,110,158–160]. 
4. Techniques of Remote Sensing in Horticulture 
4.1. Georeferencing of Remotely Sensed Images 
Georeferencing provides a spatial reference to the remotely sensed images such that the pixels 
representing crops or regions of interest on the images are correctly associated with their position on

(DSM), DEM, and 3D pointcloud [113,126,163]. This technique of georeferencing can be applied to 
any sensor that produces images, e.g., RGB, thermal, or multispectral cameras [126,164,165].

The complexity of georeferencing of hyperspectral observations depends on the sensor type, i.e.,
imaging or non-imaging. A non-imaging spectroradiometer relies on the use of a GNSS antenna and
an IMU for georeferencing the point observation [130,132,138,168]. An imaging hyperspectral camera,
generally, in addition to GNSS and IMU measurement, uses the inter-pixel relation in SfM to produce a
georeferenced orthomosaic [40,134,135,169,170].
4.2. Calibration and Correction of Remotely Sensed Images
Ensuring consistency, repeatability, and quality of the spectral observation requires stringent
radiometric, spectral, and atmospheric corrections [123,171–177]. Spectral and radiometric calibration
is performed in the spectral calibration facility in darkroom settings. The sensor’s optical properties
and shift in spectral band position are corrected during the spectral calibration process. Radiometric
calibration enables conversion of the recorded digital values into physical units, such as radiance.
Inﬁeld operation of the spectral sensor is inﬂuenced by variations in atmospheric transmittance
from thin clouds, invisible to the human observer. Changes in atmospheric transmittance aﬀect the
radiance incident on the plant. As a result, the change in acquired spectral response by the sensor
may not represent the change in plants response but the change in incident radiation on the plant.
The most common method to convert the spectral data to reﬂectance is by generating an empirical line
relationship between sensor values and spectral targets, such as a Spectralon® or calibration targets.
The use of downwelling sensors, such as a cosine corrector [137], or the use of a ground-based PAR
sensor enables absolute radiometric calibration to generate radiance [130].
The calibration of the broad wavelength multispectral sensor is generally less stringent than
the hyperspectral. Generally, multispectral sensors are used to compute normalised indices such
as NDVI. The normalised indices are relatively less inﬂuenced, although signiﬁcant, by the change
in illumination conditions which aﬀect the entire spectrum proportionally [29,101]. In this regard,
radiometric calibration of the multispectral camera has used a range of stringent to simpliﬁed, and
vicarious approaches [123,125,171,173,178–180]. Some multispectral cameras are equipped with a
downwelling light sensor, which is aimed at correcting for variations in atmospheric transmittance.
However, the performance of such downwelling sensors (without a cosine corrector) on multispectral
cameras have been reported to have directional variation resulting in unstable correction, indicating
the inability of the sensor to incorporate the entire hemisphere of diﬀused light [124,137].
The radiometric calibration of the thermal images is typically based on the camera’s DN to object
temperature curve, which provides the relationship between the DN of a pixel and a known object
temperature, usually of a black body radiator. Measurement accuracy and SNR of the camera under
varying ambient temperatures can be improved by using calibration shutters, which are recently
available commercially. Furthermore, for low measurement errors (under 1 ◦C), thermal data requires
consideration to the atmospheric transmittance [18,102]. Flying over a few temperature reference
targets placed on the ground reduces the temporal drift of the camera [142,143,181]. Temperature
accuracy within a few degrees was achieved by ﬂying over the targets three times (at the start, middle
and end of UAS operation) and using three separate calibration equations for each overpass [142].
Additionally, using the redundant information from multiple overlapping images, drift correction
models have been proposed, which lowered temperature error by 1 ◦C as compared to uncorrected
orthomosaic [152]. The manufacturer stated accuracies (generally ±5 ◦C) can be suﬃcient to access the
ﬁeld variability and to detect “hotspots” of water status. However, the aforementioned calibration and
correction of the thermal cameras are required for quantitative measurement as a goal [143]. In this
regard, current challenges and best practices for the operation of thermal cameras onboard a UAS is
provided in the literature [143].
4.3. Canopy Data Extraction
A key challenge in remote sensing of horticultural as compared to agricultural crops arises due
to the proportion of inter-row ground/vegetation cover and resulting mixed pixels. The proportion
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140
12 of 35
of the mixed pixels increases with the decrease in spatial resolution of the image. Most of the pixels
towards the edge of the canopy contain a blend of information originating from the sun-lit canopy,
shadowed leaves, and inter-row bare soil/cover crop. A further challenge can arise for some crops,
such as grapevine, due to overlapping of adjacent plants.
The canopy data from orthomosaic has been extracted using either a pixel-based or an object-based
approach. Earlier studies manually sampled from the centre of crop row which most likely eliminated
the mixed pixels [182]. In the pixel-based approach, techniques, such as applying global threshold
and masking, have been used. Binary masks, such as NDVI, eliminates non-canopy pixels from
the sampling [82,84]. Combining the NDVI mask with the canopy height mask can exclude the
pixels associated with non-vegetation, as well as vegetation that does not meet the height threshold.
The pixel-based approach, however, can result in inaccurate identiﬁcation of some crops due to pixel
heterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop pattern variability.
In the object-based approach, using object detection techniques, neighbouring pixels with
homogenous information, such as spectral, textural, structural, and hierarchical features, are grouped
into “objects”. These objects are used as the basis of object-based image analysis (OBIA) classiﬁcation
using classiﬁers, such as k-nearest neighbour, decision tree, support vector machine, random forest,
and maximum likelihood [122,183–185]. In the horticultural environment, OBIA has been adopted
to classify and sample from pure canopy pixels [119,122,186]. Consideration should be provided on
the number of features and their suitability for a speciﬁc application to reduce the computational
burden, as well as to maintain the accuracies. The generalisation of these algorithms for transferability
between study sites usually penalises the achievable accuracy. For details in object-based approach of
segmentation and classiﬁcation, readers are directed to literatures [122,183,185,187–189].
Other techniques found in the literature include algorithms, such as ‘Watershed’, which has been
demonstrated in palm orchards [82,190]. Vine rows and plants have been isolated and classiﬁed using
image processing techniques, such as clustering and skeletisation [188,191–193]. Similarly, the gridded
polygon, available in common GIS software, such as ArcGIS and QGIS, can be used in combination
with zonal statistics for this purpose. When working with the low-resolution images, co-registration
with the high-resolution images has been proposed, whereby, the high-resolution images enable better
delineation of the mixed pixels [194]. For this reason, spectral and thermal sensors, which are usually
low in resolution, are generally employed along with high-resolution digital cameras.
4.4. Indicators of Crop Water Status
A crop’s biophysical and biochemical attributes can be approximated using diﬀerent indices and
quantitative products. For example, CWSI is used to proxy leaf water potential (Ψleaf), stem water
potential (Ψstem), gs, and net photosynthesis (Pn) [83,100,195]. With regard to horticultural crops, water
status has been assessed using a number of spectral and thermal indices (Table 2).

4.4.1. Canopy Temperature
A plant maintains its temperature by transpiring through the stomata to balance the energy
ﬂuxes in and out of the canopy. As the plant experience stress (both biotic and abiotic), the rate of
transpiration decreases, which results in higher canopy temperature (Tc), which can be a proxy to
understand the water stress in the plant [207]. In this regard, crop water stress showed a correlation
with canopy temperature extracted from the thermal image [208], which enables mapping the spatial
variability in water status [209]. Leaf/canopy temperature alone, however, does not provide a complete
characterisation of crop water status, for instance, an equally stressed canopy can be 25 ◦C or 35 ◦C,
depending on the current ambient temperature (Ta). Thus, canopy-to-air temperature diﬀerence
(Tc − Ta) was proposed, which showed a good correlation with the Ψstem, Ψleaf, and gs in horticultural
crops [85,99,182].
4.4.2. Normalised Thermal Indices
The CWSI, the conductance index (Ig) and the stomatal conductance index (I3) are thermal
indices most commonly used to estimate crop water status and gs [210–212]. These indices provide
similar information, however, use a diﬀerent range of numbers to represent the level of water stress.
The CWSI is normalised within zero and one, whereas Ig and I3 represent stress using numbers
between zero and inﬁnity. CWSI has been adopted most widely in horticultural applications to
assess the water status of crops, such as the grapevines [100,213], almond [91,198], citrus [85,110], and
others [18,87,99,214]. By normalising between the lower and upper limits of (Tc − Ta), the CWSI of the
canopy presents quantiﬁable relative water stress. The formula for CWSI computation is deﬁned as in
Equation (1) [208,212].
CWSI =
(Tc − Ta) − (Tc − Ta)LL
(Tc − Ta)UL − (Tc − Ta)LL
(1)
where (Tc − Ta)UL and (Tc − Ta)LL represent the upper and lower bound of (Tc − Ta) which are found in
the water-stressed canopy and well-watered canopy transpiring at the full potential (or maximum) rate,
respectively. Assuming a constant ambient temperature, Equation (1) can be simpliﬁed to Equation (2),
which is the most widely reported formulation of CWSI with regard to the horticultural remote sensing.
CWSI = (Tc − Twet)

Tdry − Twet

(2)
where Twet is the temperature of canopy transpiring at the maximum potential, and Tdry is the
temperature of the non-transpiring canopy. CWSI has been shown to be well-correlated with direct
measurements of crop water status in the horticultural environment [18,31,32,90,99]. In this regard,
a correlation of CWSI with various ground measurements, such as Ψleaf [18,31,197], Ψstem [33,90,194],
and gs [18,90,100], have been established. Diurnal measurements of CWSI compared with Ψleaf showed
the best correlation at noon [89,197,209].
CWSI is a normalised index, i.e., relative to a reference temperature range between Twet and Tdry,
which is speciﬁc to a region and crop type; thus, CWSI is not a universal quantitative indicator of crop
water status. For instance, a CWSI of 0.5 for two diﬀerent varieties of grapevines at diﬀerent locations
does not conclusively inform that they have equal or superior/inferior water status. Furthermore,
the degree of correlation can change depending on the isohydric/anisohydric response of crop [214]
where early/late stomatal closure aﬀects the indicators of water stress [110]. Moreover, phenological
stage aﬀects the relationship between remotely sensed CWSI and water stress [197]. Thus, water stress
in a diﬀerent crop, at a diﬀerent location and at a diﬀerent phenological stage, will have a unique
correlation with CWSI and, therefore, needs to be established independently.
There are multiple methods to measure the two reference temperatures, Twet and Tdry, which
could result in variable CWSI values depending on the method used. The ﬁrst method is to measure the
two reference temperatures on the crop of interest. Tdry can be estimated by inducing stomatal closure,
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140
14 of 35
which is the leaf temperature approximately 30 min after applying a layer of petroleum jelly e.g.,
Vaseline to both sides of a leaf. This eﬀectively blocks stomata and, therefore, impedes leaf transpiration.
Twet can be estimated by measuring leaf temperature approximately 30 s after spraying water on the
leaf, which emulates maximum transpiration [23,83]. The advantage of this method is that the stress
levels are normalised to actual plants response, whereas the necessity to repeat the measurement for
every test site after each ﬂight can be cumbersome. In an alternative (second) approach the range can
be established based on meteorological data e.g., setting Tdry to 5 ◦C above air temperature and Twet
measured from an artiﬁcial surface. This method is also limited to local scale and presents a problem
regarding the choice of material, which ideally needs to have similar to leaf emissivity, aerodynamic
and optical properties [54,87]. The third method uses the actual temperature measurement range
of the remote sensing image [33,97]. This method is simple to implement, however, works on the
assumption that the ﬁeld contains enough variability to contain a representative Twet and Tdry. Fourth,
the reference temperatures can be estimated by theoretically solving for the leaf surface energy balance
equations, however, are limited by the necessity to compute the canopy aerodynamic resistance [87].
Standard and robust Twet and Tdry measurements are needed to characterize CWSI with accuracy,
especially for temporal analysis [85,87,211]. The level of uncertainty due to the adaptation of diﬀerent
approaches for Twet and Tdry determination in the instantaneous and seasonal measurements of CWSI
is not known. Nonetheless, adopting a consistent approach, CWSI has been shown to be suitable for
monitoring the water status and making irrigation decisions of horticultural crops [31,85].
4.4.3. Spectral Indices
Crops reﬂectance properties convey information about the crop, for instance, a healthier crop has
higher reﬂectance in the NIR band. Most often, the bands are mathematically combined to form VIs,
which provide information on the crop’s health, growth stage, biophysical properties, leaf biochemistry,
and water stress [29,215–218]. Using multispectral or hyperspectral data, several Vis, such as green
normalised diﬀerence vegetation index (GNDVI), renormalised diﬀerence vegetation index (RDVI),
optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), transformed chlorophyll absorption in reﬂectance
index (TCARI), and TCARI/OSAVI, amongst others [34,79,82], can be calculated that correlate with the
water stress of horticultural crops (see Table 2). The most widely studied VI in horticulture, in this
regard, is the NDVI (Equation (3)).
NDVI = Rnir − Rr
Rnir + Rr
(3)
where Rnir and Rr represent the spectral reﬂectance acquired at the NIR and red spectral regions,
respectively. In horticulture, NDVI has been used as a proxy to estimate the vigour, biomass, and water
status of the crop. A vigorous canopy with more leaves regulates more water, therefore remaining
cooler when irrigated [200] and experiencing early water stress when unirrigated. With regard to
irrigation, the broadband normalised spectral indices (such as NDVI) are suitable to detect spatial
variability and to identify the area that is most vulnerable to water stress. However, these indices are
not expected to change rapidly to reﬂect the instantaneous water status of plants that are needed to
make decisions on irrigation scheduling.
The multispectral indices along with complementary information in thermal wavelengths have
proven to be well suited to monitoring vegetation, speciﬁcally in relation to water stress [219]. The ratio
of canopy surface temperature to NDVI, deﬁned as temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI),
was found to be useful for the study of water status in horticultural crops. TVDI exploits the fact that
vegetation with larger NDVI will have a lower surface temperature unless the vegetation is under
stress. As most vegetation normally remains green after an initial bout of water stress, the TVDI is
more suited than NDVI for early detection of water stress as the surface temperature can rise rapidly
even during initial water stress [200].
Similarly, narrowband VIs that have been studied in relation to remote sensing of water status are
PRI and chlorophyll ﬂuorescence, which have been directly correlated to the crop Ψleaf, gs [110,182,204].
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140
15 of 35
Several hyperspectral indices to estimate water status have been identiﬁed [139]; however, their
application in remote sensing of horticultural crops is at its infancy. Hyperspectral indices speciﬁc to
water absorption bands around 900 nm, 1200 nm, 1400 nm, and 1900 nm may be used to detect the
water status of horticultural crops. The absorption features were found to be highly correlated with
plant water status [139]. Water band index (WBI), as deﬁned in Equation (4), has been shown to closely
track the changes in the plant water status of various crops [202,203].
WBI = R970
R900
(4)
Other water-related hyperspectral indices with potential application for horticultural crops can
be found in the literature [139,202,203]. Hyperspectral data possess the capability to reﬂect the
instantaneous water status of the plant, which can be useful for quantitative decision-making on
irrigation scheduling.
4.4.4. Soil Moisture
The moisture status of the soil provides an indication of the available water resource to the crop.
Soil moisture is traditionally measured indirectly using soil moisture sensors placed below the surface
of the soil. A key challenge with using soil moisture sensors are the spatial distribution of moisture,
both vertically and horizontally, to account for inherent ﬁeld-scale variability. For instance, the root
system of some horticultural crops, such as grapevine, is capable of accessing water up to 30 m deep,
while customer-grade soil moisture probes generally extend to 1.5 m in depth or less. Thus, soil
moisture probes do not capture all the water available to the crop as they are point measures and
not necessarily where the roots are located. Moreover, estimation of soil moisture across spatial and
temporal scales is of interest for various agricultural and hydrological studies. Optical, thermal, and
microwave remote sensing with their advantages relating to high spatial scale and temporal resolutions
could potentially be used for soil moisture estimation [220–222]. L-band microwave radiometry,
a component of synthetic aperture radar systems, has been shown to be a reliable approach to estimate
soil moisture via satellite-based remote sensing [223], such as using the ESA’s Soil Moisture and
Ocean Salinity (SMOS) [224] and NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites [225,226].
The limitation of the SMOS and SMAP missions, with regard to horticultural application, is their
depth of retrieval (up to 5 cm) and spatial resolution (in the order of tens of kilometre) [227–229].
As an airborne application, the volumetric soil moisture has been estimated by analysing the SNR of
the GNSS interference signal [230,231]. With aforementioned capabilities, a combination of satellite
and airborne remote sensing may, in the future, be a reliable tool to map soil moisture across spatial,
temporal and depth scales.
4.4.5. Physiological Attributes
Using the SfM on remotely-sensed images, 3D canopy structure, terrain conﬁgurations, and canopy
surface models can be derived [113,114,119,186,232]. By employing a delineation algorithm on the 3D
models, the 3D attributes of the crops and macrostructure are determined more accurately [120,122,233].
Crop surface area and terrain conﬁguration (e.g., slope and aspect) may help to develop an optimal
resource management strategy. For example, crops located at a higher elevation within an irrigation
zone may experience a level of water stress due to the gravitational ﬂow of irrigated water.
Using the structural measurements, such as the canopy height, canopy size, the envelope of each
row, LAI, and porosity, among others, the water demand of the crop may be estimated. Generally,
larger canopies tend to require more water than smaller canopies with less leaf area [116,157]. Using
the temporal measurement of the plant’s 3D attributes, the vigour can be computed. Monitoring
crop vigour over the season and over subsequent years can provide an indication of its health and
performance, e.g., yield, within an irrigation zone. Canopy structure metrics are closely related to
horticultural tree growth and provide strong indicators of water consumption, whereby canopy size
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140
16 of 35
can be used to determine its water requirements [234]. Other 3D attributes, such as the crown perimeter,
width, height, area, and leaf density, have been shown to enable improved pruning of horticultural
plants [116,119].
LAI can be estimated using the 3D attributes obtained from remote sensing [114,157,201], whereby,
higher LAI is equivalent to more leaf layers, implying greater total leaf area and, consequently, canopy
transpiration. Leaf density, LAI, and exposed leaf area of a crop drive its water requirement and
productivity [235–237]. Knowledge of ﬁeld attributes, such as row and plant spacing, may assist in
inter-row surface energy balance to determine the irrigation need of the plant [238]. Combining the
structural properties with spectral VIs provide an estimation of biomass [239], which can serve as
another indicator of the plant’s water requirements. Although physiological attributes have been used
to understand plant water status and its spatial variability, they have not been directly applied to make
quantitative decisions on irrigation.
4.4.6. Evapotranspiration
The estimation of ET via remote sensing, numerical modelling, and empirical methods have been
extensively studied and reviewed in the literature [240–247]. These models are based on either surface
energy balance (SEB), Penman-Monteith (PM), Maximum entropy production (MEP), water balance,
water-carbon linkage, or empirical relationships.
SEB models are based on a surface energy budget in which the latent heat ﬂux is estimated as a
residual of the net radiation, soil heat ﬂux, and sensible heat ﬂux. The models are either one-source
(canopy and soil treated as a single surface for the estimation of sensible heat ﬂux) or two-source
(canopy and soil surfaces treated separately). Improvements over the original one-source SEB models
were in the form of Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) algorithm [248,249] and
Mapping EvapoTranspiration with high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [249,250].
SEBAL oﬀers a simpliﬁed approach to collect ET data at both local and regional scales thereby increasing
the spatial scope, while METRIC uses the same (SEBAL) technique but auto-calibrates the model using
hourly ground-based reference ET (ETr) data [251]. As such, these and other (e.g., MEP) models rely
on accurate measurements of surface (e.g., canopy) and air temperatures, which can be erroneous
under non-ideal conditions, e.g., cloudy days. There is also a reliance on ground-based sensors to
capture ambient air temperatures required by the model.
Among the existing methods, FAO’s PM is the most widely adopted model to estimate reference
ET (ETref or ET0) [252]. The PM method uses incident and reﬂected solar radiation, emitted thermal
radiation, air temperature, wind speed, and vapour pressure to calculate ET0 [253]. Remote sensing
provides a cost-eﬀective method to estimate the ET0 at regional to global scales [241] by estimating
reﬂected solar and emitted thermal radiation. One of the advantages of using the PM approach is
that it is parametrised using micrometeorological data easily obtained from ground-based automatic
weather stations. However, PM suﬀers from the drawback that canopy transpiration is not dynamic
as inﬂuenced by soil moisture availability via stomatal regulation [241]. From a practical standpoint,
PM-derived ET0 estimates are used in conjunction with crop factors or crop coeﬃcients (kc), which are
closely related to the light interception of the canopy [254].
Crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is deﬁned as the product of kc and ET0. In the absence of accurate
ETc measurements, kc is an easy and practical means of getting reliable estimates of ETc using ET0 [255].
In this regard, studies have focused on the use of remote sensing to study spatial variability in kc and
ETc [101,256–258]. Thermal and NIR imagery can be used to compute kc and ETc as transpiration
rate is closely related to canopy temperature [259–261] and kc has been shown to correlate with
canopy reﬂectance [101,255]. Various thermal indices, such as CWSI, canopy temperature ratio, canopy
temperature above non-stressed, and canopy temperature above canopy threshold, can be used to
estimate ETc, where CWSI- based ETc was found to be the most accurate [24].
ET at a larger scale is typically estimated based on satellite remote sensing. The temporal resolution
of satellites is, however, low and inadequate for horticultural applications, such as irrigation scheduling
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140
17 of 35
(e.g., Landsat has a 16-day revisit cycle). In contrast, high temporal resolution satellites are coarse in
spatial resolution for ﬁeld-scale observations [25]. The daily or even instantaneous estimation of ETc at
the ﬁeld scale is crucial for irrigation scheduling and is expected to have great application prospects
in the future [240,259,262,263]. In this regard, the future direction of satellite-based ET estimates
may focus on temporal downscaling either by extrapolation of instantaneous measurement [264],
interpolation between two successive observations [201], data fusion of multiple satellites [25,260], and
spatial downscaling using multiple satellites [265–268]. An example of early satellite-based remote
sensing for ET is the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16), which was established in
1999 to provide daily estimates of global terrestrial evapotranspiration using data acquired from a
pair of NASA satellites in conjunction with Algorithm Theoretical Based Documents (ATBDs) [269].
These estimates correlated well with ground-based eddy covariance ﬂux tower estimates of ET despite
diﬀerences in the uncertainties associated with each of these techniques.
UASs are being increasingly utilised to acquire multi-spectral and thermal imagery to compute
ET at an unprecedented spatial resolution [270,271]. Using high-resolution images, ﬁltering the
shadowed-pixel is possible, which showed signiﬁcant improvement in the estimation of ET in
grapevine [101]. Using high-resolution thermal and/or multispectral imagery, ET has been derived for
horticultural crops, such as grapevines [270] and olives [271]. The seasonal monitoring of ETc at high
spatial and temporal resolutions is of high importance for precision irrigation of horticultural crops in
the future [259].
5. Case Studies on the Use of Remote Sensing for Crop Water Stress Detection
The increasing prevalence of UAS along with low-cost camera systems has brought about much
interest in the characterisation of crop water status/stress during the growing season to inform orchard
or farm management decisions, in particular, irrigation scheduling [272,273]. Traditional methodologies
to assess crop water stress are constrained by limitations relating to large farm sizes and accompanying
spatial variability, high labour costs to collect data, and access to instrumentation that is both inexpensive
and portable [272]. The beneﬁts of precision agriculture [274], including through precision irrigation
practices [1], result in higher production eﬃciencies and economic returns through site-speciﬁc crop
management [275,276]. This approach has motivated the use of high-resolution imagery acquired
from remote sensing to identify irrigation zones [99,277]. The ﬁrst horticultural applications of UAS
platforms for crop water status measurement were in orange and peach orchards where both thermal
and multispectral-derived VIs, speciﬁcally the PRI, were shown to be well-correlated to crop water
status [102]. Here, we explore the use of remote sensing and accompanying image acquisition platforms
to characterise the spatial and temporal patterns of the water status of two economically important
horticultural crops, grapevine and almond.
5.1. Grapevine (Vitis spp.)
The characterisation of spatial variability in vine water status in a vineyard provides valuable
guidance on irrigation scheduling decisions [82], and this spatial variability can be eﬃciently
characterised by the use of remote sensing platforms [29]. The ﬁrst use of remote sensing in vineyards
for crop water stress detection was using manned aircraft ﬂown over an irrigated vineyard in Hanwood
(NSW) Australia where CWSI was mapped at a spatial resolution of 10 cm [278]. Subsequently, UAS
platforms began to be used in vineyards for vine water stress characterisation. Early work in this
crop used a fuel-based helicopter with a 29 cc engine and equipped with thermal (Thermovision
A40M) and multispectral (Tetracam MCA-6) camera systems [102]. The study observed strong (inverse)
relationships between (Tc − Ta) and gs. A related study showed strong correlations between thermal
and multispectral VIs, and traditional, ground-based measures of water status, such as Ψleaf and
gs [182]. In this study, normalised PRI was shown to have correlation coeﬃcients exceeding 0.8 versus
both Ψleaf and gs, indicating that remotely-sensed VIs can be reliable indicators of vine water status.
Thermal indices, such as (Tc − Ta) and CWSI, were also well-correlated to Ψleaf and gs at speciﬁc times of
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140
18 of 35
the day. The use of thermal indices, such as CWSI or Ig, requires reference temperatures (Twet, Tdry) or
non-water stressed baselines (NWSB) [279]. Due to the diﬃculty of obtaining reference temperatures or
NWSB using remote sensing, some authors have used the minimum temperature found from all canopy
pixels as Twet [199], and Ta + 5 ◦C as Tdry [213,280]. NWSB is typically obtained from well-watered
canopies, measuring (Tc − Ta) under a range of vapour pressure deﬁcit conditions [279]. Thermal water
stress indices have also shown to be useful to distinguish between water use strategies of diﬀerent
grapevine cultivars [83,281], which is useful for customising irrigation scheduling based on the speciﬁc
water needs of a given cultivar. More recently, studies have used UAS-based multispectral-based
VIs to train an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) models to predict spatial patterns of Ψstem [84,282].
Using UAS-based multispectral data, the authors showed that ANN estimated Ψstem with higher
accuracy (RMSE lower than 0.15 MPa) as compared to the conventional multispectral indices based
estimation (RMSE over 0.32 MPa).
5.2. Almond (Prunus Dulcis)
Almonds are perennial nut trees grown in semi-arid climates and are reliant on irrigation
applications. Their water requirements are relatively high, with seasonal ETc exceeding 1000 mm [283].
The requirement for prudent irrigation management in the face of decreased water availability is
critical for maintaining tree productivity, yield, and nut quality [284]. Towards this goal, UAS-based
remote sensing has been used to characterise the spatial patterns of tree water status in almond
orchards. A UAS-based thermal camera was used to acquire tree the crown temperature data from
a California almond orchard; this temperature was used to determine the temperature diﬀerence
between crown and air (Tc − Ta) and compared to shaded leaf water potential (Ψsl) [92]. The study
found a strong negative correlation (R2 = 0.72) between (Tc − Ta) and Ψsl. The same authors conducted
a follow on study in Spain on several fruit tree species including almond. The negative relationship
(slope and oﬀset) between (Tc − Ta) and Ψstem was observed to vary based on the time of observation;
morning measurements had weak relationships, whereas afternoon measurements had stronger
relationships [99]. Their proposed methodology allowed for the spatial characterisation of orchard
water status on a single-tree basis, demonstrating the utility of UAS-based crop water stress data.
Beyond the characterisation of crop water stress for irrigation scheduling, there is an opportunity to
use this data to quantify the economic impact at a spatial level.
6. Future Prospective and Gaps in the Knowledge
Precision irrigation is a promising approach to increase farm water use eﬃciency for sustainable
production, including for horticultural crops [3,5,9,10,274,285]. It is envisioned that the future of
precision irrigation will incorporate UAS, manned aircraft, and satellite-based remote sensing platforms
alongside ground-based proximal sensors coupled with wireless sensor networks. The automation
of UAS technology will continue to develop further to a point that even novice users can adopt
the technology with ease. It is also expected that the data processing pipeline of remote sensing
images will become automated to be ‘ﬁt for purpose’ for crop water status measurements. The ideal
solution may lie in the use of satellites (or sometimes manned aircraft) for regional estimation and
planning [55,260], UAS for seasonal monitoring and zoning [32,100,197,286], proximal sensors for
continuous measurement [287], and artiﬁcial intelligence to derive decision-ready products [84,282]
that can be used for making irrigation scheduling decisions [31,288–295]. Continued technological
developments in this space will enable growers to acquire actionable data with ease, and eventually
transition towards semi-automated or fully-automated irrigation applications.
Remote sensing and current irrigation application technologies are limited in temporal and
spatial resolution, respectively. Although UAS technology can deliver sub-plant level spatially explicit
information of water status, the size of the management block is much coarser, typically over 10 m.
Hence, further improvements in variable rate application technologies, e.g., boom sprayers, or zoned
drip irrigation, are required to fully exploit high-resolution UAS measurements. Nonetheless, the
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140
19 of 35
required resolution of remote sensing should be guided by the underlying spatial variability of the crop.
For ﬁelds with relatively lower spatial variability, low/medium-resolution remote sensing imagery
may suﬃce for crop water status assessment [278,296,297].
Remote sensing provides an indirect estimate of plant water status using the regression-based
approach through several calculated reﬂectance indices. In comparison, physical and mechanistic
models, e.g., radiative transfer models and energy balance models, incorporate both direct and indirect
measures of the canopy, therefore establishing a basis for diﬀerences in plant water status. Using a
similar approach, predictions of crop water status using regression-based remote sensing models can
be improved by incorporating some direct auxiliary variables.
Further developments in thermal remote sensing are also expected, speciﬁcally, the advent of new
thermal and hybrid thermal-multispectral water status/stress indices that are more sensitive to canopy
transpiration. The most widely-adopted thermal index, CWSI, is an instantaneous measure that is
normalised to local weather conditions and inﬂuenced by genotype and phenotype. For example,
the relationship between CWSI and crop water status is inﬂuenced by environmental conditions
(e.g., high incident radiation and low humidity vs low incident radiation and high humidity) and
phenological stage [197,214,298]. As a result, corresponding ground-based measurements are required
for each temporal remote measurement to determine the correlation with water status. Hence, temporal
assessments of water status using thermal cameras will require the incorporation of meteorological
data along with the thermal response using novel indices.
In the area of satellite remote sensing, we foresee further developments on temporal downscaling
to achieve daily measurements. A higher temporal resolution may be achieved by fusion of multiple
satellite observations, such as freely available Landsat and Sentinel. Further reductions of temporal
resolution will require interpolation between two successive observations. Furthermore, temporal
models of water status could be developed to assist the interpolation to eventually satisfy the
requirements for irrigation scheduling [25,201,263]. The continued advancement and greater availability
of Nanosat/Cubesat may provide an alternate method to capture high-resolution data at a higher
a greater temporal resolution, which can be suitable to study the water status of horticultural
crops [299–301].
Crop water status is a complex phenomenon, which can be interpreted with respect to a
number of variables. These variables can include spectral response, thermal response, meteorological
data, 3D attributes of the canopy, and macrostructure of the block (farm).
Clearly, there is
an opportunity for a multi-disciplinary approach, potentially incorporating artiﬁcial intelligence
techniques which incorporate the aforementioned variables to provide a robust estimation of crop
water status [84,141,282,302,303]. Furthermore, with machine learning algorithms, hyperspectral
remote sensing will provide a wealth of data to estimate crop water status. A quantitative product,
such as SIF, derived from hyperspectral data will have the potential for direct quantiﬁcation of water
stress [204,205,304]. In this regard, the upcoming FLEX satellite mission [305,306] and recent advances
in aerial spectroradiometry [109,132,137,307–310] dedicated for observation of SIF may be unique and
powerful tools for high-value horticultural crops.
Multi-temporal images represent an excellent resource for seasonal monitoring of changes in crop
water status. Five to six temporal points of data acquisition at critical phenological stages of crop
development have been recommended for irrigation scheduling [31,32]. However, for semi-arid or arid
regions, irrigation is typically required multiple times per week. Acquisition and post-processing of
remote sensing data for actionable products multiple times a week is currently logistically unfeasible.
The fusion of UAS-based remote sensing data, continuous ground-based proximal or direct sensors,
including weather station data, can potentially inform daily estimates of water status at canopy level.
This approach will require predictive models, such as those based on machine learning algorithms, to
estimate the current and future water status of the crop. Eventually, growers would beneﬁt from the
knowledge of crop water requirements for the determination of seasonal irrigation requirements to
sustainably farm into the future.
Agronomy 2020, 10, 140

One vision for the future of precision irrigation is in automated pipelines to explicitly manage
irrigation water at the sub-block level. This automated pipeline would likely include remote and
proximal data acquisition and processing, prediction and interpretation of crop water status and
requirements, and subsequently, control of irrigation systems. Recent rapid developments in cloud
computing and wireless technology could assist in the quasi-real-time processing of the remote sensing
data soon after acquisition [311–313]. Eventually, automation and computational power will merge to
develop smart technology in which artiﬁcial intelligence uses real-time data analysis for diagnosis
and decision-making. Growers of the future will be able to take advantage of precise irrigation
recommendations using information sourced from a ﬂeet of UAS that map large farm blocks on a daily
schedule, continuous ground-based proximal and direct sensors, and weather stations. This data can be
stored on and accessed from the cloud almost instantaneously, used in conjunction with post-processing
algorithms for decision-making on optimised irrigation applications [311,314].
7. Conclusions
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the use of remote sensing to determine the water
status of horticultural crops. One of our objectives was to survey the range of remote sensing tools
available for irrigation decision-making. Earth observation satellite systems possess the required bands
to study the water status of vegetation and soil. Satellites are more suitable for scouting, planning,
and management of irrigation applications that involve large areas, and where data acquisition is
not time-constrained. Manned aircraft are sparingly used in horticultural applications due to the
cost, logistics, and speciﬁc expertise needed for the operation of the platform. UAS-based remote
sensing provides ﬂexibility in spatial resolution (crop level observation achievable), coverage (over
25 ha achievable in a single ﬂight), spectral bands, as well as temporal revisit. Routine monitoring of
horticultural crops for water status characterisation is, therefore, best performed using a UAS platform.
We envision a future for precision irrigation where satellites are used for planning, and UAS used in
conjunction with a network of ground-based sensors to achieve actionable products on a timely basis.
The plant’s instantaneous response to water stress can be captured using thermal cameras (via
indices, such as CWSI) and potentially narrow-band hyperspectral sensors (via, for example, SIF),
making them suitable to draw quantiﬁable decisions with regard to irrigation scheduling. Broadband
multispectral and RGB cameras capture the non-instantaneous water status of crops, making them
suitable for general assessment of crop water status. Integrated use of thermal and multispectral
imagery may be the simplest yet eﬀective sensor combinations to capture the overall as well as
instantaneous water status of the plant. With regard to irrigation scheduling, further developments
are required to establish crop-speciﬁc thresholds of remotely-sensed indices to decide when and how
much to irrigate.

  Main Objective: The main objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of different physical layer parameters on the performance of a LoRa network in a tree farm environment.
  Study Location: Romney, Indiana, USA
  Data Sources: Experimental data collected from LoRa sensors deployed in a tree farm
  Technologies Used: LoRa
  Key Findings: The results of the study showed that the LoRa communication range was smaller than the theoretically expected range, and that the spreading factor and coding rate had a significant impact on LoRa performance. The study also found that the Fresnel Zone still affects LoRa networks.
  Extract 1: "Overall, the LoRa communication range was smaller than the theoretically expected range. Some PHY factors, spreading factor and coding rate, showed a clear impact on LoRa performance. Actual data reliability was inconsistent at varying distances and PHY configurations, unlike the consistency found in the RSSI reported by the radios."
  Extract 2: "Additional experiments show the Fresnel Zone still affects LoRa networks."
  Limitations: The study is limited to a single tree farm location and does not consider the impact of other environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity. Additionally, the authors only tested a limited number of PHY parameter combinations and did not explore the impact of other factors, such as transmit power and antenna height.
  Relevance Evaluation: The study is highly relevant to the point of discussion, which focuses on the impact of environmental factors on wireless data transmission in agricultural settings. The authors specifically investigate the effect of physical obstacles (i.e., trees) on LoRa network performance, which is a critical consideration for deploying wireless sensor networks in agricultural environments. The study provides valuable insights into the factors affecting LoRa communication range, reliability, and RSSI, which can inform the design and implementation of real-time irrigation management systems that rely on wireless data transmission.
  Relevance Score: 0.9

Conclusion Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Deployment of internet of things (IoT) devices, wireless sensors, and sensor networks, in agriculture can be a great help in monitoring environment and growing crops; and having a network to support those devices is necessary to successfully utilize those resources. Recently, low-power wide area network (LPWAN) have been recognized as an appropriate technology for agriculture use. LoRa is a representative network of low-power wide area network (LPWAN). It can be applied to IoT for agriculture due to its long range and low power capabilities. LoRa network performance is highly affected by physical layer parameters and the environment. While LPWANs have been around for a number of years, they are still considered an emerging technology and have had few scientific studies performed. Currently, most studies have shown LoRa communication capabilities in urban, mountainous, and maritime areas, with little focus on agriculture use cases. Tree farming is a long-term investment, requiring careful monitoring to mitigate loss; therefore, this paper provides an analysis about the impact of variant physical layer parameters on performance of LoRa networks in a tree farm. Overall, the LoRa communication range was smaller than the theoretically expected range. Some PHY factors, spreading factor and coding rate, showed a clear impact on LoRa performance. Actual data reliability was inconsistent at varying distances and PHY configurations, unlike the consistency found in the RSSI reported by the radios. Additional experiments show the Fresnel Zone still affects LoRa networks. All experiments were performed in an Indiana rural tree plantation in the United States. Each node was set differently by modulating spreading factor, bandwidth and coding rate using 915MHz and 13 dBm transmit power at variant distance.

Introduction There is obvious benefit to agricultural IoT. Data collected from wirelessly connected sensors and agricultural equipment can ease the difficulty of monitoring farmland and livestock, and assist farmers' decision making. To apply IoT technology in an agricultural environment, one must consider how these devices are connected. The network system for agricultural IoT has to cover a wide area of farmland without relying on costly cellular networks. A low-power wide area network (LPWAN) is a well-suited solution for this purpose. LPWAN is a type of wireless network designed to allow long range communications at a low bit-rate. End devices can communicate with base stations from longer distances than other wireless network systems while consuming very less energy. Some LPWANs available include Sigfox, Weightless-N, NB-IoT and LoRa. Each network has its advantages and disadvantages. Though it is a fairly new technology, LoRa has attracted a lot of attention, especially in terms of low costs and excellent battery performance. LoRa's modulation developed traditional spread-spectrum communications more robust by generating chirp signal that changes frequency continuously [14]. Much of the research on LoRa is relevant to its potential for covering large areas. Unfortunately, most of the studies have been conducted in open or urban environments with only a few were related to agriculture [5], [7]. To provide consistent and efficient management of large farmlands, measurements need to be taken of LoRa network potential for those areas. Especially in a tree farm, it takes at least 6 years and up to several decades to harvest timber. Even minor failures can result in wasting long-term efforts and large investments. Therefore, to verify its potential for agriculture, we focused on experimenting changes in LoRa network performance, range, reliability, and RSSI, according to different physical layer parameters and how each affects it. In addition, by examining traditional Fresnel zone limitations, the LoRa performance affected could be measured. SECTION II. Background LPWANs supplements short range wireless networks such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth with their large-scale coverage at decent cost. Instead of narrowing bandwidth to increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) like other LPWANs, LoRa uses a special chirp spread spectrum modulation to cover large areas. Below are some details of LoRaWAn and physical factors consisting of LoRaWAn physical layer. A. LORAWAN LoRa is a chirp spread spectrum modulation scheme using wideband linear frequency which improves receiver sensitivity and tolerance to miscommunication between receiver and transmitter [9]. LoRaWAn technology mainly uses star network topology. The gateways receive messages from multiple end-devices and end-devices are connected to one or more gateways. End-devices can transmit data to gateways with own time interval and data rate complying rules. These base stations are connected to other network servers via standard IP connections [4]. The base station and end-devices can communicate bidirectionally with good coverage. LoRaWAn networks have three classes based on basic features and additional features. Class A end-devices (basic LoRaWan) provide bi-directional communications. Those communications consume the lowest power. Their downlink communication occurs from the server following uplink transmission. Class B additionally provides a scheduled receive slot trough opening extra receive windows. The servers know if end-devices are listening. Class C provides bi-directional communication with maximal receive slots for minimum latency [9]. LoRa Technology has some key features. LoRa has scalability in bandwidth. Additionally, LoRa can be used with both narrowband and wideband service with a few configuration changes. LoRa has great reliability as it resists the Doppler Effect, multipath, fading mechanisms, and other interference mechanisms [14]. Its protocol is designed specifically for low power consumption extending battery lifetime up to 20 years. A single base station can penetrate into dense urban/indoor regions, and can connect rural areas up to 30 miles away. The last feature is low cost. LoRa reduces costs in three ways: infrastructure investment, operating expenses and end-node sensors. LoRa uses license-free sub Gigahertz radio frequency bands like 169 MHz, 433 MHz, 868 MHz (Europe) and 915 MHz (North America). Since LoRa uses license-free frequency bands, network costs can be minimized [11]. B. PHY Factors PHY factors underlie all of three classes of LoRaWan. The configuration of LoRa can be tuned by controlling physical layer (PHY) settings, which results in performance changes. In this research, physical settings include spreading factor(SF), bandwidth(BW), and error correction rate(CR). 1) Spreading factor (SF) The basic premise of spread spectrum is that each bit of information is encoded as multiple chips. Spreading factor(SF) is the relationship between the bit and chip [9]. A higher SF increases the Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR), and thus sensitivity and range, but also increases the air time of the packet [4]. Available SF's are from 6 to 12 which change LoRaWAn data rates from 0.3 kbps to 27 kbps. 2) Bandwidth (BW) Bandwidth (BW) is the range of frequencies in the transmission band. LoRa can have 125 to 500 KHz of bandwidth, typically set to 125, 250, or 500KHz. Changing BW can influence message time on air which results in inverse influence on radio sensitivity. Larger BW gives a higher data rate (thus shorter time on air), but a lower sensitivity (due to integration of additional noise). A smaller BW gives a higher sensitivity, but a lower data rate. 3) Coding Rate (CR) Coding Rate(CR) is a form of Forward Error Correction (FEC) that permits the recovery of bits of information due to corruption by interference. This requires a small overhead of additional encoding of the data in the transmitted packet [9]. CR can range from 4/5 to 4/8. A larger CR offers more reliability by improving resilience to corrupted bits, but increases time on air and energy consumption [4]. 4) Transmission Power LoRa transmission power ranges from −4 to 20 dBm. Higher transmission power causes an increase in energy consumption and signal-to-noise ratio. C. Fresnel Zone The concept of Fresnel zone clearance is used to account for interference by obstacles within the beam width of a radio signal. The first zone must be kept largely free from obstructions to avoid interfering with the radio reception. However, some obstruction of the Fresnel zones can often be tolerated. As a rule of thumb the maximum obstruction allowable is 40%, but the recommended obstruction is 20% or less [8]. SECTION III. Related Work Before LPWAN became a popular network infrastructure for agricultural IoT, mesh topology networks using smaller range network devices such as Zigbee dominated wireless sensor networks (WSN). However, this kind of implementation had a serious problem with limited link budget due to high data rates and a low link budget [15]. In contrast, LPWAN, using a star network topology, has a distinct advantage with longer range and battery life. There has been a significant amount of research on outdoor LoRa coverage and performance. Most were performed in urban and maritime environments. Urban experiments showed more than half of packets were successfully delivered from 5-10km range [1], and a maximum 80% of packet delivery at a distance of 2800 meters [11]. In maritime applications, performance of 15-30km distance was observed. However, unlike the prior mentioned research other research showed only a few hundred meter LoRa network coverage [5], [7]. Also, from these experiments LoRa showed distinct performance differences within various environments such as indoor, outdoor, underground or with large amounts of vegetation. Even meteorological conditions such as temperature and humidity affect network performance [11], and their impact on LoRa performance was observed in [5]. Research also showed variant hardware physical settings can have a great influence on LoRa network performance. With increasing spreading factor LoRa had longer range with higher reliability [11]. According to [7], BW was the largest factor in communication success. However, research by Cattani et al. [5] showed that spreading factor, coding rate and then bandwidth was the order that had the most effect on network reliability. It is important the transmitter and receiver use the same spreading factor and bandwidth combination for successful packet delivery [13], which means that to experiment on various PHY settings, each device has to have the same settings. LoRa radios with different coding rates can still communicate [5]. Although prior research showed expected performance of LoRa network in many areas, little work has been done on agricultural environments to evaluate LoRa performance. Since LoRa is an appropriate technology to apply in this environment, this paper focused on how PHY settings affect reliability and coverage on an actual tree farm. Vegetation can also be an obstacle to network performance, so it is expected that LoRa will have lower performance than in other previously researched environments. SECTION IV. Experiments Method and Results A. Hardware Setup We used the LoRa IoT Development Kit from ‘Dragino’ which is a company in China offering LoRa shield based on Semtech SX1276 chip as can be seen in Figure 1. It also offers the ‘LG01-P’ LoRa Gateway which is an open source single channel LoRa Gateway. The kit offers two portable devices equipped with an SX1276 radio module that works in the 915 MHz band, and a 1/2 wave omni-directional antenna. To find temperature and humidity data, a DHT11 sensor package was used; this is a composite sensor that contains a calibrated digital signal output to measure temperature and humidity. Fig. 1. Dragino IoT kit [6] Show All B. Experimental Setup 1) Sites Our experiments were performed three times at the same tree farm. The farm is located at 13455 S 525 W, Romney, IN 47981, USA. It is primarily a flat meadow, with small hills in the middle of the property. Mid-life maple, oak, and pine trees are planted in 8-foot separate rows on the property. 2) PHY Settings and Data Packet Table I Arduino node ID according to PHY settings The experiment was carried out by assigning an Arduino ID according to each PHY Setting. Table 1 shows these variant settings. Each three components of Arduino ID is spreading factor, bandwidth and coding rate. SF can be set from 6 to 12. The SF is set to 7 (default), 9, and 11. The CR is set to a minimum value of 5 and a maximum value of 8. BW is set to 125kHz, aside from 7-250-5 and 7-250-8. Only SF7 can be set to the maximum setting of 250kHz, so SF7 was set in two cases of 125kHz and 250kHz. The value of TX power was fixed at 13(default). To account for the 60% clear 1st Fresnel Zone at 200m, the devices and antennas were fixed 2.5m above the ground. In accordance with necessary settings, 4 gateways were used to match both the LoRaWAn spreading factor and bandwidth. However, prior research showed LoRa shields with different coding rates can communicate with the same gateway. Therefore, both settings using same spreading factor and bandwidth but a different coding rate, sent data packets to one gateway. Table 2 Data packet composition The data structures of the payload used in transmitted data packets is character type and were 9 bytes in size. The first three bytes make it possible to distinguish which device is sending data. We sent data at 3 second intervals with a 0.5 second of delay between sensing. Each time, a gateway collected 150 data packets at once. The transceivers were set to not to retransmit lost data and thus accurately checked packet delivery rate. If the data packet wasn't correct, this was considered a data loss and skipped. The next data packet was then examined. Every end-device was tested at 100m, 150m, and 200m. The first experiment was conducted on a day with a temperature of 25°C, and humidity of 80%. The second day had a temperature 24°C, humidity of 62%. The third experiment was done with a temperature of 27°C, and humidity of 70%. Shields were put in a box to minimize meteorological factors affecting experiment results. Every experiment was carried out for about three hours. Additionally, all the experiments were performed at a height of 2.5m, considering Fresnel zone of LoRa network frequency and overall tree farm area. The result data was found through the average of the experiment results. Fig. 2. Experiment site (tree farm land). Star shows the position of AP and each flag shows the position of lora shields. Show All In addition, Fresnel zone tests were not done with different settings. LoRa Shield's PHY setting conditions are set to default values. SF was set to 7, BW was set to 125, and CR was set to 5. The experiment was conducted under the same conditions with the change of height only at Om, 1m, 2m, and 3m at 200m. One hundred packets were used to determine tendency of performance improvement accordance with height. C. Metrics Upon this experiment's completion, researchers calculated reliability and received signal strength indication (RSSI). The RSSI was used to analyze data of different settings at different distances. Reliability was calculated as the ratio of valid received packets to the number of packets transmitted to the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). The PDR provided information about the communication reliability [7]. RSSI is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal [10]. PDR= D T (1) View Source D: Packets delivered successfully T: Total packets transmitted D. Experiment Results 1) Experiments with Different Phy Settings Table 3 Results of each setting at different distance Through Table 3 one can see that all settings but 7-125-5 and 7-250-5 showed more than 90% reliability at 150m. Only 9-125-8 and 11-125-8 showed good reliability at 200m. Compared to related research, distances measured were much smaller than expected, and at least setting spreading factor to 9 and coding rate to 8 ensures 200m communication range with good reliability. As expected, PHY settings followed predictions. In most cases, settings with increased spreading factor and coding rate showed higher reliability at larger distances. Spreading factor clearly affected the readings. With higher spreading factor, LoRa communicated with higher reliability at larger distance. However, by combining spreading factor, PDR didn't appear to linearly increase. Coding rate was impacted when the distance grew further away. With a smaller distance and reliable PDR (higher than 90%), changing coding rate increased PDR. Bandwidth had lowest impact on LoRa performance. As shown from bandwidth 125 KHz (7-125-5 and 7-125-8) and 250 KHz (7-250-5 and 7-250-8) it was impossible to discover relation from configuring bandwidth. However, as seen in Figure 3, higher bandwidth impacted on RSSI as augmenting bandwidth has a negative connection between data rates and receiver sensitivity. Fig. 3. Average RSSI(dbm) according to distance(m). RSSI values are averaged by three experiments. Show All As Figure 4 shows, RSSI consistently decreased in every setting as distance grew further, unlike PDR. Even when PDR had erratic increase from 100m to 150m at spreading factor 7, RSSI showed a decrease. However, an obvious relation was not determined between RSSI and spreading factor. This correlates with other research [12]. Unlike Semtech's claims, RSSI seems to be affected by distance, not spreading factor. 2) Fresnel Zone Experiment Fig. 5. PDR according to antenna height Show All Table 4 Results of fresnel zone experiment Using Figure 5 as reference, height impacted LoRa network. Performance in reliability surges along with antenna height from 0m to 2m. Considering that the Fresnel zone experiment only received 100 packets, the PDR data is different from the PHY setting experiment results. This shows the tendency of LoRa performance improvement with higher antenna placement. However, this experiment alone does not reveal the difference between 2m and 3m. Thus, it cannot be verified if the height increase beyond the Fresnel Zone ensures better communication. Further study needs to be done for clear explanation. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper provides a basis on deploying LoRa within a tree farm. To complement research on applying LoRa to agricultural IoT, this research has shown how PHY factors configurations and different distances impact reliability of LoRa on tree farm. Overall, LoRa communication range in tree farm is below expected values as specified commercially and in research. However, to secure high reliability in large distances, maintaining high spreading factor and coding rate is important. Spreading factor and coding rate affected LoRa performance in an expected way, but bandwidth did not conspicuously changed performance. RSSI showed a consistent pattern from different PHY factors configurations. Unlike inconsistent PDR changes in different PHY configurations and distances, RSSI decreased along with distances in every configuration. However, we cannot determine what effect, if any, the tree plantation had on LoRa network communication. In addition, this experiment not determine what effect complying with the calculated Fresnel Zone had on LoRa communication in regards to antenna height and distance between nodes. In the next paper, we plan to compare LoRa performance in open area and tree farm with the same PHY configurations to measure how the tree plantation affect the network performance. In future work, we will study other factors influencing LoRa performance such as antenna height and environmental factors.

  Extract 1: The TSEB model is a physically-based model that is used to estimate land surface fluxes. It is a two-source model, which means that it takes into account the different temperatures of the vegetation and soil surfaces.

  Explanation: The Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model splits the directional radiometric land surface temperature into temperatures of vegetation and soil while estimating the net radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes of vegetation and soil separately before combining them to obtain the bulk surface fluxes. The model was modified and run at two different spatial resolutions, one using a coarse thermal sensor and high resolution optical sensor (Landsat) at 30 m resolution and the other using higher resolution thermal and optical sensors (MODIS and Sentinel-2) at 10–20 m resolution. This was done in order to investigate the effect of environmental factors, such as weather conditions and physical obstacles, on wireless data transmission. The high-resolution output from both runs were then compared to see how the model captures temporal and spatial patterns of fluxes.

Abstract The Sentinel satellite missions are designed to provide remote-sensing observational capability to many diverse operational applications, including in the field of agriculture and food security. They do this by acquiring frequent observations from a combination of optical, thermal and microwave sensors at various spatial resolutions. However, one currently missing capability, that would enable monitoring of evapotranspiration, crop water stress and water use at field scale, is the lack of high-resolution (tens of meters) thermal sensor. In this study we evaluate a methodology for bridging this data gap by employing a machine learning algorithm to sharpen low-resolution thermal observations from the Sentinel-3 satellites using images acquired by high-resolution optical sensors on the Sentinel-2 satellites. The resulting dataset is then used as input to land-surface energy balance model to estimate evapotranspiration. The methodology is tested using Terra and Landsat satellite observations, due to lack of sufficiently long time-series of Sentinel observations, and benchmarked against fluxes derived with high-resolution thermal observations acquired by the Landsat satellites. We then apply the methodology to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images to confirm its applicability to this type of data. The results show that the fluxes derived with sharpened thermal data are of acceptable accuracy (relative error lower than 20%) and provide more information at flux-tower footprint scale than the corresponding low-resolution fluxes. They also replicate the spatial and temporal patterns of fluxes derived with high-resolution thermal observations. However, the increase in error of the modelled fluxes compared to using high-resolution thermal observations and the inherent limitations of the sharpening approach point to the need to add high-resolution thermal mission to the Sentinels' constellation.

Introduction The Sentinel satellite missions are opening an operational era for the use of remote sensing observations in many domains, due to their range of spatial and spectral resolutions, frequent revisit times and long term guarantee of data continuity (Donlon et al., 2012, Drusch et al., 2012, Torres et al., 2012). Among those domains are agriculture and food security, for which Sentinel data has been used to operationally create dynamic cropland masks (Valero et al., 2016), perform crop type mapping (Inglada et al., 2015), monitor rice production (Torbick et al., 2017) or estimate plant parameters such as leaf area index (Campos-Taberner et al., 2017, Clevers et al., 2017), all at field-scale spatial resolution ( 10–20 m). Estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) derived from satellite based observations are also of high interest in agriculture and food security domains as well as in other applications such as water resource management (Anderson et al., 2012). To be of most use, the ET maps should have a spatial resolution on the order of spatial scale of the predominant landscape feature (Guzinski et al., 2014, Kustas et al., 2004), which in terms of agriculture is a field that often ranges from hundreds (10 m by 10 m) to thousands (100 m by 100 m) of meters square (Lowder et al., 2016). At the same time, to reliably estimate the actual ET and crop water stress it is preferable to utilise satellite observations both in visible/near-infrared (VISNIR) and thermal-infrared (TIR) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (Anderson et al., 2012, Hoffmann et al., 2016a). However, the Sentinel satellite constellation contains only one TIR sensor (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer - SLSTR) with a spatial resolution of 1000 m at nadir (on board of the Sentinel-3 satellite), while having multiple sensors with VISNIR observations capability ranging from a spatial resolution of 10 m to 1000 m (on board of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 satellites). Even though recent studies have been highlighting the importance of high-resolution TIR observations for ET estimation (Fisher et al., 2017, Sobrino et al., 2016a) and a number of satellite mission concepts are (or have been) proposed (Crebassol et al., 2014, Jul, Lagouarde et al., 2013, Lee et al., 2015) or even launched (Hulley et al., 2017), a high-resolution TIR satellite mission which could act as a companion to the high-resolution VISNIR Sentinel-2 satellites is not expected to be launched within the closest number of years. Therefore, a method is required to bridge the spatial gap between the currently available Sentinel constellation's TIR and VISNIR observational capabilities in order to optimally exploit the synergies of both types of sensors for field-scale ET estimations. A number of techniques have been developed for sharpening lower spatial resolution TIR observations with higher spatial resolution VISNIR observations (Chen et al., 2014, Bindhu et al., 2013, Bisquert et al., 2016, Gao et al., 2012). Most of those techniques consist of two general steps. In the first step, a relationship is derived between the TIR data and high-resolution VISNIR data aggregated to the resolution of the TIR data. In the second step, this relationship is applied to high-resolution VISNIR data to obtain TIR observations at the same high resolution. A post-processing step is sometimes also included which, for example, removes the bias between TIR datasets at the two resolutions. This sharpened TIR data can then be used in land-surface energy flux models to estimate high-resolution ET. Similarly, a number of techniques have been developed for disaggregating low-resolution land surface energy fluxes to higher spatial resolutions (Guzinski et al., 2014, Norman et al., 2003). Those techniques rely on the higher spatial resolution TIR data (for example coming from the Landsat series of satellites), which are assumed to have lower accuracy than the coarser resolution TIR data. Furthermore, it should be also possible to sharpen the estimated low-resolution land surface fluxes using purely high-resolution VISNIR data following the same approach as for sharpening low-resolution TIR data. Both of those approaches (i.e. sharpening low-resolution TIR data using high-resolution VISNIR data and using the sharpened output to estimate high-resolution ET; and directly sharpening estimated ET using high-resolution VISNIR data) are applicable to the Sentinel-2 (S2) –Sentinel-3(S3) satellite constellation. In this study we evaluate a number of combinations of the sharpening and disaggregation approaches for their ability to produce high-resolution ET maps in a river catchment in western Denmark. The evaluation includes the validation of the fluxes against two flux towers located in the catchment (one in an agricultural site and the other in a coniferous plantation forest) as well as comparison of spatial and temporal patterns of high-resolution ET produced by the different techniques. Due to the lack of sufficient number of Sentinel-3 images, we use Terra and Aqua (MODIS sensor) satellite data as a proxy for Sentinel-3 and Landsat data as a proxy for Sentinel-2. Even though the spectral bands of the sensors on board those pairs satellite are not exactly the same, the spatial resolutions are similar (≈1000 m for Terra/Aqua and S3 TIR data, and 30 m for Landsat VISNIR data compared to 10–20 m for S2 VISNIR data) and thus the study provides guidance on the optimal approach for deriving high-resolution ET with Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 observations. 2. Methods 2.1. Data sharpening scheme The data sharpening method used in this study is based on Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) introduced by Gao et al. (2012). In the current study it was implemented as an open-source Python application, which is freely available online (https://github.com/radosuav/pyDMS, last accessed: 01/06-2017). The DMS is a machine-learning algorithm that derives a statistical relationship between the predictor high-resolution variables aggregated to low-resolution data pixels and the low-resolution variables that need to be sharpened. It then applies this relationship to the high-resolution data to derive high-resolution representation of the low-resolution data. The current DMS implementation is based on an ensemble of decision-tree regressors, with each decision-tree trained with a random subset of the training samples drawn with replacement in a method known as Bagging (Breiman, 1996). The final value of the regression is an average of the values produced within the ensemble. The training sample is composed of the fine resolution data which passes a homogeneity threshold when aggregated to the coarser resolution (i.e. the coefficient of variation of high-resolution pixels falling within a low-resolution pixel must be below a certain threshold). All samples falling within a single regression tree leaf node are further fitted with a multivariate linear model. Therefore, once the DMS is trained an output value for a given input is determined by locating a regression tree leaf to which the input belongs and running the corresponding linear model, for an ensemble of regression trees. The ensemble decision tree regression is performed both locally (in a moving-window fashion) and globally (i.e. to the whole study area shown in Fig. 1). The results are then combined based on residuals between the regression outputs and the low-resolution training data (Gao et al., 2012). Also residual analysis and bias correction between regression outputs and low-resolution data is applied at the end of the sharpening process to ensure consistency (i.e. conservation of emitted longwave energy in case of thermal data) between the sharpened high-resolution pixels and their corresponding low-resolution pixel.

Land surface fluxes' modelling scheme The land surface fluxes' modelling scheme is based on the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) modelling scheme proposed by Norman et al. (1995) and further evolved in Kustas and Norman (1999). Briefly, the model splits the directional radiometric land surface temperature into its two main components: the temperatures of vegetation and soil. Based on this, net radiation and latent and sensible heat fluxes of vegetation and soil are estimated separately, before being combined to obtain the bulk surface fluxes. The transfer of heat between the two components and the atmosphere is modulated by “resistances” (in analogy to electrical systems) which depend on aerodynamic and meteorological conditions. Those resistances can be in parallel or series configuration, and in this study the latter one was used since it better accounts for the interaction between turbulent fluxes originating from the two components (Li et al., 2005, Morillas et al., 2013). In addition, the ground heat flux of the soil is estimated following the method of Santanello and Friedl (2003). At both the component and bulk levels the model enforces the principle of conservation of energy. For more implementation details the reader is referred to the full source code of the Python implementation of the model used in this study which available online (https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB/releases/tag/v1.4, last accessed 21.10.2018) and the referenced publications. 2.3. Flux disaggregation scheme The flux disaggregation scheme is described in Guzinski et al. (2014) and is based on the assumption of evaporative fraction (EF - fraction of total available energy used for latent heat flux) remaining stable during the late-morning and early-afternoon hours under cloud-free conditions. The EF is estimated independently from TSEB fluxes derived using the low-resolution and high-resolution data. The high-resolution EF is then aggregated to the lower resolution and compared against the low-resolution EF. If the fine-resolution EF is higher (lower) than coarse-resolution EF in a given coarse-resolution pixel then the air temperature at blending height of that pixel is decreased (increased), in order to decrease (increase) the latent heat flux and the fine-resolution fluxes are recalculated. This is done under the assumption that the coarse-resolution temperature data produces more accurate flux estimates and therefore the high-resolution fluxes have to be adjusted to match the low-resolution ones (a valid expectation in case of Landsat and MODIS thermal sensors as well as in the case of sharpened thermal images). 2.4. Evaluated model configurations In this study we compare the high-resolution ( 30 m) flux estimates derived in three different ways: using Landsat LST in TSEB together with the disaggregation scheme and low-resolution fluxes derived with MODIS LST (disTSEBL); using DMS sharpened MODIS LST directly in TSEB (TSEBM,DMS); and finally using DMS sharpened MODIS LST in TSEB together with the disaggregation scheme (disTSEBM,DMS). The first model configuration is used as benchmarks for the latter two. In addition TSEB was also run with low-resolution MODIS data (TSEBM) to allow evaluation of the benefit (or lack thereof) of deriving the fluxes at higher resolution. All those model runs were repeated twice: once with tower-based meteorological inputs (optimal case) and once with modelled meteorological inputs (typical case for regional applications). The two meteorological datasets are described in Section 3. Finally, the application of DMS to low-resolution fluxes (instead of low-resolution LST) was also tested (TSEB-DMSM) but only when modelled meteorological data was used, since regional scale flux estimates are needed for training the DMS. 3. Data 3.1. Study sites and tower-based measurements The study area is located in the Skjern river catchment on the western side of Denmark's Jutland peninsula (Fig. 1). It is a heavily agricultural area consisting mostly of fields of winter and summer barley, potatoes and plantation forest. Even though it experiences a mild maritime climate with an average temperature of 8 °C and average annual rainfall of 850 mm, irrigation of the crops is still required due to the predominantly sandy nature of the soil (Ringgaard et al., 2011). The Skjern catchment is the location of the Danish Hydrological ObsErvatory (HOBE) which maintains three eddy-covariance (EC) flux towers within the area (Jensen and Illangasekare, 2011). The measurements from two of those towers, one located in a barley field near the town of Voulund (referred to as VOU tower) and the other in a conifer plantation forest with an average tree height of 20 m close to the town of Gludsted (referred to as GLU tower), are used in the current study. The area around the VOU tower is heterogeneous at 1 km scale, with multiple fields as well as shrubs and forests falling within a 1 km radius. The GLU tower, on the other hand, is surrounded by the plantation forest for at least 1 km in each direction but becomes heterogeneous upon closer inspection with different tree stands, clearings and forest roads visible at higher resolutions. The VOU tower has the EC system located at 6 m height above ground level (agl) and an air temperature and humidity sensor located at a height of 4 m agl. At the GLU tower the EC system is at a height of 38 m agl and air temperature and humidity were measured at a height of 30 m agl. Both towers also have sensors for measuring four components of net radiation (incoming/outgoing and shortwave/longwave) as well as heat plates in the vicinity of the towers for the measurement of ground heat flux. More detailed description of the towers' location and set-up can be found in Ringgaard et al. (2011), while the pre-processing applied to tower measurements is described in Guzinski et al. (2014). Meteorological measurements from the flux towers (air temperature and humidity, wind speed, and incoming solar radiation) were used as inputs to the TSEB model for the local-scale model runs. The fluxes measured by the towers (sensible heat, latent heat, ground heat and net radiation) were used to validate the TSEB model outputs. The energy balance closure at both towers was enforced by assigning the residual energy to the latent heat flux, as was done in previous studies utilising the same data (Guzinski et al., 2013, Guzinski et al., 2014, Hoffmann et al., 2016b). Flux tower footprint were estimated as described in Guzinski et al. (2014). 3.2. Satellite data The low-resolution (≈1000 m) data originates from the MODIS sensor on board the Terra and Aqua satellites. Four products from Collection 6 were used: MOD11A1 - instantaneous land surface temperature and emissivity (LST), at daily timestep (Wan, 2014); MCD15AH2 - 8 day leaf area index (LAI) composite (Yan et al., 2016); MCD43A3 - 16 day albedo composite; MOD13A2 - 16 day vegetation indices composite. The products that are provided with 500 m resolution (MCD15AH2 and MCD43A3) were resampled to 1000 m using pixel averaging. The albedo used in the models was derived from MCD43A3 white and black sky albedos with an assumption that in clear-sky atmosphere 80% of the light is direct and 20% diffuse. This was then further split into canopy and soil components using fraction of vegetation cover (see below) and the assumption that in the visible part of the spectrum albedo of soil is twice that of vegetation and in the near-infrared albedo of soil is 70% of that of vegetation. This assumption is based on standard spectral profiles of soil and vegetation (Baldridge et al., 2009) and while it might have an effect on the component fluxes originating from soil and vegetation, its impact on the bulk fluxes should be minimal, especially for moderate to dense canopies (e.g. LAI > 1). Emissivity was similarly split into soil and vegetation components by assigning vegetation the value of 0.995 and estimating the soil emissivity using fraction of vegetation cover and emissivity from MOD11A1 product. While MCD15AH2 and MCD43A3 products are derived from observations taken by both Terra and Aqua satellites, it was decided to use only Terra observations for the instantaneous land surface temperature model inputs since the overpass time of Terra is closer to that of Sentinel-3. The high-resolution (30 m) data came from the sensors on board Landsat 5, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellites. The atmospheric correction of both thermal and shortwave images was performed as described in Guzinski et al. (2014). Vegetation indices were calculated directly from the top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectances while Landsat LST was derived as described in Guzinski et al. (2014). It should be noted that while thermal data is acquired by the Landsat satellites at a resolution ranging from 60 m to 120 m (depending on the satellite), it is resampled to 30 m using cubic convolution before distribution to the users and therefore in this study was assumed to have a resolution of 30 m. High resolution LAI and albedo were derived by running the DMS (see Section 2.1) with TOC VISNIR Landsat reflectances and MCD15AH2 and MCD43A3 MODIS products respectively. The DMS and TOC VISNIR Landsat reflectances were also used to sharpen the MOD11A1 MODIS LST products to be used as a replacement of Landsat LST, as well as to sharpen flux outputs of the low-resolution TSEB model runs. In all cases the moving-window size for local regression was set to 30 by 30 MODIS pixels and the homogeneity threshold for both local and global regressions was set automatically to select the 80% most homogeneous pixels from the aggregated fine-resolution image. The linear regression extrapolation was limited to 25% of the range of the training samples falling within the corresponding regression tree leaf node (see Section 2.1). The DMS was applied on a scene-by-scene basis, meaning that the Landsat scenes were not combined into a larger multi-temporal training data set but each Landsat scene was used individually to sharpen MODIS product or TSEB output corresponding to the scene acquisition date. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were used to derive fraction of vegetation that is green and actively transpiring (fg). In most land cover classes (see Section 3.3 below) fg was estimated as following the approach of Guzinski et al. (2013). The only exception was in croplands where fg = EV I during crop senescence (set as between day-of-year 160 and 230) and fg = 1 during other periods, in order to avoid issues present in this land cover class detailed in Guzinski et al. (2013). MODIS LAI (both original resolution and sharpened) was assumed to represent green LAI and hence was divided by fg to obtain Plant Area Index (PAI) which was then used as input into for modelling intercepted radiation and wind attenuation processes. NDVI was also used to estimate fractional vegetation cover (fC) as where NDVIS is the vegetation of bare soil and assigned a value of 0.15 and NDVIV is NDVI of full vegetation cover and assigned a value of 0.9 (Gutman and Ignatov, 1998). 3.3. Ancillary data Apart from the data coming from satellite observations, the TSEB model requires two other spatially distributed datasets. The first one is a land-cover map which, together with a look-up table, is used to assign input surface parameters that cannot be directly retrieved from satellite observations, e.g. vegetation height or average leaf size. In this study the land-cover map was based on Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2012 version 18.5, downloaded from the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (http://land.copernicus.eu, last accessed 21.08.2017). The map was reclassified from Corine classes to those shown in Fig. 1 and resampled from the original 100 m resolution to either 30 m resolution (using nearest neighbour approach) for the high-resolution model runs or to 930 m resolution (using mode approach) for the low-resolution runs. Afterwards both maps were used to assign input parameters based on Table 1. Vegetation height (hC) has the largest influence on the modelled fluxes from all the parameters listed in Table 1. Therefore in land cover classes where it changes throughout the growing season (grasslands and croplands) it was scaled with PAI using power law, with maximum value indicated in Table 1 reached when PAI was 5 in croplands and 4 in grasslands and a minimum value set to 10% of the maximum value.

Three ERA-Interim products were used: the 2 m air temperature (2T), 2 m dew point temperature (2D) used to calculate the vapour pressure, and the 10 m horizontal wind speed (10U and 10V). Although the 2T product nominally represents the air temperature at 2 m height, in this study it was assumed to represent regional-scale blending-height air temperature (due to low spatial resolution and smoothness of the product) and therefore was placed at 100 m agl. To compensate for the height difference the 2T air temperature was reduced by 1 K, in accordance with dry adiabatic lapse rate, before being used as input to the models. The wind field was assumed to be at 10 m above the canopy. The meteorological data are provided at a 0.75° spatial resolution and were subset and resampled for the high and low-resolution model runs. In the temporal domain the data were linearly interpolated between the 3-hourly ERA-Interim time steps. The only meteorological dataset which came from field-based observations instead of the reanalysis dataset was the incoming shortwave radiation, based on the assumption that clear-sky shortwave radiation is uniform at regional scale and on the findings of Guzinski et al. (2014). 4. Results In this section we validate the high-resolution modelled fluxes against flux tower measurements at the VOU and GLU sties. In addition we evaluate the differences between the fluxes modelled with Landsat LST and sharpened LST in the spatial and temporal domains. This analysis focuses on the agricultural site since this is where high-resolution observations provide the most utility. Finally, we apply the proposed methodology to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data and compare with fluxes obtained using Landsat-8 LST at regional scale. 4.1. Voulund agricultural area Table 2 summarizes the performance of the TSEB algorithm when run at Landsat resolution using tower-based meteorological inputs, with the scatterplot of modelled versus measured fluxes shown in Fig. 2. Similarly, Table 3 and in Fig. 3 show the results when tower-based meteorological measurements are replaced by ERA-Interim fields. Concurrent cloud-free observations by Landsat and Terra satellites over the VOU site were present on 19 dates during the study period. However, due to issues with tower-based flux measurements, the modelled H, LE, Rn and G could be compared to measurements on 19, 15, 16 and 18 dates respectively. Table 2.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) The results at the agricultural site indicate that although the fluxes derived with sharpened MODIS LST do not provide the same accuracy as fluxes derived with Landsat LST (especially in case of sensible heat flux), they still provide an improvement compared to MODIS coarse scale fluxes, in particular if the disaggregation approach is being used. The RMSE of H decreases by 12 to 14 W/m2(around 20%) and correlation increases by 0.03 to 0.05 between the TSEBM and disTSEBM,DMS runs, depending on which meteorological inputs were used. A smaller decrease in RMSE (6 to 9 /m2) and larger increase in correlation (0.13) is also present between those two runs in case of LE. This implies that by sharpening the coarse LST with finer resolution optical data it is possible, to a certain degree, to separate the fluxes originating from within the flux tower footprint from the fluxes falling outside of it. Sharpened coarse-resolution modelled fluxes (configuration TSEB-DMSM) are also closer to the tower measurements compared to the original resolution coarse fluxes but the improvements are not as large as when sharpened model inputs are used. The ground heat flux modelled at high spatial resolution has lower correlation compared to the low resolution G, regardless of the model configuration used. This might indicate inaccurate estimation of net radiation of the soil at higher spatial resolution but due to the small magnitude of G it should not significantly impact the other fluxes. It is also worth noting that at the VOU site there is an increase in modelled H error when switching from Landsat LST to sharpened LST, while there is a slight decrease in error when switching from tower-based meteorological inputs to ERA-Interim dataset. For example, the decrease in RMSE of H for the disTSEBM,DMS runs driven by the two types of meteorological inputs is 3 W/m2(correlation decreases from 0.76 to 0.73) while the increase in RMSE between disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS is 15 to 18 W/m2(correlation decreases by 0.16). In case of latent heat flux the situation is somewhat different, with RMSE increasing by 16 W/m2 and correlation decreasing by 0.14 when tower-based data is replaced by ERA-Interim for the disTSEBL run, while the RMSE of LE increases by 2 W/m2 between the disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS runs when using tower-based dataset and decreases by 3 W/m2 when using ERA-Interim datasets. 4.2.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) At the GLU site there is a strong and consistent underestimation of Rn (bias ranging from −24 W/m2 to −51 W/m2) despite very strong correlation (r always above 0.97) for all model runs. Based on this high correlation, the underestimation can probably be attributed to consistent overestimation in the parameterization of reflectance (albedo) and/or transmittance of the short-wave radiation by canopy or soil. This bias seems to mostly transfer to the estimates of H in case of tower-based meteorological inputs and estimates of LE in case of ERA-Interim inputs. In addition the estimation of G has very low correlation, but due to low G values under the forest canopy that should not have a significant impact on the accuracy of other modelled fluxes. At the forest site, the RMSE of H and LE from the TSEBM run is lower than that of disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS runs with both types of meteorological inputs, with the exception of high-resolution H estimated with ERA-Interim dataset which has lower error than the low-resolution H. This could be because the forest site is homogeneous at low spatial resolution while becoming heterogeneous at higher resolutions, which is directly opposite of the agricultural site. In addition, forest canopy is more complex than that of crops, with possibility of within-canopy heat storage or different wind attenuation compared to a vertically homogeneous canopy (Massman et al., 2017). Those factors could be more influential when modelled at higher spatial resolutions. This, together with large shifts in bias between H and LE when using the two types of meteorological inputs, make it hard to come to any firm conclusions with respect to the applicability of the sharpened LST in forested land covers. However, similarly to the situation at VOU, disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS provide the most accurate high-resolution flux estimates. 4.3. Spatial pattern comparison In the above sections the fluxes modelled by different configurations of model inputs and approaches were evaluated against measurements from two flux towers. Even though tower footprints were taken into account, those evaluations can be essentially considered to be performed at a single point. However, it is also important to evaluate how similar or different are the fluxes produced by the different model runs in a spatial context. In particular, we focus on fluxes produced by the disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS model runs driven by tower-based meteorological observations (see Table 2 and Fig. 2) in the area surrounding the VOU flux tower. Since disTSEBL uses LST derived from actual thermal observation it is considered as the reference dataset. disTSEBL models fluxes at the time of Landsat overpass while disTSEBM,DMS at the time of MODIS overpass and therefore a direct comparison of the fluxes is not possible. Instead evaporative fraction is used, under the assumption that it remains constant during the morning hours in cloud free conditions. Fig. 6 shows a visual comparison of EF on three selected dates, while Fig. 7 shows the scatterplot of disTSEBL versus disTSEBM,DMS EF on the same dates but only from pixels which were classified as belonging to cropland land cover class. The three dates were chosen such that on the first date (beginning of the growing season) the EF at VOU is high, in the second it is intermediate and in the third it is low (end of the growing season). Fig. 6 shows that in general the EF modelled with sharpened LST is able to capture the spatial patterns of the reference dataset, although with somewhat reduced range. This reduced range is evident at the beginning of the season (Figs. 6 top row and 7a) when the contrast of reflectance between the different fields is quite low due to limited amount of green crops present on the fields. In that case the higher values of LST (lower EF) are not well captured by the LST sharpening process. Similarly, in the middle of the season (Figs. 6 middle row and 7b), the contrast of reflectance between the different fields is also low (due to most fields being covered with green crops) and high EF values are not well represented. On the other hand, when the contrast in the reflectance between the fields is high (Figs. 6 bottom row and 7c) the variability of EF is very well captured by the sharpened LST. Therefore, one possible limitation of the sharpening method is that it might require contrasting surfaces at different vegetation densities.

Scatterplot of modelled evaporative fraction (EF) of the croplands surrounding VOU field on three dates: 20.04.2011, 17.06.2009 and 26.07.2012. EF modelled using Landsat LST and TSEB with disaggregation (x-axis, disTSEBL) was plotted against EF modelled using sharpened MODIS LST and TSEB with disaggregation (y-axis, disTSEBM,DMS). The plot includes all pixels from the area shown in Fig. 6 which fall into cropland landcover class. Another contributing factor could be that the first two scenes were acquired by Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor on Landsat 5, while the last scene was acquired by Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on Landsat 7. This has two consequences: firstly ETM+ has increased radiometric sensitivity, accuracy and dynamic range over TM (Barsi et al., 2007); and secondly due to orbit of Landsat 5 only two thirds of the catchment area shown in Fig. 1 are captured during an overpass which leads to less training points for the DMS. Both of those issues should be resolved when using Sentinel-2 optical observations to sharpen Sentinel-3 TIR data, hopefully leading to wider range of modelled ET: firstly Sentinel-2 optical sensor has 12 bit radiometric resolution (compared to 8 bit resolution for Landsat 5 and Landsat 7) and low radiometric noise; and secondly Sentinel-2 has wider swath width than Landsat satellites (Kääb et al., 2016). One other difference observable between the EF derived by disTSEBL and disTSEBM,DMS is the sharpness of the latter (Fig. 6). This is due to the Landsat LST being resampled to 30 m from the acquisition resolution of between 60 m and 120 m (depending on the Landsat satellite), while the MODIS LST is sharpened using the Landsat reflectance observations which are acquired at 30 m resolution. When sharpening Sentinel-3 TIR data with Sentinel-2 optical data an even sharper (20 m resolution) image should be obtained. 4.4. Temporal pattern comparison One of the main reasons for obtaining high-resolution estimates of land surface energy fluxes is to be able to follow the temporal evolution of agricultural water use and plant water stress at field scale. Therefore, it is important to evaluate how accurately the fluxes estimated with sharpened LST can follow that temporal evolution. Similarly to Section 4.3 we use EF for this evaluation and consider the fluxes derived with Landsat LST as the reference dataset. For both types of LST inputs the TSEB model was driven by tower-based meteorological observations and the disaggregation approach was used. Fig. 8 shows the temporal evolution of EF for two agricultural fields throughout the study period. The relative location and size of the two fields (labelled (a) and (b)) are shown in the left panel of Fig. 9. It can be seen that both fields are much smaller than the spatial resolution of MODIS and SLSTR thermal observations (around 1 km) and that the distance between them is on the order of one low-resolution LST pixel. It can also be seen in Fig. 9 that the two fields do not always follow the same cultivation calendar. Despite this, EF modelled with sharpened LST is able to follow quite closely the temporal pattern of the reference EF, with r of 0.87 and Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) of 0.08 for field (a) and r of 0.83 and RMSD of 0.09 for field (b).

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) However, upon closer inspection some deficiencies of the sharpened LST approach become evident. Fig. 9 shows that while in the 2013 growing season field (a) remained essentially bare until June (with crop cover visible only in the image from 21.07.2013), field (b) was sown with winter crop the previous season and so was covered with green vegetation from May through June and then being already harvested for the image on July. The EF shown on the right end of Fig. 8 reflects this temporal sequence in case of model runs using Landsat LST (disTSEBL - red crosses) but not necessarily when using sharpened LST (disTSEBM,DMS - green x’es). In field (a) disTSEBL EF starts around 0.6 at the beginning of May 2013 then drops to 0.4 and gradually increases to 0.5 as the vegetation grows, while in field (b) it remains around 0.6 throughout May and June 2013 as the green vegetation matures and drops to around 0.4 at the end of July when the field does not contain photosynthetic vegetation anymore. disTSEBM,DMS EF follows the reference EF quite closely in field (a), with the exception of the estimate at end of May 2013 when it is overestimated, but in field (b) drops to 0.4 at the end of May and remains constant during the following two modelled dates. Especially in field (b) the behaviour of disTSEBL EF appears more realistic, which might indicate that the sharpened LST is not able to fully capture the dynamics of this field. 4.5. Comparison of fluxes derived with sharpened Sentinel-3 LST and Landsat LST at regional scale The suitability of applying the proposed methodology for deriving high-resolution fluxes with Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 images was also evaluated. The scenes were acquired on the morning of 17th of May 2017 and cover an agricultural area in the Po Valley in northern Italy. A Landsat-8 (L8) image was acquired over the area on the same morning, allowing for comparison of high-resolution fluxes estimated using S3 LST sharpened with S2 optical data against fluxes estimated using L8 LST in a region of interest (ROI) of 83 km by 40 km (Fig. 10).

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Land surface energy fluxes were first derived at the Sentinel-3 resolution using the TSEB model and then at the Sentinel-2 resolution using the TSEB model and the disaggregation approach. The S3 LST was obtained following the split-window approach proposed by Sobrino et al. (2016b). For high-resolution application the LST was sharpened to 20 m using the DMS approach and all 12 S2 bands, atmospherically corrected using Sen2Cor tool (Louis et al., 2016) and (in case of bands with different spatial resolution) resampled to 20 m. LAI was retrieved from the atmospherically corrected Sentinel-2 reflectances using the biophysical processor available in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software and resampled to S3 resolution for the low-resolution run. Due to the lack of established S2 or S3 albedo product or algorithm, the albedo data was taken from a MODIS MCD43A3 product and resampled for the S3 resolution run or sharpened with DMS for the S2 resolution run. The meteorological inputs were taken from the ECMWF analysis data which is included in the Sentinel-3 SLSTR data file, with the exception of incoming shortwave radiation which was estimated using the approach of Weiss and Norman (1985). The landcover-based parameters were set according to reclassified Corine map, as described in Section 3.3. To derive the reference high-resolution fluxes the same inputs were used except DMS-sharpened S3 LST was replaced with L8 LST. Maps of latent heat flux derived using Sentinel-3 LST, DMS-sharpened Sentinel-3 LST and Landsat-8 LST of three zoomed-in subsets of the ROI are shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen that at the original S3 resolution it is not possible to distinguish fluxes coming from individual fields or natural landscape features (e.g. riparian zones). However, at the S2 resolution those features become quite apparent both when using sharpened S3 LST and L8 LST. The spatial patterns shown in the two high-resolution latent heat flux maps are quite similar, although the fluxes estimated using L8 LST show larger dynamic range.

Density scatterplots of latent and sensible heat fluxes and the evaporative fraction for all the agricultural pixels within the ROI (over 7 million points) are shown in Fig. 12. The plot and statistics for latent heat flux confirm the findings described above: the correlation between LE modelled with the two types of LST is high (0.89) and using DMS sharpened S3 LST leads to underestimation of high-value fluxes and overestimation of low-value fluxes. The correlation between the sensible heat fluxes is significantly lower (0.67) which leads to the correlation between EF estimates to lie between the two values (0.79). It is not immediately clear why the correlation of H is so much lower than that of the other fluxes (correlations of G and Rn are 0.99 and 0.90 respectively). However, the response of the TSEB model to the changes in input LST is non-linear and this contributes to the different correlations of the different fluxes.

Potential for applicability in operational setting High resolution estimates of evapotranspiration have many operational uses, in particular in the domains of agriculture and water resources management (Anderson et al., 2012). For example, they allow for field-scale water accounting or precision irrigation. In Section 4 we have shown that by using 1 km LST sharpened to 30 m it is possible to obtain instantaneous ET estimates at field scale with a relative RMSE of 15% (when using local meteorological observations) to 19% (when using reanalysis meteorological fields). The bias of the modelled ET is significantly smaller and those errors should reduce when instantaneous outputs are averaged to daily, weekly or monthly values. This level of accuracy is similar to what is achieved with field measurements and therefore the estimates can be considered as reliable for water accounting (Karimi et al., 2015). It was also demonstrated that fluxes derived using sharpened low-resolution (Terra or Sentinel-3) LST capture the spatial patterns of fluxes derived using high-resolution (Landsat) LST well but with a narrower dynamic range if the optimal conditions for sharpening are not met. The temporal patterns shown by the two types of modelled fluxes are also similar. This confirms the applicability of the proposed method to be used with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images to obtain high-resolution evapotranspiration estimates. At both sites the fluxes derived from sharpening the low-resolution estimates (TSEB-DMSM) were not as accurate as the fluxes derived with sharpened LST (disTSEBM,DMS), with the exception of LE at the agricultural site where the RMSE of the two runs was the same. This indicates that it is preferable to sharpen the low-resolution data (in case of this study LAI, LST and albedo) and use them as inputs to the TSEB model, rather than sharpening the TSEB model outputs using DMS to achieve higher spatial resolution flux estimates. In case of applications utilising S2 data, LAI (and possibly albedo) can be derived directly at fine resolution (see Section 4.5) thus improving the high-resolution model parametrization. Furthermore, sharpening the fluxes directly may cause a lack of energy closure at fine scale that needs to be taken into account. In the current study reanalysis meteorological dataset (ERA-Interim) was used. These data are usually released with up to 3 months delay, which is fine in case of end-of-season water accounting but not suitable for irrigation advice. In that case another meteorological dataset, e.g. ECMWF forecast products (Andersson, 2015) would have to be used. This could have a significant impact on the modelled flux accuracy, especially if the forecast air temperature or wind speed are not well captured and this should be evaluated in future studies. In case of regional or local applications, it is possible to use near-real-time observations from ground stations and thus avoid this issue. 5.2. Limitations of the proposed approach The approach to sharpen low-resolution LST with high-resolution optical data is based on the assumption that there exists a statistical relation between the two dataset. The sharpening methodology used in this study (see Section 2.1) permits this relation to be non-linear and even very complex but it still must exist. While there is no general, globally transferable relation between TIR and optical data, it is possible to derive it when the two datasets are limited in space and time. This study shows that in such localised cases it is possible to use the sharpened LST to derive the land surface fluxes at high spatial resolution with acceptable accuracy. However, even then the range of high-resolution fluxes will not be as large as it would be if high-resolution LST observations were used, due to the aggregating effect present in the low-resolution observations. Another inherent limitation of estimating ET using DMS sharpened LST is the underlying assumption that the TIR and optical datasets contain the same or related information about the modelled physical phenomena. In practice they might contain complementary information. For example, crop water stress can be observed in the TIR domain some weeks before it becomes visible in the optical domain but both types of observations are required to map the water stress in different stages of the crop phenological cycle (Hoffmann et al., 2016a). On the other hand, Sentinel-2 bands in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) part of the electromagnetic spectrum do contain information about vegetation water content (Ceccato et al., 2001) and (under certain assumptions) about soil water content (Sadeghi et al., 2017). Therefore, more research is required to determine whether the DMS sharpened LST is suitable for applications such as early detection of vegetation water stress and precision irrigation, in which crops are subject to certain stress without provoking a decrease in yield/biomass. In other applications, such as in regional field-scale water use mapping (e.g. Senay et al. (2016)) the use of sharpened LST as input to ET models should produce acceptable results. The above mentioned limitations, together with results presented in Section 4, point to the need for direct high-resolution TIR observations to complement the existing capabilities of the Sentinel satellite constellation. While the methodology proposed in this study is valuable for filling in the currently present data gap, it does so with a reduced accuracy compared to what would be possible with a high-resolution TIR sensor and might not be suitable for all TIR-based applications. Further research into different types of sharpening procedures and ET models will probably improve on the results presented in this study but it is highly unlikely that the need for high-resolution evapotranspiration estimations will ever be fully met without a dedicated high-resolution TIR sensor. 6. Conclusion The Sentinel constellation of satellites provides a suit of observational capabilities for operational use in agricultural applications. However, one currently missing feature is high-resolution TIR sensor which could be used to (among other applications) estimate evapotranspiration and water use at field scale. This study evaluates a method to fill this data gap by sharpening low-resolution TIR observations from Sentinel-3 satellites using high-resolution optical observations from Sentinel-2 satellites. The evaluation is performed at two study sites, both located in a temperate climatic zone: an agricultural site with field sizes smaller than low-resolution pixel size and plantation forest site larger than low-resolution pixel size. Due to lack of long enough timeseries of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations and due to the need for high-resolution TIR data to use for benchmarking, the method was evaluated using MODIS and Landsat observations and later applied to Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 images to confirm its applicability to this type of data. The results at the agricultural site indicate that although the fluxes derived using sharpened LST are not as accurate as those derived using high-resolution LST, they are still an improvement compared to low-resolution fluxes. For most accurate results the fluxes derived using sharpened LST should be refined with a disaggregation scheme which utilises low-resolution fluxes. Sharpening the low-resolution fluxes directly did not produce as good results. The fluxes derived with sharpened LST are able to satisfactorily capture the spatial patterns of different evapotranspiration rates of the different small-sized fields (although with reduced range), especially when high contrast is present within the scene. The temporal evolution of evaporative fraction throughout multiple growing seasons is also generally well represented when using sharpened LST even though certain critical events are missed. At the forest site the utility of sharpened LST is harder to evaluate due to the nature of the site (homogeneous at coarse scale but heterogeneous at fine scale) and the difficulties in modelling ET in forest ecosystems. Follow on studies are planned, which will utilise purely Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 observations and which will be conducted in irrigated croplands located in semi-arid and Mediterranean climates, where high LST contrast should be present at both low and high spatial resolutions and where water conservation issues are most critical. In addition, different LST sharpening techniques and ET modelling schemes will be tested. This study demonstrates that although modern data fusion techniques can be employed to partially compensate for the current lack of high-resolution TIR observations from Sentinel satellites, they cannot fully cover this data gap. Therefore, Sentinel constellation should be complemented with TIR observations at high spatial (and temporal) resolution to optimally exploit the existing capabilities in agricultural applications.

The COVID-19 preventive measurements restrict farm-workers from travel to their farms, social distancing and lockdown
to prevent them from getting infected. Consequently, farming and irrigation activities are dramatically reduced due to
shortage of farm-workers and reduction of crops production. To find solutions, various technologies have been adopted
to remotely connect farmers with their farm-fields from their homes and perform the same work as they are in the farm.
An Internet of Things (IoT) approach, modern sensor technologies, and smart irrigation equipment are coupled to allow
the collection of the field data for automatic irrigation of the field. This paper presents the IoT system based on Fuzzy
logic controller that assists farmers to receive and monitor necessary irrigation data from the farm field through their smart
phones and PCs. The Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are deployed in the field to measure the water content in the soil
and water used for plants by measuring the soil moisture dynamics throughout the entire duration of the crop growing sea-
son in the Maize crop farm. The Fuzzy logic controller was used for data analytics and intelligent decision making as well
as Fuzzy logic toolbox in MATLAB to simulate irrigation scheduling process. The system saves 50% of water and energy
consumption for irrigation, 80% reduction of farm-workers and increase in 20% of crop production.

Introduction
Agriculture sector is crucial to the population welfare as it
provides the food, employment and raises the national econ-
omy; In Rwanda, about 96% of its population living in rural
areas depends mainly on agriculture for their income and it
is almost impossible to survive without this sector. However,
the climate change, the irregular precipitation and long dry
season are negatively affecting the quantity and quality of crop
production and results in agriculture production crisis in the
region. Each agricultural crop has its weather requirements for
growing, that’s why the farmers wisely select the right season
when to sow on the basis of weather condition (Zhu et al.,
2020; Patil et al., 2019). Therefore, in order to achieve a high
quantity and quality of crop production by balancing weather
condition, irrigation is essential.
The method used in irrigation involves building canals
which supply uniformly water from water resources or use of
water pumps for spraying water evenly in the field. Never-
theless, the scarcity of water resources has been a problem that
impacts the agriculture development. Therefore, A convenient
irrigation system shall make the agricultural process more
effective (Patil et al., 2019). However, not only the currently
used methods of irrigation consume more water than what
plants need, but also require farmers to manually and con-
stantly operate water valves or water pumps in case of absence
or excess of water in the field. In addition, COVID-19 pan-
demic as the biggest health crisis in this decade, due to its
preventive measures taken by different organ around the world
which restrict the people to stay at home (lockdown) and
social distancing have severely affected agricultural activities
(Filtjens, n.d.; GSMA, 2021). Therefore, the introduction of
ICT in agriculture has emerged as the effective and sustainable
solution to improve irrigation systems.
The emergence and rapid development of IoTs and Big Data
Analytics presents interesting solutions to the above problem.
(Badrun and Manaf, 2021; Salvi et al., 2017). In this context,
an IoT system can connect multiple sensor nodes and other

smart devices located in the field and link them to a local or
cloud based controller. These nodes in turn collect and trans-
mit real-time data from their surroundings to the controller.
This information can be either used to offer for example a
farmer both immediate and long term response or used by pre-
dictive and adaptive algorithms to execute operational
responses such automate irrigation scheduler (Gautam and
Sen, 2015; Jamroen et al., 2020).
The use of Smart Crops Irrigation System with Low Energy
Consumption overcomes the above mentioned problems with
An Internet of Things (IoT) approach, modern sensor tech-
nologies, and smart irrigation equipment are combined to per-
mit the collection of the field data for automatic irrigation and
notification . This study presents the IoT based irrigation sys-
tem using Fuzzy logic controller that assists farmers to receive
and monitor the field parameters such as soil moisture, and
temperature as well as remotely controlling irrigation system
installed in the farm field through their smart phones and PCs.
Related works
This section presents the cutting-edge studies for currently
available related solutions. First, threatenings to farmers due
to COVID-19 pandemic are evaluated followed by IoT tech-
nologies for irrigation and finally the applications of Fuzzy
logic in agriculture are presented.
1. Threatening to farmers due to the COVID-19 pandemic
Threatening to farmers due to the COVID-19 pandemic has
exacerbated, especially in developing countries. in Rwanda,
big number of the citizen are employed in farming activities
where the report shows that in 2019 in Rwanda, 64% of the
population was hired in this agriculture sector (MINAGRI,
2020). Since outbreak of COVID-19, one among the effective
measures to control the spread of the pandemic was to enforce
the citizen to stay-at-home (4.I. Workshop: Health systems
resilience during COVID-19: Lessons for building back better,
2021; Tripathi et al., 2021). The agriculture also was one
among sectors affected by these COVID-19 prevention mea-
sures. One among affected farming parts was irrigation where
farmers were restricted to go to irrigate their fields and had
to depend again on rain season only which reduced dramat-
ically their production (Boughton et al., 2021; Selim and
Eltarabily, 2022). nevertheless the IoT was introduced and
being used in agriculture sector, challenges of COVID-19 pan-
demic have proved that the digital agriculture need to be accel-
erated, where smart irrigation systems are needed for
autonomous irrigation and assisting farmers in remote mon-
itoring and tracking forming activities (GSMA, 2021; Nyakuri
et al., 2022).
2. IoT connectivity technologies for irrigation
Wi-Fi connectivity is a widely used wireless communication
technique. Many agricultural monitoring systems, such as the
one presented in (Mendez et al., 2012) by Gerard Rudolph et
al and (Hasan et al., 2021), employ Wi-Fi to communicate
amongst the various agents of their designs. They demon-
strated a Wi-Fi wireless sensor network for farm monitoring,
with nodes collecting data on temperature, humidity, light, soil
moisture, and water level. The data was also sent to a server
so that it could be viewed later. As a result, researching MiFi
coverage in various agricultural settings is of tremendous
interest. In (Mendez et al., 2012; Li et al., 2020), Muhammad
A. et al. reported a method for estimating the location of wire-
less nodes based on signal intensity. The IEEE 802.11 b/g
standard was used and the locations included urban regions,
rural areas, woodlands, and plantations. However, Wi-Fi
requires more internet infrastructure when deployed in remote
area. 
Cellular system employs GSM/GPRS standard for data
communication between field sensor node and the cloud
server for data storage and further analysis. Additionally, the
Android app is being developed to track the system's current
state instantly (Science, 2018). In (Munir et al., 2021; Yang
et al., 2021), the GSM module was used to connect an IoT
cloud server to a network of sensors, analyzes the data at the
edge server, transfers only a subset of the data to the main
IoT cloud server to predict the amount of water that a field
of crops will need, and uses an edge Android application to
display the outcome. The IoT devices communicate with cel-
lular networks by using second generation (2G), third gen-
eration (3G), fourth generation (4G) and GPRS standards due
to its relatively long-range wireless communication and its
robust communication links (Khattab et al., 2019; Science,
2018).

devices in irrigation system to communicate effectively with
minimized cost and energy consumption but within a short

range less than 100 m (Kim et al., 2008), developed sensor-
based variable rate irrigation systems with Bluetooth tech-
nology. The application in this article requires plug-and-play
compatibility to serial devices with affordable wireless com-
munication modules in order to accommodate existing data
loggers and sensors. For wireless data transmission between
in-field sensor stations and a base station, the Bluetooth mod-
ule was chosen (Ilapakurti and Vuppalapati, 2015) and (Hasan
et al., 2021) used the Bluetooth low energy framework to sen-
sor sensor nodes. Their choice for using Bluetooth low energy,
also known as Bluetooth Smart, was to maintain a same com-
munication range as Wi-Fi but using significantly less power
and cost. When compared to other previous stated technol-
ogies used in irrigation, system design optimization, trans-
mission energy, cost and security can be achieved by improved
with the only limitation of the device communication range.
3. Fuzzy logic for Data Management and Analytics for
Irrigation Optimization
Fuzzy logic system determines degree of truth for right deci-
sion making to the problem as that of human perception and
reasoning can make. Fuzzy logic algorithms are robust and
adapt easily to the changing environments (Jane and Ganesh,
2019; Pezol et al., 2020) in (Phogat et al., 2021) an irrigation
system based on ANN and Fuzzy Logic was developed. Soil
moisture dynamics, precipitation, evapotranspiration for wheat
crop were considered. And the results of Fuzzy logic was
found suitable with 89% better performance due to better deci-
sion making the lower implementation cost. An intelligent
automatic control system was developed in (Shongwe, 2022)
and (Jamroen et al., 2020) using the fuzzy logic controller to
enable smart irrigation based on environmental factors such
as soil moisture variation, soil Ph, solar irradiation, air tem-
perature, and air humidity. The system showed water and
energy usage efficiency relatively to the optimal growth of the
plant.
After observing irrigation challenges faced by formers
during COVID-19 pandemic and reduction of their production
due to those challenges, based on the necessity of digitali-
zation in irrigation system and gaps identified in different
researches, the Smart Crops Irrigation System with Low
Energy Consumption was developed. It works by deploying
sensor nodes in the field so that irrigation can be done based
on water requirements by the plants to reduce water wastage
from irrigating unneeded location and assisting farmers in irri-
gation activities using smart device.

System design 
1. System architecture
The proposed system is illustrated in the Figure 1 and is
designed for semi-automatic irrigation system. The sensor
nodes are deployed in the field and work in WSN mode at
the edge of the network and consist of sensors, Microcon-
troller and ZigBee technology and gather all necessary field
data to a single gateway. The gateway gathers all data sends
data to the cloud platform for further analysis. The water for
irrigation came from AKAGERA River and stored in the
water reservoir where it is pumped to the field by the solar-
powered pump when it is needed by any sensor node in the
field. For any sensor node, if the water content in the soil get
below the threshold value, the irrigation is done either auto-
matically or by the farmer according to the weather fore-
casting.The field data is sent to the cloud platform through the
gateway using SGM system. The cloud plat form receives big
data from the field and weather forecasting, analyses it, take
decision and sent notification to the farmer through smart
phone and PC. The farmer accesses to all field information
and can operate the irrigation system from home (whether to
irrigate or stop irrigation if it is going to rain) using his smart
phone. 
2. Solar powered sensor node
The sensor node presented in this project collects data from
the given section of the field (for this case is 2 ha), processes
it and communicates it to the gateway which is the central unit
of the WSN. It consists of four main units; the sensing unit
that employs Hobonet TEROS 12 Soil Moisture/Temperature/
EC Sensor to detect the water content and temperature dynam-
ics in the soil, Atmega 328 microcontroller which is respon-
sible for processing data from sensors and determine the
irrigation requirements, communication units using Xbee
module for transmitting processed data to the gateway and
finally the solar panel module for powering the whole device.
3. Wireless sensor network (WSN)
WSN is the distributed sensor nodes structure that allows
many sensor nodes to communicate each other wirelessly in
the network. In this study, the standalone sensor node can
cover area not more than 2 hectares while the field is 12 hect-
ares; so, the sensor nodes are connected in the WSN structure
in order to collect the entire field information to the central
unit (The gateway) for further processing and communicating
the same data to the cloud for further analysis and decision
making. The ZigBee technology has been chosen for their low
power consumption, low cost and easy transmission compared
to Lora, Wi-Fi and GSM technologies.

4. Mobile application
The bazafarm mobile application is found in the google play
store. Its dashboard show the farm information and soil con-
dition with notification to the farmer. The soil moisture level,
soil electrical conductivity, the battery level of each device and
the device ID is shown in the dashboard.
5. System flowchart
Smart crop irrigation operates by using microcontroller
Atmega 328 which starts by scanning soil moisture, soil tem-
perature, and electrical conductivity of the soil. Those three
parameters were scanned with help of moisture sensor placed
to in the soil. Therefore, those scanned parameters are sent to
both cloud and to mobile phone by using GSM. When soil
moisture becomes less than twenty four percent, then, turn on
the pump for irrigating the crop. Otherwise pump is off. The
electrical conductivity of soil turns pump on while it is
becomes greater 570 ms/m. 
Fuzzy logic controller and MATLAB 
simulation
1. Fuzzy logic system for decision making
Fuzzy logic approach is a machine learning technique for
data analytics and intelligent decision making for uncertain
problems based on the degree of truth. Fuzzy logic helps in
right decision making as that can be made by human per-
ception and reasoning based on the environment variation
rather than convention true or false (1 or 0) logic (Arcos-
Aviles et al., 2021). 
2. Fuzzy inference system and membership functions
For the simulation of the output based on the input variation
through the Fuzzy Logic Controller is done in the Fuzzy logic
Toolbox in MATLAB (Alfin and Sarno, 2018). The output is
the speed variation of the electrical pump for irrigation that
determines the quantity of water to be irrigated according to
the soil state. The soil state is determined by the soil moisture,

soil temperature and the soil EC data collected by sensors as
illustrated in Fuzzy Inference System editor Figure 5.
In the proposed work, there are three Fuzzy input mem-
bership functions including soil moisture, soil temperature and
EC. The input membership functions with their linguistic vari-
ables, corresponding ranges and plots are illustrated in the
Table 1. 
The output membership function of the Fuzzy system is the
variation speed of electrical pump that varies from 0 to 30%
for low state, 30% to 60% for medium state and 60% to 100%
for high state of its total power. The linguistic variables, cor-
responding ranges and plot are described in the Table 2.

3. Fuzzy IF-THEN Rules
In this study, the fuzzy IF-THEN rule system is based on
the expert knowledge in the field of irrigation to manage the
appropriate quantity of water to irrigate the farm field at real-
time. The Fuzzy Rule System starts by determining water con-
tent in the soil (in %), temperature (in oC) and EC (in mS/
m) of the soil as input Fuzzy values. The input Fuzzy values
are applied to IF-THEN rule system that determines the output
Fuzzy values as described in IF-THEN Rule viewer Figure 6.
4. Surface view
The surface viewers of the proposed Fuzzy system are the
three-dimensional output surfaces that shows output variations
with their corresponding inputs. The surface views in Figure
7(a), Figure 7(b) and Figure 7(c) represent the output variation
speed of the electrical pump during irrigation process that cor-
respond to soil moisture/soil temperature, soil moisture/EC
and soil temperature/EC respectively.

section of the field. After smart irrigation system with low
energy consumption installed in the Maize farm, the data col-
lected in two consecutive seasons, the season 1 started from
April to July 2021 and the season 2 started from August to
October the results obtained are presented in the Figure 8.
1. The data collected by each sensor during those seasons
show that the average of the soil moisture was 29.45%
and 33.55% respectively, which are exactly in the
expected normal range.
2. The average soil temperature was 22.56oC and 23.53oC
respectively which correspond to the normal recom-
mended temperature range.
3. Water usage and energy consumption was reduced by
45% due to the reduction of the irrigation time duration.
4. The 80% reduction in number of farm-workers due to
automatic irrigation and remote farm irrigation moni-
toring system via smart phone.
5. 20% increase in maize production compare to previous
seasons.
The resulting Averages of soil moisture and temperature in
the period of two seasons showed that water content in the
soil was maintained at desired level due to the regular auto-
matic irrigation system based on the water needs for the plant.
Data were collected in two periods, the first period was from
May to July and the second was from August to December
and C9 section covers 12 Ha and the crop planted is Maize.
Each sensor node sends data every 30 minutes and each single
data packet has 2.5 kb size.
According to the above chart, the number of data collected
in C9 section in season1 is estimated to 22.9 MB while num-
ber of data collected in season 2 is 18.5 MB. So, the number
of data collected in season1 is more than season 2 because
season 1 was longer than season two.
2. Discussion
The project was well conducted durig the two seasons peri-
ode which had defferent rainfall and sunshine patterns. The

resulting average soil moisture and temperature in that period
proved that water content in the soil was maintained at desired
level due to the regular automatic irrigation system based on
the water needs for the plant. By using this system, farmers
can nolonger rely on rainfall condition. In addition, a sig-
nificant benetit for farmers was achieved by saving 80% of
labor force (as COVID-19 pandemic prevention measures
were conserned) and 45% of energy consumption was saved
with 20% increase in crop productivity.
By introducing this smart irrigation system, other types of
crop than Maize such as vegetables and potatos can be grown
and increase significantly the productivity. The availability of
sufficient sunlight makes renewable enery an additive source
of free energy for irrigation equipment to overcome electrical
energy problem in the region.
Conclusion
This study presents smart irrigation project based on soil
parameters dynamics suitable for Maize crop irrigation. It uses
sensors to sense variation in moisture and temperature in the
soil, process them using Raspberry-pi 3 and Fuzzy Inference
Controller for decision making and gives recommendation
(notification message) to the farmers according to standards
predetermined through mobile application. This system pro-
vides capabilities for the farmer to monitor their farm irri-
gation activities anywhere they can be and at any time as the
COVID-19 pandemic prevention measures prevent movement.
The results shows that there are significant reduction of water
quantity and energy for irrigation as well as preventing the
COVID-19 transmission by monitoring the farm activities
remotely through smart phone.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

Abstract Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN) have promising applications in the field of underground structural health monitoring. Signal path loss prediction is a great challenge in the design and onsite installation of WUSN. Existing wireless signal propagation models cannot well predict the total path loss due to the neglection of node detailed structure. This paper develops a numerical model in FEKO to simulate the signal propagation in soils considering the detailed structure of buried sensor node including linear shaped antenna, coaxial feeder, batteries and protecting PVC box. The developed numerical model is validated using the Friis equation in free space and results of outdoor signal propagation experiments. Compared to analytical propagation models, the developed numerical model can well consider the path loss induced by sensor node itself. The proposed numerical model is able to simulate the signal propagation in heterogeneous soils. Signal path loss fluctuates in heterogeneous soils due to the coupling of direct, reflected and refracted waves. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate the effects of soil properties, signal frequency, node orientation and soil heterogeneity on total path loss. An optimal frequency foptimal exists to minimize the signal path loss and foptimal is in the range of 0.56–0.65 GHz for the node in this paper.

Introduction Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN) are the natural extensive of wireless sensor networks (WSN). The majority of sensor nodes, including their means of transmitting and receiving, are deployed completely below the ground for WUSN. As a promising underground sensing technique, WUSN has the advantages of concealment, ease of deployment, timeliness of data, reliability and coverage density (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006). In recent years, WUSN has been employed to the smart sensing of underground infrastructures and their adjacent underground environments. WUSN is already widely used in the monitoring of underground coal mines (Wu et al., 2010, Kennedy and Bedford, 2014), transportation tunnels (Bennett et al., 2010, Stajano et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2020) and utility tunnels (Huang et al., 2019, Zhou et al., 2020). Both the structural health condition of underground structures and the underground environments such as temperature, humidity, gas concentrations can be monitored using relevant wireless sensors. The wireless signals in these scenarios still transmit in air. Differently, the wireless signals transmit in dielectric soil medium and thus undergo much larger attenuation for WUSN in some other applications. For example, WUSN is used to detect the fluid leakage of buried pipeline (Lin et al., 2019). Leakage localization algorithms are also proposed based on different sensing parameters and types of pipeline (Abdelhafidh et al., 2018). Other applications are like soil moisture monitoring (Bogena et al., 2009, Bogena et al., 2010, Di Fusco et al., 2018), soil permittivity estimation (Salam et al., 2019b) and seismic mapping (Saeed et al., 2019). This paper only focuses on the signal propagating in soil medium. It is a great challenge to estimate the signal path loss for WUSN due to the complex signal propagation mechanism and complex soil dielectric behavior (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006). A reliable and accurate path loss estimation method is needed in the design stage to determine the maximum internode distance and network topology (Akyildiz et al., 2009). In the deployment of WUSN system, the signal path loss is used to estimate the received signal strength. What’s more, signal path loss estimation is crucial to node connectivity analysis during the operation of WUSN system (Sun et al., 2011, Trang et al., 2018). Based on the estimated path loss, the sensor can adaptively select the energy-saving transmission configuration to prolong the network lifetime. There are some analytical models for characterizing the signal propagation in soils. However, analytical models are not easy to use in complex scenarios such as multi ground layers and existence of underground structures (Mekid et al., 2017). Therefore, this paper aims to develop a comprehensive numerical model to directly obtain the total signal path loss between two sensor nodes. In the numerical model, the details of wireless sensor node such as the antenna size, antenna orientation are modelled. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Part 2, related works will be reviewed concerning the existing analytical propagation models; In Part 3, a refined numerical model for simulating the signal propagation is developed in commercial software FEKO (FEldberechnung bei Körpern mit beliebiger Oberfläche) and the numerical model is validated using outdoor signal transmission tests; In Part 4, the effect of soil physical properties, signal frequency, antenna orientation and soil heterogeneity on signal path loss are parametrically studied; In Part 5, several conclusions are provided. 2. State of arts Communication channels of WUSN need to be clarified before the introduction of signal propagation models. There are three types of communication channels for WUSN as shown in Fig. 1, Underground to Underground (UG2UG), Underground to Aboveground (UG2AG) and Aboveground to Underground (AG2UG). For UG2AG and AG2UG channels, wireless electromagnetic (EM) signals transmit both in air and soil medium. EM waves reflect at the soil-air interface, which causes additional signal path loss. For UG2UG channels, EM waves propagate in the soil medium throughout the transmission path. Therefore, three types of signal propagation can be characterized from the communication channels. Type (I): signal propagation in air; Type (II): signal propagation in soil medium; Type (III): signal propagation at the soil-air interface. Friis equation can be used to model the EM waves propagation in air (Li et al., 2007). Fresnel equation can calculate the signal path loss at the soil-air interface due wave reflection or refraction (Bogena et al., 2009). Download : Download high-res image (121KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Three types of communication channels for WUSN. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, three categories of single path propagation models in soils have been reported as shown in Table 1. The first category is the series of Modified Friis models. This series began with the conventional Modified Friis model proposed by Akyildiz et al. (2009). NC Modified Friis model proposed by Nchimunya et al. (2010) took account of the signal attenuation induced by wave reflection and refraction. Soil complex dielectric constant (CDC) model was incorporated into single path propagation models to consider the effect of soil physical conditions. Peplinksi model was adopted in Conventional and NC Modified Friis models. Other models in this series adopted different methods, such as TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) measurements (Sadeghioon et al., 2017) or MBSDM (Mineralogy-Based Soil Dielectric Model) (Sambo et al., 2019), to predict the soil CDC. The Modified Friis based models are only valid in the far field region of antenna, which is often neglected in the past studies. Table 1. Signal propagation models in soils. Propagation models CDC prediction Antenna field region Modified Friis Conventional Modified Friis (Akyildiz et al., 2009) Peplinski model NC Modified Friis (Nchimunya et al., 2010) Peplinski model Far field TDR Modified Friis (Sadeghioon et al., 2017) TDR measurement MBSDM Modified Friis (Sambo et al., 2019) MBSDM CRIM Fresnel (Bogena et al., 2009) CRIM Near field Two stage model (Huang et al., 2020) TDR measurement Whole field Note: the near field and far field of antenna is determined using the far field distance df. df is determined by the following equation, where, D is the antenna dimension, λ is the signal wavelength. The second category is CRIM Fresnel model proposed by (Bogena et al., 2009). This is a semi-empirical model combining the Fresnel equation in the near field of antenna and the CDC model of Complex Refractive Index Model (CRIM). Different from Modified Friis model, CRIM Fresnel is only valid in the near field of sensor node antenna. The third kind of propagation model is Two-stage model proposed by Huang et al. (2020). The two-stage model considered the field characteristic of senor node antenna and combined the advantages of Modified Friis model and Fresnel model. However, there is a fitting parameter m used to characterize the field characteristics is related to soil types and can hardly be determined before experiment. The three channels in Fig. 1 can be investigated based on single path loss models. The UG2AG and AG2UG channel are usually described by one model. Such models like ZS Free space-Modified Friis based model (Sun et al., 2011), XD Free space-Modified Friis based model (Dong et al., 2013) and WUSN-PLM (Sambo et al., 2020) have been reported. For UG2UG channel, two-path model (Vuran and Akyildiz, 2010), 3 W (3 waves) model (Dong and Vuran, 2011, Salam et al., 2020) and WUSN-PLM (Sambo et al., 2020) are reported from literatures. From the review of related works, the existing propagation models have some challenges in predicting the signal path loss in soils. In those analytical or semi-empirical models, the sensor nodes are always assumed as points which have the ability of transmitting or receiving wireless signals. The specific conditions of sensor nodes such as antenna size, antenna orientation and node size are neglected. Besides, the existing models are all developed in homogenous soils and difficult to use in heterogeneous soils. This paper aims to address the two shortcomings of the existing propagation models by developing a refined numerical model to simulate the signal propagation. 3. Numerical simulation of signal propagation considering detailed node structure 3.1. Numerical model setup in FEKO Numerical simulation of wireless signal propagation from one sensor node to another is a typical computational electromagnetic problem. In this paper, Methods of Moments (MoM) based software FEKO is chosen to simulate wireless signal propagation in soils. MoM solve the integral Maxwell’s equations shown as in Eq. (1). (1) where, E is the electric field, B is the magnetic field, ρ is the electric charge density, J is the electric current density, μ is the media permeability, ε is the media permittivity, Ω is any volume with closed boundary surface ∂Ω, Σ is any surface with closed boundary curve ∂Σ. The integral Maxwell’s functions are only concerning the electric field E and magnetic field B at the boundary ∂Ω and ∂Σ. The investigated region is meshed only at the boundary. MoM solves the electric source ρ and J at the boundary by assuming basic interpolation functions in discretized subdomains and transform the integral Maxwell’s equations into linear algebra equations (Rao et al., 1982). MoM is a “source method” and very suitable for simulating open boundary radiating structures. Compared to “field methods”, such as Finite Element Method (FEM), the free-space region between the radiating structures do not need to discretized using MoM. Boundary conditions are automatically fulfilled, and memory requirements are determined by the scale of geometry boundary and the required solution frequency. Besides MoM, FEM is also incorporated into FEKO. MoM and FEM can be collaborated in the same simulation. Therefore, FEKO have enough accuracy and efficiency in both electrically large and small size problem (Jakobus and Smith, 2012). Furthermore, FEKO is capable of solving computational electromagnetic problems in nonhomogeneous media. 3.1.1. The structure of sensor node for WUSN The sensor node for WUSN is different from that for WSN due to the change of working environment. The signal frequency of EM wave is lowered to reduce the path loss in soils. The previous works show that 433 MHz is the optimal frequency to minimize the signal path loss for WUSN (Li et al., 2007). The antenna size is then determined according to the signal operating frequency. The monopole antenna is widely used for wireless sensor node as it is the simplest omnidirectional antenna. The largest linear dimension of monopole antenna can be decided as (Huang, 2021). (2) where D is the largest linear dimension of monopole antenna, λ is the signal wavelength which is determined by λ = c / f, c is the light velocity in vacuum, f is the signal frequency. The size of the monopole antenna with the center frequency of 433 MHz is 0.173 m obtained from Eq. (2). A real monopole antenna is illustrated in Fig. 2.

In addition to the change of signal operating frequency, the structure of sensor node for WUSN is unlike that for WSN. Fig. 3 is the prototype of buried wireless sensor node developed by Tongji University and Wisen Innovation Ltd together. The sensor node is composed of fours parts: antenna is responsible for transmitting and receiving signals; sensor board is responsible for sensing and processing; battery is the energy source for the whole system; coaxial feeder connects the antenna to sensor board. The four parts are encapsulated in a PVC box for the isolation of the surrounding soils and underground water. Any other types of buried sensor node may have different structures, the basic four parts are generally needed. The refined numerical simulation of this paper will be all founded on the prototype given in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (114KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Structure of buried sensor node for WUSN operating at 433 MHz. 3.1.2. Numerical modelling of the sensor node According to the detailed structure of buried sensor node, the numerical model is developed in FEKO as shown in Fig. 4. The PVC box has a dimension of 200 mm in length, 120 mm in width and 80 mm in height. The thickness of the PVC box is 5 mm. The PVC box is modelled as a hollow cuboid in FEKO using the given dimensions. The material of PVC is electrically simulated using a dielectric medium with the dielectric constant of 4.0 while it has zero electrical conductivity. EM waves reflect and refract at the air-box and soil-box interface. Therefore, wireless signal has attenuation when transmits through the PVC box and this attenuation is denoted as Pbox.

The sensor board is modelled as a rectangular perfect electrical conductor (PEC) with a size of 87.6 mm × 88.9 mm. The sensor board is served as the ground plane for the monopole antenna. Ideally, the monopole antenna is equivalent to a dipole antenna if the ground plane is infinite (Huang, 2021). For the finite sensor board inside a real sensor node, the length and width make a difference to the antenna characteristics. The signal attenuation caused by sensor board compared to an ideal dipole antenna is denoted as Pboard. The monopole antenna is modelled using a PEC cylinder with a radius of 2.5 mm and length of 173 mm. The antenna is connected to sensor board via coaxial feeder. Coaxial feeder is composed of inner conductor, outer conductor and an insulating layer between two conductors. The inner conductor is connected to the sensor board on one end and to the monopole antenna on the other end as shown in Fig. 5. The waveguide port is adopted to excite the coaxial feeder in the numerical model. The waveguide port is located at the end surface of insulating layer. EM wave is guided inside the insulating layer limited by surrounding two conductors once the port is excited. As the coaxial feeder is connected to antenna, EM wave is then radiated into the space via the monopole antenna. Download : Download high-res image (169KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Modelling of the coaxial feeder. Batteries takes up a large space inside the sensor node due to the great desire of power. Four batteries are modelled as four same cylinders in the used prototype. The dimension of each battery is 15.5 mm in radius and 61 mm in height. The surfaces of the cylinders are modelled as PEC as the surface of battery is made by conductive metal. The existence of four batteries will affect the signal propagation and batteries induced signal attenuation is denoted as Pbattery. After the geometry modelling of the sensor node, mesh is needed to perform computational electromagnetic calculation. Fig. 6 shows the mesh of the sensor node in FEKO. Four global mesh sizes: Fine, Standard, Coarse and Custom can be chosen for the mesh. Triangle element is adopted as the Method of Moments will be used in the simulation. An auto mesh technique is employed in FEKO once the global mesh size is decided for simulation. As shown in Fig. 6, the auto mesh technique has a very good adaptability for different distance to the port. Mesh is automatically densified near the port while gradually become coarse with the increasing of the distance to the port. The mesh has 6765 triangle elements overall for one sensor node at the coarse mesh size level as shown in Fig. 6(a). If the global mesh size is set as standard level, the total mesh elements will expand to 11,985 as given in Fig. 6(b). From the comparison of different global mesh size level, the mesh size near the port is the same and the mesh size is smaller at the far distance to the port for standard mesh level. The solution method is MoM with surface equivalence principle for the whole numerical model. Download : Download high-res image (745KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6.

Numerical modelling of the signal propagation between two nodes Fig. 7 gives the overview of how the wireless signal propagation between two sensor nodes are modelled in FEKO. Sensor Node1 and Node2 are placed at a certain signal propagation distance in the vertical direction. The distance between two ports is denoted as the node distance d. Take the signal transmits from Node1 and receives at Node2 as example to illustrate the propagation process. A waveguide excitation is given to the port 1 of Node 1. The antenna of Node1 transforms the excitation into EM waves and radiating into the surrounding space. Once the antenna of Node2 receives the radiating EM waves, it transforms the EM waves into excitation. This excitation can be received by port 2 of Node2. The total signal attenuation, namely path loss, can be obtained from analyzing the energy difference of the two ports. S-parameter S21 measures the energy difference between port 1 and port 2. FEKO can solve the scattering problem and directly output the S-parameter. Download : Download high-res image (206KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Signal transmission and receiving mechanism between two nodes. Ground is introduced into the model covering the two nodes and the ground is modelled as homogenous dielectric lossy medium. Equivalent complex dielectric constant εeff (ε′-jε″) are key parameters to model the dielectric and lossy behavior of soils. In real-life application, ground is infinite in dimension. However, the numerical model cuts off at the boundaries to make the simulation possible. A cylinder boundary is chosen in this paper. The boundary conditions are automatically fulfilled as the MoM is adjusted from Boundary Element Method (BEM). The horizontal distance of the sensor node to the model boundary is r and distance to top or bottom boundary is h as shown in Fig. 8 (a). Mesh of the numerical model is given in Fig. 8 (b) from a cut plane view. Automatic mesh technique and coarse mesh size level are adopted in the simulation. Mesh of soil ground could be much coarser than the buried sensor node without the sacrifice of solving accuracy. Download : Download high-res image (278KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Numerical model developed in FEKO for wireless signal propagation in soils. It is easy to see that model boundary is crucial for the reasonability and applicability of developed numerical model. Fig. 9 aims to investigate the boundary effect on the simulated signal path loss for soils with variated electrical properties and different node distance. Fig. 9 tells that the distance of buried sensor node to the top and bottom boundary h does not the influence the signal path loss. Therefore, the h value is set as 0.6 m for the consideration of computational cost. The radius r of the numerical model has an obvious effect on the path loss. To obtain a stable model response, r value needs to be large enough. From the four groups of calculation in Fig. 9, the minimum value of a required model radius is correlated to the signal wavelength in soils λc. λc is determined as follows (Shi et al., 2021), (3) where, β is the phase shifting constant of soil, which is determined by (Akyildiz et al., 2009) (4) where, f is the signal frequency, μ is the magnetic permeability in soils which equals to the magnetic permeability in vacuum μ0, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, ε′ is the real part of relative complex dielectric constant of soils, ε″ is the imaginary part of relative complex dielectric constant of soils. The input parameters are the signal frequency, soil equivalent relative complex dielectric constant ε. Four different signal wavelengths are considered in Fig. 9 from 0.116 m to 0.276 m for f = 0.433 GHz. Compared to the wavelength in free space λ0, the soil wavelength λc is reduced.

The determination of model boundary is shown in Table 2 obtained from the numerical tests. The minimum model radius rmin to arrive a stable signal path loss is determined if the change of path loss is smaller than 0.5 dB. Then the ratio of rmin over λc can be calculated as given in Table 2. For soil type (a), (b) and (c), rmin / λc is the in the range of 4.3–4.5. For soil type (d), rmin/λc = 2.8. Considering all the four cases, it is appropriate to set the value of rmin / λc as 5. Therefore, the numerical model radius can be determined as r = 5λc. Table 2. Determination of model boundary.

Validation of the developed numerical model 3.2.1. Model validation in free space using Friis equation The developed refined numerical model is first compared to Friis equation in free space. Friis transmission equation calculates the wireless signal path loss in free space as follows (Li et al., 2007), (5) where, Lp is the signal path loss in dB, d is the sight-of-line distance between transmitter and receiver in meters, f is the wireless signal frequency in Hertz. Fig. 10 (a) shows the total signal path loss from Port 1 of Node 1 to Port 2 of Node 2 in free space obtained by refined numerical model. Three signal operation frequencies, 433 MHz, 868 MHz and 2.4 GHz are considered in the numerical simulation. The total signal path loss Lp,total is composed of two parts: the free space path loss L0 and sensor node itself induced path loss Lnode as expressed by Eq. (6). (6) Download : Download high-res image (390KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Simulation of signal propagation in free space and comparison with Friis model. Node induced path loss includes the path loss induced by node box Pbox, sensor board Pboard and batteries Pbattery as discussed in Part 3.1. Free space path loss L0 is determined by node distance and signal operating frequency. Node induced path loss is irrelevant to node distance and only determined by node detailed structure and signal frequency. Therefore, Lnode and L0 can be separated from Lp,total as Lnode is a constant for different signal transmission distance. The separated L0 from refined numerical simulation is compared to the Friis transmission equation in Fig. 10 (b). The simulation results by refined numerical model well agrees with the theoretical Friis equation in free space at different node distances and signal frequencies. The separated Lnode is 34.3 dB for 433 MHz, 17.0 dB for 868 MHz and 6.9 dB for 2.4 GHz. This fully accounts for the importance of Lnode in calculating Lp,total. The comparison clearly shows that Friis equation can only give the signal path loss in free space. Friis equation does not consider the detailed structure of sensor node and therefore cannot predict the node induced path loss. The developed refined numerical model simulates the signal propagation from the waveguide port and obtain the total signal path loss from transmitter to receiver. 3.2.2. Model validation in soils using outdoor experiments Outdoor experiments of EM wave propagation in soils were conducted to validate the developed numerical model. Only a brief introduction of the signal transmission experiment is given here as it is not the focus of this paper. More details can be found in another published paper (Huang et al., 2020). The experiment setup is shown in Fig. 11. The experiment system was composed of two wireless sensor nodes, one gateway and one laptop. Node 1 was buried at the bottom of the hole and Node 2 was placed at the surface of the backfilled soil. The distance between Node 1 and Node 2 was changed as the covering soil increased. At each time interval, sensor nodes formed a mesh topology and send data to the sink node. Sensor node 2 received the signal sent by Node 1, recorded the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Index) and transferred this information to the sink node. The sink node transmitted the mesh information to the remote sever via the mobile network and signal path loss could be easily obtained if both the transmitting and receiving power were measured.

Four groups of experiments with three types of soils were conducted. The physical and electrical properties of the backfilled soils were given in Table 3. Two groups of experiments using silty clay were conducted and one group of experiment was conducted for wet sand and dry sand respectively. Table 3. Physical and electrical properties of the soils used in experiments (Huang et al., 2020). Soil Type ρb ρs VWC σ Soil particle distribution ε′ ε″ S C Silty clay 1.366 2.72 48.1% 0.400 2.7% 26.3% 32.0 22.3 Wet Sand 1.340 2.69 4.9% 0.001 53.8% 9.6% 6.3 0.8 Dry Sand 1.340 2.69 0.0% 0 53.8% 9.6% 3.7 0.0 Note: ρb is the soil bulk density in g/cm3, ρs is the soil particle density in g/cm3, VWC is the volumetric water content, σ is the bulk electrical conductivity in S/m, S is the mass fraction of sand particles, C is the mass fraction of clay particles, ε′ is the real part of relative complex dielectric constant, ε″ is the imaginary part of relative complex dielectric constant. During the measurements, the temperature is kept around 19 °C. The experiment results of signal path loss are compared with the numerical simulation in Fig. 12. The RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and the maximum error are used to evaluate the agreement of numerical simulation results with experiment data. The RMSE is 3.4 dB and maximum error is 6.1 dB for “Silty clay-1”. The RMSE is 3.4 dB and maximum error is 5.7 dB for “Silty clay-2”. The RMSE is 3.0 dB and maximum error is 5.2 dB for “Dry sand”. For group of wet sand, the numerical results underestimate the signal path loss compared to experiment results at a short node distance. The maximum error is 14.9 dB for the numerical results. The deviation in the wet sand group is possibly caused by the inhomogeneous of wet sand in the vertical direction. But the deviation between numerical and experiment results are decreasing with the increase of node distance. The numerical results still agree with the experiment results at a large node distance. The RMSE for the group of “Wet sand” is 6.5 dB. Download : Download high-res image (276KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Comparison of refined numerical simulation and outdoor experiment results. The signal path loss for silty clay is much larger than that for sand both from the numerical simulation and experiment results. It indicates the soil types have an important effect on the soil electrical properties as given in Table 3 and make a big difference to the signal path loss eventually. From the comparison of numerical simulation results with Friis equation in free space and outdoor experiment results in soils, the refined numerical model developed in this paper is proved valid. 3.3. Comparison with the previous models A comparison between the proposed numerical model with the previous analytical models are provided in this section. Two presentative analytical propagation models are chosen for the comparison. 3 W model proposed by Dong and Vuran (2011) and WUSN-PLM model proposed by Sambo et al. (2020) are compared with numerical model for UG2UG channel as seen in Fig. 13(a). The experiment data is from the literature (Dong and Vuran, 2011). The transmitter and receiver were all buried at a depth of 0.4 m. The soil in the experiment contained 31% of sand, 29% of clay and VWC = 20%. In the near field (0–1 m), the 3 W model overestimates the signal path loss while numerical model and WUSN-PLM underestimate the path loss compared to the experiment data. In the far field (d > 1 m), the numerical model agrees well with WUSN-PLM and has a larger signal path loss prediction than the 3 W model. There is no more experiment data in the far field region. Therefore, the models are further compared in the far field region in Fig. 13(b) for UG2UG channel. The effect of node burial depth is investigated. It is found that WUSN-PLM does not consider the lateral waves and overestimate the signal path loss when d > 4.5 m. The proposed numerical model predicts a signal fluctuation caused by the coupling effects of reflected wave and direct wave when node distance is relatively small. This kind of coupling is influenced by the node burial depth and node distance. When the node distance is large enough, the prediction by numerical model has an identical tendency with 3 W model.

For UG2AG channel, the proposed numerical model is also compared with the analytical model by Dong et al. (2013) and WUSN-PLM. The underground node is buried 0.5 m below the ground and the aboveground node is placed 0.5 m above the ground. The investigated soil contains 50% of sand particles, 15% of clay particles and VWC = 5%. The horizontal internode distance d is variated to observe the different model predictions as shown in Fig. 13(c). The WUSN-PLM agrees well with Dong’s model if η = 2.0 for UG2AG model. And the numerical model behaves more like Dong’s model if η = 3.5. The proposed numerical model has more flexibility to simulate the signal path loss for different channels compared to analytical models. 4. Parametric studies In the applications of WUSN in underground sensing, severe installation environments such the soil water content variation with time (Dong and Vuran, 2013, Salam and Vuran, 2016), soil heterogeneity will challenge the performance of network connectivity. Furthermore, the chosen of optimal signal frequency is necessary to reduce the path loss (Salam et al., 2019a). During the installation, the node orientation also affects the signal path loss from the previous experiment results (Silva and Vuran, 2009, Vuran and Silva, 2010). Therefore, these factors are parametrically studied in this section to provide some guidance for the design and installation of WUSN. 4.1. Influence of soil physical properties Soil physical properties affects the signal path loss through their influence on soil CDC. The soil equivalent relative complex dielectric constants εeff for homogeneous soil is predicted by MBSDM (Mironov et al., 2009). The input parameters are the clay particle percentages C, soil VWC and signal frequency f. MBSDM is believed to have a better prediction of soil complex dielectric constants and fewer input parameters compared to other CDC models (Sambo et al., 2020). The node distance is fixed at 1.0 m and signal frequency is 433 MHz for this parametric study. Soil clay content C and water content VWC are variated to observe their effects on signal path loss. Fig. 14 shows that VWC makes a big difference to signal path loss. And the path loss can be fitted using parabolic curves. The fitting results are summarized in Table 4. The curve fitting results show that a parabolic equation has a very good fitness to the curves as all the R2 values are better than 0.99. Signal path loss in soils with very low water content is very close. The signal path loss at mv = 0 is in the range of 56.54–57.22 dB. This means dry soil have similar attenuation to wireless signals. Compared to the 58.97 dB path loss in free space, dry soil causes very limited additional attenuation to signals. This can be understood from the double-layer theory of soil particles (Dobson et al., 1985). Dry soil has a very low electrical conductivity because the cations and anions precipitate as salts resulting in the shortage of moveable ions. In addition, absolute value of the other two fitting coefficients in the parabolic equation increase with the increase of clay particle fractions C. Signal path loss is more sensitive to VWC for soils having larger clay particle content compared to soils with fewer clay particle content.

Influence of signal operating frequency The path loss in free space at 1.0 m node distance is set as the baseline for signal propagation in soils. Four soil samples are investigated with different clay content and volumetric water content. The soil complex dielectric constants required by the numerical model are first calculated at different signal frequency using MBSDM. The distribution of signal path loss in soils at different frequencies as shown in Fig. 15 is similar to that in free space. An optimal frequency foptimal exists to minimize the signal path loss. Before the optimal frequency, signal path loss decreases rapidly with the increase of signal frequency. After the optimal frequency, signal path loss increases with the increase of frequency. Therefore, a local minimum arrives at the optimal frequency which is in the range of 0.56–0.65 GHz for different soil samples. This gives practical guidance to the choice of signal operating frequency. The general considered center frequency fcenter = 0.433 GHz is far from good in our analysis. The path loss at optimal frequency can reduce about 21%–24% compared to the path loss at designed center frequency.

Different soil samples do not influence the distribution of signal path loss over frequency. The influence of soil physical parameters on optimal frequency is less than 0.1 GHz, which can be very useful in choosing the optimal signal operating frequency for different application scenarios. 4.3. Influence of relative node installation place In real-life application of WUSN, the relative node installation place between two sensors affects the signal propagation. The relative node installation place between two sensor nodes is illustrated in Fig. 16 (a). The relative rotation angle is used to quantify the possible installation deviation. Numerical results in Fig. 16 (b) shows that the relative rotation angle has a nonnegligible effect on signal path loss. Signal path loss arrives at a local maximum value when the rotation angle is 90° and 270°, and path loss arrives at a local minimum when the rotation angle is 0°, 180° and 360°. Therefore, it is the most unfavorable condition for signal propagation if two nodes are placed in the perpendicular direction while it is the most favorable condition if the two nodes are placed in the parallel direction. The difference of signal path loss in the perpendicular direction and parallel direction is up to 33.8 dB for d = 0.5 m, 37.8 dB for d = 1.0 m and 39.2 dB for d = 2.0 m. Download : Download high-res image (241KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Effect of relative rotation angle between two sensor nodes on the signal path loss. Another observation from Fig. 16 is that a small rotation angle deviation from the parallel direction (0°, 180°) does not cause a big increase of the signal path loss. Signal path loss only increase 0.3 dB when the rotation angle deviates ±15° from 180°, and it increases 1.4 dB when the rotation angle deviates ±30° from 180°. The signal path loss only increases 2% in the rotation angle range of ±30°. This allows enough installation error in the real application. 4.4. Influence of water content variation induced soil heterogeneity Natural soils are usually inhomogeneous due to the formation histories and outside influence from ground surface such as the increase of water content induced by rainfall. Such inhomogeneity is especially obvious in the vertical direction. In order to quantitatively investigate the effect of soil inhomogeneity on signal path loss, a vertical variated water content is assumed as shown in Fig. 17. The soil bulk density and particle density are set as ρb = 1.4 g/cm3 and ρs = 2.7 g/cm3 with a porosity of 0.481. The soil volumetric water content (VWC) is assumed linearly distributed in the vertical direction. VWC = 0.0 at the ground surface and VWC = 0.3 at a depth of 2.0 m. Download : Download high-res image (79KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 17. Assumed soil vertical inhomogeneity induced by variation of water content. Confronted with the assumed vertically inhomogeneous soil, analytical propagation models have great difficulties in predicting signal path loss in such soils. However, the numerical model has advantages in solving such problems. Fig. 18 gives a simplified strategy for the simulation of vertically inhomogeneous soil through layered approximation. The investigated region is divided into several layers to approximate the linearly increased VWC along the burial depth. Each layer is assumed to be homogeneous with an equivalent VWC. The equivalent VWC of each layer is determined by the center point of that layer. With the increase of soil layers, the layer thickness is gradually reduced and the approximation is approaching the initial problem. For the specific case provided in Fig. 17, four simulation schemes including 1 layer, 4 fours, 8 layers and 16 layers are designed. Download : Download high-res image (153KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 18.. Strategy of the simplified modelling of soil inhomogeneity. UG2AG channel is investigated for heterogenous soils as shown in Fig. 19. The aboveground node is 0.4 m above the ground surface. The underground node is in the same vertical alignment with the aboveground node and the buried depth is variated in the range of 0.2 m–2.0 m. If the whole region is considered as one homogeneous layer, the signal path loss for UG2AG channel is larger than several layers. With the number of layers increasing, the signal path loss is converged according to the tendency observed from Fig. 19. Signal path loss in layered soils is more complex than it is in homogeneous soil due to the coupling of direct waves and reflected waves. The coupling of different waves could increase or reduce the path loss. Thus, the signal path loss is fluctuated with the increase of burial depth. But there is still an obvious linear tendency of signal path loss. Applying linear regression to each curve, the linear coefficient Pα can be obtained. The linear coefficient Pα in dB/m accounts for the signal path loss induced by soil absorption. Pα = 27.3 for one layer, Pα = 37.4 for four layers, Pα = 34.0 for eight layers, Pα = 37.6 for sixteen layers. Both the signal path loss fluctuation and tendency show the difference between homogenous and heterogenous soils. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 19. Effect of number of soil layers on UG2AG channel in heterogeneous soil. UG2UG channel is also studied in heterogenous soils as shown in Fig. 20. The transmitter and receiver are buried at the same depth ht = hr. The node horizontal distance d is in the range of 0.2–3.0 m. Sixteen layers simulation scheme is adopted to modelling the soil heterogenous. Three node burial depth ht = 0.2 m, 0.4 m and 0.6 m are chosen for the simulation. The results show that the fluctuation of signal path loss is larger than that in homogenous soils. Signal propagation is much more complex due to the wave reflection and refraction between different layers. With the increase of node burial depth ht, the fluctuation period and amplitude decreases. The linear coefficient does not vary much for each case. Pα = 18.7 for ht = 0.2 m, Pα = 17.1 for ht = 0.4 m, Pα = 15.1 for ht = 0.6 m. The fluctuation of signal path loss makes it more difficult for analytical models to give an accurate prediction. The linear coefficient for UG2AG and UG2UG shows that signal propagation along the vertical direction is much more difficult than horizontal direction. The numerical simulation shows the soil heterogeneity has unfavorable effect on signal propagation. Therefore, the transmitter and receiver are suggested to install in homogeneous soils or at least in the same soil layer.

Conclusions This paper develops a refined numerical model to simulate the wireless signal propagation in soils for WUSN. The structure details of the buried sensor node have been considered in the numerical model developed in FEKO. The proposed numerical model considers the attenuation caused by the sensor node itself. Furthermore, the proposed model allows the investigation of soil inhomogeneity, which is difficult for analytical signal propagation models. Several points are concluded as follows: (1) The refined numerical model considering the detailed structure of buried sensor node can obtain the total signal path loss in soils. Signal loss caused by sensor node itself is clarified by the comparison with Friis equation. For the specific node shown in this paper, the additional loss is 34.3 dB. The additional loss is determined by the node structure and signal frequency. (2) At low water content, signal path loss is not sensitive to soil clay content. Path loss is at the same level for signal propagates in dry soils. At high water content, clay content makes a big difference to signal path loss. For different types of soils, the path loss can be expressed as a parabolic function of soil volumetric water content. The fitting parameters are determined by soil clay content. (3) An optimal frequency foptimal exists to minimize the path loss given the antenna size. foptimal is not equal to the center frequency of antenna. Soil physical properties has limited influence to the optimal frequency. foptimal is in the range of 0.56–0.65 GHz for antenna size D = 17.3 cm. (4) Signal path loss of two sensors installed in the parallel direction (relative rotation angle 0°, 180°) is the local minimum while it is the local maximum for sensors installed in the perpendicular direction (relative rotation angle 90°, 270°). A deviation of ±30° from the parallel direction only causes a 1.4 dB increase of signal path loss. (5) The proposed numerical model is able to simulate signal propagation in heterogeneous soils. Layered approximation is adopted to simulate the heterogeneous soils with linear increase water content along depth. With the increase of equivalent layers, the signal path loss converges. For a region with 2 m deep, division by 16 homogenous layers are a good approximation. The coupling of direct, reflected and refracted waves could increase or decrease the path loss and lead to the fluctuation. The fluctuation of signal path loss makes the prediction more difficult for analytical models.

Abstract Many Internet of Things (IoT) requirements are already at the core of next generation wireless networks, including 5G, cognitive radio and future Internet. There is a huge consilience that the majority of Internet devices will become sensors and actuators equipped over ordinary “things”. As a consequence, the radio environment will increasingly become crowded with thousands of low-cost devices sharing the unlicensed frequency bands. This paper is regarding a convergent solution of future Internet and cognitive radio in the context of IoT. It proposes an embedded and low cost cooperative spectrum sensing solution, which has been experimentally implemented. Furthermore, we present a distributed software-controlled sector aware spectrum sensing architecture to store and analyze the spectrum usage information. Finally, the proposed approach has been integrated to a future Internet architecture called NovaGenesis. A proof-of-concept has been experimentally performed, demonstrating for the first time the convergence of IoT, future Internet and cognitive radio.

Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) has been challenging all existing information and communication technology (ICT) architectures in the last years, mainly due to the exponential growth in the number of connected devices, the diversity of possible technology stacks (heterogeneous networks) and devices connectivity issues [1], [2]. The new scenario becomes even more challenging since many traditional networks had not been originally designed to offer adequate security and privacy for IoT [3], [4]. Moreover, a significant portion of mobile IoT devices will require rebinding of devices’ locators [2] and hundreds or even thousands of them will share the same radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic spectrum. The IoT requirements play an important role in the context of the next generation wireless networks, including 5G [5], cognitive radio [6] and future Internet [2]. For instance, Michailow et al. [5] have considered low power consumption and delay tolerant requirements of machine-to-machine communications in the context of 5G networks. Cognitive radios networks (CRNs) have been proposed as a key solution to define rules and techniques for using underutilized licensed RF bands [7]. One of its benefits is allowing users of congested unlicensed bands to offload their traffic to other parts of the RF spectrum, even the licensed ones. A CRN is able to identify when the legal owner of some RF spectrum portion, who is called primary user, is not making use of its licensed RF band. Cognitive networks may orientate secondary (opportunistic) users to make use of this part of the RF spectrum without interfering in the primary user communication [6]. As a consequence, a cognitive radio (CR) must identify – or sense – when the licensed RF band is unused and distribute this information for the secondary users that may be interested in establishing communication over this part of the RF spectrum. The tsunami of devices expected in IoT will push radio frequency spectrum control and management towards more opportunistic approaches, creating a straightforward link between IoT and CRN [1]. The latest piece of this puzzle is the strong relation between the IoT requirements and future Internet (FI) research [8]. The term future Internet was adopted in the first initiatives with the aim of rethinking the Internet, including the future Internet design (FIND) initiative [9] and the European future Internet assembly (FIA) initiative [8]. By FI, we mean any Internet-like network that could emerge in the future. This includes evolutionary approaches, in which the fundamental protocols of the current Internet are maintained and new ideas are incrementally introduced; or revolutionary approaches, in which the architecture is redesigned from scratch (also named “clean slate” proposals). Examples of evolutionary FI architectures (FIAs) that encompass IoT scope are: FIWARE [10], SENSEI [11] and SmartSantander [12]. FIWARE provides a platform to integrate computer programs (or generic enablers – GE) via the next generation service interfaces (NGSIs). The NGSI-9/NGSI-10 is based on RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs) [10], as a consequence, it is dependent on the current Internet technologies. SENSEI is focused on the wireless sensor and actuator networks interoperation, creating a market for the sensed data also employing RESTful interfaces. Finally, SmartSantander is based on a platform for the smart city services integration using RESTful APIs. To the best of our knowledge, those projects do not explore CRN approach to opportunistically perform spectrum control and management, by using a spectrum sensing technique. They also lack on supporting some FIA ingredients, such as: information-centric networking (ICN) [13], service-oriented architecture (SOA) [14], service-centric networking (SCN) [15], software-defined networking (SDN) [16], network function virtualization (NFV) [17], self-verifying naming (SVN) [4], identifier/locator (ID/Loc) splitting [2] and network caching. Up to the current moment, we can conclude that none of the mentioned revolutionary approaches have being proper explored in the IoT state-of-the-art. In this sense, we idealized and developed a new FIA called NovaGenesis (NG) [18], which considers IoT and CRN as key players for future Internet. In this paper, we explore for the first time the convergence of IoT, CRN, and FI technologies, by means of three main contributions. Firstly, we report a successful implementation of a novel approach for cognitive radio in IoT scenarios based on a software-controlled, low-cost and an embedded cooperative spectrum sensing. Secondly, we present the concept and an experimental demonstration of a distributed, software-controlled and sector aware spectrum sensing architecture that employs current Internet protocols to store and analyze spectrum usage information. Thirdly, we extend NG with novel services to interoperate with the proposed CRN approach based on energy detection from spatially-distributed remote radio units by taking advantage of the NG FIA ingredients. The remainder of this article will introduce our CRN based on energy detection from spatially-distributed remote radio units in Section 2. The proposed system is implemented using a low-cost hardware and GNU Radio as a processing platform. Section 3 presents NovaGenesis, including its fundamental concepts, implementation and two novel FI services to interoperate with our CR solution. Experimental results are reported in Section 4, including a proof-of-concept of the new NG services together with the embedded spectrum sensing. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5, giving direction for future works. 2. Cognitive radio network proposal: embedded low-cost cooperative sensing The employment of a RF spectrum sensing technique is convenient, independently of the way that the unused RF band is going to be allocated by a secondary user, for this reason is considered one of the CR most important features [19]. CR may be placed alone in a non-cooperative environment or being part of a cooperative network, in which a channel allocation decision is based on the information collected by diverse CRs. In the ISM bands, there is no licensed user, so the primary user is not formally present, but the benefits of the spectrum sensing and CR techniques are still valid. Regulation agencies stipulate that radios must implement some specific channel access techniques for certain RF bands, such as frequency hopping spreading spectrum (FHSS) or direct sequence spreading spectrum (DSSS). By applying FHSS, a radio pair keeps changing the communication channel frequency over time, spreading the transmitting power over a wider bandwidth. In a point to point communication, FHSS is very reliable and have been used for a long time. IoT applications, wireless sensor networks (WSN) and smart grid solutions typically demand low power consumption in order to enable communication among hundreds or even thousands of devices. 2.1. Cooperative spectrum sensing The proposed cooperative cognitive radio network is presented in Fig. 1a. It is composed by the following blocks: sensing cell (SC); sensing cell controller (SCC); sensing information storage and analysis (SISA). The SC is responsible to acquire RF information, whereas the SCC detects users in the RF spectrum and SISA acts as a fusion center with the ability of collecting and aggregating information from many SCCs. The proposed approach provides higher level of RF spectrum usage information, with the purpose of allowing a dynamic spectrum allocation.

Cognitive radio blocks in the context of IoT: (a) data flow from sensing cell (SC) to sensing information storage and analysis (SISA); (b) radio interference scenario with three sensing cell controllers (SCCs). 2.1.1. Sensing cell (SC) The RF spectrum may be sensed by more than one sensing cell (SC), which includes a RF receiver, an antenna and a computational processing board. The SC hardware has been developed using a low-cost commercial hardware based on Raspberry PI 2 processing board and a digital video broadcasting-terrestrial (DVB-T) receiver acting as a RF receiver. The latter one has becoming popular in software-defined radio (SDR) applications [20]. SCs may be deployed over different locations in order to cover a wide geographic area, characterizing a cooperative network scenario. More than one source of spectrum sensing information may be used to provide information for a real-time RF spectrum allocation. The proposed cooperative network reduces the hidden node problem effect, providing information to discover distinct sectors, then improving the RF spectrum usage efficiency [21]. Traditional CR implementations define a radio capable to sense the spectrum, while performing its usual communication functionality [6]. Since the objective is to employ low resource devices that may not have enough processing capacity to run a spectrum sensing algorithm, the SCs may be used as a support system to existent fixed frequency systems. For this reason, in the proposed system, the SCs are sensing-only devices. It is feasible to implement the sensing algorithm over more powerful IoT devices. In context of IoT, a network commonly has its own border router or gateway that acts as a network coordinator and interface to the Internet. The SC acquires samples from RF spectrum for demodulating them to a baseband digital signal. The digital signal is delivered to the processing board, which encapsulates the RF information into TCP/IP packets to be sent to a SCC. 2.1.2. Sensing cell controller (SCC) The sensing cell controller (SCC) has two important roles in the proposed system: (i) it configures the SC receiver parameters; (ii) it performs the energy detector computation to be sent to SISA. The SCC runs on a standard desktop computer and all energy detection algorithm is performed by applying previously-developed GNU Radio framework, which is a free software tool that provides a set of processing blocks with focus on SDR usage. By controlling the SC parameters, such as radio central frequency and radio bandwidth, becomes possible to sense a wide RF spectrum, typically divided into RF channels. This functionality is very important, since the low-cost receiver has only 2 MHz bandwidth. The computed RF spectrum energy information is then sent to the SISA block. 2.1.3. Sensing information storage and analysis (SISA) The SISA block relies on a specific algorithm responsible to collect data from many SCCs and store this information in a database. The SISA information may be based on a specific region, or a specific RF spectrum band or even some calendar range. SISA provides a database information on the RF spectrum utilization divided in hours of a day, based on each SCC connected to it. The SISA has an API that allows some CR interested on its sensing information to put queries on spectrum information usage statistics. 2.1.4. Spectrum sensing based on energy detection Energy detection is considered the most simple spectrum sensing technique. It has been chosen to enable the use of low-cost components and, also, because it is the most appropriate technique when the transmitted signal is unknown [22]. The energy for N received RF signals (X) may be calculated as follows: (1) where the resultant value defines the test statistic variable T. The noise power variance must be known in order to define an optimal test statistic variable T′ given by: (2) The need of obtaining T′ is a drawback of the energy detection technique, since the system must measure or estimate the channel noise. From this estimate, it is possible to define a detection threshold λ that allows to evaluate the channel availability. The acquired T′ samples are compared to λ and stored in a detection vector Dv: (3) The percentage of samples with value greater than the threshold is counted and this information is forwarded to the SISA, as a detection information, indicating a quantitative presence of a RF signal in the sensing band: (4) 3. NovaGenesis architecture NovaGenesis (NG) is a research project that started in 2008, with the goal of answering the following question: “Imagine if there is no Internet architecture, how could we design it using the best contemporary technologies?” NovaGenesis scope includes not only data exchanging (like any other networking technology), but also data processing and storage (including cloud computing and networking cache). NG design considered a set of state-of-the-art ingredients, focusing on synergistically integrating them. 3.1. Motivation and advantages Cooperative spectrum sensing, spatial and temporal spectrum usage profiling, as well as dynamic resource allocation require the transfer and storage of the sensible information. The unrestricted access to spectrum samples can reveal private behavior, network infrastructure and weak performance points. Attackers can explore these weaknesses to cause unwanted interference, reducing the network throughput. False spectrum samples could create chaos in the resource managers. Collaborative spectrum sensing and dynamic resource allocation require more than performance. The provenance of spectrum samples should be guaranteed, creating a trustable network of sensing devices. Software control requires trust, privacy, provenance and integrity of control data. An illegitimate software controller can cause deliberate stopping of software-defined radios (SDRs). Software controllers and SDRs should establish a trustable network, working according to previously defined service level agreements (SLAs). Many Internet technologies were designed in the 70s. Despite of data integrity importance, it is still missing in the majority of TCP/IP networks today. A legacy of a time when security was not a big deal. According to Jacobson et al. [23], “trust in content is easily misplaced, relying on untrustworthy location and connection information”. Data security depends mainly on the available connection security, e.g. IPsec or security socket layer (SSL). Neither data, nor services are protected by their own names. Novel techniques such as self-verifying names (SVNes) can improve entities security and trust. Ghodsi et al. [4] contend on the security and privacy advantages of SVNes compared to the current Internet naming. In addition, data provenance is limited to the guarantees offered by the domain name service (DNS). However, DNSSEC standard is still in the early days of deployment and typically not available at low level domains, like the one presented in Fig. 1. Related works on IoT proposals, such as FIWARE [10], SENSEI [11] and SmartSantander [12] do not employ contract-based coordination of controllers and SDRs. NG “clean slate” design aims at fulfilling these gaps, bringing the following benefits to the scenario presented in Fig. 1: Unlimited namespaces: Not only natural language, but also SVNes can be employed to create as many namespaces as desired. Data, services, hardware and any other entity can be individually named, allowing persistent identification independently of location. This provides provenance, improving trustable operation [4], [13], [23], [24]. For this reason, we have redesigned the scenario of Fig. 1 with SVNes and other NovaGenesis ingredients (Section 3.2). Flexible name resolution: Current DNS can resolve a limited set of names [25]. However, emerging scenarios require extending these capabilities to other entities, such as data objects [13], [23], [24] and services [15]. NovaGenesis name resolution is generic to accommodate this requirement (Section 3.3). On the other hand, the scenario of Fig. 1 is dependent on the available DNS deployment at sensing cells and SISA domains. Service-oriented design (SOD): The role of software is becoming increasingly important in modern ICT. Contemporary software engineering like service-oriented design should be employed. FIWARE, SENSEI and SmartSantander employ RESTful APIs, but they lack on implementing the entire service life-cycle, which includes negotiation and contracting. Our approach implements service life-cycling not only for SDR services, but also for software-controllers. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to experimentally demonstrate SOD application in a convergent CRN, IoT, and future Internet proposal. In contrast, Fig. 1 architecture does not employ SOD. Software-controlled radio: SDR capabilities and allowed configurations are exposed to services during dynamic service composition. NG software-controllers can negotiate the available resources, capabilities and configurations with the dynamic resource managers, with the purpose of forming a trustable network. If the services agree to work together, SDRs are configured under the “umbrella” of the established SLAs. As far as we know, this feature has never been reported in literature up to the moment. NovaGenesis combines these emerging ingredients towards more flexible and trustable ICT environments. As a first conclusion, NovaGenesis can be applied to integrate IoT, CRN, FI, smart cities, next generation mobile networks, among other contemporary ICT environments. 3.2. Fundamental concepts NovaGenesis is based on a set of fundamental concepts that are required to better understand its design and contributions, namely: Naming: Names are symbols used to denote one or more individual entities, like pieces of digital contents, computers and ordinary things. In our case, denoting stands for representing something by “signals”. By definition, names denote meaning and sense. Natural language names (NLNes) are those used in the human language, such as “Node 1” or “Domain A”. However, there are names that have no meaning, for example, the self-verifying names1 (SVNes) generated from the output of a mathematical hash function [4]. For instance, a 32 bits name generated by NG using murmurhash 3 is “28FD4420”. SVNes are self-verifiable, because at any time the binary words used to generate them can be hashed again and get exactly the same output (name). Using SVNes as an alternative to NLNes [13], [24] makes possible to check the relationship between the named entity and its name at any time. According to Ghodsi et al. [4], SVNes provide better security, scalability, and flexibility than NLNes. Thus, the current paper proposes, for the first time, the use of SVNes in a joint IoT and cognitive radio scenario. Name binding: Our approach employs an unlimited number of namespaces that are linked by means of name bindings. A name binding (NB) is a mapping among two or more names, typically implemented as a vector in the form: < key; value(s) >. A NB can relate a name to an object or a name to other names. Fig. 2 illustrates a name binding scheme. The edges are NBs, whereas the vertices are NLNes or SVNes. For example, Domain 1 name is bound to Router 1 and Gateway 2. Obverse that NBs can represent entities relationships, i.e. “semantic operators” among entities, like is contained or contains. In the previous example, one can use the NB < Domain 1; Gateway 2 > to represent that Domain 1 contains a Gateway 2. Download : Download high-res image (143KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Graph of names and their bindings representing entities relationships. Colors are used to classify different types of physical and virtual entities. Name resolution: In context of Fig. 2, name resolution consists of resolving a name to other bound names, i.e. to determine the values behind a certain key. For example, the name Router 1 is bound to the names OS 6, while OS 6 can be resolved to Process 10 and Process 11. NG provides a distributed, hierarchical, name resolution service (NRS) that resolves NLNes or SVNes (keys) in one or more NLNes or SVNes (values). Identification and localization: An identifier unambiguously separates an entity from others in a certain scope. Considering Fig. 2, a scope can be denoted by the name Domain 1 and all the names of entities inhabiting this domain can belong to the same scope. In this context, the names Process 12 and 280273AA uniquely separate this entity from others. However, the name Process 12 could not be unique globally. In this scenario, SVNes can be used. Note also that Domain 1 can denote the location of the Gateway 2 in the network. Services and contracts: A service is a virtual entity responsible for processing, exchanging and storing information. According to this definition, a computer program is a service. NG follows SOA principles [14], in which services are dynamically composed. In SOA, services life-cycling is contract-based. It means that after peer services discovery, a contract is formulated and negotiated. Therefore, a contract can be defined as a piece of information that sets the limits, responsibilities and clauses to be respected, as well as criteria for the completion and punishment of services that were poorly executed. Proxies, gateways and controllers: A proxy is an attorney that represents other components in a network for any purpose. As an example, consider a Wi-Fi access point that is represented by a proxy service that “sells” its forwarding capacities. This proxy can negotiate the Wi-Fi capabilities to potential clients. Another important concept is a gateway, which translates or encapsulates messages of a certain input protocol to the desired output protocol. Finally, we define a controller as a service that makes the decision regarding devices or services configurations. The controlled device can be physical or virtual. 3.3. The NovaGenesis current implementation The NG web of names (i.e. name bindings graph shown in Fig. 2) is implemented in a distributed way. NBs are published and subscribed by services and stored on hash table data structures hosted by one or more operating system (OS). We have adopted an object oriented design (OOD) approach to implement NG components. Every service has several internal objects, called blocks, with specific functionalities. Two blocks are instantiated in all services: gateway (GW) and hash table (HT), as illustrated in Fig. 3. GW provides a bus for block communication inside a service or at different services. It uses SVNes in the message headers to decide how to forward/route messages. The HT block is a hash multimap data structure employed to stored NBs. The current implementation is based in four services: Download : Download high-res image (176KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Example of NovaGenesis one hop link scenario formed by two PGCS processes encapsulating NG messages over underlying hardware. PSS, GIRS and HTS encompass NovaGenesis name resolution services, which are used by two applications (APP1 and APP2) to communicate based on publish/subscribe model. Publish/subscribe service (PSS): NBs are published by any services through sending a message to an instance of a PSS. PSS provides the rendezvous between the publisher and subscriber services, allowing secure and private access to NBs. PSS implements the main NG application API that has six primitives: (i) publish NB (with associated data, if any); (ii) publish NB/data and notify other services about a publication; (iii) subscribe a NB/data; (iv) subscribe a NB/data and notify other services about a subscription; (v) deliver a subscribed NB/data; and (vi) revoke a NB/data publication. PSS can be seen as a distributed API, accessed via its names. Additionally, we have generalized PSS to allow pub/sub of contents associated to NBs, adding to this NRS a network cache functionality. Generic indirection resolution service (GIRS): PSS does not store bindings or data published, since it forwards them to a GIRS instance, which selects a proper hash table service (HTS) where they will be stored. The published NB/data are forwarded by GIRS to an HTS instance, where they are stored behind a hash table data structure. Therefore, GIRS is an intermediate service among PSS and HTS instances. Hash table system (HTS): HTS stores bindings and their associated contents, in case they exist. Consider for example the content named Sample 1 at Mote 3 of Fig. 2. This content will be stored as a file in a folder of an HTS instance. A name binding < 291074AA, Sample 1 > can relate the SVN of the content to its NLN. Proxy/gateway/controller service (PGCS): The component PGCS provides the following functions: (i) message encapsulation over already established networking technologies, such Ethernet or Wi-Fi; (ii) a proxy service to represent other NG services inside an OS; (iii) bootstrapping functionalities to initialize a domain; (iv) software-control of hardware or other computer programs outside NG environment. PGCS enables PSS, GIRS, and HTS to discover one another during initialization. Since an address is a name that denotes the position to where an existence can inhabit or be attached, PGCS relays on its local HT block or the domain HTS to store NBs among already established address formats (e.g. a real world or an emulated MAC Ethernet) and/or NG addresses. Independently of the address format used to connect PGCSes, inside NG all the communication is SVN-oriented. Additionally to the gateway service, PGCS publishes NBs about other NG services inside an OS to other PGCSes in the same domain, therefore propagating new services for their peers. NovaGenesis messages are implemented as information objects and serialized to ASCII character arrays with two portions: command lines (streamed from CommandLine objects) and payload (streamed from a file system archive). There is a bank line separating both. The command lines portion is composed by several textual lines, which can be dynamically expanded according to the need. The command lines are formatted as: ng -command –alternative version [ < n type E1 E2 E3 E4 ... En > ] where -command is the action to be done. -alternative selects among alternatives in the action to be done. version selects the desired version of implementation. [ ] indicates one or more vectorial arguments. n is the number of elements in an argument. type is the type of the elements in an argument. E1 E2 E3 E4 ... En are the elements of an argument. 3.4. Representing a spectrum cell controller in NovaGenesis In this Subsection, we describe two new services developed for NovaGenesis to interoperate and manage the low-cost collaborative sensing approach presented in Section 2. Our main goal is enabling the convergence between the spectrum sensing approach for IoT with the NG “clean slate” FIA. This work represents an extension of our previous work on CRN with NovaGenesis [18]. 3.4.1. Spectrum sensing service The spectrum sensing service (SSS) has been developed to expose dedicated spectrum sensing hardware or a software-defined radio (SDR) to NG services. It exposes the device features, capabilities and configurations, as well details of the available spectrum sampling procedures. Other NG services can discover, negotiate and contract spectrum sensing functionality via their SSS representatives. This service is also a gateway for: (i) dedicated spectrum sensing hardware or SDR, translating NG command lines to non NG configurations, e.g. JavaScript object notation (JSON); and for (ii) interconnection of TCP/IP and NG stacks, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Messages from SCC are encapsulated over TCP/IP using ZeroMQ2 (ZMQ) push/pull sockets and delivered to SSS. Inside NovaGenesis, SSS changes to publish/subscribe (pub/sub) model instead of ZMQ’s push/pull, publishing and subscribing NBs and information objects (like SLAs or spectrum samples) to/from name resolution service (NRS).3 Download : Download high-res image (159KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Protocol stack for NovaGenesis interoperability with SCC. SSS provides the interconnection between TCP/IP and NG stacks. SCC sends spectrum samples to SSS using ZMQ with TCP/IP/Ethernet. Inside NG, the communication model employs pub/sub of NG messages directly over Ethernet, meanwhile other link layer technologies can be used. In Fig. 4, SSS communicates with SCC through three ZMQ push/pull socket connections, which form two communication channels, one for data and another for software-control settings. The data channel carries the spectral sensing information obtained by the components SC (Section 2.1.1) and SCC (Section 2.1.2). The setup channel is formed by the second and third connections and it is used by NG to obtain and send settings for SC and SCC. The information exchanged between SSS and SCC are structured in strings using JSON format. It is encoded in key/value pairs, in which the key field identifies the name of a parameter or command, tied to its value. The configuration channel to NovaGenesis can perform two operations: the commands get_info and set_config. get_info : The get_info JSON command is sent by SSS to SCC in order to request the spectral sensing available functionalities, identifying information of the sensing cell and the parameters of the current configuration of spectral sensing. The answer contains: (i) the sensing capabilities of the SCC in the key capacities; (ii) the cell identification information in the key cell_info; and (iii) the current spectrum sensing configuration. set_config : This command is sent from SSS to SCC to adjust spectrum sensing parameters according to a resource management service (RMS), which will be presented in Section 3.4.2. They are the start and end sampling frequencies in Hz. Also, the sampling bandwidth can be configured. data: The spectrum energy data is continuously transmitted from SCC to SSS. Fig. 5 illustrates the format of this data. The key scc_id uniquely identifies the SCC that generated the data. The key msgid provides a message sequence number, while the key date carries a timestamp of the sample. Last but not least, the key sensor contains the estimated probability that the related channel is busy. Download : Download high-res image (80KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Example of data format from SCC to SSS. The information collected by SSS is forwarded to a peer resource management service (RMS), whose responsibility includes data aggregation and correlation in a similar way to SISA. A SLA proposal describes the sampling features of spectrum sensing or SDR equipment it represents, such as rates, resolution, output format, among many others. 3.4.2. Resource management service (RMS) RMS implements a name-based, contract-oriented, dynamic orchestration of substrate resources exposed by SSS (other NG services are being developed, but they are out of the scope of this paper). RMS mediates the relationship among user applications and the SSS instances, inside NG cloud/networking (without TCP/IP). When a SSS discovers a RMS, it proposes a SLA with a description of the service to be provided. RMS accepts the contract and starts being notified of the SSSes’ publications to become aware of the situation of the radio spectrum opportunities in the ISM bands. 3.4.3. Sequence diagram of interoperability solution Fig. 6a and b provide a sequence diagram of the actions implemented to transport SCC spectrum samples to the NG RMS. In message a, both SSS and RMS publish their NBs to the PSS/GIRS/HTS (hereafter, called NRS for short). In message b, they subscribe possible peer keywords, e.g. “resource”, “manager”, “sensing”. NRS returns bindings containing the subscribed keywords in message c. These NBs, have in the value portion SVNes of services candidate to be a peer. Table 1 summarizes the messages exchanged among these components, giving details on technologies and message's content.

Sequence diagram: (a) Spectrum sensing service (SSS) and resource management service (RMS) expose their names and discover one another (a,b,c). SSS represents sensing cell controller (SCC) inside NG, publishing an offer to the RMS containing SCC capabilities (d,e,f). (b) RMS publishes a contract acceptance that is subscribed by SSS (g,h). Spectrum samples are subscribed by RMS (i,j,k). Configuration files are published to SSS (l,m,n) and delivered to SCC (o). Table 1. Summary of messages exchanged in sequence diagram of Fig. 6a and b. Msg. Description Stack a Publishing of bindings for service exposing. NG/Eth. b Subscription of bindings for service discovery. NG/Eth. c Delivery of bindings of possible peers. NG/Eth. d SCC answers to get_info command sent by SSS. TCP/IP/Eth. e SSS publishes service offer with SCC configuration. NG/Eth. f RMS subscribes SSS’s service offer and analyses it.

NG/Eth. n NRS delivers the configuration file to SSS. NG/Eth. o SSS translates the file and configures SCC. TCP/IP/Eth. During SSS initialization, it sends a get_info message to the SCC. When the answer returns in message d, SSS is able to make a service offer to RMS, specifying the possible configurations at SCC. SSS publishes the offer to the NRS, notifying the candidate RMS in message e. RMS subscribes the service offer object as illustrated in message f. In the current prototype, RMS just accepts this offer publishing a service acceptance object (message g). In future versions, we plan to add negotiation actions between them. Observe that these offer and acceptance objects are transferred using SVNes in the header of NG messages. Also, the keys used to subscribe these objects are used to verify their integrity. To the best of our knowledge, NG is the first FIA that checks integrity and provenance of data objects. In message h, SSS subscribes the service acceptance object published by the RMS and notified by the NRS. Then, when SCC publishes a data JSON like in message i, SSS publishes and notifies the peer RMS (message j). RMS then subscribes the data, as illustrated in message k. Finally, RMS can request SSS to change some configuration on SCC. In this case, it publishes a software-configuration object (message l) that is notified to the peer SSS. The SSS component subscribes the object (message m), which is delivered by NRS in message n. SSS translates the configuration object to the JSON format as expected by the SCC and forwards to SCC (message o). SCC then changes the configuration at the GNU Radio, which reflects the change on the hardware. 3.5. Comparison to our previous approach without NG Fig. 7 illustrates the TCP/IP over Ethernet stack as used to implement the scenario of Section 2. The SISA component has the following internal blocks: (i) input/output (IO) control; (ii) data access object (DAO), which is an interface to a MongoDB data base; (iii) information analysis, which provides algorithms to analyze data stored on the data base; and (iv) the data base itself. The communication between IO (and IA) to DAO uses ZMQ. From DAO to MongoDB a Linux system call is employed to invoke a TCP socket. Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Stack for cooperative spectrum sensing using TCP/IP and ZeroMQ push/pull. A comparison of Fig. 4 with Fig. 7 indicates that Section 2 components (SC, SCC, SISA) employ TCP/IP over Ethernet as its communication stack, whereas NovaGenesis components (SSS, NRS, PGCS, and RMS) run NG directly over Ethernet without TCP/IP. SSS works as a gateway between the two stacks. In the Section 2 scenario, not only push/pull, but also client/server communication models are employed. On the other hand, NG employs only pub/sub due to its security, privacy and asynchronous communication features. We can summarize some of the differences between these scenarios as: Naming: Content and services are accessed using their self-verifying names (SVNes). Message forwarding/routing also employs SVNes. In contrast, ZMQ and TCP/IP only allows structured natural language names, which do not have the intrinsic security characteristics of SVNes [4]. Name resolution: In current Internet the name resolution is provided by DNS. In NovaGenesis, NRS does a similar role, but using pub/sub of domain name records. Limited service-orientation: In ZMQ/Internet, the service-oriented design (SOD) is employed only on the WWW, whereas in NovaGenesis it is for all services, including networking ones. Life-cycling: It encompasses the dynamic composition of services and their contents. In the Internet architecture it is present only at WWW. In NovaGenesis, life-cycling is intrinsic to any entity: content, services, operating systems (OSs), hosts, etc. The same pattern happens for contract-based operation. Deployment in hosts: Internet protocols are implemented at the core of operating systems. NovaGenesis protocols in hosts are implemented as services that follow SOD paradigm. 3.6. Next steps and open challenges We plan to implement the complete Fig. 1 scenario in NovaGenesis, with the aim at extending NG services to control Wi-Fi access points based on RMS decisions. We are also extending our NRS to hierarchical domains, as an alternative to DNS. In addition, we have already started implementing NG message encapsulation to other IoT technologies, such as IEEE 802.15.4. Furthermore, we have been developing an embedded proxy/gateway service (EPGS) to run inside energy constrained devices. Considering project activities up to now, we can summarize some open challenges for NG (and other FIAs) evolution as: Scalability and elasticity evaluation: Emerging architectures need to prove unprecedented levels of scalability and elasticity, especially due to the growths on the number of devices and services expected for IoT [2]. An open problem is how to evaluate “clean slate” proposals if experimentation technologies are dependent on TCP/IP? Testing revolutionary architectures require raw socket/link layer solutions or even interfaces for physical layer. Appropriate methodologies for comparison: New architectures such as NovaGenesis, expressive Internet architecture (XIA) [24] and network of information (NetInf) [13] employ novel ingredients, combined in a unique way. It is not trivial to determine the common and fair aspects to be compared, since it does not exist a standard benchmark methodology for FIA comparison. New methodologies for large-scale architectures comparison are required. Diversity of scenarios: Another hurdle is the diversity of scenarios that should be evaluated. Our contemporary Internet is huge and full of protocols. Therefore, new tools are required to automate experiments and results analysis. SmartSantander [12] and FIWARE [10] are examples of experimentation architectures for smart cities. However, as previously stated, many of their tools require TCP/IP and spectrum sensing capabilities are not available. Tools and experiments reproducibility: tcpdump is a famous tool for monitoring and evaluating TCP connections. Despite developing new architectures, researchers also need to develop tools for experimentation and performance evaluation of their proposals. 4. Results and analysis We divided this section in two parts. Firstly, we analyze the effects of an interfering radio in the quality of communication between two IoT nodes in the 915 MHz ISM band. Our low-cost cooperative sensing approach is used to determine the best channel for the pair of IoT communicating devices. Secondly, we demonstrate a convergent solution of future Internet and cognitive radio in the context of IoT. A complete life-cycle of spectrum management services is performed, from service exposition and discovery up to service contracting and trustable transfer of spectrum data to a resource management service. 4.1. Low cost cooperative sensing and cognitive radio The implementation scenario of the low-cost cooperative cognitive radio for IoT applications was reported in Fig. 1b from Section 2. A pair of radios M1 and M2 have been used as IoT devices establishing a communication link; their hardware are composed by two Texas Instruments reference designs based on RF transceiver CC1120. The experiments have been realized from 902 to 928 MHz, which is a frequency range reserved for unlicensed ISM applications. The radios have been configured to continuously transmit packets with 50 bytes length at a fixed data rate of 150 Kbps using 2-GFSK modulation. The radios are placed away from each other in such a position that a communication between them is possible when no interference is present. Near each radio a SC was placed so M1 and M2 may be sensed by SC1 and SC2, respectively. Another radio Mint that acts as an interference source by means of generating random RF spectrum utilization was placed close to the SC1. Mint behaves such as a communication device that does not belongs to this IoT network, characterizing a multi-user RF environment. In a practical environment, a perfect isolation of RF boundaries is not possible, so the SCs will also sense some signal from neighbor radio as well the interfering source. Table 2 summarizes the adopted experimental parameters. Table 2. Experimental parameters. Parameters Actual values Variable parameters M1 and M2 frequencies 921 and 924  MHz Mint transmit probability 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80% RF transmission power –21, –17 and –14  dBm Measured RSSI –95, –91 and –87  dBm Fixed parameters Sensed spectrum range 902 to 927  MHz Mint frequency 921  MHz Digital modulation 2-GFSK Channel bandwidth 200  kHz Bit rate 150 kbps Data transport Packet Packet size 50 Bytes PER test 5000 Packets per test The experiments have been carried out for different values of receiver signal strength indication (RSSI) by changing the M2 transmission power. The probability of the radio Mint be transmitting have been modified to evaluate its influence over the link communication. Fig. 8 reports the experimental results where the packet error rate (PER) parameter has been used as a performance figure of merit. Five thousand packets have been sent in and the amount of successfully received packets were recorded. Initially, it was considered that the radios M1 and M2 does not have information about RF spectrum usage, so the 921  MHz channel was selected, the same being used by Mint. During the experiment the interfering radio Mint randomly transmit messages that are not demodulated by M1 or M2 but interferes on link communication increasing the PER. Posteriorly, an additional test has been carried out by means of using the SISA information reported in Fig. 9, for setting radios M1 and M2. As a centralized source of information, SISA indicates the channel 921  MHz is in use and the channel 924  MHz is available. The hidden node problem is present as SC2 does not sense Mint signal as shown in Fig. 9b. Note that the vertical axis in this figure corresponds to Eq. 4 Detection values. When SC1 information Mint is detected (Fig. 9a) the usage of the 921  MHz channel is avoided. The PER measurement have been conduced again with radios using the 924  MHz channel. It has been kept lower than 5%. Download : Download high-res image (129KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Packet error rate (PER) measurements.

Interoperation with NovaGenesis Fig. 10 presents our concept of a convergent solution of future Internet and cognitive radio in the context of Internet of Things. The computer on the left side runs SCC using GNU Radio, whereas the one in the middle runs five NovaGenesis services, including SSS for interoperability with SCC and PSS to provide a distributed API for NG pub/sub service, and a PGCS that encapsulates NovaGenesis messages over Ethernet/Wi-Fi. The computer on the right runs a PGCS and a RMS. RMS is the target of the spectrum samples collected at SCC, forwarded to SSS, published to PSS, and finally subscribed by RMS.

Exposition and discovery Fig. 11 contains a partial reproduction of the log of an SSS exposition message published to the PSS. The first command line with the command ng -m –cl is used by NovaGenesis to route the message to the destination. NG employs a name-based routing approach based on tuples of self-verifying names. The argument [ < 4 s 0BD95286 ED12F3ED 342DD4C5 B8101939 > ] contains a tuple that identify/locate the source of the message (SSS) and the argument [ < 4 s 0BD95286 ED12F3ED 449B0B0C 6FDF0A76 > ] provides the ID/Loc for the PSS. The command line ng -p –b is used to publish name bindings, therefore exposing keywords related to the SSS, e.g. the key 19656CF3 is the hash of the word “Wi-Fi”. This log is exactly an example of the message a from Fig. 6a. In the discovery process, the RMS subscribes keywords from the PSS that represent a possible peer (message b).

Fig. 12 reproduces the message that carries a Service_Offer_2026721035.txt object (message e in Fig. 6a). The pub/notify command line (ng -p –notify) contains the name binding < 1 s 3182F342 > < 1 s Service_Offer_2026721035.txt >, which links the SVN 3182F342 to the .txt file.

Finally, in Fig. 14b it is plotted the mean round trip time (RTT) spend by the RMS to subscribe spectrum sensing objects from PSS/GIRS/HTS. In the first 9 h, the RTT remained linear about 5.2 ms. After, it suffered a small increase probably due to the large amount of sample files stored at the HTS. All the samples have been stored. As a conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a straightforward and innovative convergence of IoT, FI and cognitive radio.

Conclusions This paper presented, for the first time, a successful convergence of cognitive radio network (CRN), Internet of Things (IoT) and a future Internet architecture (FIA) called NovaGenesis. We first report a low-cost embedded cooperative sensing and cognitive radio architecture for IoT. In this solution software-control is provided using current Internet technology. Moreover, we have experimentally demonstrated the use of cooperative spectrum sensing based on energy detection to overcome the hidden node problem, which for sure will be present in IoT. We measured PER as a function of RSSI to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed CRN. We have also extended NovaGenesis with two novel services to interoperate with the aforementioned CRN: spectrum sensing service (SSS) and resource management service (RMS). SSS interoperates with a sensing cell controller, which has a GNU Radio implementation for determining energy level at channels. The SCC spectrum samples are sent to SSS using TCP/IP. SSS translates the data objects from JSON to NovaGenesis and publishes them to the RMS (without TCP/IP). RMS subscribes the data objects according to their self-verifying names (SVNes), checking provenance and integrity. The novelties we demonstrated are typically found only in FIA research: exposition and discovery of services; contract-based operation; distributed name resolution using keywords and SVNes; and name-based routing of messages among services. These features allow the convergence among IoT, CRN and FIAs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time spectrum sensing for IoT have been combined with a FIA. Future works include the evaluation with different radios, sensing cells, interference sources arrangements and spectral sensing algorithms. Finally, we also plan to extend NovaGenesis services to have the same software-control architecture (including SISA). In this way, we will be able to compare the performance and scalability of both current Internet and FIA approaches.

  Explanation: In this paper, the authors present a cooperative, distributed spectrum sensing approach for use in a cognitive radio network (CRN) with varying conditions. They take a parameter estimation approach to the spectrum sensing problem and use the Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) method based on the diffusion strategy under multiple frequency bands and investigate its efﬁciency and robustness in the presence of changes in the sensing environment, including interference and congestion.

The main objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of the ATC diffusion-based method in more challenging and practical scenarios, where some frequency bands stop being utilized by some primary users (PUs), or where there is a mobile SU node in the network. The authors consider a network of three static PUs with overlapping power spectrums and a set of K = 11 geographically distributed SUs that communicate via a connected network. The network is divided into different frequency zones, and each SU is interested in a subset of these zones. The PUs cease to use some of the frequent zones during different time intervals, and one of the SUs becomes mobile and changes position and frequency bands of interest over time.

The authors analyze the performance of the ATC method by monitoring the estimation error of the involved parameters that approximate the total power spectrum. They evaluate the convergence and accuracy of the ATC method in estimating the global and common interest parameter vectors and compare its performance with a non-cooperative LMS algorithm. Their results show that the ATC method outperforms the non-cooperative LMS algorithm, and that the use of adaptive combination weights further improves the estimation accuracy.

The work presented in this paper is relevant to the review intention as it provides a detailed analysis of the performance of a cooperative, distributed spectrum sensing approach under realistic and challenging conditions. The authors have conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of their approach and have provided insights into its behavior under different scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid growth in wireless communications, coupled with insufﬁcient utilization of the
spectrum, led to the development of new wireless services and the promising technology of cognitive
radio (CR) networks, which facilitate periodic access to the unoccupied spectrum bands and thus
increases spectral efﬁciency. A fundamental task in CR networks is spectrum sensing, through which
unauthorized secondary users (SUs) detect unoccupied bands in the spectrum. To achieve this, an
accurate estimate of the power spectrum is necessary. From this perspective, and given that many
other factors can affect individual detection, such as pathloss and receiver uncertainty, we aim to
improve its estimate by exploiting the spatial diversity in the SUs’ observations. Spectrum sensing
is treated as a parameters estimation problem, assuming that the parameters’ vector of each SU
consists of some global and partially common parameters. To exploit this modeling, distributed
and cooperative spectrum sensing is the subject of interest in this study. Diffusion techniques, and
especially the Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) method will be exploited, where each SU cooperates
with a group of nodes in its neighborhood that share the same parameters of interest. We consider
a network of three static PUs with overlapping power spectrums, and thus, frequency bands. The
performance of the employed method will be evaluated under two scenarios: (i) when the PUs
spectrum varies, since some frequency bands are not yet utilized, and (ii) when the frequency bands
of the PUs are ﬁxed, but there is a mobile SU in the network, changing regions and parameters
of interest. Experimental results and performance analysis reveal the ATC algorithm robustness
and efﬁciency.

1. Introduction
The radio frequency spectrum is an inherently limited resource. Many services pro-
vided to users every day are based on the broadcast of radio signals (radio, television,
telephony, broadband internet, defense applications (e.g., radar), scientiﬁc uses such as
meteorology, positioning (GPS), etc.). New technologies, such as the Internet of Things
and Machine-to-Machine communication, appear that rely on the use of wireless radio
systems (UMTS, Wi-Fi, WiMax, Digital TV, 5G, and B5G). Additionally, the transition to
multimedia applications, and in general, the rapid growth in wireless communications
have contributed to a great demand for the development of new wireless services for both
the authorized and unauthorized frequency spectrums [1].
At the same time, the electromagnetic spectrum, because of greater and greater in-
creases in demand, is in short supply. Most of it is occupied by already existing services
and applications. Therefore, to assign a part of the electromagnetic spectrum to a new
service, an existing one should be replaced, cease its operation, and thus free the requested
spectrum band. However, the electromagnetic spectrum will still be fully occupied. On the
other hand, a signiﬁcant part of the already allocated spectrum has limited or sporadic
usage, thus leading to its underuse.

All of the above create the requirement for continuously available spectrum frequen-
cies without interference. Recent studies have shown that the current ﬁxed spectrum
assignment policy has imposed insufﬁcient use of the spectrum. In recent years, dynamic
spectrum management in 5G networks is more necessary, due to the increasing demand for
free frequencies solving the problem of spectral inadequacy [2]. To address this problem,
Cognitive Radio Networks have been brought to the foreground as a promising technology
that facilitates periodic access to unoccupied frequency bands, contributing to the increase
in spectrum efﬁciency [3].
According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), cognitive radio is
a system that senses its operating electromagnetic environment and can dynamically
and autonomously adjust its radio operating parameters to modify the operation of the
system, such as to maximize the throughput, mitigate interference, facilitate interoperability
and access the secondary networks. Hence, one main purpose of cognitive radio is the
autonomous exploitation of the locally unused part of the spectrum (spectrum holes) with
the aim of providing new access paths to it [4].
The main functions of the cognitive radio networks (spectrum sensing, management,
mobility, sharing) are represented in a cycle called the cognitive radio cycle [5]. Cognitive
Networks manage the problem of congestion frequencies by introducing the occasional use
of frequency bands that are not occupied by authorized users and are known as spectrum
holes. The CR network users can share the spectrum with primary users. Primary users
have higher priority or authorization in the use of an available piece of the spectrum, and
use the service to which the speciﬁc bandwidth is assigned, thus maximizing the degree of
spectrum utilization [6]. Secondary users of the cognitive network have a lower priority
and exploit the available spectrum in such a way that they do not create interference with
primary users. The fundamental work of each of the SUs is to detect and identify the
presence or absence of authorized users, known as primary users. It is usually achieved
by sensing the RF environment through a process called spectrum sensing. The way of
measuring and exploiting the spectral space is called spectrum coverage, which is stated
as being a frequency band that is not used by its PU, at a speciﬁc time, in a speciﬁc
geographic area [7]. CR networks, along with device-to-device communication, are two key
technologies for efﬁcient spectrum sharing, especially in next-generation networks [8,9].
In the current study, we will be concerned with cooperative sensing, and especially
distributed learning and distributed estimation methods about intelligent wireless sensor
networks similar to [10]. Speciﬁcally, our aim is to estimate the total spectrum of three PUs
with overlapping frequency bands. Capitalizing on the relevant literature, the problem has
been previously studied for either independent [11] or overlapping spectrums among two
PUs [12]. Additionally, the main contribution of the presented analysis is the evaluation
of the ATC diffusion-based method in more challenging and practical scenarios, where
some frequency bands stop being utilized by some PUs, or where there is a mobile SU
node in the network. The experimental results verify the efﬁciency of the method in such
challenging conditions.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the relevant spectrum
sensing works with the subject under consideration. Furthermore, in Section 3, an analysis
of the system model and the adopted methodology followed are made. In addition,
in Section 4, we discuss the acquired research results. Finally, conclusions and future
directions are outlined in Section 5.

2. Spectrum Sensing Methods
In this section, we will present the most common spectrum detection techniques where
each user individually decides if some frequency band in the spectrum is available for
use. In particular, we will focus on the most popular in wireless communications, such as
Energy Detector (ED), Cyclo-stationary Feature Detection (CFD), Compressive Detection
(CD), and Matched Filter and Waveform-based technique [13,14]. Furthermore, we will
present recent works on spectrum sensing exploiting the capabilities of machine/deep
learning. Additionally, the section concludes with cooperative approaches.
2.1. Traditional Methods
An energy detector is a non-coherent method that identiﬁes the primary signal based
on the detected energy. It is the most common method due to its low computational
and implementation complexity. Because of its simplicity and non-requirements for prior
knowledge of the primary signals, the energy detector is the most popular technique in
cooperatives spectrum sensing. The signal is detected by comparing the output of the
detector to a threshold, which depends on the noise level [15]. However, the detection
time to achieve a speciﬁc detection probability may be high. In addition to, the detection
performance is subject to noise power uncertainty. An energy detector cannot be used to
distinguish between the primary and CR signals. As a result, CR users need to be strongly
synchronized and not transmit to the quiet period [6,16].
Cyclo-stationary Feature Detection (CFD) exploits the periodicity of the received
PU signal to identify its presence. It is a detection method that takes advantage of the
cyclo-stationary characteristics of the received signal, which is usually integrated into
(i) sinusoidal carrier frequencies, (ii) pulse sequences, (iii) signal periodicity, or (iv) its
statistical properties, such as mean value and autocorrelation [17]. Thus, CFD can dis-
tinguish between a telecommunication signal and the noise due to robustness at noise
uncertainty, and performs better than the energy detector at low SNR. Although this re-
quires prior knowledge of the signal characteristics, CFD can distinguish CR transmissions
from various PU signals. It eliminates the requirement to synchronize the energy detector
in cooperative detection. A weakness of this method is the high computational cost and
long detection time. Because of these issues, it is less common than energy detectors in
cooperative detection.
In the case of spectrum underutilization, compressive sensing techniques for cognitive
radio networks can be used to approximate and recover the detected spectrum, which
facilitates the detection of sparse primary signals in the wideband spectrum [18]. Hence,
the compressive detection techniques provide promising solutions for the fast recovery of
wideband signals and facilitate wideband detection with acceptable computational com-
plexity. In wideband cooperative compressive detection, SU nodes individually perform
compressive detection and cooperatively estimate the wideband spectrum by exchang-
ing spectrum estimates, and iteratively reach a collective decision by exchanging local
decisions [19].
Matched Filter [20] is the optimal method of detecting PUs signals when the transmit-
ted signal is known. The main advantage is the short required time for achieving a certain
probability compared to other methods that are discussed. The required number of samples
increases with O(1/SNR) for a given false alarm probability Pf a to low SNR. However, this
requires the SU to modulate the received signals. Therefore, this requires perfect knowledge
of the signal characteristics of PUs, such as bandwidth, operating frequency, modulation
type, pulse shape, and format framework [21].
Waveform-based is usually used in wireless systems with known standards to help
synchronization, or for other purposes. Such standards include preambles, midambles,
spread-out sequences, etc. The preamble is a sequence transmitted before each burst.
Sensors 2022, 22, 6692
4 of 20
The midamble is transmitted in the middle of a burst or a time slot. It uses the same model
as the energy detector. In the presence of a known pattern, detection can be performed
by correlating the received signal with a known copy of it. This method only applies to
systems with known signal patterns and is called coherent detection. This method is more
reliable, has a better time convergence, and the performance of the algorithm increases
with the length of the standard signal [21].
2.2. Recent Methods and Motivation
Apart from traditional spectrum sensing methods, researchers have turned to ma-
chine/deep learning [22], and Reinforcement and Federated Learning for efﬁcient spectrum
sensing. A reliable machine learning-based spectrum sensing in CR networks is presented
in [23]. Wang et al. surveyed dynamic spectrum allocation based on reinforcement learning
algorithms in cognitive radio networks [24]. Additionally, in [25], it is suggested that a
machine-learning-based opportunistic spectrum access approach exploits multi-armed
bandit (a powerful reinforcement learning tool) and matching theory. In [26], machine
learning techniques (support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest
neighbors (KNN)) are used to detect a PU in Mobile CR networks.
Classical local techniques can also be part of a cooperative framework for spectrum
sensing, which is usually employed to increase the detection reliability in either a cen-
tralized (e.g., Fusion Center), decentralized, or relay-assisted manner [27–29]. In [30,31],
cooperative spectrum sensing methods are suggested based on an energy detector. Alter-
native methods perform spectrum sensing in CR networks based on adaptive LMS-based
distributed cooperative methods [12,32,33]. Recently, in [34], spectrum sensing is solved
via federated learning, which is exploited for data distribution and model training over
many devices. The proposed method creates a common deep learning model for each user
group in the iterative process.
In the era of 5G networks, a high trend toward distributed and cooperative schemes
has emerged for important operations in the physical layer, with some remarkable examples
being spectrum sensing [35], beamforming [36], and channel estimation in the mmWave
spectrum [37,38]. Due to the persistent increase in smart devices, and the need for high
data rates with low latency, 5G and beyond networks have become more important than
ever. Essential technology for its successful implementation is direct Device-to-Device
(D2D) communication (e.g., for extending capacity and enabling scalability) with Internet-
of-Things (IoT) being a characteristic short-range application that will highly beneﬁt from
the capabilities of 5G networks. Focusing on spectrum sensing in a 5G IoT network,
geographically distributed SUs can sense multiple channels owned by PUs and decide via
cooperation on available spectrum holes using learning algorithms (i.e., centralized and
distributed).
In this study, distributed cooperative spectrum sensing will concern us, since such
schemes are adaptable and more robust against changes in topology, especially in mobile
and scalable IoT systems [39]. Focusing on a mobile CR network with overlapping spec-
trum PUs, a Bayesian machine learning approach for collaborative spectrum sensing has
been suggested in [40]. In a more recent study [41], the authors, considering clusters of
unmanned aerial vehicles, elaborated a diffusion-based distributed cooperative spectrum
sensing approach with adaptive weights, assuming a binary state model to describe channel
occupancy.
In the same direction, this study focuses on the problem of multi-task [42] parameter
estimation, assuming varying spectrum sensing and adopting a distributed diffusion-based
approach from a well-established family of techniques, which are preferable in wireless
sensor networks due to lower communication overhead and more improved performance,
compared with the centralized and non-cooperative strategies. In particular, we exploit
the distributed diffusion method ATC to cooperatively estimate the aggregated spectrum,
assuming a more complex scenario of three PUs with overlapping spectrums. Hence,
multiple clusters of users are derived, each of which relates to a common interest frequency

band. According to [11], a multi-task CR network is formulated. Initially, we evaluate the
efﬁciency of ATC, assuming that the spectrum of PUs is varying (i.e., we cease the use of
some frequency bands) and that secondary users are static. Finally, an interesting aspect of
this work constitutes the performance evaluation of the same method in the case where
one SU node is mobile.
3. Materials and Methods
In this section, we will present a description of the system model that approximates
the total power spectrum in a speciﬁc SU node, the main aspects of the adopted solution
method, and the deﬁnition of the necessary structures for the selected case study.
3.1. System Model
We consider Q PUs and K SUs. The power spectrum emitted by each PU can be
captured as a linear combination of some basis functions. Here, we choose Gaussian basis
functions. Each SU, through spectrum sensing, essentially detects the total spectrum from
all of the PUs of the area. The power spectrum from PU q is written as [43,44]
Sq =
B
∑
m=1
bqm fm(ejω)
= f ωwq, q = 1, 2, . . . , Q
(1)
where fm(ejω) = e
− (ω−ωm)2
2σ2m
and parameters ωm, σm are the central frequency and stan-
dard deviation (these parameters are part of the system design and thus a priori known),
f ω =
h
f1(ejω), f2(ejω), f3(ejω), . . . , fB(ejω)
i
is a vector with the basis functions, scalars
{bqm} denote the coefﬁcients of the basis expansion for user q, and wq = [bq1, bq2, . . . , bqB]T
is the vector with the factors involved in the linear combination of the basis functions. The
representation in (1) can well approximate an essential part of the power spectrum if B is
sufﬁciently large.
The power spectrum that a SU k detects by PU q is subjected to attenuation due to
the propagation path loss denoted as pqk. Path loss coefﬁcients are known and deﬁned
in advance in a training stage between PUs with each SU. Training is usually repeated
at regular intervals because the coefﬁcients may change (slowly) in time due to node
movement. When the transmitted spectrum travels from the PU to the SU, then the power
spectrum that is measured by the receiver of the SU k is pqkSq(ejω).
Hence, the total power spectrum from all PUs at SU k is written as
St

∑

receiver noise. Notice that wT
q stands for the {bqm}s involved in the power spectrum
composition of PU q; thus, wo
k concatenates the {bqm}s of all PUs Q.
At each time instant i, the SU k observes the received power spectrum in a discrete
frequency grid {ωr}, in the interval [0, π] under the measurement and/or model noise vk,r
with zero mean and covariance matrix Rvk of dimensions L × L:
dk,r(i) = uk,ωrwo

where vk is the measurement and/or model noise with zero mean and covariance matrix
Rvk of dimensions L × L. We have taken measurements at L different frequencies, and
for this reason, the matrix has L rows. As a result, in (6), a linear model is obtained for
estimating the parameters of interest in wo
k. All of the considered processing steps are also
illustrated in Figure 1.
The path loss factor is approximated according to the formula
pqk,i =
dqk,i
d0
−n
(7)
where dqk,i is the Euclidean distance of SU k to PU q at i, d0 is the reference distance which
is d0 = 1, and n models the attenuation environment in the network. Hence, the path loss
values between SU k and the Q PUs is captured in
pk,i =
h
p1k,i, p2k,i, p3k,i, . . . , pQk,i

.
(8)
In the estimation of pk,i, we consider a respective measurement Gaussian noise of zero
mean and standard deviation σp; thus, ˆpk,i = pk,i + nk. When the SU k moves, the values of
pk change as its distance from the PUs changes, and consequently its values.

To estimate the spectrum, it is sufﬁcient to estimate the parameters vector that multi-
plies the basis functions. By relying on the network data {dk,i, Uk,i}, we treat the problem
Sensors 2022, 22, 6692
7 of 20
as a parameter estimation of multiple interests and assume cooperation among the nodes
to process the data in a distributed fashion based on a diffusion strategy, e.g., Adapt-Then-
Combine (ATC). The aforementioned strategy well approximates the centralized solution
when all nodes want to estimate the same vector of parameters [12].
Each vector {wo
k}K
k=1 might consist of parameters of global interest to the whole net-
work, parameters of common interest to subsets of nodes including node k, and parameters
of local interest for node k. In particular, subsets of parameters in wo
k may account for:
•
One global parameter vector related to the frequency band in the power spectrum of
all PUs, which affects all SUs in the network.
•
J common parameter vectors associated with frequency bands in the power spectrum
of PUs that affect speciﬁc subgroups of nodes with partially or fully overlapped
common interests.
Finally, in this study, we have not considered parameters of local interest.
In this way, considering a scenario where there are J different subsets of common
parameters, the observation model provided in (6) can be reformulated as
dk,i = Ukg,iwo
g + ∑
j∈Ik
Ukcj,iςo
k,j + vk,i,
(9)
where each node aims to solve through cooperation the following optimization problem

(10)
with respect to wg, ς1, ς2, . . . , ςJ, where Ik is an ordered set of indices j associated with
the vectors ςj that are of interest to node k, Ukg, Ukcj are matrices of dimensions L × Mg,
L × Mcj that consist of the columns of Uk,i associated with the wg and the ςk,j, respectively.
Some statistical independence assumptions [12] on the data are the following:
•
vk,i
is temporally and spatially white noise,
whose covariance matrix is
Rvk,i = E{vH
k,ivk,i}, and which is independent of Uk,i for all k and i, with k ∈
{1, 2, . . . , K} and i > 0;
•
Uk,i is independent of Uk,j, with i, j > 0 and i ̸= j (temporal independence);
•
Uk,i is independent of Um,i, with k, m ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K} and k ̸= m (spatial independence
refers to different SUs);
•
Ukg,i, Ukcj,i are independent for all k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , K} and j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , J} (indepen-
dence among the global and common parameter vectors).
Under the assumption that all regressors Uk,i are spatially and temporally independent,
the unbiased asymptotic convergence of the diffusion-based ATC LMS algorithm with the
previous combiners is satisﬁed for any initial condition, and any choice of the combiners,
if step size µ takes values that are sufﬁciently small and that satisfy the inequality relation
0 < µk < 2/λmax(R(Uk), k = 1, 2 . . . , K, where λmax is the maximum eigenvalue of the
autocorrelation matrix R(Uk) of the transformed measurements’ model in (9).
3.2. Distributed Solution: ATC Diffusion-Based LMS
Distributed and adaptive schemes are usually adopted to improve energy efﬁciency,
robustness, and scalability. In this study, we will exploit the diffusion method ATC, which
consists of an adaptation and a combination step [12]. In the following, we will describe
the main steps of the method, which are also illustrated in Figure 2. Before presenting ATC,
a list of useful designations is shown in Table 1. The main steps of the ATC algorithm are
the following:

3.3. Case Study: Cognitive Radio Network with Three PUs of Overlapping Frequency Spectrum
We have considered a network of Q = 3 PUs with an overlapping power spectrum,
as illustrated in Figure 3, and a set of K = 11 geographically distributed SUs that commu-
nicate via a connected network, as shown in Figure 4. The nodes are interconnected by a
graph G(V, E), where V = {1, 2, . . . , K} is the set of nodes and E = {(i, j) : Node i ∈ V is
connected with node j ∈ V}.
In the network, there is one global interest frequency band d and J = 6 common interest
frequency bands denoted as a, b, c, e, z, h, where PU1 = {a, b, c, d}, PU2 = {b, d, e, h} and
PU3 = {c, d, e, z}.
Each of the following sets includes the nodes interested in the corresponding frequency
band, and thus, the parameters of wo
k involved in the spectrum approximation. Based on
this concept, we assume that there are the following sets:
•
Frequency zone a: C1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
•
Frequency zone b: C2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11]
•
Frequency zone c: C3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
•
Frequency zone e: C4 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
•
Frequency zone z: C5 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
•
Frequency zone h: C6 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11]

According to these sets, SU1 is located at the coverage area of PU1 and is interested in
frequency bands a, b, c, d. SU4 is in the range of PU1, PU2, and PU3, and is interested in
all frequency bands. SU2 is in the coverage of PU1 and PU2 and is interested in all zones
except for z. Based on the common interest sets Cj, j = 1, 2, . . . , J with J = 6, we construct
a binary matrix whose columns refer to the number of global and common frequency
bands or interest parameter vectors, and its rows capture the SUs in the network. Its
size is K × (J + 1) and is deﬁned as C(k, j) =

all SU nodes are interested in, while the remaining relate to the common interest bands
a, b, c, e, h, z. More speciﬁcally, this matrix is as follows:

Moreover, we consider that for each of the frequency bands of common interest,
a parameters’ vector of size Mcj × 1 should be estimated, while for the global interest
frequency band, one parameters vector of size Mg × 1 should be estimated. We create the
matrix Caug
k
of size L × (Mg + ∑J
j=1 Mcj) based on the interests matrix C. At each row of the
matrix C, the ﬁrst column element is duplicated Mg times, and each one of the rest elements
is duplicated Mcj times. Then, each row is duplicated L times. Hence, the augmented
matrix Caug
k
is created and the "correct" input matrix at ATC is Uaug = Caug
k
Uk,i (point by
point multiplication) at SU node k and time instant i. Essentially, the Caug
k
ﬁlls with zeros

The performance evaluation of the ATC method is based on Mean Square Deviation

with adaptive weights. The MSD is deﬁned as

Algorithms 1–3. More speciﬁcally, Algorithm 1 is utilized to generate the data that will be
used as input to Algorithm 3, which estimates the parameters vector and the MSD for all
users in the network.
Additionally, this algorithm exploits internally Algorithm 2, which implements the
Equations (13)–(16) in order to create the matrices Cg, Ccj involved in the combination step
of global and common (uniform and adaptive, respectively). If we set t = 1 (global) and
t = 2 (common) in the Rule functions inside Algorithm 3, the results correspond to the
uniform weights combination rule.

4. Results and Discussion
In this section, we present the results of the ATC algorithm performance evalua-
tion, which is used to estimate the Q · B = Mk = Mg + ∑j∈Ik Mcj parameters that ap-
proximate the total power spectrum emitted by the three PUs. Here, we assume that
M1 = M2 = . . . = MK = M. The problem is translated into a multiple interests (global and
common) parameter estimation problem.
The performance of the adopted method was evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations
with 50 independent runs [45]. We simulated a network consisting of Q = 3 PUs and
K = 11 SUs, as illustrated in Figure 3. Additionally, we have considered B = 16 Gaussian
basis functions of amplitude normalized to one and standard deviation σm = 0.05. These
functions are involved in (2), and especially, in the creation of Uk,i in the linear model of (6).
Furthermore, each SU scans L = 50 channels over the normalized frequency axis between 0
and 1. The noise vk,i in (6) or (9) is zero-mean Gaussian with a standard deviation varying
between 0.04 and 0.16 for different k. Similarly, the additive noise nk in path loss estimation
is generated with σp ∈ [0.03, 1.25]. In Figure 5, we illustrate the noise power of each SU
node. The step-size µk of the LMS adaptation at each node is equal to 0.02 ∀k. Additionally,
we selected Mg = 10, Mc1 = 3, Mc2 = 5, Mc3 = 6, Mc4 = 7, Mc5 = 8, Mc6 = 9.

4.1. Static SU Nodes and Varying Spectrum
Here, the term varying spectrum is utilized to capture the case where the PUs ceases to
use some of the frequent zones a, b, c, d, e, z, h. In this case, we aim to examine the behavior
of the ATC algorithm by monitoring if the parameters’ estimation error has the desired
behavior. SUs are not aware of these changes, but through the measurements {dk,i, Uk,i}
and the estimation error of the involved parameters that approximate the total power
spectrum, they learn of the changes that occur in the broadcasting spectrum of the PUs.
To evaluate the above conditions, we run the algorithm so that in different time intervals,
the use of a particular frequency band is cancelled. The cancellation is achieved by setting
zero values to the corresponding optimal parameters in the augmented vector wk which is
used internally in the algorithm for estimating the MSD. Speciﬁcally, we selected to cancel,
in speciﬁc time intervals, the use of the following parameter vectors:
•
15–20: Mg parameters of wg,
•
60–70: Mc1 parameters of ς1,
•
110–120: Mc2 parameters of ς2.
In Figure 6, we present the average performance of MSD error for the aforementioned
interest vectors. As it is shown, the ATC method identiﬁes this change in the sensing
environment, which is captured in the MSD error of these parameter vectors. For com-
parison, we also plot the performance of the non-cooperative LMS algorithm, setting the
adjacent matrix as A = IK. The results verify the importance of cooperation in relation
to individual estimation. Moreover, comparing the two methods for the estimation of the
combination weights, the superiority of adaptive ﬁltering is veriﬁed. The nodes working
together to achieve spectrum estimation do not know in advance which neighboring nodes
are affected by which model and which model affects their own data. A node with different
interests may feed its neighbors with irrelevant data, that is, with incorrect estimates that
alter their own. The nodes gradually adjust the weight they give to the estimates of that
neighbor, which tends to zero, so the effect of its estimate becomes negligible. That is,
the network is divided into clusters-groups according to the interests of the nodes. As we
see, the collaboration between members of a group with the same interest leads to a better
estimation of the parameters of interest. The weights’ values are a measure of trust that a
node gives to its neighboring node.
Focusing on the convergence of the ATC, we observe that in the case of the global
parameters vector, the algorithm starts to approach the steady state at iteration i = 1000.
However, much more iterations are needed in the case of the two common interest parameter
vectors for the MSD to attain a steady state. Additionally, an essential performance difference
occurs from the average individual estimate of all nodes. Observing the MSD of the two
common interest parameter vectors, it is lower than the MSD of the global parameters.

4.2. Mobile CR Node
In this subsection, as a ﬁrst approach, we evaluate the performance of ATC, assuming
that there is one mobile SU node in the network. A moving SU changes position (x, y).
However, this change may not necessarily vary the frequency bands of interest and the
neighbors. If changes occur, this implies that the corresponding structures of the ATC
algorithm should be updated. These structures relate to the path loss coefﬁcients between
the mobile SU and the three PUs because it is location-dependent, the adjacency matrix
A and the interests’ matrix C. To check the area in which the moving node is located,
we measure the node’s Euclidean distances from the three PUs and compare them with
the corresponding transmission range of the PUs. Let’s assume that the distances are
d1, d2, and d3, respectively, and the transmission ranges are R1, R2, and R3. For the speciﬁc
experiment, we considered R1 = 150, R2 = 165, and R3 = 170. Based on Figure 3, we
formulated the rules presented in Table 2, which helps us to update the interests’ matrix C
and the structures that depend on it. Moreover, in Table 3, we assume the characteristic
points of the SU1 trajectory and the corresponding frequency zones of interest derived from
Table 2 under the selected values for the parameters R1, R2, R3.

Now, let us focus on Figure 7, which captures the MSD curves of those parameter
vectors that correspond to the frequency zones (i.e., e, z, h) that started to be in the interests of
the SU1 node and that relate to the common interest vectors ς4, ς5, ς6. Focusing on ς4, ς5, ς6
and the convergence of the ATC, we see that in the case of ς5, ς6 the algorithm approaches
the steady state earlier, at iteration i = 500. However, more iterations are needed (at least
i = 1000) in the case of ς4 to attain the steady state. An essential performance distance is
captured between the adaptive and the uniform weighting methods, where the adaptive
weights win. Finally, we observe an abrupt fall in the MSD in the time instants 19 and 59,
as indicated in Table 3, which shows that the algorithm identiﬁes the new parameters of
interest of SU1.

Assuming the adaptive weights method in the combination part of the ATC, in Figure 8,
we capture the mean weight error of the parameters of interest of the moving SU1, which
as it moves, changes regions and frequency bands of interest. In each ﬁgure, we depict the
evolution of the Mcj parameters estimation error. Observing Table 3, we see that the time
intervals where the mean error curve is ﬂat correspond to regions where the SU1 is not
interested in the respective frequency band.

In concluding the evaluation part of the adopted ATC method, we see that the al-
gorithm is able to identify the changes in the interests of a SU, which is reﬂected in the
error curves. In either case, its performance remains intact, achieving low error values that
attain zero.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, the estimation of the total power spectrum of three PUs was investigated
via the ATC diffusion algorithm, which was tackled as a multi-task problem, having
promising results in each of the considered scenarios. We examined its efﬁciency for two
different weighting rules for the coefﬁcients in the combination step of the algorithm.
In the case of the relative variance rule combined with the adaptive estimation ﬁlter, MSD
achieved better performance than the uniform one. This is due to the fact that the noise
proﬁle of the nodes is derived based on the instant estimates of the parameters vector, both
of them and their neighbors.
An open issue in the above scenarios could be the usage of more overlapping primary
users, which would, however, eliminate the zone of global interest, and nodes would only
estimate various common interest parameters. Additionally, a variation of the examined
Sensors 2022, 22, 6692
19 of 20
scenarios could concern the movement of more than one node, since, in practical scenarios,
more SUs may be mobile.
Alternatively, we could determine the combination weights, taking into account only
the variance of two communicating nodes and not of the whole neighborhood, and evaluate
its beneﬁts in the per node and network MSD in the adaptive combination weights. Our
aim is to see the improvements to MSD by experimenting with the parameters involved
in the ATC method and especially the step size µ, which is an important parameter that
impacts on the convergence of the algorithm. Finally, it would be interesting to re-evaluate
the above parameter estimation problem, if we were using the Combine-Then-Adapt or
LMS-type incremental methods.

Abstract: Internet-of-Things (IoT) enabling technologies such as ZigBee, WiFi, 6LowPAN, RFID,
Machine-to-Machine, LTE-Advanced, etc. depend on the license-free Industrial Scientiﬁc and Medical
(ISM) bands for the Internet. The proliferation of IoT devices is not only anticipated to create a
huge amount of congestion in the near future, but even now the unlicensed spectrum is not enough
in the ISM bands. Towards this end, Cognitive Radio (CR) technology can resolve the spectrum
shortage issue since CR users can opportunistically exploit white spaces in licensed channels of
the adjacent wireless systems. In CR networks, it is critical to coordinate spectrum access among
Secondary Users (SUs) while protecting priority rights of Primary Users (PUs). Therein, SUs need to
take good care of hidden PUs in order to avoid harmful interference. Further, a densely deployed
CR network can compromise spectrum sensing quality and certainty of the results when a large
number of SUs contends to access the same channel. Therefore, based on the vulnerable sensing
results, SUs can cause interference to the PUs. In this paper, we ﬁrst investigate the leading issues
and then propose a novel Handshake Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (HSMA/CA)
protocol for CR-based IoT networks. Our proposed HSMA/CA scheme resolves hidden primary
terminal problem and maintains sufﬁcient priority rights to PUs in a densely distributed network.
In addition, we optimize the spectrum sensing period to maximize the system performance by
maintaining peculiarities in the sensing operation like false alarm and misdetection. To evaluate
the performance of HSMA/CA, we have analyzed the protocol through the Markov chain model in
terms of throughput and verify its accuracy by simulations. Simulation results show that our scheme
is suitable for non-collaborative densely deployed CR-based IoT networks.

1. Introduction
For the recent decades, Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology has been sharply propelling into
our daily lives due to low-power and low-cost smart objects like sensors, controllers, actuators,
etc. The widespread applications of IoT, including smart homes, smart meter, smart cities, eHelth,
connected cars, and so on, require Internet connectivity for anything, anywhere, and anytime [1].

In one report, Cisco anticipates that the Internet-connected devices will be 2.7% of the worldwide
physical objects by 2020, which is more than that of 80% in 2012 [2]. From another recent report [3],
we have calculated based on the United Nation world population prospects [4], that each person will
have at least nine devices on the Internet in 2025, as shown in Figure 1. On one hand, the leap in IoT
growth can liberate humans from the old and dump devices, while it requires enabling protocols and
more spectrum on the other. Worse still, the available spectrum is scarce; especially in the Industrial,
Scientiﬁc, and Medical Bands (ISM). However, most of the IoT technologies (e.g., Bluetooth Low
Energy, WiFi, 6LoWPAN, ZigBee, etc.) depend on ISM bands that are not really sufﬁcient to their needs
for spectrum.
Cognitive Radio (CR) is considered as a cornerstone technology to resolve the spectrum shortage
issue through the dynamic spectrum allocation [5–7]. In CR networks, allocated frequencies are often
used by the Primary Users (PUs), which have higher priority rights of spectrum use. Conversely,
the Secondary Users (SUs) do not have a spectrum license, but they can dynamically occupy the
unused frequencies (or white spaces) in the absence of PUs [8,9]. However, the CR system may not
have the freedom to operate at the similar transmission parameters across the existing spectrum bands
in order to avoid interference to the PUs [10]. Further, a CR system should accurately detect white
spaces without generating a level of harmful interference, which is what is not acceptable to the PUs.
Unfortunately, this is not always true because the accuracy of energy detector equipped with the
CR system for spectrum sensing is not perfect due to inevitable inefﬁciencies like the false alarm
and misdetection [11,12]. The spectrum assignment through dynamic access is, therefore, not trivial
since the radio transmissions can interfere with each other unless separated enough in time, space or
frequency. The dynamic spectrum access can be more aggressive as a channel can be used by multiple
users simultaneously if only the channel satisﬁes a predeﬁned quality condition. This situation will get
worse if IoT-enabled SUs are densely deployed to act as competitors. Hence, the dynamic spectrum
leasing, e.g., in [13,14], can increase the transmission power density and subsequently the interference
level [15]. We need to consider the leaked powers from the adjacent SUs to the PU receivers especially
in the decentralized networks due to hidden primary terminal problem [16–18].

In the existing literature, purpose-built Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for CR-based IoT
networks have not been studied directly. However, there exist several MAC protocols for CR networks
as in [19–23], which always consider a dedicated Common Control Channel (CCC) to schedule the
SUs’ transmissions in a sequential way. In [19], the authors proposed an opportunistic MAC protocol
that relies on an exclusive CCC for each frame. In this protocol, the channel time is divided into two
Sensors 2019, 19, 241
3 of 21
virtual segments named as report and negotiation phases. First, SUs report the sensing information
of the available channels in the report phase. Then, in the negotiation phase, they compete to win
the access opportunity for the next frame using a p-persistent CSMA/CA mechanism. To enable
this protocol, each SU necessarily equipped with the two transceivers. That is, the one transceiver is
tuned to the CCC, while the other is dedicated to sense and occupy the identiﬁed unused spectrum
channels. In [22], the OMC-MAC is proposed, in which the CCC time is divided into non-overlapping
periods called beacon intervals. Therein, each beacon interval consists of three phases called sensing,
contention, and transmission phases. According to this protocol, SUs ﬁrst sense channels in the sensing
phase, then contend to win a transmission opportunity in the contention phase and they ﬁnally follow
a contention-free process in the transmission phase. However, CCC-based MAC protocols are not
much attractive due to denial of service attack, jamming, and single point of failure [24–26].
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, few of the previous works have considered the random
access model that does not require an exclusive CCC and so it is more suitable for the CR-based IoT
network. However, SUs’ channel access, and PUs’ detection and protection become more challenging
in the absence of CCC. Furthermore, in distributed CR network the lack of centralized control without
CCC can cause many challenges like the hidden primary terminal problem. We can ﬁnd various MAC
protocols for distributed CR network that based on the random access model, as in [27–34]. In [27],
the VX, VAC, and KS schemes are proposed, which enable two metrics, to protect the transmission
priority rights of the PUs, named collision probability and overlapping time in a random access
mechanism. In these sachems, collisions between the SUs due to the hidden terminal problem are
not considered, which are not trivial in the densely deployed secondary networks. Furthermore,
the assumed scenario of one PU band and one SU is too simple, which is in fact an impractical
assumption. In [29], the O-CSMA/CA is proposed, in which the backoff algorithm of the IEEE
802.11 standard is revised to improve fairness and reduce collisions among the SUs. In this protocol,
SUs enable virtual carrier sensing to resolve the classical hidden and exposed terminal problems.
However, no mechanism is suggested to resolve the hidden primary terminal problem to protect the
PUs’ transmissions.
In [31–33], the authors suggested a two-level opportunistic spectrum access strategy in CR
networks. In the ﬁrst level, SUs enable spectrum sensing with a given probability to detect and protect
the PUs. In the second level, they compete to access channel with one of the following random access
mechanisms called CR-ALOHA and CR-CSMA protocols. The CR-ALOHA is based on the classical
Slotted ALOHA scheme as that in [35], while the operation of CR-CSMA is inspired by the traditional
carrier sense multiple access schemes as that in [36]. However, the performance of these protocols
is not very attractive because of the inability to avoid packet collisions with nearby SUs. In [34],
the CR-CSMA/CA is proposed to resolve the hidden primary terminal problem in distributed CR
networks. In this scheme, the transmitter sends a control packet, called PTS, to initiate the mutual
spectrum sensing with the receiver. When both the transmitter and the receiver conﬁrm all the
neighboring PUs to be silent, they can transmit a data packet following the RTS/CTS handshaking
procedure as in the standard CSMA/CA [37]. However, this scheme is not much attractive because
mutual spectrum sensing (a relatively long operation) is carried out before the RTS/CTS handshaking
procedure that can lead to increase the cost of transmission failure. We notice that the event of
transmission failure is most likely happen in a densely deployed network and so it should not
have unnecessary overhead to maintain the efﬁciency of the system. In our previous works [38–40],
we suggest different proposals of random access MAC protocols inspired by the CR-CSMA/CA.
In [38], the CR-MEGA is proposed, which adopts a dual sensing approach by enabling carrier
sensing with spectrum sensing in a sequential way so as to avoid packet collisions with the nearby
SUs and as well as the faraway PUs. This protocol performs well even with the highly active PUs due
to its proactive mechanism. However, the advantage is achieved with the increased sensing overhead,
which is what is not acceptable in a densely distributed environment. In [39], hybrid-MAC is proposed,
which is based on the asynchronous and hybrid spectrum sensing techniques. This scheme alternatively
Sensors 2019, 19, 241
4 of 21
exploits two different spectrum sensing approaches, i.e., fast sensing [41] and ﬁne sensing [42],
in addition to the traditional carrier sensing of CSMA/CA. In [40], the adaptive-MAC is proposed,
which is the straightforward extension of the hybrid-MAC. In this scheme, a purpose-built algorithm
in SUs controls the adaptive spectrum sensing time, depending on the packet transmission result and
the previous activity of PUs, in order to maintain a balance between the system throughput and the
spectrum sensing overhead. However, the performance of both hybrid MAC and adaptive-MAC are
not very optimistic due to the same reason as that in CR-CSMA/CA protocol.
In [43], a random access model called Mutual Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
(MSMA/CA) is proposed, which is based on cognitive radio network to efﬁciently utilize the
bandwidth and spectrum resources in the IoT-enabled environment. MSMA/CA enables mutual
spectrum sensing operation in the midst of the two control frames named Notify-To-Sense (NTS)
and Acknowledge-To-Sense (ATS), to avoid the hidden primary terminal problem. The operation of
MSAM/CA is rather smart and agile because it has merged the functionality of classical RTS/CTS into
NTS/ATS frames with the added advantage of spectrum sensing. We notice that the long spectrum
sensing period in the midst of NTS and ATS can let the hidden SUs affect the transmission in densely
deployed networks. That is, with the NTS and ATS frames SUs transmitter and receiver can only stop
the exposed and hidden SUs, respectively. However, if the gap between the sharing of NTS and ATS
frames is large due to the long spectrum sensing period, then hidden SUs can also broadcast the NTS
frame (followed by the secondary transmitter) and hence cause collision over the secondary receiver.
We think that this phenomenon can severely affect the system performance when SUs are placed in
close proximity in a super dense environment. It is, therefore, the optimum selection of the spectrum
sensing period especially in the IoT environment is desirable. In addition to the spectrum sensing
period, the performance of the energy detector is vulnerable by another factor, i.e., spectrum sensing
threshold, due to the peculiarities of the energy detection sensing model.
In this paper, we design a novel MAC protocol for densely deployed CR-based IoT networks
by modifying the prevalent CSMA/CA protocol. Our protocol is called Handshake Sense Multiple
Access with Collision Avoidance (HSMA/CA) mechanism since it purposefully features the handshake
based mutual spectrum sensing in the transmitter and the receiver. We tailored the Notify-To-Sense
(NTS)/Clear-To-Sense (CTS)/Acknowledge-To-Sense (ATS) procedure for the data transmission in
place of the NTS/ATS operation in existing MSMA/CA in order to improve the SUs’ access operation in
a dense environment. The NTS/CTS/ATS mechanism ﬁrst enables the handshaking operation among
the SUs and then conduct the spectrum sensing operation in the transmitter and in the receiver to avoid
the hidden secondary terminal and hidden primary terminal problems simultaneously. Moreover,
we incorporate the optimization of the spectrum sensing period considering the inefﬁciencies of energy
detector to improve the performance of the CR-based IoT networks.
The key contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
•
We propose a new MAC protocol for densely deployed CR-based IoT networks that resolves the
hidden primary terminal problem with the minimal possible overhead while effectively dealing
with the classical hidden (secondary) terminal problem.
•
We develop an optimization model to judicially adapt the spectrum sensing period considering
the incidences of false alarm and misdetection and hidden primary terminal, in order to improve
the system efﬁciency and reduce the interference to active PUs.
•
We analyze the performance of our proposed protocol in terms of normalized throughput
with the Markov chain model and compare the results with that of existing CR-MEGA and
MSMA/CA protocols.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 covers the main issues in CR-based IoT
networks that make them different from the classical wireless networks. Section 3 takes an overview
of the system model. Section 4 describes the proposed MAC protocol. Section 5 analyzes the proposed
protocol through a mathematical model. Section 6 validates our model and discusses the obtained
results. In the last section, we summarize and conclude the paper.

2. Issues of CR-Based IoT Networks
There are a variety of reasons that can compromise the performance of the classical wireless
networks. However, we here only discuss the issues related to the CR-based IoT networks as in
the following.
2.1. Heterogeneous Environment
A CR system generally works in a multi-dimensional environment having coexistence of PUs and
SUs with variations of time, space and frequency. The coexistence of non-cooperative users makes it
very hard to sense the signals from PUs reliably. Moreover, the resulted interference induced from
autonomous detection procedure of multiple SUs in an independent sensing environment would also
lead to confuse the CR system by overestimation of signal’s power. Hence, the potential transmitter is
likely to deceive by assuming the inactive status of PU to be active. This phenomenon is more likely to
happen in dense networks.
2.2. Tradeoff between Sensing Schemes
Spectrum sensing is to detect the signal from PUs possibly under noisy environment. It is very
crucial to identify the PU’s signal for the communication of SUs at the desired interference level.
There are two general techniques on spectrum sensing i.e., fast sensing and ﬁne sensing [44]. The fast
sensing measures the energy level of received signals while consuming less than 1 ms. This approach
has the advantage of reporting results in a very short time, but it cannot distinguish the source of
signals. On the other hand, the ﬁne sensing consumes several tens of milliseconds, and identiﬁes better
the signal source by using the matched ﬁlter or cyclostationary detection. Hence, there exists a tradeoff
between sensing time and sensing quality alternatively in addition to the selection of an appropriate
sensing scheme.
2.3. Sensing Performance
The perfect sensing is a big challenge in real environments. There exists always a probability
of misdetection and false alarm. We denote the false alarm probability as α and the misdetection
probability as β, respectively. The false alarm means that an SU mistakenly detects an idle PU to be
active. Then the SUs can miss the transmission opportunity. For SU i, the false alarm probability, αi,
can be found in [45] as,
αi = Q
 λ
ν2 − 1
p
T fs

,
(1)
where λ is the detection (or spectrum sensing) threshold of the sensor to decide the activity of PU,
and ν2 denotes the power of the noise in the channel. On the other hand, misdetection indicates that
an SU recognizes active PUs as idle by mistake, which leads to the signiﬁcant interference due to
subsequent transmissions of SUs. In [45], the detection probability of an arbitrary SU i is derived as,
Ωi = Q

1
√2γ + 1Q−1(αi) −
p
T fsγ

,
(2)
where T denotes the spectrum sensing time, fs indicates the sampling rate of the channel, γ accounts
for the Signal-to-INoise-Ratio (SINR) of the PU’s signal measured at the SU i, and Q(·) represents
the complementary distribution function of a standard Gaussian variable. Hence, the misdetection
probability, βi, of an SU i can be written as,
βi = 1 − Ωi.
(3)
In order to adequately protect the PUs, we require the misdetection probability should be bounded
by a predeﬁned value ˆβ such that β ≤ ˆβ.

2.4. Hidden Primary Terminal Problem
The performance of an CR system is signiﬁcantly affected by its sensing ability during the
detection process of the active PUs. SUs may fail to detect the presence of PUs due to multipath fading
affects in wireless channels and temporal and spatial appearance of the PUs. In that case, SUs can
cause much interference to the PUs in their successive transmissions.
We illustrate the scenario of the hidden primary terminal problem in Figure 2, where the solid
lines denote the Carrier Sensing Range (CSR) and the dotted lines indicate the Spectrum Sensing Range
(SSR), respectively. We see that SUs i and j are respectively involved in a transmission as a transmitter
and as a receiver. We can also observe that PUs P and H are respectively located outside the CSRs of
the SUs i and j. In carrier sensing, SU i can only ensure the inactive status of PUs that are located inside
its CSR, when it senses the channel is idle for Data Interframe Space (DIFS) interval, but not that of PU
H. In spectrum sensing, the ability of SU i is, however, only limited to evaluate when PU H is working
as a transmitter but not when it is performing as a receiver. The obvious reason is the inability of SU i to
receive signals of the PU P’s transmission to the hidden PU H. Hence, SU i’s transmission to SU j can
essentially affect the likely transmission of PU P to the PU H. In such a scenario, a secondary network
can create harmful interference when an PU e.g., H, is hidden from SU e.g., i. It is very desirable that
SU i should make sure of the silence of neighboring PUs when it involves in transmission with SU j.

3. System Model
We have considered one secondary network with K SUs and one primary network with multiple
PUs in the system. The SUs and PUs both can coexist yet cannot communicate with each other since
they lack collaboration. The secondary network is established in a decentralized manner without
getting support from the centerlized server, in which SUs’ transmissions are carried out through
peer-to-peer communication setup. However, SUs, whenever they act as IoT devices, can rely on
the server for Internet service. We have assumed the single and shared channel model, therein SUs
can ﬁnd transmission opportunities whenever the legitimate owners (or incumbent PUs) are inactive.
Once PUs are active, SUs are then liable to vacate the channel immediately. To identify a transmission
opportunity, the secondary transmitter and its corresponding receiver, denoted as SU i and SU j,
can enable spectrum sensing using one of the energy detection, autocorrelation-Based Sensing or
cyclostationary feature detection mechanisms [45–48].
During a spectrum sensing operation, each SU in its neighborhood can detect PUs either to be
active or inactive. The PUs in the neighborhood of SU i can be found active with the probability of
π1,i, while the neighboring PUs can be observed as inactive with the probability of π0,i. However,
the spectrum sensing operation is not ideal due to the imperfect sensing environment. We hence
Sensors 2019, 19, 241
7 of 21
consider the incidence of false alarm and misdetection in order to make the proposed system more
realistic. Ultimately, SU i can conduct a data transmission operation based on the sensing results,
provided that the channel is clear from the incumbent PUs. For SU i, the clear-channel probability (R),
with which the channel is free from the incumbent PUs, can be obtained as,
Ri = (1 − αi)π0,i + βiπ1,i,
(4)
where recall that αi and βi, respectively refer to the probabilities of false alarm and misdetection for SU
i, as deﬁned in Equations (1) and (3). So, the energy detector in SU i suggests declaring the activity or
inactivity of incumbent PUs with probability 1 − Ri and probability Ri, respectively.
4. Proposed MAC Protocol
We here discuss the proposed MAC protocol called Handshake Sense Multiple Access with
Collision Avoidance (HSMA/CA), which is designed for the densely deployed cognitive radio-based
IoT networks. In HSMA/CA, the system time is divided into consecutive and multiple equal sized
time slots, therein SUs competing at a moment follow a random access procedure over the shared
channel. The channel is based on a single channel model, in which data and control packets both
are transmitted over the same channel. SUs contend at the beginning of each time slot, denoted as
σ, and the winner SU thereafter transmits data packet according to a deﬁned mechanism outlined in
the following.
4.1. NTS/CTS/ATS Access Mechanism
Our proposed protocol, HSMA/CA, is a tailor-made version of the standard CSMA/CA
(and MSMA/CA) for the densely distributed systems. In classical CSMA/CA, each station must
ﬁrst identify the state of the channel as idle or busy through the carrier sense before it enables collision
avoidance and data transmission procedures. Therein, carrier sensing includes sensing of the physical
medium by Clear Channel Assessment function to avoid a transmission overlap and the Network
Allocation Vector (NAV) function to reserve the channel for data packet transmission. However,
carrier sensing in CSMA/CA is limited because it is usually carried out at high SNR regime, and so
vulnerable to the presence of hidden primary terminal nodes in CR ad hoc networks. For example,
if an PU is positioned outside the carrier sensing range of an SU transmitter, it is hard to identify the
activity status of this PU through the carrier sensing mechanism. On the other hand, the spectrum
sensing method such as energy detection, autocorrelation-based sensing or cyclostationary feature
detection mechanisms [45–48] can be carried out in low SNR regime, but requires signiﬁcant time
while introducing greater incidences of misdetection and false alarm. In HSMA/CA, we have used
Notify-to-Sense (NTS)/ Clear-to-Sense (CTS)/Acknowledge-to-Sense (ATS) based handshake access
mechanism in place of the classical RTS/CTS. The NTS/CTS/ATS procedure is purposefully designed
to complement carrier sensing with spectrum sensing in order to avoid and protect the hidden
secondary and hidden primary terminals, respectively. However, SUs under HSMA/CA adopt the
similar backoff procedure as that is used in CSMA/CA since both protocols are based on the same
random access model.
We illustrate the packet transmission procedure in accordance to HSMA/CA in Figure 3, which is
described as follow. The SU with packet to send ﬁrst chooses a backoff counter at random to avoid
collision. Then the SU conducts the carrier sensing for one DIFS interval to check whether the channel
is free or not and to avoid a transmission overlap. If the channel is sensed as idle for the DIFS
interval, then SU decreases its backoff counter one by one for each backoff slot time observed as idle.
In Figure 3, the chosen backoff counter is 6. If no transmission by other SUs is observed until the
backoff counter becomes 0, the transmitter broadcasts an NTS packet to synchronize the spectrum
sensing operation with the corresponding receiver. The NTS packet keeps the neighboring SUs silent
by updating their NAVs until the spectrum sensing is done. If the receiver overhears the NTS packet,
Sensors 2019, 19, 241
8 of 21
it will then send an CTS packet to the transmitter. The CTS packet makes the hidden SUs silent
by updating their NAVs until the packet transmission is over. Once the NTS and CTS packets are
exchanged successfully, the transmitter and receiver both can mutually conduct the spectrum sensing
operation to protect the PUs in their neighborhood. After the mutual septum sensing, if there is no
hidden PU active around the receiver, it returns the ATS packet to the transmitter. If the hidden PU is
active otherwise, the receiver will be blocked by spectrum sensing, and so it will hold the ATS packet.
Meanwhile, the transmitter will wait for the ATS packet assuming it is not blocked by the active PUs in
its neighborhood. The transmitter sends the DATA packet when it decodes the ATS packet successfully,
and the receiver returns the ACK packet at the end. If there is an error-free environment the transmitter
decodes the ACK packet correctly and completes one DATA packet transmission.

We mention that an PU can receive interference when it becomes active during the exchange of
NTS and CTS. However, such interference is acceptable in CR systems because of the following two
reasons. First, IEEE 802.22 standard requires that SUs should necessarily vacate the channel within
100 ms once PUs become active [49]. For example, assuming the transmission rate of 1 Mbps and
the packet size of 1000 bytes, the packet transmission time is 8 ms, much less than “100 ms”. Hence,
the allowed time is good enough for the exchange of NTS and CTS packets. Second, the activity rate of
incumbent PUs for cognitive radio networks is usually observed very low [50–52]. Hence, incumbent
PUs are not likely to remain active most of the time. Refer to the exchange of NTS and CTS packets,
it should be noticed that transmitter does not always receives the CTS packet when there is a collision
among multiple NTS packets. The detailed operation under HSMA/CA is studied in Section 5.
4.2. Spectrum Sensing Optimization
We now provide an analysis to demonstrate how the performance of the proposed protocol could
be improved under the real environments while considering the inefﬁciencies of spectrum sensing.
We optimize the spectrum sensing period and the sensing threshold because both of the parameters
can otherwise affect the performance of the proposed protocol. To improve the system performance,
we can optimize both of the parameters by minimizing the incidence of false alarm and misdetection
with a given activity rate of hidden primary terminals (or hidden PUs). In our model, we assume N
spectrum sensing slots in a spectrum sensing period. We denote the duration of each sensing slot as Ts.
Hence, the length of a spectrum sensing interval can be written as,
T = N × Ts,
(5)
which is our design parameter. From Equations (1) and (3), we can derive false alarm and misdetection
probabilities at a given sensing interval, so as to calculate the network throughput. Let the hidden PUs
are activated with an activity factor A at each sensing slot time. Let h be the number of hidden PUs.
We can ﬁnd the hidden PUs’ interference probability, Pi, as a function of N, A, and h as,
Pi = 1 −
1 − A
hN,
(6)
where the second term refers to the no-interference probability to the hidden PUs. We hence can derive
the throughput of the system as,
˜S = R(λ, N) ×
1 − Pi

C,
(7)
Sensors 2019, 19, 241

where C is a given channel capacity and recall that R is the clear channel probability as deﬁned in
Equation (4). From Equation (1), we can see that,
λ = ˆλ × ν2,
(8)
where ˆλ is the normalized value of the sensing threshold, λ and noise power, ν2 in the wireless channel.
Please note that the optimization model is only designed to obtain the optimized value of sensing
interval while considering the peculiarities of spectrum sensing in a real environment. So, the network
throughput is derived to observe the effects of our design parameters. We have investigated the
performance of our proposed protocol with more detail in the following.

5.1. Packet Transmission Process
We investigate the packet transmission process of our HSMA/CA protocol. In this process,
there exists one of the four possible events during a packet transmission process, which we called
as: (1) NTS collision; (2) Blocking at SU transmitter; (3) Blocking at SU receiver; and (4) Successful
transmission, as shown in Figure 4. These four events in one packet transmission attempt of SU i
are denoted as ei, i = 1, . . . , 4. We calculate the probability (p) and time delay (t) of each event in
the following.

5.1.1. NTS collision
We recall that under HSMA/CA the contending SUs are dispersed with the backoff mechanism
to avoid the collision. The backoff time of each SU is deﬁned by its randomly chosen backoff counter,
which is decreased by one whenever the backoff slot is idle. The winner SU whose backoff counter
expires ﬁrst can transmit the NTS packet. However, more than one winner SUs can cause NTS collision
Sensors 2019, 19, 241
11 of 21
whenever their backoff counters expire at the same time. Suppose that SU i has the backlogged buffer
queue and the backoff counter 0. So, SU i transmits NTS packet to the SU j with the transmission
trial probability denoted as Xi. After the timeout, SU i is failed to receive the CTS packet since its
NTS packet becomes collided with another NTS packet. That situation, what we called as event e1,
will happen with the probability,
p1 = Ri
 
1 −

∏

,
(9)
where Xk and Rk respectively refer to the packet transmission trial probability and the clear channel
probability for SU k. In the second term of Equation (9), this can be helpful to notice that NTS packet
of at least one SU will collide to the NTS packet of SU i when k SUs, where k = 2, . . . , K, are not trying
to transmit with 1 − Xk probability. From Figure 4a, time delay of SU i due to event e1 is,
t1 = NTS + CTS + SIFS + DIFS,
(10)
where NTS and CTS accounts for the transmission time of one RTS and that of one CTS, respectively.
5.1.2. Blocking at SU Transmitter
Suppose that SUs i and j have exchanged the NTS and CTS packets. Therefore, both SUs, thanks to
NAV mechanism, mutually conduct their spectrum sensing operations without receiving interruption
from the other SUs. However, SU i has sensed the neighboring PUs active and so it is blocked by the
spectrum sensing for a predeﬁned period, which is event e2 that encounters with probability,
p2 = 1 − Ri.
(11)
From Figure 4b, time delay by the event e2 at SU i can be written as,
t2 = NTS + CTS + SS+ 3SIFS + DIFS,
(12)
where SS denotes the length of spectrum sensing time for one mutual operation.
5.1.3. Blocking at SU Receiver
Suppose that SU i is not blocked by the spectrum sensing, so it is waiting to receive the ATS
packet from the SU j. However, if SU j has sensed the hidden PUs as active, then it will be blocked by
the spectrum sensing operation and so cannot send the ATS packet. That is event e3, in which SU i
transmits packet to SU j with the packet transmission probability θij. However, the timeout in SU i
will ultimately fail the data packet transmission with probability,
p3 = Ri(1 − Rj) ∑

(13)
where 1 − Rj denotes no channel clearance probability for SU j. The last term in Equation (13) indicates
that no transmitter out of k SUs, where k = 3, . . . , K, can interrupt SU i’s transmission. From Figure 4c,
the time delay due to event e3 can be measured as,
t3 = NTS + CTS + SS + 3SIFS + DIFS.
(14)
Sensors 2019, 19, 241

5.1.4. Successful Transmission
Now we consider the successful transmission case, which we called as event e4. Suppose that
SUs i and j are not being blocked by the mutual spectrum sensing operation. In that case, SU i will
positively decode the ATS packet if there is an error-free channel. Thereafter, SU i sends an DATA
packet and then it will correctly receive the ACK packet from the corresponding SU j. Meanwhile,
NAV mechanism keeps the other SUs silent for the respective time periods noticed in the overheard
NTS, CTS, and ATS packets. The occurrence probability of event e4 can be written as,
p4 = RiRj

(15)
where 1 − Xj represents reception state of SU j. From Figure 4d, time delay by event e4 is given as,
t4 = NTS + CTS + SS + ATS + DATA
+ ACK + 5SIFS + DIFS,
(16)
where ATS, DATA, and ACK respectively denote the transmission time of one ATS packet, transmission
time of one DATA packet, and that of one ACK packet.
5.2. Normalized Throughput
We analyze the performance of our proposed HSMA/CA protocol in terms of normalized throughput,
which is what is derived under the given set of assumptions:
•
The topology of the secondary network is composed of a fully connected complete graph, therein
SUs are directly connected to each other with a single hop distance.
•
The secondary network is saturated such that SUs have non-empty queues, in which there is
always an DATA packet to send at each station.
•
The transmission channel is error-free and there is no capture effect, so the packets are discarded
when they receive collision.
•
The control and DATA packets are sent through a single channel, which is shared among the SUs.
•
The SUs use the same physical layer and their data transmission rate is also constant.
We investigate the backoff process of SUs in HSMA/CA system with a two-dimensional Markov
chain model as illustrated in Figure 5, in which backoff states at time t are deﬁned by the values of two
random processes of backoff stages m(t) and backoff counters c(t). We can denote the backoff state of
an arbitrary SU i being the value of a backoff stage m − 1 and that of a backoff counter c − 1 as (m, c).
The arbitrary SU i decreases it backoff counter from its contention window W whenever the channel is
observed as idle. Once the backoff counter reaches 0, SU i can begin data transmission process. In that
process, if the transmission is successful, then SU i returns to its initial backoff stage. Conversely,
when SU i observes collision, it increases its backoff stage from m to m + 1 upto a maximum retry limit
M. In that case, the backoff counter is chosen among m ∈ [0, Wm+1] provided m ≤ M. We denote the
size of initial and that of maximum window as W0 and WM, respectively. When SU i transmits with
probability p, it is a failed transmission that happens either due to e1, e2, or e3. For SU i, we can obtain
the probability of a failed transmission from Equations (1), (9), (11) and (13),
pi = αi + p1 + p2 + p3,
(17)
which will be increased by the inevitable probability of false alarm, αi, in a real environment.
From Equations (3) and (15), we can obtain the probability of a successful transmission as,
qi = βi + p4,
(18)
Sensors 2019, 19, 241
13 of 21
where p4 remains high due to misdetection probability, βi, in a real sensing environment. From Figure 5,
we can obtain the state transition probabilities of the Markov chain as Equation (20). We noticed that
the Markov chain of our HSMA/CA protocol hase close resmblace to that in Chong et al. [53] due
to the common backoff process. We hence directly refer to the results in Chong et al. [53] for the
transmission trial probability of SU i as Equation (21).

We can distinguish system slots into empty slots and event slots. In the empty slots, SUs do
not attempt to transmit packets. However, SUs in the event slots observe one of the four possible
events, as deﬁned in Equations (10), (12), (14) and (16), whenever they attempt to transmit data packets.
We can readily obtain the occurrence probability of the empty slots as,

(21)
We can further classify the event slots into transmission slots and no-transmission slots.
The slots in which transmissions happen successfully are transmission slots. From Equation (18),
we already have obtained the successful transmission probability under a real environment for SU i.
Hence, the occurrence probability of the slots with successful data transmission can be written as,
Pr = ∑
i
Xiqi.
(22)
Sensors 2019, 19, 241

However, the no-transmission slots are those slots who have observed the failed transmissions.
We can ﬁnd the occurrence of no-transmission slots with probability Pn = 1 − (Pe + Pr).
The throughput of the proposed HSMA/CA system can be expressed as,
S = Average data paylod bits transmitted in a slot
Average length of a slot
.
(23)
We assume an autonomous system in which SUs have an average size of the data payload bits
E[P]. So, the average amount of the data payload bits successfully transmitted in one slot is PtE[P].
Let E[O] be the average length of a slot, which can intuitively be computed as,
E[O] = Peσ + PrE[Tr] + PnE[Tn],
(24)
where Tr = t4 and Tn = t2(= t3). We assume t1(= t2 = t3) so that all SUs can keep pace in the system.
Hence, Tn = t1(= t2 = t3). From Equation (16), we can observe that
E[Tr] = NTS + CTS + SS + ATS + DATA
+ ACK + 5SIFS + DIFS
= NTS + CTS + SS + ATS(H + E[P])/E
+ ACK + 5SIFS + DIFS,
(25)
where H and E respectively represent the size of PHY plus MAC headers and the channel transmission
rate. From Equation (12), t2 is constant and so E[Tn] = t2. Conclusively, Equation (23) becomes,
S =
K − 1
PtE[P]

(26)
where the term K−1

spectrum sensing out of K users in the system.
6. Results and Discussion
We used energy detection model for spectrum sensing, in which ﬁrst we need to determine the
optimized value of the normalized threshold and that of spectrum sensing slots. For that purpose,
we have derived the spectrum sensor’s false alarm and misdetection probabilities as Equations (1) and
(3), respectively. We assume a 1 MHz channel and set the spectrum sensing sampling rate with 6 MHz
and SNR of the PU signal measured at SU is set to 0 dB. Further, the number of spectrum sensing
slots is assumed to be 20, with duration of 0.035 ms each. We consider the activity rate of hidden PU
as 1%. To validate our analysis, we develop simulation in C++ code according to the details of our
HSMA/CA protocol. We average 1000 runs to obtain one simulation result. In a nutshell, the default
parameters used in the simulation are summarized in Table 2.

Simulation Results
In Figure 6, we have shown the effect of various design parameters over the spectrum sensing
errors in the system. We have evaluated the variations of misdetection probability for the various
values of normalized sensing threshold in Figure 6a. We can see that misdetection probability remains
0 when the threshold is less than 0.9975, and it becomes sharply increases when the threshold is greater
than 0.9975. We mention that the sensing threshold is bounded upper due to the requirement on the
misdetection probability as ≤0.1 (or detection probability as ≥0.9). With higher sensing threshold
(i.e., >0.9975), the throughput of secondary network increases but the PUs cannot protect enough.
On the other hand, the false alarm probability remains high with threshold less than 0.9975 and then it
goes down sharply when the threshold exceeds 0.9975, as shown in Figure 6b. Hence, the achieved
optimized spectrum sensing threshold by minimizing the spectrum sensing errors is 0.9975.

Figure 7 illustrates the effect of the number of spectrum sensing slots over the system throughput.
We observe that the achieved throughput of the system increases with the increase in the number
of sensing slots until a certain limit and then decreases monotonically. With less number of sensing
slots, channel resources are wasted due to the high probability of false alarm and thus the system
Sensors 2019, 19, 241
16 of 21
performance degrades. Conversely, with a large number of sensing slots, the system throughput can
decrease due to the increased sensing overhead. We can also see that there exists the optimal number
of sensing slots (=5) and accordingly the optimal spectrum sensing interval (=0.035 ms × 5) for the
best throughput. However, it depends on the system environment such as channel model, sampling
rate and the distance between PUs and SUs. In Figure 8, we exhibit the effect of sensing threshold over
the throughput of the system. We can see that system throughput remains low (=0) below the optimal
threshold and thereafter it increases up to the maximum value due to the higher probability of false
alarm and misdetection, respectively. If the chosen threshold is higher than the optimal value, the
throughput of the system can be achieved further but at the cost of higher misdetection, which is not
desirable due to the protection priority of PU in CR system.

We have shown the effect of hidden primary node activity rate over the system performance
for the various number of hidden PUs in Figure 9. Therein, the values of throughput monotonically
decrease with the increase in activity rate of the hidden primary node. This is because of the fact that a
hidden PU can interrupt more with higher activity rate and secondary network accordingly vacates
the channel to avoid interference that eventually leads to a decrease in system performance. However,
the gap between the curves of throughput is attributed due to the large number of hidden PUs, that can
block SUs with more probability and so the achieved throughput of the system decreases sharply.
Figure 10 illustrates the effect of sensing errors in terms of false alarm and misdetection
probabilities at the optimal values of spectrum sensing slots and normalized threshold. We can
Sensors 2019, 19, 241
17 of 21
see that as long as the false alarm probability decreases and the misdetection probability increases,
the throughput of the system increases accordingly. This is because of the fact that a smaller value of
false alarm and a larger value of misdetection can generate the higher value of throughput. On the
contrary, if the sensing errors and spectrum sensing slots in the system are not optimized, then SUs’
system performance and PUs’ protection both can degrade signiﬁcantly.
We now present the performance of proposed protocol in terms of normalized throughput.
In Figure 11, we compare the performance of the proposed HSMA/CA with CR-MEGA and
MSMA/CA protocols. We witness that our analysis is very accurate because our analysis results
closely follow the simulation results. We observe that the performance of the secondary network
remains low since the contention window becomes large for the less number of SUs. On the other hand,
contention window becomes smaller for a large number of SUs that lead to increase the RTS collisions.
So, the system performance is decreased. We also observe that our proposed HSMA/CA outperforms
both CR-MEGA and MSMA/CA protocols due to its optimized sensing. This is how our HSMA/CA
protocol avoids the sensing overhead to spare the fraction of bandwidth for the transmission of more
data packets, which ultimately maximizes the system performance. Given the best performance with
optimal threshold and sensing interval, it is safe to say that our HSMA/CA is a best candidate MAC
protocol for CR-based IoT networks.

7. Conclusions
We propose a Handshake Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (HSMA/CA)
mechanism for CR-based IoT networks. Therein, the transmitter ﬁrst conducts carrier sensing and
thereafter it handshakes with the intended receiver using NTS and CTS packets to keep the neighboring
SUs silent. Once NTS and CTS are exchanged, the transmitter performs mutual spectrum sensing
in conjunction with the receiver in order to detect active PUs and active hidden PUs, respectively.
When PU is active, spectrum sensing blocks the transmitter. Otherwise, it waits to receive the ATS
packet from the corresponding receiver before transmitting a DATA packet. If the hidden PU is
active, then the receiver holds the ATS packet to block the transmitter. Whenever the channel is
clear, the transmitter sends an DATA packet and receiver replies with an ACK in the sequel. In case
of collision, SUs follow a bakeoff procedure as that in standard CSMA/CA. This is how our MAC
protocol protects priority right of PUs by resolving the hidden primary terminal problem, in addition
to protecting a densely deployed network from the classical hidden and exposed terminal problems.
Our HSMA/CA also adapts the spectrum sensing period by maintaining inefﬁciencies in spectrum
sensing to avoid the sensing overhead. We investigate the performance of the proposed protocol
in terms of normalized throughput using the Markov model and duly veriﬁed by the simulation.
We observe that our HSMA/CA outperforms existing schemes due to optimized spectrum sensing.
Hence, the proposed HSMA/CA can be a good candidate MAC protocol in the real environment.

Following the trend, it is evident that 6G will emerge as highly softwarized and open networks allowing the participation of multiple stakeholders. This undoubtedly will make 6G more flexible, agile, autonomous, intelligent, and cost-efficient networks. However, the programmability and openness will make 6G networks more prone to issues like security, privacy, traceability, interoperability, auditability, resource manageability, spectrum efficiency, and 3D mobility. To address these issues, a deep integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks is foreseen. Thus, we aim to put together blockchain and 6G under a magnifying lens to gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of blockchain in the 6G ecosystem. We begin by providing an overview of the envisioned 6G networks and blockchain technology. Next, we present a high-level view of the role of blockchain for 6G trends and requirements. Following that, we conduct an in-depth study on how the blockchain can provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized underpinning to various technical aspects and use cases of 6G. Thereafter, we discuss the deployment challenges to be faced while integrating blockchain in 6G and the possible solutions. Finally, future research directions are expounded to set the floor for further advancements in the blockchainized 6G.

Introduction The evolution of mobile networks has come a long way and has hitherto fulfilled the market demands as well as users’ expectations. The time has come for the world to experience and enjoy the services offered by the fifth-generation (5G) of mobile networks. It is going to radically change the way humans and machines communicate, interact and stay connected. Distinctively, 5G supports three different broad traffic classes namely eMBB (enhanced Mobile Broadband), URLLC (Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication), and mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications) [1], [2]. These are designed to meet heterogeneous and customized demands of individuals as well as network tenants such as industry verticals, mobile virtual network operator (MVNO), Over The Top (OTT) service providers [3]. Moreover, various new technologies such as Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), Network Slicing (NS), Cloud Computing (CC), Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA), and massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) drive the 5G ecosystem and help achieve the 5G vision [4], [5] (A list of important acronyms is given in Table 1).

For instance, 5G, in line with its predecessor generations, remains confined to cell-based communications that offer primarily ground coverage [6], [7], [8]. Further, even with 5G, a significant portion of the earth will remain unconnected and uncovered which includes large bodies of water, areas with low (or negligible) population, deep deserts, and mountains [9]. Hence, 5G’s state-of-art and its ongoing initial deployments reveal many limitations when one envisions future requirements [7]. Hence, in a decade or so, even with 5G technology it would be difficult to scale up and meet the diverse demands (in terms of traffic, connection density, and services) of the hyper-connected future era. This understanding has impelled a new wave of interest in the next generation of mobile networks which is touted as the 6G. At present, with a resurgence of research activities around the globe, the research and industrial community is formulating the overall vision, exploring the potential use cases, defining the future requirements, and identifying the key enabling technologies for 6G [1]. 6G, the future generation of wireless communication system, is envisioned to lay the foundation of a new era of hyper-connected and artificially intelligent societies [10]. It would enable complete digitization, mobilization, and automation with seamless integration of heterogeneous networks spanning over space, air, ground, underground and undersea, thereby paving the way for universal communication system [11]. For instance, the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as Aerial Base Stations (ABS) will extend the reach of ground stations enabling better coverage and cell-free communications. Integrating heterogeneous networks in 6G calls for a unified framework comprising of key enabling technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Visible Light Communication (VLC), quantum communications, and TeraHertz (THz) communications [7], [9], [12]. Moreover, 6G is believed to go beyond conventional RF-based communications and embrace various other propagation media like sonar waves for underwater, optical fiber for the fronthaul and the backhaul, and magnetic induction for underground communications [13]. Undoubtedly, 6G has to meet the predicted explosive growth in terms of the number of connected devices as well as the exponentially increasing traffic demands. As per CISCO, by 2030, 500 billion devices would be connected across the globe, which will be of the order of 59 times more than the human population by then [10]. The traffic is estimated to be 607 exabyte/month by 2025 and 5016 exabyte/month by 2030 [14]. Major contributors to this expected traffic will be video traffic and the M2M communications traffic [14]. The trend exhibits that the prominent users of 6G are going to be machines/devices thus network services will be more machine-centric than human-centric. The fascinating range of new devices that will proliferate the space of connected devices will be AR (Augmented Reality) glasses, VR (Virtual Reality) headsets, hologram devices, swarm robots, home appliances, range of sensors of autonomous vehicles, industrial machines, and Internet of Everything (IoE) devices [10]. 6G networks are envisioned to be softwarized, virtualized, customized, cloudified, edgified, intelligent, autonomous and self-sustainable [15]. Security and privacy of such open and programmable networks will be one of the indispensable architectural requirements. Some of the identified technologies that will play a cardinal role in this direction include blockchain technology, native Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum computing and communication, and Physical Layer Security (PLS) techniques [9], [16]. Some of the captivating applications to be offered by 6G are VR, AR, MR (Mixed Reality) and XR (Extended Reality) applications [17], M2M type subscription and applications [14], 3D holographic imaging and presence [18], [19], 5D communications (sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste) [18], VLC (Visible Light Communications) [20], smart clothing and wearables, fully autonomous (Level-5 [21]) and connected vehicles, and accurate indoor positioning [22]. In a nutshell, the envisioned motive of 6G networks revolves around the following: • To offer a universal communication system integrating underwater, ground, air, and space networks. • To effortlessly accommodate a proliferation of heterogeneous devices emerging from IoE. • To proactively meet the futuristic traffic demands. • To offer strict Quality-of-Service (QoS) for new heterogeneous traffic classes and services. • To open a new landscape of business opportunities with strong consideration for network tenants and industry verticals. • To pave the way for an unseen fleet of real-time and AI-powered applications.

Paper motivation Blockchain, one of the most popular types of distributed ledger technology, has been identified as a key enabler for mobile communication systems. Already its applicability in 5G networks has been a hot research topic in the recent past [23], [24]. Since the future generation of mobile networks, especially 6G, is going to be increasingly softwarized, decentralized, and open systems thus the underpinning of blockchain technology is believed to be indispensability for secure and complete automation. In particular, there are technical aspects (such as security, privacy, network service management, resource utilization, and spectrum management discussed in detail in Section 5) and applications of 6G (such as healthcare, energy Internet, UAVs, CAVs, and XR presented in depth in Section 6) that are expected to be enhanced with the use of blockchain technology . In this context, researchers have already started exploring the role of blockchain in 6G networks [25], [26], [27]. 1.2. Selection method The aim of this paper is to put the integration of blockchain technology for 6G under the magnifying glass to provide an in-depth understanding of a wide range of benefits that can be achieved with the use of blockchain technology in 6G era. In particular, the motivation is to answer set of research questions when leveraging blockchain technology in conjunction with smart contracts for 6G.

High-level 6G architecture [1], [12], [35], [38]. 2.1. 6G driving trends 6G will be the key communication infrastructure to satisfy the demands of future needs of hyper-connected societies in 2030 [12], [15], [34]. Thus, these future demands will drive the development and define the features of 6G networks. • Expansion of IoT: It is expected that the number of IoT devices in the world will grow up to 24 billion by 2030. Moreover, the revenue related to IoT will hit the market capitalization of USD 1.5 trillion by 2030 [39]. • Massive Availability of Small Data: Due to the anticipated popularity of 6G-based IoT devices and new 6G IoT services, 6G network will trend to generate an increasingly high volume of data. Most of such data will be small, dynamic, and heterogeneous in nature [35], [40]. • Availability of Self-Sustained Networks: 6G mobile systems need to be energy self-sustainable, both at the infrastructure side and at the device side to provide uninterrupted connectivity in every corner of the world. The development of energy harvesting capabilities will extend the life-cycle of both network infrastructure devices and end devices such as IoE devices [11], [41]. • Convergence of Communication, Sensing, Control, Localization, and Computing: Development of sensor technologies and direct integration of them with mobile network accompanied by low energy communication capabilities will lead to advanced 6G networks [35], [42]. Such a network will be able to provide sensing and localization services in addition to advanced communication and computing features [35], [42], [43]. • Zero Energy IoT: Generally, IoT devices will consume significantly more energy for communication than sensing and processing [44]. The development of ultra-low-power communication mechanisms and efficient energy harvesting mechanisms will lead to self-energy sustainable or zero energy IoT devices [44]. • More Bits, Spectrum, and Reliability: The advancement of wireless communication technologies including coding schemes and antenna technologies will allow the utilization of new spectrum as well as reliably send more information bits over existing wireless channels [12], [35]. • Gadget-free Communication: The integration of an increasing number of smart and intelligent devices and digital interfaces in the environment will lead to a change from gadget-centric to user-centric or gadget-free communication model. With such a transition, the user will be able to communicate with the hyper-connected digital surroundings without any devises. The “omnipotential” environment is smart enough to provide the necessary information, and digital services according to the user requirements [45], [46], [47]. • Increasing Elderly Population: Due to factors such as advanced healthcare facilities and the development of new medicines, the older population in the world is increasing rapidly. According to “An Aging World: 2015” report, nearly 17 percent (1.6 billion) of the world’s population will be aged 65 and over by 2050 [48]. • Emergence of New Technologies: By 2030, the world will experience new technological advancements such as stand-alone cars, AI-powered automated devices, smart clothes, printed bodies in 3D, humanoid robots, new AR devices, quantum computing, and space travel [12], [35]. 6G will be the main underlying communication infrastructure to realize these technologies. 2.2. 6G applications A new set of 6G applications will appear due to above-mentioned 6G trends. Some of these important 6G applications are discussed below: • UAV based Mobility: The popularity and progress of research and development (R&D) activities related UAV based services are improving around the globe. This will lead to use UAVs in new domains such as taxi services, logistics, passenger transport, and military operations [49], [50]. • Holographic Telepresence: is another exciting 6G application. Using holographic telepresence, it is possible to real-time project distant objects including people as full-motion 3D images. Due to a high level of realism to the actual physical presence, holographic telepresence useful for applications such as, meeting, conferences and news broadcasting [51], [52]. • Extended Reality (XR): 6G is believed to offer extended reality which can combine real and digital/virtual environments. XR terms expands over multiple technologies i.e., Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Mixed Reality (MR), and everything in between [53], [54]. • Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAV): With more than 40 companies active contribution for R&D activities in CAV domain, the future human society will soon experience the fully autonomous, highly reliable, and commercially viable autonomous vehicles [55]. • Internet of Everything (IoE): Current IoT ecosystem will evolve further to the Internet of Everything (IoE) which interconnects not only things but also people, processes and data itself [56]. • Smart Grid 2.0: Energy networks will evolve from Smart grid 1.0 which is about installing interconnected smart meters and getting them integrated, to Smart Grid 2.0 which will actually do more advanced things such as automated meter data analysis, dynamic pricing, prepayments, and intelligent line loss analysis. Smart Grid 2.0 offers the distribution grid management automation via a self-healing, digitally controlled energy network for reliable electric power delivery [57]. • Industry 5.0: 6G will provide a solid underpinning for next generation of industries, i.e., Industry 5.0. It enables co-working concept of people, intelligent robots and smart machines. In this manner, Industry 5.0 adds the personalized human touch to the automation and efficiency in Industrial Internet applications [58]. • Hyper-intelligent IoT: is a next generation of IoT application which relies mainly on AI technologies. It will use AI algorithms to mainly optimize the complex IoT data processing task to control automated devices such as robots and UAVs. In this way, hyper-intelligent IoT can use to implement intelligent digital services [59]. • Collaborative Robots: directly collaborate with people by work side-by-side with them. These collaborative robots can perform tedious, repetitive, and risky tasks which are difficult to do with humans. The use of co-robots can improve the health and safety of human workers and automate the production process [60]. • Personalized Body Area Networks(PBANs): is a short-range network which basically deploy around or within the human. PBAN are important to implement integrated mobile health (mHealth) systems. These mHealth systems are used to perform health monitoring and personalized health management. mHealth systems deploys multiple sensors within the human body to collect health information. PBAN interconnects these sensors to enable dynamic exchange of the collected information [61]. • Intelligent Healthcare: is the next generation of healthcare systems. Novel AI technologies will use in ehealth sector realize this new intelligent healthcare systems. New devices such as Intelligent Wearable Devices (IWD) and Intelligent Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) will use to implement Hospital-to-Home (H2H) services and hyper-connected smart hospitals [38], [62]. 2.3. 6G technical requirements/vision The technical capabilities of 6G networks have to improved to realize new 6G applications. Thus, technical requirement of 6G networks should extend the capabilities of 5G networks. 6G networking requirements can be divided into different categories as follows: • Further enhanced Mobile Broadband (FeMBB): The mobile broadband speed should exceed the limits of 5g network and offer the peak data rate at Terabits per second (Tbps) level. Moreover, the user-experienced data rate should also increase to Gigabits per second (Gbps) level [38]. • Enhanced Ultra-Reliable, Low-Latency Communication (ERLLC/eURLLC): The E2E latency in 6G should be further reduced up to μ s level to enable new high-end real-time 6G applications [15]. • Ultra massive Machine Type Communication (umMTC): Connection density will further increase in 6G due to the popularity of IoT devices and the novel concept of IoE. These devices communicate with each other and offer automated services collaboratively [63], [64]. • Extremely Low-Power Communications (ELPC): The network energy efficiency of 6G will be improved by 10x than 5G and 100X than 4G. It will enable extremely low power communication channels for resource-constrained IoT devices [15], [65]. • Long Distance High-Mobility Communications (LDHMC): With the support of fully integrated satellite technologies, 6G will provide communication for extreme places such as space and the deep sea. Satellite communication is said to have potential to enable Internet of Remote Things (IoRTs) [66]. Moreover, AI-based automated mobility management systems and proactive migration systems will be able to support seamless mobility at speed beyond 1000 kmph [38]. • High Spectrum Efficiency: The spectrum efficiency will be further improved in 6G up to five times as in 4G and nearly two times as in 5G networks [15]. • High Area Traffic Capacity: The exponential growth of IoT will demand the improvement of the area traffic capacity by 100 times than 5G networks. It will lead up to 1 Gbps traffic per square meter in 6G networks. In addition to the above network level requirements, 6G networks are expected to deliver high security, high privacy and high reliability to enable new 6G applications.

Machine learning allows machines to learn about a process or performing a task from analyzing only data without being programmed explicitly [68]. Thus, ML is considered a subset of AI. • Edge AI: is focusing on running AI algorithms locally at the edge of the network with limited resources and very low E2E latency. Due to limitations in edge computers, these edge AI models/algorithms can be pre-trained in the cloud for optimized results and can then be moved to the edge [69]. • Above 6 GHz Radio Frequency: With the greater use of small cells and emerging advances in communication technology, 6G will be able to support the use of higher frequencies in future use cases [70]. • Blockchain/DLT: Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a decentralized, secure and immutable database that is managed by multiple users. It will play a vital role in enabling many 6G services [32]. • Swarm Networking: is the concept of managing a group of network elements or users as a part of a swarm. 6G will need to use swarm networking concepts to efficiently manage a swarm of edge devices, UAVs, or robots, due to the collaborative nature of these elements [71]. • Zero touch network and Service Management (ZSM): is the concept of enabling full end-to-end automation of network and service management to deliver services in an agile, high speed, and scalable manner [72]. • Smart Surfaces: In the near future, the novel smart surfaces will be inherently intelligent to offer services. They will evolve from the current form to integrate smart technology onto the surfaces of furniture, buildings, and vehicles. Thus, these smart surfaces will combine the materials science of smart materials with IoT and big data analysis to offer dynamic, reconfigurable, and digitally controllable surfaces [73]. • Quantum Communication: With the development of quantum computing research, 6G may utilize quantum information processing and quantum teleportation to enable quantum communication. One of the most interesting applications of quantum communication is the protection of information channels against eavesdropping using quantum cryptography [74]. 3. Overview of blockchain In recent years, the rise of DLT, in particular blockchain technology, has gained significant momentum and has been embraced by the industry and research communities. This section briefly covers the basic concepts, types of blockchain, smart contracts, and salient features of blockchain. 3.1. Blockchain - A type of DLT Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger which is maintained in a decentralized manner by the underlying P2P network of nodes. As the name implies, blockchain comprises of series of blocks of transactions that are logically chained or linked together to form a digital ledger. Transactions occurring in a given time frame are verified and then bundled together in a unit called as block. So, each block contains a finite set of transactions. All these blocks are logically linked together in the order of their creation using cryptographic hashes. This is to say that every block stores the hash value of the previous block in the ‘previous block hash’ field. The first block, aka genesis block, does not have any previous block. Thus, the previous block hash field of the genesis block is set to all 0’s. The digital ledger holds all the past transactions in chronological order and is cryptographically sealed [75]. Further, this ledger is replicated at all the participating nodes in a P2P blockchain network. With time, the distributed ledger keeps growing because the write operations are performed in exclusively append mode [76]. From a technological viewpoint, blockchain is considered as one single technological innovation which is a unique, and powerful mix of underlying concepts, techniques and technologies [77]. For instance, blockchain uses cryptographic techniques like Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), hashing, digital signature, and Merkle tree. It also utilizes P2P technology for connecting nodes (aka miners) to establish a blockchain network. Furthermore, a consensus mechanism allows nodes in the blockchain network to be synchronized and to agree on the current state of the distributed ledger. Blockchain promises to solve the issues like exclusive peer-to-peer transactions without centralized third parties, fraudulent replication of digital asset/value or transaction (e.g., double spending), establishing trust with pseudonymity, transparent yet immutable record-keeping, provenance and auditable enabled distributed ledger, and digital signing and execution of legal agreements (between parties) in the form of softwarized contracts. The technology is also optionally driven by incentive mechanisms to attract more nodes to participate in the decentralized management of the digital ledger [78]. 3.2. Types of blockchain There exist different types of blockchain and many times the clear distinction between them is missing. Fig. 5 shows different types of blockchain and the classification is based on (i) who is allowed to read, write and commit transactions in blockchain (i.e., permission configuration) [77], and (ii) on what type of servers hosting is done [79]. The read permission allows a node to access and see all the past transactions, and the write permission enables nodes to create and broadcast a transaction to all the other nodes in the blockchain network. The commit permission empowers a node to update the distributed ledger [77]. Fundamentally, there are four different types of blockchain: (i) public, (ii) private, (iii) permissionless and (iv) permissioned blockchain. If a blockchain permits any node to acquire read permission by default, and public servers are used for its hosting then it is considered as public blockchain. On the contrary, if read permission is restricted and private hosting is used then such a blockchain is called as private blockchain. In other words, in public blockchain anyone can read whereas in private blockchain only the set of vetted nodes can read. Next, a blockchain is said to be permissionless, if all the nodes with read capability can also write and commit. However, in permissioned blockchain only the authorized subset of the participating nodes (who can read) are capable to write and commit. Based on these four basic types of blockchain, there are four combinations possible which are shown as the leaf nodes of the inverted tree structure in  Fig. 5. Public permissionless blockchain are the ones where anyone can join the blockchain network and perform read and write operations. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are examples of such blockchain. Public permissioned blockchain allows anyone to read but allows only the selected few nodes to write and commit. For instance, a supply chain ledger that can be read by customers but updated by only the authorized nodes under the control of company [79] or a blockchain-based voting system. Private permissionless blockchain is formed by only the set of restricted nodes which can perform read, write and commit operations. Such a type of blockchain is also called a consortium or federated blockchain. Finally, private permissioned blockchain enable all the nodes in the set of approved nodes to carry out read operation, however, the write and commit operations are exclusively performed by network operators (i.e., a subset of a set of approved nodes) [77].

Smart contract Yet another important concept that has extended the capability of blockchain is smart contract. The idea of smart contract existed much before the birth of blockchain technology. It was first introduced by Szabo in 1994 [80]. It can be simply defined as a computer program that encodes all the terms and conditions of an agreement between participating entities and runs on top of blockchain [81]. Any node in the blockchain network is capable of executing a smart contract either when it is called by initiating a transaction or when certain predefined conditions are met. Moreover, a smart contract can be established between untrusted and anonymous entities in the blockchain ecosystem without the need of a third party [82]. As and when the pre-defined encoded conditions are reached the corresponding smart contract gets self-executed thereby empowering automation. It is worth noting that once a smart contract is deployed on the blockchain, it cannot be stopped by any entity within the system or outside the system [81]. 3.4. Salient features of blockchain This section briefly discusses salient features of blockchain technology. They are as follows: • Decentralization: Unlike, conventional centralized technologies, blockchain technology offers decentralized modus operandi. This implies there is no central authority that owns and controls a given system completely. Rather, the system is collectively operated by a dynamic set of nodes (or miners) such that any node can create new block comprising a set of transactions. Thus, blockchain decentralizes the decision-making and control of the entire system. • Immutability: Once any transaction or data is stored on the blockchain in general, there is no way that it can be tampered with or altered. This is due to the distributed digital ledger, use of cryptographic techniques, and consensus-based update procedure. Thus, it is important to note that immutability also implies irrevocability and non-deletion of content from the blockchain infrastructure. • Transparency with Pseudonymity: Transparency implies any node in the blockchain network has access to read any content present in the digital ledger. The level of transparency is highest for public permissionless blockchain and is minimum in private permissioned blockchain. Further, nodes in the P2P blockchain network can just see transactions happening between different digital addresses (account IDs), however, the information about which ID belongs to whom (i.e., an individual or an organization) is absent. Thus, blockchain allows transparency with pseudonymity. • Fast Processing and Lower Cost: Conventional (logically centralized) systems involve multiple intermediaries and/or trusted third parties. For the overall processing of a transaction, each of these intermediaries performs its set of dedicated tasks which incur some processing delay. Moreover, each intermediary charges some processing fee for the tasks performed. All these intermediaries collectively increase the total delay and inflate the overall cost to process a transaction. Thanks to the decentralized and disintermediated blockchain-based system, users can perform transactions directly at peep level without involving third parties or intermediaries. Any one node or miner in blockchain-based system can process a new transaction and this update gets registered in the distributed ledger. This results in fast processing and a reduction in the overall cost per transaction as compared to conventional centralized system. For instance, processing of international banking transaction using Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) involves many intermediary banks which may take days to complete and charge high transaction cost [83]. However, blockchain-based system can process transaction fast and at low cost [83], [84]. • Consensus-based Decision Making: To add new content or to update the current blockchain, consensus needs to be established among the majority of the nodes in the blockchain network. Thus, blockchain dethrones the monopoly and embraces democracy in the system. The algorithm required to establish the overall agreement in blockchain infrastructure is called a consensus algorithm. A variety of consensus algorithms are available for example Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Practical Byzantine Faulty Tolerance (PBFT), Delegated Proof-of-State (DPoS), Proof-of-Burn (PoB), and Proof-of-Activity (PoA). Based on the suitability and a given use case, one must be used. • Automation Driven by Smart Contracts: Smart contract enhances the capabilities of blockchain technology and have been found to be versatile. In particular, smart contract helps in exercising tight access control and automating blockchainized systems. At any point in time, when the predefined conditions embedded in a smart contract are met, the smart contract gets self-executed and performs the required tasks without any human interventions. This results in achieving automation among multiple untrusting stakeholders in a system. 4. Blockchain for 6G trends and requirements - A high-level view This section provides a high-level view of the use of blockchain for 6G trends and requirements which were discussed in Section 2.

Role of blockchain for to achieve 6G requirements. Blockchain has significantly outgrown its inceptive use in cryptocurrencies like in Bitcoin. It is rapidly emerging as a promising technology in other sectors such as supply chain management, healthcare, smart manufacturing, education, and other businesses and trades [85], [86]. It holds immense potential to transform the way peer transactions, log management, record-keeping, decentralized negotiation, trade agreements, audits and compliance, dispute settlements, access management, and secure automation (via digital contracts), are carried out. Continuing the fundamental trend we have witnessed with 5G, it is evident that 6G is going to entail increasingly softwarized, virtualized, intelligent, and programmable systems [15], [33]. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note the following. On the one hand, concepts like softwarization, virtualization, and programmability of the next-generation mobile networks would lead to enormous advantages such as agile and open network management and orchestration (MANO), multi and micro services, on-demand creation of virtual networks, and multi-tenancy. On the other hand, these concepts tend to exacerbate the issues like security vulnerabilities, privacy leakage, unauthorized access to user data, dispute-prone soft spectrum sharing, fake or corrupted software network functions and control APIs, illegitimate resource utilization, and inability to provide differential security for differentiated services [87]. Blockchain is entrusted to play an alleviating and central role in providing a feasible solution to these issues. For instance, 6G networks may witness the availability of open-source software for implementing various network functions at core, transport or access levels [10]. In such an open environment, blockchain can ensure the correct functioning, versioning, integrity, and overall security and trust management for the software available to be deployed. In essence, blockchain can be leveraged to improve and support the technical aspects of 6G mobile networks as well as uplift the applications and use cases envisioned with the realization of 6G. 4.1. Blockchain for 6G trends The blockchain and smart contract will play a vital role in 6G trends as well. Here we discuss the impact and added benefit of blockchain on the 6G driving trends mentioned in Section 2.1. • Massive Availability of Small Data: Blockchain can be used to eliminate the data silos and enable the trusted data sharing between unknown parties. Smart contracts can automate such transactions. • Availability of Self-Sustained Networks: The automation and management via smart contracts can reduce the extra overhead on network management and orchestration. Especially, decentralized access control and authentication will be used to fully enable energy-efficient communications. • Convergence of Communication, Sensing, Control, Localization, and Computing: The development of wireless technologies and semiconductor technologies will lead to more advanced devices with different capabilities. One device can support communication, sensing, control, localization, and computing. This will lead these devices to interact with multiple stakeholders simultaneously. For instance, sensing information can be shared with MNOs and spectrum regulatory bodies [88]. Due to the convergence, not only the collected raw data but also computed data models (e.g., in the Federated Leading (FL) use case [89]) can be shared with other stakeholders. In such cases, Blockchain can be used to establish distributed trust between different stakeholders, protect the integrity of shared data and automate the process via smart contacts which encourages the realization of convergence. • Expansion of IoT/Zero Energy IoT: Blockchain and smart contracts can automate a variety of IoT-related tasks such as authentication, data management, payment handling, and agreement management to support scalability. Such automation will lead to a reduction in operational costs. In addition, extra blockchain-based security and privacy mechanisms can be deployed to protect the IoT ecosystem and its stakeholders. • More Bits, Spectrum and Reliability: Blockchain with clearly-defined smart contracts can alleviate the spectrum shortcomings against extreme capacity/rates by sharing spectrum in a transparent, agile (paperless), and trustworthy manner. In other words, it can enable on-demand spectrum via secure and auditable transactions. • Gadget-free Communication: Blockchain can play a vital role in ensuring the required level of security and privacy. Especially, blockchain-based services can be deployed for the establishment of ad-hoc communication with different stakeholders in gadget-free environments. Moreover, the trustworthy sharing of user data between different stakeholders can also be enabled via blockchains. • Increasing Elderly Population: The increasing elderly population will raise different demands, such as high demand for health services, the need for more prolonged government services (i.e., welfare, pension), and user-friendly and affordable shopping options (e.g., grocery delivery, food delivery). To tackle these requirements, several technological solutions are developed and also proposed. E.g., the use of e-health services will reduce the cost and stress on existing health services. E-government can offer faster and more scalable services than existing legacy government service models. UAVs can be used to deliver food and groceries. However, these new technological solutions will face deployment challenges such as trust establishment, automation support, need for privacy protection, lack of scalability, etc. To tackle these issues, blockchain with smart contracts can be used as a viable solution in many application domains including healthcare [90], e-governance [91], transport [92], and multimedia [93]. In such domains, blockchain and smart contracts can enable automation, reduce the cost of operation, support scalability, and provide extra security and privacy. • Emergence of New Technologies: Blockchain can be used as supporting technology for most of the novel technologies such as AI, humanoid robots, new AR devices, and quantum computing. For instance, blockchain can be used to eliminate the data positioning attacks on AI systems. Fig. 6 presents in nutshell the importance of blockchain for 6G trends. Moreover, the impact of blockchain in 6G trends will be discussed in detail under 6G technologies (Section 5) and 6G applications (Section 6). 4.2. Blockchain for 6G requirements Table 4 delineates the role of blockchain to support 6G requirements. • FeMBB: Decentrality, data sharing, and distributed computation features of blockchain along with smart contracts can prove to be instrumental to provide extremely high data rates. Moreover, service automation can be enabled with the use of blockchain as a secure and decentralized service platform. Nevertheless, the design of lightweight blockchain (in general DLT technology) is important because of the computationally intensive nature of blockchain. • umMTC: Blockchain-based ultra massive sensing applications, fast data exchange without the need of central entities, and trust-building can well support the extreme massive connectivity requirement of 6G. However, the design of a low-latency blockchain can further enhance the applicability of blockchain. • eURLLC: Park et al. [94] have proposed various solutions such as ML-based prediction, non-RF modality utilization, and co-design of communication and control for eURLLC. Blockchain can support these solutions. For instance, blockchain provides numerous benefits like data and model sharing, trusted decision making, and decentralized intelligence as presented by Liu et al. [29]. However, how to manage blockchains for different verticals and how to speed up the consensus finality need further attention. • ELPC: Use of private permissioned blockchain [95] or consortium blockchain [96] turns out to be applicable for low-energy communications. Deploying blockchain nodes at the edge of the networks or even at gateways [97] can enable power-constrained IoE devices to securely store and process data. Nonetheless, it is essential to access the impact of energy consumption of blockchain in 6G networks. Furthermore, computationally inexpensive consensus mechanisms tailored for ELPC are to be designed. • LDHMC: 6G networks will offer seamless connectivity independent of 3D location, time, and mobility. Blockchain can provide secure and trusted connectivity monitoring and clearing among different network service providers, especially for roaming cases. Nevertheless, the overall latency and distributed storage of data from the subscribers of heterogeneous networks need innovative solutions. In addition, privacy must be guaranteed for dispute-free coexistence. • High Spectrum Efficiency: Blockchain-enabled trustless and decentralized spectrum management can pave the way for highly spectrum efficient 6G networks. Xu et al. [25] proposed a basic blockchain-enabled framework for decentralized resource management. For harnessing the full potential, lightweight blockchain is required for small cells and its integration for RAN management is to be considered. 5. Blockchain for 6G technical aspects This section extensively discusses the use of blockchain to support and improve various technical aspects of 6G.

Use of blockchain for improving technical aspects of universal communication system envisioned with 6G. 5.1. 3D networking 6G is destined to break the conventional two-dimensional (2D) nature of mobile communication systems and emerge as three-dimensional (3D) mobile networks to provide truly global coverage [11]. The aim is to extend the presence of mobile networks in air, space, underground, and sea. Thus, altitude is considered as the third dimension. Since the antennas installed at terrestrial base stations are optimized for ground users and cannot support high-elevation angles [98], flying technologies, such as UAVs, tethered balloons, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have been proposed to contribute towards the extension of the mobile network ecosystem. In particular, UAV as Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) is characterized by flexible mobility, ease of maneuvering, varying capability, and Line-of-Sight (LoS) communications [98]. UAVs can provide coverage extension using UAV-to-user, UAV-to-UAV, UAV-to-base station, and UAV-to-satellite communication in future communication networks [99]. Thus, UAV ABSs can provide wide coverage, broadband and reliable wireless connectivity, cost-effective and flexible deployment, and pandemic and disaster management. In contract to 5G, satellite communications are envisioned as a key component for 6G systems to provide global coverage and services including multimedia [1], [100] 5.1.1. Key challenges Some of the impediments that exist in establishing a 3D networking paradigm are as follows: • Interoperability and data management for heterogeneous networks in a seamless, trustless, and automated fashion, turns out to be an important challenge. One way to overcome this issue would be to use a network of hierarchical trusted entities. However, such a solution is prone to all the issues related to a (logically) centralized system. • Adding altitude as a new dimension will open a new attack surface since the ABSs are not within the premises of their operators. Moreover, since attackers can easily get control of ABSs [101], secure key distribution and revocation are essential. • Another challenge is ensuring secure seamless movement of increasing number of flying connected devices within different heterogeneous networks. • In addition, 3D localization, network planning, cell association, and spectrum sharing are yet another set of challenges that arise with the use of UAV ABS [98], [102]. Table 5. Blockchain for 3D networking. Reference Key contribution Blockchain platform and consensus algorithm Remarks Sun et al. [103] Highlights the importance of using blockchain for SAGIN in terms of decentralized control, privacy, data auditing, registration and authentication. However, to overcome the high latency and large storage space issues associated with blockchains, authors proposed an architecture with multiple blockchains; space chain, air chain, and ground chain. Blockchain simulator (Go language), BFT consensus for space and air chains, and DPoS or BFT for ground chain. Dedicated efforts are required to ensure security of cross chain technology. Moreover, dynamic sharding or DAG to increase throughput and use of technique such as zk-SNARK to improve privacy are proposed. Tan et al. [104] To remove the dependency on any central authority such as base station, authors proposed lightweight blockchain-enabled distributed key management for heterogeneous FANETs. Rationale is to include cluster heads which are resourceful UAVs in addition to regular UAVs and modify the structure of block and transaction. Miner election scheme using distributed random generation (DRG) protocol. The major limitation is that cluster heads are assumed to be honest. A rouge cluster head can send fake transactions and may revoke benign UAVs from the system. Shi et al. [105] To overcome the issues with the centralized (AAA) management of LS-HetNet, authors proposed using of blockchain-enabled decentralized AAA scheme. The approach does not required use of ACL for exercising access control. Ethereum private blockchain Challenges that still need to be addressed are enabling secure routing within blockchain and make blockchain lightweight and secure at the same time. Dai et al. [106] Highlights the challenges being faced by the emerging Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Network (SAGSIN) such as security and privacy issues as well as difficulty in resource sharing among heterogeneous networks. By integrating blockchain, network slicing and network softwarization, authors proposed frameworks for network management and brokerage services for SAGSIN. NA Optimization of large-scale cross-domain blockchain-based system is an open challenge to be addressed for maximum benefits. Approaches that can be used for cross-domain collaboration are game-theory and machine learning based. 5.1.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain has the required potential to offer secure and decentralized management of integrated heterogeneous mobile networks covering space, air, and ground [103]. In particular, blockchain and well-defined smart contracts can facilitate a decentralized solution for distributed key management, authentication, authorization, auditability. and trustless interoperability among heterogeneous networks (and even among various components of one network). Alladi et al. [107] reviewed the role of blockchain for UAVs and highlighted a wide range of benefits that can be achieved. Some of them are automated decision making, implementation of new business models, load balancing, detection of hijacks and data poisoning attacks, and avoidance of mid-air collisions [107]. To overcome the high latency and storage-intensive nature of blockchain for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN), Sun et al. [103] proposed the use of multiple blockchains, namely, space chain, air chain, and ground chain. Space chain is maintained by satellite network and to make this blockchain lightweight, Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus is used. The Air chain is maintained by air network (mostly UAV ABSs) and also by some trusted ground stations. Since ABSs are resource-constrained, authors used ground stations to perform computational tasks and ABSs simply acts like a mobile relay to flying users. Ground chain is maintained by mobile networks, ad-hoc networks and WiMAX. Additionally, for interoperability among three chains, the authors proposed the use of collaborative blockchain using side chain/relay technology. The authors carried out implementation using Ethereum. Their results show gains in terms of reduction in storage requirement, high average utilization, and reduced failure probability. Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) are considered important to realize 3D networking in 6G era by acting as airborne relays and providing on-demand extension of radio connectivity [108]. For distributed key management in the context of FANETs, blockchain is a promising technology, nevertheless, it incurs computational and storage overheads. Thus, to overcome the storage and computation issues associated with the use of blockchain for resource-constrained drones, Tan et al. [104] used heterogeneous FANETs containing resourceful drones (as cluster heads) in addition to usual drones. Moreover, to make use of blockchain lightweight for UAVs, authors modified the structure of a block as well as a transaction. In particular, the nonce and target difficulty fields were removed. Consequently, PoW consensus algorithm is not used. In fact, a miner election scheme is used which decides a miner who is given chance to generate the next block. The limitations of the proposed work are that the cluster heads are assumed to be honest and deployment of resourceful UAVs as cluster heads might be costly and at times not feasible for the state-of-art industrial UAVs. Shi et al. [105] deals with the issue of centralized management of data generated in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Networks (LS-HetNet). The authors put forward blockchain-based decentralized Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing (AAA) scheme for providing data access in LS-HetNet such that maintenance of Access Control List (ACL) is not required. Different phases are used for registration, access provisioning, and revocation of rights previously granted to the data consumers. To implement the proposed scheme authors used Ethereum private blockchain and evaluated throughput, storage overhead, and computation overhead. The results presented show the feasibility of the proposed scheme, nevertheless, rigorous testing on real-life testbeds is required to ensure efficacy. In [109], authors put forward a framework that comprises mobile mining nodes and communicating nodes. The latter types of nodes are connected via a high-bandwidth backhaul network and help former types of nodes to communicate mining results. Following this approach, authors in [26] integrated blockchain with federated learning for 6G edge to deal with disaster management. To ensure security, privacy and efficient resource sharing for Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Network (SAGSIN) in 6G era, authors in [106] proposed close integration of blockchain, network slicing and network softwarization. In particular, blockchain-based network management and blockchain-enabled brokerage services are presented for SAGSIN. Some of the important functionalities offered by decentralized blockchain-based network management of SAGSIN are ID management, authentication, authorization and firmware update management. Whereas blockchain-enabled brokerage service for cross-domain environment offers secure SLA, peer-to-peer payment settlement, and smart contract based tight access control. 5.1.3. Summary The use of blockchain for 3D networking can provide decentralized and secure solutions for data accessing, offloading, and interoperability. Moreover, the idea of using multiple blockchains along with hierarchical structure is highly appealing for 3D networks. Table 5 provides the summary of important related works using blockchain for 3D networks. Nevertheless, efforts are required to design lightweight encryption mechanisms and consensus algorithms to run blockchain-based solutions on UAVs. In the case of the use of multiple parallel blockchains, cross-chain security and isolation among blockchains need to be ensured [103]. Furthermore, efficient ways are needed to perform transaction prioritization in blockchain, and to handle interoperability when different networks have their decentralized platforms. 5.2. Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) Radio spectrum is a scarce and indispensable resource for mobile communication; thus, its overall management (allocation, sensing, and sharing) must be carried out efficiently in 6G networks. The traditional way of static spectrum allocation using Fixed Spectrum Access (FSA) policy by telecommunication regulatory bodies though ensures legitimate use of the spectrum but results in under-utilization of the allocated spectrum [110]. In recent years, various Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) mechanisms have emerged, such as Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA), Licensed Shared Spectrum (LSA), and Spectrum Access System (SAS) [111]. In general, the DSM system comprises two types of users: primary user and secondary user. The primary user (aka incumbent user) is an authorized entity with the exclusive right over the allocated spectrum; however, it might not be able to utilize the spectrum completely all the time. The secondary user is the one who gets access to the unused spectrum shared by the primary user. DSA allows the secondary user devices to assess the radio spectrum environment continually and automatically adjust operating frequencies to accommodate changing capacity/interference conditions [112]. However, the interference-free access and QoS is not ensured in DSA [113]. In LSA, the telecom regulatory body oversees the sharing agreement to overcome this issue  [114]. In other words, a secondary user must get an LSA license from the regulatory body to access the spectrum primary user (or the incumbent) is ready to share. MNOs or MVNOs are usually the secondary users. The requirement for DSM becomes even more critical in 6G era since the number of private networks or local operators are expected to increase and coexist with public networks [115]. The successful emergence of local (micro) operators calls for dynamic spectrum sharing between MNOs (or other incumbent users). 5.2.1. Key challenges • The traditional (centralized) way of spectrum allocation and management has numerous challenges. These are high administrative cost, security vulnerabilities, privacy leakage, unoptimized spectrum allocation, existence of intermediaries to purchase spectrum, slow process of establishing spectrum sharing agreement, and difficulty to ensure compliance to SLA transparently. • Although cognitive radio provides users the ability to exploit the unused spectrum, however, malicious unlicensed Secondary Users (SUs), using the spectrum-sensing mechanism, can randomly access the unused spectrum or channels by the licensed-Primary Users (PUs). Subsequently, they can launch attacks, such as primary user emulation or Denial of Service (DoS), affecting the cognitive radio network’s performance and security [116]. • In the case of shared spectrum, the primary issue with the private networks is the coexistence, i.e., managing Priority Access License (PAL) users and General Authorized Access (GAA) users to ensure how they can coexist by sharing the spectrum relatively [117]. Since private networks will continue to exist in 6G, designing a dedicated Spectrum Access System (SAS) will be crucial and challenging at the same time. 5.2.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain turns out to be a highly promising technology for dynamic spectrum allocation, sharing, accessing, and overall management, including auctioning and payment settlement. In particular, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has already identified the potential of blockchain for efficient management of spectrum [120]. Specifically, blockchain has immense potential to improve the localized visibility in spectrum usage and ease of auditability of overall activities for effective implementation of spectrum sharing rules [137]. Table 6. Blockchain for Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSM). Reference Key contribution Experimental setup Parameters evaluated Remarks [118] Considering the centralized dynamic spectrum sharing attack prone and non-transparent, authors proposed blockchain-enabled privacy-protected double auction mechanism for decentralized and auditable dynamic spectrum sharing. Truffle framework along with IPFS were used to develop a DApp Spectrum provider’s revenue and social welfare (difference of spectrum demanders’ utility and providers’ utility) The task of determining the winner of double auction mechanism is formulated as integer linear programming and solved using Hungarian algorithm. [119] To overcome the high administration cost and the privacy issues faced by the traditional CBRS, authors leveraged blockchain to propose distributed CBRS. Furthermore, ring signature is used to ensure users’ privacy, and proof-of-strategy is proposed as a new lightweight consensus algorithm. Simulations using MATLAB platform Failure rate of system, recognition rate (of both authentic users and malicious users), and system utility were evaluated Genetic algorithm is used to solve the consensus puzzle which is a class of binary integer programming. [120] To improve the resource utilization in 6G networks, authors presented collaborative blockchain and AI for dynamic resource sharing. In particular, blockchain is used for achieving security, automation, regulation, and payment settlement, whereas, AI is used to attain improved pattern recognition and intelligent decision making. Simulation based setup is used and traffic is modeled using Poisson process Profit ratio and throughput per licensed time slot are evaluated Two-tier blockchain structure is used — local blockchain per area (comprises of mobile devices and base station of that area) and global blockchain (comprises of all the base stations). [121] To address the issue of low utilization efficiency of radio spectrum, authors proposed blockchain-based automated pricing model for secondary spectrum market trades among Primary Licensed Operators (PLOs). Simulation based experimental setup is used Total revenue of PLOs, floor values and sensitivity analysis are performed A new blockchain token named as spectrum dollar is used as incentive for spectrum trades in secondary markets. [122] To enable secure, privacy protected, and incentivized sharing of underutilized spectrum by H2H users for M2M communications, authors proposed blockchain based two-stage framework. In the first stage, H2H enters into contract with base station to share spectrum, and in second stage this shared spectrum is shared with M2M devices. Simulations based experiments are performed Amount of shared spectrum resources and utility of primary and secondary users are evaluated Contract theory is utilized to resolve the incentive optimization problem under information asymmetry. [123] To meet various challenges & functionalities required by increasing private local operators, authors put forward Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform. In particular, various functionalities such as subscription management for service registration, reputation management for service quality, fraud prevention for roaming instances, and data management are enabled in a decentralized and secure manner. Simulation based experiments using MATLAB and implementation using Ethereum test network Rinkeby are done Roaming cost, service charge, error rate, execution and transaction costs, and latency are evaluated. The structures used for various smart contracts used for DApp are given in the paper. [124] To effectively realize micro-operator based small cell deployments, authors presented blockchain and SDN integrated architecture where the complex service level agreements (SLAs) are coded as smart contracts. These smart contracts run on blockchain layer which logically sits on top of SDN layer. Ethereum private blockchain with PoW consensus algorithm and simulation module. Received signal strength, network throughput and transaction scalability are evaluated. Cost savings, and increase in network coverage with guarantee QoS are the main advantages of deploying micro-operator based small cell. Table 7. Summary of security attacks and tentative mitigation techniques with blockchain. Attack Description Blockchain based solution DDoS Attacks An attacker targets the resource consumption or protocol vulnerability of a single victim node by using malicious codes installed on several computers. Authors in [125] proposes a blockchain-based approach for intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS mitigation. They use smart contracts to facilitate collaboration among SDN-based networking domains. The work [126] use smart contracts for AI-based DDoS detection and mitigation. Eavesdropping An illegal action of a third party to secretly capture data being exchanged between both sides of communication. [127] adopts the blockchain platform (Ethereum) to decentralize a dynamic distributed honeypot system and store the port access data by delivering a private chain. Scanning attacks Send requests to all ports of a target host, aiming at exploring the opened ports and further exploiting associated bug to launch attacks. In [127], a private blockchain is used for encrypted communication and services transformation. It mitigates spoofing attacks with changing service IP addresses due to transformation property. Spoofing attacks This attack occurs when fake entities can trick users into sharing information for malicious activities. Use multi-layered blockchain framework for smart mobility data-market to enforce fair trade with smart contracts. The identity keys will reduce the number of fake users and node spoofing attack [128], [129]. Man-in-the-Middle This happens during data transmission where an adversary eavesdrops, intercepts and manipulates the information. The work [130] uses an ultra-lightweight RFID protocol targeted for integration in a supply chain management system that utilizes permissioned blockchain network. Sybil attack Adversaries create numerous fake identities to gain a disproportionately large influence. Trusted transaction mechanism is developed with permissionless tamper-proof blockchain-based data structure for storing transaction records of agents without central control [131]. Selfish mining attack When the selfish miners attempt to increase their rewards by deliberately keeping their blocks private Introduce a life-time or an expiry time for the blocks to prevent block withholding by selfish miners. Author in [132] formulate a set of Markov chains to capture the state transitions of private and public chains. Hijacking A network security attack divert traffic of legitimate users and network towards hijacked addresses. In [133], a blockchain based distributed prefix authentication protocol is used in ICN for authenticating mobile users. Each router in the network authenticates the prefix to verify the ownership before updating and forwarding the state of the network. Poisoning attack Attackers intentionally inject false data into the training pool of ML model. Replace the central authority by a blockchain system integrated with federated learning from the aspect of fog servers [134]. The work [135] employs a private blockchain to deliver a collaborative deep learning task in IoT. Privacy attack Attackers intentionally capture personal data of the users and to impose attacks. Using digital signatures generated for a group of blockchain participants where group members remain anonymous [28]. Zero-knowledge arguments and proofs methods [28] and Coin mixers [136] are some other techniques to protect privacy. In contrast with the traditional exclusive frequency allocations, spectrum sharing by definition involves multiple entities with shared access rights to use the spectrum. Here, the users exchange spectrum usage rights to fulfill their needs [138]. In this regard, blockchain can be used to set-up a trustless, decentralized and open spectrum trading platforms. Nevertheless, blockchain-empowered open trading of spectrum resources may lead to privacy issues like revealing trading patterns or leakage of bids made in auction-based spectrum sharing. Various privacy-protection mechanisms based on blockchain and smart contracts can be used to protect the trading entities from such privacy threats. In this line of approach, Tu et al. [118] presented a double-auction scheme, which is deployed as a smart contract in a blockchain platform. To preserve the privacy of users, differential privacy, in addition to asymmetric encryption, is used during the bidding process. Furthermore, the problem of determining a winner in the double auction scheme, is formulated as Integer Linear Programming (ILP). With a similar aim to overcome the privacy risks plus the issues like administrative overheads and single-point-of-failure associated with traditional Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), Zhang et al. [119] proposed a distributed CBRS model using blockchain. CBRS, originally proposed by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is regarded as a potential candidate to meet the high spectral efficiency requirement for 6G. Authors, in particular, put forward Proof-of-Strategy (PoS) as a new consensus algorithm that is not only lightweight but also integrates with the spectrum allocation process, i.e., the system reaches the consensus by evaluating the spectrum allocation strategy. Moreover, the use of ring signature technique protects privacy by ensuring unlinkability between users’ real-world identities and their pseudonyms. Similarly, Hu et al. [120] posited two-level hierarchical blockchain architecture powered by AI to manage spectrum resources effectively. In particular, authors manifest the use of blockchain to offer improved functionalities such as resource advertisement, spectrum regulation, a record of spectrum usage, and financial settlement. AI is suggested to provide usage pattern recognition using deep learning and intelligent decision-making using deep reinforcement learning. Moreover, the use of hierarchical blockchain reduces administrative costs, decreases computational and storage overheads, and minimizes the complexity of consensus algorithms. Nonetheless, blockchain overheads and techniques to acquire the training data for AI models with complete privacy compliance are still challenging. Furthermore, blockchain can enable guarantee SLA and dispute-free fast financial agreements for quasi-real time spectrum sharing (i) between different MNOs, and (ii) between MNOs and micro/local operators [139]. For instance, Khan et al. [121] leveraged blockchain to carry out fair trading of spectrum in the future Secondary Spectrum Market (SSM) by eliminating the possible economic malpractices. In particular, the authors proposed tokenization of spectrum in form of a new virtual coin named ‘Spectrum dollar’. Thus, their proposition allows disintermediation of financial (central) exchanges and faster financial settlement. Moreover, the authors used the floor-and-trade rule to tune the price of a spectrum dollar to maximize the profit, minimize the loss, and ensure loss-free trading. Nevertheless, building confidence and onboarding MNOs and local operators to such decentralized solutions with spectrum tokenization will be challenging. Blockchain has been shown to assist the sharing of spectrum by Human-to-Human (H2H) users with mobile networks to cater to the massive connectivity needs for M2M communications. Zhou et al. [122] proposed a blockchain-enabled framework that (i) preserves privacy in terms of spectrum sharing cost announced by H2H users, which acts like primary users and share their spectrum, (ii) facilitates optimized incentives to H2H users by employing contract-theory, and (iii) optimizes the allocation of the shared spectrum (by H2H users) to M2M devices by developing a matching solution. In general, such a technique can be helpful in dynamic spectrum management in future convergence of heterogeneous networks towards 3D networks. Nevertheless, the scenario involving multiple services and multiple base stations still needs to be studied, as stated in their work. In context of MNOs augmented with micro/local operators, blockchain as a service has been proposed to automate the secure management of spectrum between MNOs and local operators. Such a service can provide: (i) selection of spectrum owners (i.e. MNOs acting as primary user), (ii) open auction in secondary spectrum market, (iii) direct P2P payment for spectrum sharing, and dynamic creation of agreement using smart contracts [123]. With similar intent, Okon et al. [124] implemented a blockchain-based mechanism for spectrum sharing and SLA compliance in a multi-operator scenario characterized by small cell deployment by micro-operator. The authors implemented blockchain network as an overlay on SDN infrastructure. 5.2.3. Summary In nutshell, the broad roles of blockchain for 6G spectrum management are (i) decentralized, open and privacy-protected platform for intelligent spectrum trading, (ii) dispute-free and fast setting-up of agreements, (iii) tokenization of spectrum and P2P fast payments, and (iv) ease of monitoring and auditing to ensure SLA compliance while sharing spectrum. In particular, blockchain can be used as a secure and decentralized database for spectrum management that can record all the activities related to spectrum management. Table 6 provides the summary of related works that focus on using blockchain for spectrum management. Though there are significant advantages in using blockchain for dynamic spectrum management, however, deployment of blockchain network within the premises of cognitive radio network is challenging keeping in mind the resource-constrained mobile users [110]. Other practical challenging task will be the onboarding MNOs and local operators to a blockchain-based open platform which has no central authority. 5.3. Security Security is an all-time important property in telecommunication and networking. Starting from no security mechanism and hard handovers in 1G, authentication, anonymity, and encryption-based security were introduced in 2G [5]. In 3G, security features of 2G were enhanced by introducing Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA), two-way authentication, and 3GPP’s air-interface security and network authentication by users [7]. With 4G Enhanced Packet System-AKA (EPS-AKA), mutual authentication, trust mechanism, and handover key management were introduced. 5G incorporated many advanced security features like better mutual authentication capabilities, Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI), Extensible Authentication Protocol-AKA (EAP-AKA) [140], and 5G-AKA, Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) based identification mechanism [141], [142]. In future 6G networks, many security challenges may encounter due to extremely large network of heterogeneous networks, and the expected extremely higher reliability requirements. In order to thwart more sophisticated adversaries, advanced and intelligent security mechanisms will be needed [31], [143], [144]. 5.3.1. Key challenges Following are few security challenges identified in the envisioned 6G networks. • Confidentiality and integrity will be challenging since the future 6G infrastructure may portray enormous threat surfaces with wireless connectivity and the massive data volume generated in the network. • Uninterrupted service accessibility will be another challenge because the broader threat surface and massive connectivity will enhance the risk of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks [5], [145]. • The authentication and access control mechanisms need to be scaled-up to meet the diversification of 6G tenants, which are resource-intensive and may create bottlenecks in associated services. In particular, the centralized way of access control poses significant challenges in the design of future networks [7]. • Auditing will be another challenging security perspective due to the assessment requirements of a huge number of tenants (e.g., managing network slices among multiple tenants.). • With the emergence of ubiquitous intelligence in 6G, AI/ML based security attacks may also incur in 6G networks. In contrast, AI can be used as a tool for detecting, predicting, and mitigating security attacks. Therefore, the deployment of proactive security mechanisms and detection of zero day attacks will be vital security challenges in 6G [146], [147].

Possible security attacks and challenges in 6G networks along with the security features which may accompany with blockchain. 5.3.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain is emerging as an intriguing solution to implement security, accountability, surveillance and governance of mobile networks. Table 7 summarizes the possible security attacks that can occur in the next generation of mobile networks and their possible mitigation using blockchain. Blockchain-based 6G networks may resist the eavesdropping and hijacking threats using the blockchain properties such as immutability, transparency, non-repudiation, and provenance. Blockchain provides decentralized means of trust among untrusted users because it can withstand Sybil attacks [148], [149], [150]. Notably, in a Sybil attack, an attacker creates a large number of fake identities in a peer-to-peer network-based system and gains higher influence because of the sheer size of fake identities. By using efficient consensus protocols, such as PoW, blockchain ensures only genuine users control the system [151], [152]. Also, as only the participating nodes can view or add new transactions, such a combination will mitigate the chance of data modification and man-in-the-middle attacks. In addition, authentication, access control and accountability are key security aspects that can be addressed by deploying well-designed smart contracts on top of the blockchain. Furthermore, as stated in [29], the use of blockchain allows (i) secure training of AI/ML models based on the immutable data stored on blockchain typically in heterogeneous network scenario, (ii) trust-building by transparently storing data related to the decision-making process in AI/ML based systems, and (iii) trustless collaborative optimization of ML models by secure exchange of model parameters. For AI/ML functions, it is vital to have trusted execution for security. Smart contracts provide a distributed mechanism for that purpose. For instance, the developed smart contract in [153] is used to detect network anomalies and malicious traffic, thus providing an analysis of network traffic between industrial IoT with a trained deep learning model in a secure distributed environment. El Azzaoui [154] proposed a framework ‘Block5GIntell’ where the support that blockchain can provide to AI for building secure 5G networks is discussed. Since will have AI at its core, blockchain has a significant role to play for 6G networks. From a different perceptive, 6G business ecosystem will be comprised of numerous stakeholders and business players, all working together to achieve common goals. Security will be of paramount importance to build trust among these players. In summary, Fig. 8 provides an illustration of possible security attacks and challenges in 6G networks along with the security features which are offered by blockchain. The circles indicate two key components of a 6G network, namely distributed AI and intelligent radio, which have the closest relationship with the applicability of blockchain for the security landscape. The possible types of attacks for which blockchain based solutions can be adopted in the envisioned 6G networks are listed on the left side rectangle in the figure. The attacks may occur at different levels such as edge level, application level, device level, wireless air interfaces, external network, or different 6G verticals. Moreover, the security threats may be exacerbated with network softwarization and the use of AI/ML techniques. Among these categories, the specific attacks that can be mitigated using blockchain are discussed in Table 7. Also, blockchain can be used for authentication, authorization and key management purposes in the communication networks [155], [156], [157]. Having a common communication channel in the form of blockchain will introduce trust among multiple stakeholders in 6G network to cooperate on a common platform even at unexpected failures of the networks [158]. 5.3.3. Summary Based on the above-related works, blockchain can be used as a security enabling technology in 6G networks to address the security features such as authentication, access control, communication integrity, availability, and accountability. Moreover, blockchain-based solutions can be formed to protect 6G networks from several attacks as presented in Table 7 and Fig. 8. However, incorporating such blockchain based security solutions will still be challenging in the 6G networks due to increase in device heterogeneity, the convergence of heterogeneous networks towards 3D networking, growth in big-data, and additional computational resources required for blockchain. Moreover, the security issues of blockchain itself need to be addressed from the perspective of 6G. 5.4. Privacy Given that a significantly higher level of heterogeneity will characterize the 6G ecosystem (in terms of users, devices, applications, services and stakeholders), privacy for such a complex ecosystem will be equally important, if not more, than security [159]. Preserving privacy while collecting, aggregating, and processing data in many application domains of 6G, such as healthcare, environmental protection, smart city, and social survey, will be essential [160]. Moreover, with every aspect of human lives getting connected and using of AI-enabled applications, both data privacy and user privacy must be protected. In addition, the novel 3D networking paradigm will allow the proliferation of flying connected devices. Despite the myriad of practical applications of UAVs, there are privacy concerns such as identity, trajectory (location), and mission privacy [161]. Thus, privacy will be an essential requirement for 6G networks, and compliance to privacy laws like GDPR [162] need to be ensured. 5.4.1. Key challenges Privacy preservation will be a significant consideration in the complex 6G network ecosystem. • The unauthorized access to virtualized networking resources can impose a high risk of connected users’ privacy [159]. Therefore, secure access control is one key challenge that arises for privacy preservation in vast data sets in 6G networks [107]. • With the emergence of massive-scale sensing systems (e.g., using UAVs) with cameras and sensors continuously collect data from surroundings, there can be many instances that may cause violation of data privacy. For example, crowd monitoring drones that collect information on large gatherings may impose threats on individual’s privacy. • Due to the enormous amount of data at centralized points such as data aggregation servers, data providers, and service providers, there can be the risk of privacy leakage [28]. • Since AI/ML are key enabling technologies of 6G, while collecting individual personal related data for training models, the risk of revealing data may create privacy attacks [146], [163]. 5.4.2. Role of blockchain Privacy is another technical aspect that can be met with the use of blockchain in 6G networks [28]. Having a common communication channel in the form of blockchain, can allow network users to be identified by pseudo names instead of direct personal identities [148]. Manogaran et al. [159] proposed a blockchain-based integrated security measure (dubbed as BISM) for 6G communication environment. In the proposed measure, virtualized resource access control and user privacy-preserving techniques are modeled with low time complexity and memory consumption. The authors considered the connected users and the virtualized resources, and the access control decisions are taken by maintaining the states of the resources using a Q-learning procedure. The performance of privacy preserving is measured by the user and resource level with respect to time complexity and memory consumption. However, the drawback is that the authors do not present the deployment of their proposed solution in a real blockchain platform. As stated in [164], the use of blockchain for 6G-enabled UAV communication is significantly efficient compared to the current communication networks. It may provide higher privacy and transparency during data acquisition and air traffic management while allowing fast uploading of data with higher bandwidth and lower latency among UAV applications. In [160], the authors proposed a blockchain-based privacy-aware distribution collection-oriented strategy for data aggregation. In their solution, privacy protection is achieved by improving blockchain with a new block header structure to decompose high sensitive tasks and actors into different groups. However, they do not provide the exact details on how the block header modification can be performed for data aggregation in a trustless network. Fan et al. [165] proposed a privacy preservation scheme that grants complete data ownership based on blockchain for content-centric 5G networks. The clearly defined access rules govern who gets to access the user’s data and when, i.e., time. Moreover, the adopted key management and the use of encrypted data strengthen privacy. The work considers the mutual trust between the users and the content providers and exploits a public blockchain. In addition to that, as stated in [166], blockchain technology can be applied together with differential privacy and homomorphic encryption techniques for enabling privacy preservation in 6G. Privacy preservation using machine learning is an emerging research area. In [167], authors design a blockchain-based architecture for secure data sharing among distributed entities by incorporating privacy-preserved federated learning. More specifically, federated learning is used to build and share data models instead of sharing the actual data, and differential privacy is used to protect data privacy. However, on one hand Blockchain is using as a tool for privacy preservation, on the other hand the transparency in the blockchain networks may affect the privacy requirements in the 6G networks. Particularly, in the permissionless blockchains, transparency and openness may create harmful effects to the user privacy [168]. Mixing services are integrated as a solution to achieve on-chain transaction privacy. For instance, the mixing services allow different users to collaboratively form one transaction with multiple inputs and outputs. Thereby the attacker is unable to distinguish the connectivity between the transaction inputs and the corresponding outputs. 5.4.3. Summary Although preserving privacy will always add an extra overhead, it is quite important as it will be an implicit indicator that ensures trust among the stakeholders in future 6G networks. However, ensuring the proper accountability to assure the privacy protection aspects of fully automated AI-driven systems in future networks will be a challenging research area. As described in the above section, the existing literature reveals the efforts of exploiting blockchain for privacy preservation in 6G as well as the drawbacks. The use of blockchain for 6G privacy needs to be handled carefully for keeping the correct balance between data privacy protection and the system performance for computational overhead. 5.5. Resource management Efficient resource management and sharing have become crucial due to the scarcity of networking, computing, and memory resources. In 5G networks, softwarization and virtualization based technologies such as SDN, NFV, and NS, have enabled efficient management of resources. Nevertheless, with the ever-growing number of subscribers and their connectivity requirements of more data-hungry and computationally advanced applications, resource management will be more challenging in 6G. On the other hand, the emergence of micro-operator-driven local networks promises to serve customized and location-aware needs of industry verticals and other organizations [169]. Although these local networks deployed as small cell can guarantee QoS and reliability, however, for their successful deployment, on-demand infrastructure sharing is essential [123]. Thus, the resource management in the next generation of networks must undergo drastic improvements to minimize the cost and maximize the utilization of the resources while catering to the existing and the new range of services and applications. 5.5.1. Key challenges Some of the key challenges pertaining to resource management in 6G networks are as follows. • As the number of network tenants (e.g., industry verticals) are increasing in parallel to the number of traditional mobile users; resource management will become more complicated [170]. In particular, the complexity arises not just due to massive connectivity requirements but also due to the time-varying and heterogeneous (at times orthogonal) service demands. Optimized management of physical and virtual resources under such dynamic scenarios will be challenging. • Centralized orchestration of resource trading would not be able to scale-up and meet various demands of network tenants and infrastructure providers in terms of security, transparency, and trustless trading. • The next-generation networks are becoming more distributed systems. Therefore, the networking and computational resources have to be managed by considering local availability and global requirements. 5.5.2. Role of blockchain The role of blockchain in 6G networks can be closely coupled with the dynamic resource management of next-generation networks. There are numerous alleviating roles that blockchain can play in future network softwarization related services. These services are automatic slice brokering, secure and optimized VNF placement, proactive service migrations to the edges, and transparent incentive mechanisms for sharing of unused resources. Blockchain-based network slice brokering is used to enable the dynamic interoperability and resource trading requirements of market players such as infrastructure providers, consumers, and mobile network operators in trading the network and computational resources [171], [172]. In addition to facilitating on-demand resource allocation and resource trading for RAN, computational resources, and storage, the slice broker performs admission control based on traffic monitoring and forecasting, including mobility, based on a global network view. In [173] authors studied the feasibility of blockchain and smart contracts to enabled network slice brokering in 5G networks. In particular, secure and autonomous network slice creation for industrial automation use case has been analyzed. Various industrial automation microprocesses such as testing, resource croudsourcing, sorting, grafting and streamlining have been considered and the applicability of blockchain-enabled 5G network slice broker for these microprocesses has been explored. Another pertinent work is [174] where authors proposed a blockchain-based decentralized resource trading and distributed task assignment scheme for IoT devices. Game theory based smart contracts are used for the process of optimal resource trading among the participants. The consensus mechanism in their solution guarantees the reliability and security of distributed resource trading and task assignment. Likewise, in [175], the Stackelberg game theory model is exploited in edge computing resource trading for mobile blockchain. In particular, they consider the offloading of mining computation tasks to the edge computing service providers in a multi-user environment. In [176] also, the authors propose the use of public blockchain for MEC network with a Stackelberg game-based learning framework. Blockchain has also been exploited for edge caching and slice orchestration at the edge of the network [177], [178], [179]. In [177], the authors consider a joint resource allocation in blockchain-based MEC using a double auction mechanism. Using a tamper-proof ledger in blockchain, the authors could prevent the malicious edge servers from tampering with the player information. The resource management in edge clouds will be challenging due to the requirements of reliability, scalability, and fair service allocation. As stated in [180], blockchain can be used to face these challenges since it does not need a centralized scheduler, can handle intelligent contracts and ensure security. When the blockchain-based resource management schemes do not require a centralized scheduler, it can improve the robustness of the edge computing paradigm. Furthermore, blockchain capabilities can be utilized when spare or unused computational capabilities of nearby mobile and other devices need to be harnessed. In this scenario, smart contracts along with tokenized rewards can be used to compensate such nearby devices for sharing their resources [181]. However, in terms of device performance, the resource management in 6G with blockchain has two-fold problems. On the one hand, it has to develop lightweight blockchain solutions for low-cost low-performing devices. On the other hand, high-performance blockchain and decentralization for the vertical industries and future networks. Moreover, the use of public blockchains for resource management may create privacy breaches [182]. 5.5.3. Summary Throughout this section we have identified few research efforts where blockchain is used for resource management in 5G and 6G networks in terms of resource trading with network slice brokers, edge caching, and wireless resource utilization. Table 8 provides the summary of important related works using blockchain for network resource management. Based on the above related works, the key limitations encountered with the use of blockchain for resource management include the extra overhead and the privacy breaches. Table 8. Blockchain for resource management. Reference Key contribution Experimental setup Parameters evaluated Remarks Afraz et. al. [172] Propose a blockchain-based network slice broker as a dynamic trading platform for cloud resource providers and network operators to provision network slices dynamically. Cloud-based Hyperledger Fabric Transaction latency, throughput and computing intensity The experiments are performed to determine the feasibility of the solution. Further research is required to assess the impact in the 5G and 6G slicing market performance. Qiao et. al. [174] Proposes a blockchain based framework for decentralized resource trading and distributed task assignment in device-to-device edge computing and networks. Numerical analysis Service latency and revenue of resource providers For the resource trading in IoT networks, the task assignment is performed using game theory based smart contract. Only the feasibility analysis is provided and the proof-of-concept and overhead computation is missing. Fan et. al. [175] Propose a three-stage Stackelberg game approach for pricing-based edge computing resource offloading of mobile blockchain miners operated in IoT networks. Numerical analysis Service utility and unit service price of edge service providers Mining tasks are offloaded to both edge and centralized service providers in order to make it a promising approach for more complex future networks. However, the feasibility of the proposed solution is proposed only with the simulation results. Asheralieva et. al. [176] Propose a hierarchical learning framework with Stackelberg game based model for a public blockchain realized in a mobile edge computing (MEC) network. Simulation setup in OPNET platform Payoff for miners and service providers It is proven that the learning algorithms converge to stable states when the miners’ actions are the best responses to the optimal price assigned by the SP. Proof of concept is missing from this work. Sun et. al. [177] Propose a two-hop edge caching framework for 6G using blockchain and physical layer security techniques. It considers data reliability and frequencies to optimize the probabilities of content caching and secure transmission. Simulation setup Probabilities of secure transmission, content caching and redundancy rate The proposed blockchain based framework assures the security of historical data and the privacy of users. No implementation is provided in this work. 5.6. Ubiquitous intelligence In 6G, the concept of hyper-intelligence envisions a smart and autonomous networks which will facilitate key operational functions such as self-configuration, self-monitoring, self-healing, and self-optimization with minimal human effort and intervention [183]. Furthermore, the network services and applications will be hyper-flexible, customizable, and adaptive in a self-driven manner to provide the best user experience ubiquitously. This cognitive network inherently aims to integrate AI/ML as a native element in future networks, i.e., ubiquitous intelligence. For instance, the first step towards hyper-intelligent networks is ETSI ZSM architecture entailing closed-loop operation and AI/ML techniques with pervasive automation of network management operations [184]. Furthermore, distributed learning and intelligence schemes such as Federated Learning will be widely used across the network as a mechanism for distributed AI in heterogeneous settings [185]. 5.6.1. Key challenges The key challenges for ubiquitous intelligence in 6G networks can be summarized as follows: • Complexity and optimization for AI/ML: The diversity and complexity of 6G networks will lead to challenges in terms of human-in-the-loop management and system optimization tasks. Autonomic and self-driven management and optimization schemes are crucial. However, the complexity of such intelligent schemes and how they can be optimized are challenging questions [12]. The overall complexity is to be managed, and the AI/ML adoption should be optimized. • Integration of trusted nodes into distributed learning settings: The distributed nature of intelligence in 6G calls for an integrated operation of disparate parties for smart infrastructure. This is also due to the multi-party and multi-domain structure of softwarized and service-based architecture inherited from 5G networks and extended further [186]. However, trustworthiness for AI/ML agents is a not trivial attribute and may impair the intelligence performance in 6G networks. • Secure data sharing for pervasive intelligence: The centralized storage and management feature in 6G AI applications may incur threats to data security (e.g., stealing or malicious tampering due to compromise of the server), resulting in privacy violation and interference with normal network functions [27]. This is an important challenge for large-scale and multi-party networked systems such as 6G. • Large-scale AI/ML applications: The ubiquitous intelligence for various use cases and applications will lead to a more decentralized data storage and exchange architecture in 6G. This drive is also related to the cooperative and federated services and infrastructure flexibly bound together for smart immersive environments and objects. An important challenge is how to devise and integrate technologies to enable such scalability for ubiquitous intelligence. 5.6.2. Role of blockchain Since the pervasive use of AI/ML will be realized in a distributed and large-scale 6G system for various technical aspects including network management, distributed AI/ML techniques are supposed to enforce rapid control and analytics on the extremely large amount of generated data in 6G networks. Blockchain can provide important functionalities towards ubiquitous intelligence in 6G networks. One such aspect is AI governance and data sharing. Governing and sharing the learning results efficiently, reliably, and safely are hampered by the heterogeneity and non-confidence among edges. For instance, in [187], Qiu et al. elaborated on the concept of blockchain energized edge intelligence for B5G networks and develop a distributed and immutable record of learning results, namely, Ai-Chain. Furthermore, the authors developed a new learning-based consensus protocol called proof of learning (PoL) that considers the results of local training processes running at edge learning nodes as a race that needs a consensus on the winning node. However, their work assumes every edge node to have the same number of neural cells and the same number of layers in their neural network. In realistic scenarios, this might not always be feasible. Another important role of blockchain is to support context awareness and autonomicity. Hyper-intelligent 6G networks have to be context-aware for network management as well as providing smart digital services. It is possible with ultra-scale sensing functions (discussed in the following paragraph), which will support such context-aware operation. Additionally, they need to be self-driven and autonomic to be able to meet performance KPIs. Blockchain will provide trusted execution with smart contracts and data sharing for context-awareness and, consequently, autonomic operation. However, the complexity of blockchain-based solutions for that purpose may lead to a burden. Ultra-scale sensing is another important capability as the integration of advanced sensor technologies with mobile networks accompanied by low-energy communication capabilities will lead to pervasive intelligent sensing and localized services [188]. Blockchain will also serve as a decentralized and trustworthy data stratum for ultra-scale sensing and big data analytics in 6G. This is a crucial utility of blockchain since sensing is a foundational pillar for intelligent services and networks. As an application of blockchain for intelligent sensing in Beyond 5G networks, Reebadiya et al. proposed a blockchain-based secure and intelligent sensing and tracking architecture for CAVs using beyond 5G communication networks in [189]. Their proposed architecture ensures secure sensing and object tracking through blockchain by deploying AI algorithms at the edge servers while the B5G network enables low latency and high reliability communications for serving these time-sensitive applications. For 6G networks, the anticipated services require very stringent and consistent QoE/QoS performance. This is only possible through a very effective and smart resource management framework in the network access. However, the resource scarcity and efficiency requirements make this kind of operation challenging. Control of massive-scale intelligent surfaces is a particular management challenge in 6G. The use of programmable intelligent surfaces to cover man-made structures (e.g., buildings, roads, indoor walls) allows intelligent control of the transmission environment in wireless systems [190]. Such intelligent surfaces are going to play an important role for 6G networks and will be beneficial the quality of radio signal is degraded. In a blockchainized 6G network, blockchain provides the key capability of facilitating federated control among disparate intelligent surfaces. Moreover, intelligent surface control functions from different administrative domains (e.g., different network operators) can exchange synchronization and reconfiguration information using blockchain. 5.6.3. Summary Blockchain can serve as an enabler for implementing pervasive intelligent networks via secure data sharing, immutability, and decentralized architecture. The decentralized paradigm also provides a more robust intelligence stratum for the entire network ranging from smart devices to cloud services. It can facilitate federated very large-scale AI/ML applications for smart and autonomous digital connected services. Therefore, a decentralized and secure data sharing technique without a so-called trusted third entity or intermediary, i.e., blockchain is promising in future 6G [27]. However, the overhead, scalability, and interoperability challenges of blockchain are especially apparent on the way to achieve the ubiquitous intelligence objective of 6G. For instance, the energy consumption due to blockchain functions such as consensus and cryptographic operations are challenges limiting the utility of blockchains. This phenomenon heralds the critical need for analysis of the energy and environmental impact of pervasive blockchain adoption in 6G, and thus research for its minimization is essential. Moreover, the scalability aspect needs to be improved for realizing ultra-scale intelligence solutions. There are also new attacks emerging which try to impair the reliability and accuracy of AI/ML solutions using blockchains, which the research community needs to heed more elaborately in the future [28]. 5.7. Mobility management Since 6G networks will be a super-dense network of networks and will make use of a higher frequency spectrum (GHz/THz range), the 2D cell boundaries would shrink to a few meters [8]. This drastic reduction in 2D cell size would require more base stations to cover the same area, and so the expected number of handovers for mobile users will also increase exponentially. Furthermore, because of the non-optimized handover mechanisms for various overlapping and small coverage base stations (such as Picocell, Femtocell, and UAV-based ABSs), the handover probability (HOP), Handover Failure Probability (HFP), Handover Ping-Pong Probability (HPPP) effect, and Radio Link Failure (RLF) will increase significantly [191]. Subsequently, it will have an adverse impact both on throughput and delay. On the other hand, the advent of 3D networking will support 3D mobility of flying users, requiring new mobility management techniques since handover will also happen in vertical direction [2]. As 6G aims to offer ultra-reliable low-latency communication, the efficient management of mobility is very crucial [191]. 5.7.1. Key challenges Some of the challenges pertaining to mobility management in next-generation networks are as follows. • Distributed Mobility Management (DMM), an initiative of IETF, has numerous security issues such as impersonation attack, session hijacking, DoS attack, man-in-middle attack, and attacks by malicious entities involved. These issues make DMM’s use challenging for mobility management. • To ensure the secure handovers and avoid performance degradation, forward secrecy is crucial, which protects the past session keys (and corresponding communications) even if the long-term secrets of UE and APs are compromised in the future. In addition to the forward secrecy, simultaneously achieving other requirements (e.g., mutual authentication, key agreement, traceability, and robustness) is a significant challenge [192], [193]. • Use of centralized authentication server for mobility management leads to both performance and security issues. • Roaming fraud due to inefficient and delay-prone data exchanges between a home network and a visitor network causes high economical losses [194]. Such roaming fraud can be a critical challenge in future 6G networks because of the densification of networks, 3D networking, and popularity of micro-operators powered local/private networks [123]. 5.7.2. Role of blockchain The combination of blockchain and smart contracts can establish trust among mobile users and mobile networks in a distributed and anonymized fashion. Various use of blockchain to efficiently manage mobility in wireless networks are discussed as follows. DMM aims to overcome the issues (e.g., single-point-of-failure and sub-optimal routing) related to traditional centralized mobility management [195]. The rationale of DMM is to distribute the control of mobility across the network. Nevertheless, as pointed out by Sharma et al. [196], DMM suffers from security issues like session hijacking, DoS attack, and attacks by Mobile Anchors and Access Routers (MAARs). These issues are mainly because security is implemented in a centralized manner. Thus, authors in [196] proposed blockchain-based DMM, which provides distributed security, fault-tolerance, and identity management. Though their scheme has been shown to be promising, however, high storage redundancy due to multiple distributed ledgers is challenging. Furthermore, how the initial authentication of mobile devices happens is not discussed and is assumed to happen using a private secure channel. Lai et al. [197] provides a solution to handover authentication for group communication scenario in VANETs where mobility of fleet of vehicles is to be managed. The authors used aggregate message authentication code, one-time password, and blockchain to reduce the handover overload. The proposed protocol uses Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) algorithm for session key management. The protocol uses blockchain in which the vehicle, control mobility databases, and mobility access routers, store the vehicle’s key information, which mobility access routers can use later to authenticate the vehicles. In addition to fulfilling the security requirements such as session key confidentiality and immunity towards reply attack and sybil attack, the authors demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective in the context of handover latency and computation and communication overheads. Similarly, the use of blockchain for authentication during handover while protecting user’s privacy in SDN-based 5G Networks has been presented by Yazdinejad et al. [198]. As 6G will use SDN and NVF to manage the networks efficiently, it is expected that blockchain can play a significant role in mobility management. The authors in [192] proposed RUSH, which provides anonymous mutual authentication with key authentication, robust traceability, and perfect forward secrecy by using chameleon hash functions and blockchains. In RUSH, after the initialization phase, a user registers in a network to get the service. Subsequently, the user prepares for the handover phase. It first chooses a pseudo-identity, computes various parameters to prove the legitimacy of his identity, and submits the authentication parameters to the access point. The access point checks the freshness of the information to prevent replay attacks and verifies the legitimacy of the authentication parameters. The authors compared the proposed mechanism in terms of authentication message sizes and the storage cost and concluded that both the parameters decrease in the proposed scheme. The authors used Burrow-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic to check the security properties of the proposed anonymous mutual authentication. Furthermore, to formally verify the proposed authentication mechanism, the authors used AVISPA model checkers. For ensuring the secure handover key management with complete forward key separation, Lee et al. [199] proposed a novel approach, named Parallel Blockchain Key Derivation Function (PB-KDF). Their proposed architecture comprises an entity named Authentication Center, which initially collects the public keys of all the Base Stations and then puts them together to form a genesis block. This genesis block is then shared with all the Base stations in a geographical area belonging to one administrative domain. By doing so, all the base stations get public keys of all the other base stations that they can use for secure communication. When a user device joins a base station, the base station sends the genesis block to the user device. Upon receiving the genesis block, the user device sends its public key and a timestamp to the base station. The base station shares this information with other base stations. Hence, each base stations have the same data about the user, which is used for creating a proof-of-work challenge. Similar to [192], the authors in [199] used BAN logic to prove various security objectives and evaluated the performance of their system in terms of packet loss vs. distance between base stations, latency incurred because of handover failure rates, and key derivation time. With the same intent to provide forward secrecy and meet the lightweight requirement for resource-constrained mobile devices and protect the privacy of users, Hu et al. [193] proposed an anonymous, temper-resistant and seamless handover authentication scheme. Their proposed scheme uses a chameleon hash function and blockchain-protected user certificate to perform handover authentication. When a user registers at the authentication server, the latter generates a unique certificate and uploads it to the blockchain. When the user moves to a new access point, s/he is authenticated by cross-checking with the original certificate available on the blockchain. The authors analyzed the security and efficiency of the proposed authentication scheme. They showed that their scheme provides conditional privacy based on the pseudonymity feature of blockchain, immunity to various attacks (like replay, man-in-middle, and passive eavesdropping attacks), and perfect forward secrecy of session key. Mobility of UE can also result in a roaming situation when the source and destination base stations belong to two different networks. The home network is where the UE is officially registered, and the visitor network is the one that has a prior agreement signed with a home network to provide services to the customers of the home network. Usually, it takes significant time to establish such roaming agreements, and also they are static in nature. The latter implies that traditional roaming agreement is apt when there are a standard set of services [200]. However, for heterogeneous, agile, and customized services as offered in 5G (and are expected with 6G), dynamic agreements are needed. Blockchain and smart contracts are considered to realize such dynamic roaming agreements [123]. Another vital issue associated with the current roaming system is roaming frauds that result in significant revenue loss. The primary cause behind roaming fraud is the presence of third-party entity called Data Clearing House (DCH). This DHC stands as an intermediary between a home and a visitor network and introduces a significant delay that hinders the home network from charging mobile UE under roaming, precisely [194]. To overcome the issue of roaming frauds, authors in [123], [194], [201] proposed the use of blockchain. In particular, authors in [194], [201] make use of blockchain and Stackelberg game theory based economic model to ensure secure communication, enable fast and decentralized data exchange between home and visitor network, and maximize profits of involved parties. 5.7.3. Summary Blockchain has been shown to have the potential to provide key derivation (with full forward secrecy) during handover, maintaining anonymity during authentication, reducing overall authentication overload, deploying fair economic incentive policies and mitigating roaming frauds. Significant research work has already manifested blockchain as an efficient tool to implement secure mobility management for MNOs, local operators, VANET, fog networks, and in general wireless mobile networks. Its role in 6G will continue to solve similar issues. However, the cost paid to use blockchain for mobility management is in the form of high storage requirements and additional computation resources to implement blockchain. Also, achieving transparency and verification while ensuring a fair incentive mechanism in a mobile environment is challenging as the number of UE estimated to use 6G networks are going to highly mobile and very volatile. 5.8. Other emerging technical aspects Some of the other technical aspects that can be ameliorated with the use of blockchain are discussed as follows. 5.8.1. Zero-touch network and service management (ZSM) ZSM, an initiative of ETSI, is an emerging paradigm to achieve the E2E network and service automation. The ultimate goal of ZSM is to realize a hundred percent autonomous networks capable of self-configuration, self-optimization, self-monitoring, self-healing, and self-scaling without any human intervention [202]. Thus, ZSM leads to flexible and agile delivery of services by ensuring economic sustainability in the diversified networks [72]. The ZSM architecture is formed using intent-based interfaces, closed-loop operation, and AI/ML techniques to empower full automation of the management operations. 6G complex ecosystem is envisioned to be comprised of multi-tenants, multi-operators (strengthened by local/micro operators), and multiple (virtual network) service providers. Thus, ZSM will play an instrumental role for 6G networks in achieving E2E automation of network resources and services that fall under different parts of a mobile network (e.g., core, transport, and radio access) spanning over multiple operators and service providers. Blockchain and AI-driven operations may support cross-domain security and trust orchestration mechanisms in the proposed ZSM architecture by assisting service lifecycle automation in multi-tenant and multi-stakeholder environments [203]. DLTs like blockchain can be adopted to implement distributed security and trust through smart contracts among both trusted and non-trusted multiple parties (i.e., multi-tenant and multi-operator scenarios) [204]. This approach can be further combined with distributed AI for cognitive network orchestration, leading to zero-touch network automation. Thus, blockchain has the potential as a promising technology to promote trust in zero touch network management. However, it is still challenging to maintain the proper balance between data privacy and trust in a blockchain-based automated system to operate with assured information security. 5.8.2. Edge Computing (EC) and Federated Learning (FL) Edge Computing (EC) will continue to play a key enabling role in 6G networks by extending the computing and caching facilities offered by cloud servers to the edge of the mobile networks, i.e., very close to the end-users. Some of the well-known advantages of using EC are the closest proximity, extremely low latency, location and context awareness, real-time access, and high bandwidth capacity. Further, the potential use of AI/ML techniques within the premises of edge computing is popularly called Edge AI. However, for AI/ML based systems, there is a need to frequently send a significant volume of raw data to a centralized server to perform the training of AI/ML models. This uploading of raw data can lead to possible challenges in terms of data and user privacy, communication overheads, and extra load on resource-constrained mobile devices [205]. To overcome these issues Federated Learning (FL) turns out to be a promising distributed AI solution. In FL, statistical models are collaboratively trained directly at the participating devices with the locally generated (private) data. Thus, instead of sharing the raw data, FL allows devices to upload the locally trained model to the server. Blockchain is being considered as tool for Edge AI [187] and edge-based FL platforms [89] to provide trust, security, and strict access control. AI-native 6G is envisioned to offer intelligent predictive pre-caching at the edges to meet the needs of network tenants, efficiently. However, to carry out such analytics and prediction, logs of user’s activities are fed to AI/ML algorithms that raise privacy concerns. In this regard, Sun et al. [177] developed blockchain-driven edge caching architecture that aims to optimize both the cache hit rate and the redundancy rate while ensuring security and user’s privacy. There is an increasing number of works that aim to harness the synergy between FL and EC using blockchain. For instance, Lu et al. [206] use digital twins to improve the reliability of EC applications by creating digital twins of IoT devices in the EC server and performing data analysis on the digital replica present on the edge servers. Here, the authors used a blockchain-based FL to secure and protect data privacy of digital twins. In [207], authors proposed blockchain-enabled FL scheme for digital twin edge computing platform serving a huge number of IoT devices in 6G era. With the help of numerical results, the authors showed that their proposal can boost the communication security and preserve data privacy. 5.8.3. Interference management The process of managing the radio spectrum to minimize the interference and maximize the efficiency of spectrum utilization is referred to as interference management. Different types of interference are co-channel interference, adjacent channel interference, out-of-band interference, and remote interference. Co-channel interference occurs when two or more users transmit on the same frequency in the same geographic area. It reduces Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), hence reducing the throughput [208]. Adjacent channel interference happens when the receiver cannot reject off-channel signals of the desired signal at reference sensitivity level due to an adjacent channel signal. It occurs because the adjacent channel interferer’s modulation products are falling in the receiver’s IF passband [23], [209]. Out-of-band interference, also known as sideband noise, happens when transmitter emissions fall outside the transmitter’s intended channel bandwidth. This noise permeates into the adjacent channels or other bands and adds to the thermal noise floor of the receiver. Remote interference takes place when, during certain atmospheric conditions, downlink transmissions travel a large distance and interfere with uplink reception of another base station despite the guard period as the downlink generally has much higher transmit power than the uplink [210], [211]. It is a large-scale phenomenon, and thousands of base stations may interfere with each other at the same time [212]. Gamal et al. [213] emphasized the fact that the inference management for the next-generation wireless networks will see a significant difference as compared to the current generation wireless networks. In particular, the authors focused on Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) communication, which can boost the rate gains at the reduced delay. Nevertheless, CoMP suffers from unequal gains for participating users in every channel. To overcome the issue, the authors proposed a blockchain-based monetary mechanism that drives a greedy distributed strategy to avoid interference. The blockchain-based monetary mechanism uses a coin that is traded between the participating nodes. A node represents a transmitter–receiver pair. A node i pays a coin to node j , either when node i produces interference at the node j ’s receiver or when node i rents the transmitter of node j . Though their proposition is promising, however, the work needs to be evaluated with a prototypical implementation. Another interesting work by Vishal et al. [214] suggested using blockchain-enabled on-demand drones to support inter-service operability with minimal interference in the network. The authors presented the idea of forming an aerial blockchain comprising drones from different vendors. Thus, these drones are said to socialize via blockchain and form a common platform to provide interference-free fronthaul communication for a highly dense user environment. In summary, blockchain-based solutions can improve interference management by enabling dynamic collaboration and trust among the users. Furthermore, using blockchain for allocating frequency spectrum based on fair and trusted economic schemes can also avoid interference among primary and secondary users [25]. However, remote interference management would be complex, especially as 6G envisions to provide connectivity to UAV; remote interference would create problems both for UAVs and base stations. 5.8.4. Tactile Internet The evolution of the internet from mobile Internet to the Internet of things (or everything) is now moving towards Tactile Internet that aims to communicate physical, tactile experiences in real-time [215]. Thus, Tactile Internet requires ultra-reliable, ultra-responsive, and ultra-secure network connectivity with extremely low latency. Since these requirements match the 6G KPI, Tactile communications are envisioned to be rolled out in 6G era. Nevertheless, the key issue is to maintain data integrity and access control while delivering real-time control using tactile communication [216]. As in tactile communication, information related to the kinesthetic perception (such as applied force, the exact position, and velocity) and tactile perception (such as surface texture and necessary friction) will be transmitted to be reproduced at the receiver. Thus, any kind of security and privacy vulnerabilities will have a severe impact. For instance, in telesurgery, the consequences can be fatal. The use of blockchain has been looked upon as a possible solution to deal with security and privacy issues in Tactile Internet [217]. Hassija et al. [218] proposed a blockchain-based framework for drone-mounted base stations in the Tactile Internet environment. The authors used permissioned blockchain with authorized nodes and smart contracts to prevent any dispute. These nodes run on drones mounted with small cell stations and cellular base stations. Hassija et al. [219] put forward the use of blockchain to perform secure mobile data offloading in Tactile Internet scenario. The authors highlight that conventional blockchain suffers with poor scalability, inefficiency, and no provision of timestamp-based ordering required to handle mission-critical time-sensitive applications. To overcome these issues, the authors make use of (i) Hashgraph, which is based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and (ii) game-theoretic bargaining model. The use of Hashgraph offers consensus timestamp and Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (ABFT) mechanism, which is immune to colluding nodes, and the use game-theoretic model allows cost-effective negotiation for offloading. 5.8.5. Quantum Communication Quantum Communication (QC) is an emerging communication paradigm that encodes the information in a quantum state using photons or quantum particles and transfers these quantum states from one place to another [15], [74]. The security comes from the fact that the information cannot be accessed or cloned without tampering the quantum state because of quantum principles like the correlation of entangled particles, quantum superposition, quantum entanglement, the no-cloning theorem, and inalienable law [11], [53], [220]. There are several applications of QC, such as quantum key distribution and quantum secret sharing in long-distance communication with improved data rates due to the superposition nature of qubits. For instance, Liao et al. [221] have exhibited intercontinental QC between earth stations located in China and Austria using Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite as a relay. The distributed secure data storage and smart contract based strict access control features of blockchain can well support quantum (or semi-quantum) communication based applications in 6G era. Due to the complexity of quantum devices and their high prices, at present semi-quantum techniques are proposed. They aim to integrate quantum with classical cryptographic techniques. Zhu et al. [222] put forward two semi-quantum reflection protocols using blockchain technology for security enhancement and efficient management of Internet of Vehicle (IoV) scenario. The authors considered all the exchanges (as part of the semi-quantum protocol) over quantum channels as ‘transactions’ in blockchain parlance. Their proposed IoV architecture is shown to be immune to most of the attacks under the no-cloning theorem and unbiased-chosen basis (UCB) assumption. Nevertheless, more research efforts are required to gauge the clear benefits that blockchain can bring to QC, especially the role of blockchain for routing in multi-hop quantum communication [223], quantum entanglement and quantum parallelism based MAC protocols [224], and for error detection and correction in QC [13].

Blockchain for 6G use cases and applications Distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain are expected to play a vital role in future 6G communication networks to enable numerous trending applications such as industry 5.0 enabled factories, holographic teleportation, extended reality, and connected autonomous vehicles [31], [95], [225]. Furthermore, [226] evaluates blockchain and IoT use cases and presents that blockchain and smart contracts align well together with the microprocesses related to value creating resource configuration that is capable of being realized through modern microservice technologies. In addition, the shift from conventional value chains to decentralized platforms will also lead to value propositions towards the end-to-end business ecosystem. This section elaborates on several 6G-enabled use cases and applications that are envisaged to harness the capabilities of blockchain. Each application is described highlighting the key challenges and how blockchain can act as an enabler to realize them. Table 9 summarizes the role of blockchain for 6G-enabled use cases in terms of features offered, types of blockchain used, consensus algorithms used, expected throughput and latency, and the potential blockchain platforms. 6.1. Industrial applications in Industry 5.0 Industry 4.0 aimed to increase the productivity and efficiency of smart industries by intensively using Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) that harness the mMTC and URLLC capabilities of 5G networks [227]. Industry 5.0 will advance the Industry 4.0 concept with the efficient use of machines and human workers in a synergistic environment to personalize autonomous manufacturing [58]. Notably, in Industry 5.0, humans will be expected to perform high-level and creative tasks while the autonomous machines will be conducting mundane and time-consuming work. Industry 5.0 applications will leverage AI/ML technologies together with VR/AR/XR, digital twins and advanced robotics. This gamut of technologies will facilitate human–robot co-working (with collaborative robots aka cobots) and customized manufacturing processes while increasing production efficiency, minimizing wastage and environmental pollution [228]. 6.1.1. Key challenges Some of the key challenges related to Industry 5.0 in future 6G communication networks are given below. • Scalable communication infrastructure will be required for Industry 5.0 to connect a large number of devices facilitating human–machine interactions on top of automated applications [229]. Moreover, storage and processing of the generated Big Data will also be a challenge for Industry 5.0. • The overall network should be secured against possible attacks while personal and sensitive data are being gathered. In particular, human–robot interactions can raise privacy concerns as they may collect personal data [230]. Thus, privacy compliance will be indispensable, and the challenges will be automated monitoring and secure auditing. • Efficient utilization and security of AI/ML techniques are essential for Industry 5.0 applications to enable automated decision making. • Although the existing cloud manufacturing has numerous advantages, however, it is prone to all the issues related to centralized systems and dependency on third-party entities [231]. • Federated and optimized use of computational resources available in the surroundings will be essential to meet the future dynamic requirements of industrial applications. However, the challenge will be how to incentivize and automate such resource pooling. 6.1.2. Role of blockchain It is envisaged that blockchain will play a key role in facilitating Industry 5.0 applications in future 6G networks in the coming decade [232]. The role of blockchain towards enabling Industry 5.0 in future 6G networks is illustrated in Fig. 9. According to Wu et al. [233], blockchain enables many features towards establishing industry infrastructure by enabling enhanced scalability, security, and privacy. In particular, blockchain integrated with edge computing is capable of offering the above features in the IIoT scenario by distributing computing across the IIoT infrastructure and offloading computationally intensive tasks to the edge servers. In this direction, a blockchain-based secure edge intelligence platform is proposed by Zhang et al. [225] to facilitate edge services in an IIoT environment. In this work, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques are utilized to improve the efficiency of the blockchain-based distributed edge resource utilization. The nodes that contribute towards edge intelligence by performing tasks such as transaction validation in the blockchain are rewarded with a novel credit-differentiated transaction approval scheme. This scheme is reliable and incentivizes the nodes to participate in blockchain-related operations. However, the realization of this approach requires efficient AI processing mechanisms and smooth interoperability between diverse blockchain technologies. A communication protocol that uses blockchain and smart contracts to enable autonomous agents to make independent decisions on economic actions in industries is presented in [234]. This protocol arranges economic interactions that are performed between autonomous agents using a P2P network that is based on blockchain. Authors used Ethereum for implementation, where the smart contracts were linked with the Robot Operating System (ROS) communication framework of autonomous agents. The connection between physical sensors and the Ethereum blockchain is performed through Open Platform Communications United Architecture (OPC UA) while InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a distributed storage system, is used for storage. However, the smooth operation of this protocol requires autonomous agents to be equipped with sufficient RAM and computing resources. The limitations imposed by the centralized framework in the existing cloud manufacturing architecture can be solved by introducing blockchain driven decentralized architectures. For instance, blockchain-based cloud manufacturing architecture is proposed in [231] to facilitate on-demand secure services, secure data exchange, and effective collaboration between multiple parties. In the proposed architecture, the user part of the architecture consists of the end-user, while the blockchain cloud manufacturing part consists of the core layer, blockchain networks, and the cloud manufacturing layer. Here, the important challenge is to virtualize cloud manufacturing in the blockchain network. Blockchain can provide a high level of security by storing all the data and transactions in the shared ledger which is replicated at all the nodes in the network. To meet this requirement of secure and efficient exchange of big data in an industrial environment, Zheng et al. [235] proposed an IIoT data management system the harnesses the best of blockchain and distributed off-chain storage system like IPFS. Furthermore, the authors used Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structured IOTA Tangle to meet the high scalability, immutability, and low operational cost requirements. This method facilitates better data exchange among IIoT devices to facilitate advanced data-driven techniques in Industry 5.0. Blockchain capabilities can be utilized when spare or unused computational capabilities of nearby mobile and other devices need to be harnessed. In this scenario, smart contracts along with tokenized rewards can be used to compensate these devices [158]. Furthermore, in case of dispute or ownership violation, blockchain-assisted management of Intellectual Property (IP) rights will be a rescue [236]. 6.1.3. Summary Based on the existing works, it can be concluded that blockchain turns out to be a promising technology for Industry 5.0. It can enable Industry 5.0 applications by providing features such as improved security and privacy of data and stakeholders, secure use of AI and ML for autonomous operations, optimized cloud manufacturing, and agile and dispute-free business agreements between companies, their partners and customers. However, there are aspects that require more efforts such as building of standard application programming interface (APIs) for development of DApps, enhancing scalability and security of blockchain-enabled IoT system, and optimized allocation of networking, storage, and computing resources for running blockchain [233]. These gaps are yet to be filled towards utilizing blockchain as an enabler of Industry 5.0 in future 6G era. 6.2. Smart healthcare 6G communication networks will revolutionize the smart healthcare sector by going beyond space and time barriers [38]. 6G technology will be able to meet the stringent Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of healthcare applications such as ultra-high reliability, extremely low latency, and high mobility [237]. Intelligent Wearable Devices (IWDs) will be instrumental in health monitoring and early detection of various health conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease [238]. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will form a network of medical devices, equipment, and people, aiming to exchange healthcare data seamlessly [239]. Moreover, in the 6G era, the convergence of smart devices and the use of AI/ML techniques will lead to Intelligent Internet of Medical Things (IIoMT) facilitating early diagnosis and intelligent preventive healthcare [38]. Patient visits to hospitals can also be minimized by enabling medical staff to be virtually present using technologies such as XR applications to discuss patient issues [240]. Hospital-to-Home (H2H) services will be implemented on a mobile vehicle platform that will be facilitated with medical equipment and will have minimum dependence on hospital resources, including medical professionals [38]. Telesurgery with 6G enabled tactile internet can use fully automated robots or robots that work in collaboration with humans. Thus, 6G as underlying communication infrastructure will realize a complex, intelligent and connected healthcare paradigm. 6.2.1. Key challenges The smart healthcare applications in the 6G era require overcoming a significant number of challenges as follows. • Besides a wide range of benefits offered by the digitization of healthcare systems with the use of smartphones, IoMTs, and cloud services, there has been a significant increase in privacy breaches in the healthcare industry [241]. Thus, the key challenge of 6G-envisioned intelligent healthcare system is to ensure complete privacy protection. • Future healthcare systems require extremely high reliability and availability ( > 99 . 99999 % ) [1]. • Decentralized operation of IIoMT devices comprising cyber–physical systems in smart healthcare applications should be facilitated. • Managing a large number of IIoMT devices requires autonomous operation between devices. • Providing harmonious cooperation between different stakeholders such as hospitals, government agencies, and insurance companies to provide better healthcare services.

Role of blockchain Blockchain is emerging as a promising candidate to support the future 6G-envisioned smart healthcare ecosystem. Fig. 10 illustrates the envisaged use of blockchain in the healthcare domain. According to [242], the management of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) is one of the popular use-cases of blockchain in healthcare. MedRec, GHN, HealthChain, MedBlockm, and BlockHIE are some of the reported blockchain-based applications. Since privacy-protection of medical data is very crucial, thus in this context, Dwivedi et al. [243] proposed a decentralized healthcare blockchain for secure management of healthcare-related big data for IoT environment. Their system combines the benefits offered by blockchain together with lightweight cryptographic approaches. In particular, a lightweight ring signature is used to ensure the anonymity of transactions and the ARX algorithm (a type of symmetric key encryption) is used to encrypt data to be uploaded on the blockchain. Moreover, Diffie–Hellman technique is used to securely exchange keys using public channel. The use of lightweight mechanisms alleviates the system from satisfying the powerful computational and bandwidth requirements of blockchain such as consensus algorithms (e.g. PoW). Therefore, their proposed system is more suitable for a resource-constrained IoT environment. However, the proposed system is still prone to attacks like DoS attack. With a similar intent, Zghaibeh et al. [244] presented a blockchain-enabled healthcare platform named as Smart-Health (SHealth) to ensure features such as security, availability, reliability, trustworthiness, and efficient data management. SHealth is based on three layers; government, users, and IIoMT devices. The proposed system uses a permissioned blockchain implemented on a modular hypeledger fabric utilizing the PBFT consensus mechanism. Smart contracts are capitalized to automate the process of facilitating user requests such as medical appointments, tests, and access to medical history. However, realizing such a comprehensive system would require multiple blockchain platforms to seamlessly interoperate and integrate with the existing standalone medical platforms. Real-time telesurgery is another application that is expected to be realized in the future by 6G-enabled smart healthcare sector. In this regard, a blockchain-based framework named HaBiTs is proposed by Gupta et al. [245]. The work emphasizes achieving interoperability and security using smart contracts on top of blockchain for telesurgery in healthcare 4.0. This framework suggests the use of permissioned blockchain platforms such as hyperledger fabric (or consortium blockchain). Being a distributed platform owing to the usage of blockchain, this platform does not require multi-level authentication while the system performance and cost efficiency are enhanced. However, the implementation of such a proposition and its testing under various types of attacks would be necessary for a clear understanding of the pros and cons of blockchain-based telesurgery. Blockchain has also been identified as a key technology to deal with global pandemic like COVID-19 [246]. Such unprecedented situations demand sharing of healthcare data among various stakeholders across the borders. In the context of COVID-19, contact tracing has been implemented as a mechanism to monitor close physical interactions among the people. In case an individual is diagnosed with the disease, people who had close contact with the infected person can be identified based on the information collected from the contact tracing application. However, such contact tracing applications must overlook patient’s/user’s privacy. Accordingly, Zhang et al. [247] proposed the integrated use of 5G and blockchain for a privacy-preserving contact tracing scheme named PTBM. In particular, the authors used 5G as underlying high-speed communication infrastructure and used blockchain together with bloom filter and Public-Key Cryptosystem with Distributed Decryption (PCDD) for privacy (identity and location) protection. The authors used two different blockchains; permissionless blockchain accessible to the people using contact tracing application and permissioned blockchain providing restrictive access to medical organizations, medical centers and fog nodes. Hyperledger fabric was used to show the high computation efficiency and low cost of communication. Nevertheless, large-scale testing and benchmarking of such blockchain-enabled contact tracing are essential. Furthermore, with the emergence of 6G, AI/ML techniques, and big data analysis, blockchain-enabled could be used to predict, model and analyze future epidemics. Yet another important challenge being faced by the healthcare domain is the fair and transparent acquisition of data for research, commercial products, and drug development. This challenge can be well-addressed by blockchain, as discussed by Mamoshina et al. in [248]. The authors proposed a blockchain-powered framework to build a marketplace that uses LifePound as a new crypto utility token. Such a marketplace helps user to sell their biomedical data directly to the consumer and earn LifePound. Furthermore, to allow the exchange of large-sized files, cloud storage services (which can be made to comply with privacy laws like HIPAA) are used, thereby making the solution scalable with off-chain storage. Furthermore, the authors suggest the use of threshold encryption to boost security. In threshold encryption willingness of multiple parties is necessary for the decryption of data. Nevertheless, building an effective real-time pricing model for data selling/buying is still an important question to be answered. 6.2.3. Summary Blockchain has proven itself to be a suitable candidate to resolve security, privacy, trust, and auditability issues of smart healthcare applications in the future 6G era. Specifically, blockchain in healthcare can help realize telesurgery, avoid counterfeit medical equipment and drugs, enable secure and remote patient monitoring, automated processing of health insurance claims, and establishment of an open market for profitable medical data acquisition. However, blockchain technology should mature in several directions, including improving interoperability, scalability, and transaction speed. Furthermore, privacy laws and regulations should also see appropriate amendments to facilitate the decentralized storage and operation of sensitive health data. 6.3. UAV applications UAVs, colloquially called drones, are another interesting application that is expected to flourish with the dawn of 6G [53], [249]. The market capitalization of drones for industrial and commercial applications was 19.3 billion USD in 2019 and is projected to grow up to 45.8 billion USD by 2025 [250]. UAVs are considered to emerge as an another key application of future 6G mobile networks. While UAVs had their inception in military applications, their role is rapidly growing in civilian applications. Some of the civilian applications of UAVs are management of ground traffic in smart cities, video coverage of live events, video surveillance at industrial scale, remote sensing, wildlife survey, delivery of goods and packages, smart agriculture, smart construction, and short distance air taxis [1], [107]. Furthermore, UAVs can enable intelligent transportation systems [251]. The key features of UAVs are ease of deployment, line-of-sight connectivity, and controlled mobility [252]. In addition, UAV-to-Everything (U2X) networks are also envisaged together with the developments of 6G and IoE [253]. Moreover, UAV or Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) require a solid UAV Traffic Management (UTM) system to operate fully autonomous UAVs safely beyond visual line of sight [254]. UTMs require efficient, secure, and risk-free communication to manage their movement in the urban airspace. It is envisaged that 6G will enable a UTM ecosystem focusing on terrestrial and non-terrestrial features supporting mobile, aerial and satellite communication. 6.3.1. Key challenges The deployment of UAV-based applications in 6G communication systems will encounter many challenges; some of them are discussed as follows: • UAV applications in B5G and 6G communication networks need to be highly available, reliable, and fault tolerant [250]. • UAV networks are prone to different types of security vulnerabilities such as cyber-attacks, jamming, hijacking, eavesdropping, and privacy attacks [255]. Therefore, ensuring security and privacy in UAV applications are considered to be pivotal [256]. • The latency should be minimized to facilitate UAV applications. • The operation of large UAV swarms should be automated efficiently. 6.3.2. Role of blockchain The use of blockchain offers many unique features that can help better realize 6G-enabled UAV applications. For instance, Mehta et al. [250] discussed the integration of blockchain with UAV networks to solve the inherent issues such as fault tolerance, reliability, energy efficiency, latency, QoS, and bandwidth. The distributed nature of blockchain offers increased fault tolerance for UAV networks if one or more nodes are disconnected. These nodes will be synchronized once they are reconnected. Furthermore, the security vulnerabilities of UAV communication can be addressed through blockchain owing to decentralized security management techniques. The energy efficiency and latency issues can be solved through lightweight blockchain architectures. Trusted access point groups are utilized to improve the access efficiency, and thereby QoS and blockchain-enhanced cloud platforms with efficient cryptographic algorithms are suggested to facilitate low latency [250]. Sharma et al. [257] proposed a blockchain-based method to utilize drones as on-demand caching nodes towards facilitating ultra-reliable communication in MEC. This neural blockchain based drone caching approach banks on blockchain to ensure high reliability, availability, and survivability amongst peers. Blockchain is used as a distributed ledger shared with all nodes in the network which are identified through their public keys. Moreover, Kuzmin et al. [258] presented a blockchain-based approach for performing secure operations in semi-autonomous UAVs. In this approach, each UAV in the UAV communication network (UAVNet) acts as a blockchain node. To minimize the threat on the communication channel between UAV and ground station, the fly route is included as a smart contract in the blockchain. Thus, UAVs can consider sensor data and the flight schedules of other UAVs to avoid any collision when operating autonomously. The consensus algorithm used in this blockchain UAV network is Proof-of-Game (PoG). However, the successful implementation of this requires facilitating the dynamic participation of UAV groups and autonomous information exchange mechanisms, while memory limitations of UAVs should be addressed. Furthermore, blockchain based privacy preservation methods in 5G and beyond UAV communication networks are presented in [259]. For instance, blockchain can be used for an efficient UAV ID management system, which will be robust, tamper-proof, and minimize single point attacks. Furthermore, smart contracts can be used to automate the process of ID management. In addition consensus mechanisms such as PoW and PBFT can make UAV networks resistant against malicious attacks, including Sybil attacks. Protecting drone trajectory information through blockchain-based access control and authentication methods is another way of preserving user privacy. However, several aspects of blockchain need more research and development, such as low efficiency and resource overhead of consensus algorithms, research constraints of UAVs, and scalability of blockchainized UAV networks. In addition, [260] explores UTM related security issues and proposes UTM-Chain, which is a lightweight blockchain-based security solution. This security solution is based on utilizing hyperledger fabric for UTM of UAVs in low-altitude by addressing computational and storage resources limitations of UAVs. The proposed method integrates the blockchain technology with UTM components. The architecture of the proposed system is based on a permissioned blockchain network. Blockchain is also utilized to store transactions and control the access to flight data that are securely stored in a decentralized off-chain database. The access is controlled through blockchain and smart contracts. Therefore, the proposed UTM-Chain also provides secure and reliable data transmission between UAVs and ground stations in envisaged 6G networks. 6.3.3. Summary Blockchain is emerging as a viable technology to realize UAV applications in the future 6G networks. It offers unique features such as decentralized decision-making, strong security while exchanging data between UAVs and between UAVs and ground stations, privacy protection of the sensed data, automated collaboration, identity management, mission secrecy, and tight access control through smart contracts. However, several issues, including increased scalability, lower latency, and resource constraints in UAVs, need further research. 6.4. Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) Another prominent use case of the future networks will be Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), which will demand advanced technologies for real-time sensing, secure connectivity, and automate vehicle decisions [261]. CAVs evince, on the one hand, the convergence of connected vehicles powered by V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communication facilitated through dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) and mobile networks, and fully autonomous vehicles on the other hand [262], [263]. 6G will provide a solid underpinning for the deployment of CAVs as an emerging industry vertical [264]. CAVs with various types of sensors (e.g., camera, ultrasound, radar, lidar, and other V2X sensors) will provide information related to safety, navigation, mapping, and infotainment to users [263]. In addition, CAVs will resolve the existing problems in transportation systems, such as traffic congestion, road safety, fuel wastage, and air pollution [265]. 6.4.1. Key challenges There are several challenges to be addressed to facilitate the deployment of CAVs in the 6G era. • CAV applications driven by future networks will need reliable support for real-time operations. Providing such time-critical services with non-stop availability will be challenging with centralized management because it is prone to single-point-of-failure and is costly [266]. • CAV applications require AI/ML/FL techniques to support the intelligent processing of big data. However, sharing of data for training purposes or sharing of locally trained models for global optimization may encounter security breaches [267]. • CAVs will give rise to a new range of services like optimized ride-sharing, trusted payments, automatic insurance renewal and claim settlement, smart parking, and location-specific personalized services. Security aspects like authentication, integrity, privacy, and trustworthiness must remain intact for these services-related CAVs [268]. 6.4.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain is envisaged to play a substantial role in enabling CAV applications of future 6G networks. Authors in [269] have surveyed the integration of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) together with Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) towards realizing CAV. Accordingly, blockchain is capable of providing decentralized operation and management, peer-to-peer trading [270], improving system performance, and high trust, security, and privacy in CAV applications. Blockchain and smart contracts have the potential to offer data protection management for secure and safe driving. In this context, [271] presents a framework incorporating consortium blockchain with AI named Blockchain-enabled intElligent Safe-driving as-sessmenT (BEST) towards enabling safe-driving while ensuring the security of vehicle information and other data in CAVs. This method utilizes blockchain as a distributed data management platform to ensure the trust as data are immutable and transparent to the users. The consensus method used in this system is byzantine fault tolerance-based delegated proof-of-stake (BFT-DPoS). In this, BFT is added as an extra layer to DPoS to further ensure the robustness and validity while minimizing the consensus delay. However, challenges such as resource limitations in CAVs, vehicles not willing to actively share their information, and adapting to highly dynamic road conditions remain yet to be addressed. Blockchain can enable a new range of services emerging from CAVs like ride-sharing, trusted payments, automatic insurance renewal and claim settlement, smart parking, and location-specific services. Rathee et al. [272] presented a framework using blockchain towards securing CAVs and providing Connected Vehicles as a Service (CVaaS). This framework enables confidentiality and transparency among various parties (e.g., customers and vehicle owners) using blockchain to extract information from IoT devices and store records securely and transparently. All the records related to documenting, controlling and monitoring are securely stored in a blockchain ensuring that any alteration, deletion or compromise of IoT device is identified in an efficient and timely manner. However, this system needs to harness efficient AI/ML capabilities towards enhancing system intelligence. Another work presented in [273] presents a Blockchain based Framework for Auto-insurance Claim and Adjudication (B-FICA) for CAVs. B-FICA provides an access control mechanism using partitions to prevent unauthorized access evidence while protecting evidence from alteration through dynamic validation. This method uses permissioned blockchain together with multi-signed transactions as a proof of interaction-execution method. Also, block validation plus dynamic, lightweight consensus mechanism enables updating the data states while ensuring data security against any alteration. Furthermore, proof of interaction-execution also ensures non-repudiation while facilitating investigations of insurance claims. Blockchain has the capacity to enable energy trading among the CAVs and between the CAVs and electricity charging service providers. For instance, Zhao et al. [270] put forward a blockchain and smart contract based decentralized architecture for trading electricity among autonomous Electric Vehicles (EVs) since they are equipped with bidirectional charging points. Their proposed solution comprises conceptually three entities; supplier EV that will discharge, consumer EV that will charge, and Road Side Units (RSUs). The authors used permissioned blockchain which is maintained at the RSUs. The system allows automated negotiation between supplier and consumer vehicles based on the trust values of EVs, economic status of consumer EV, and demand/supply parameters exchanged between consumer and suppliers. Such a kind of decentralized P2P energy trading among EVs can have numerous advantages like decreasing charging queues during peak hours, reducing energy loss by trading surplus energy and earning immediate economic rewards of selling energy. Nevertheless, testing and formal verification of such solutions are required before they can be entrusted. As an instance of blockchain-enabled automated energy trading between electric CAVs and electricity charging service providers, Gabay et al. [274] proposed a framework for charging EVs, including authentication and scheduling. In particular, the authors made integrated use of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zkSNARKs), blockchain, and smart contracts to enable privacy-protected authentication and charging process. Their implementation setup made use of Zokrates for zkSNARKs and Ethereum test network Ropsten for deploying smart contracts. 6.4.3. Summary Blockchain has unique capabilities to support 6G-enabled CAV applications in future communication networks. Specifically, it will enable automation through smart contracts, decentralized management, transparent P2P electricity trading, new services based on CAVs, and privacy protection. However, there are still some challenges like improving scalability, minimizing latency, overcoming resource constraints in CAVs, and effectively integrating edge intelligence capabilities with CAVs, which are to be addressed. 6.5. Energy Internet Energy Internet (EI) or Smart Grid 2.0 is the evolution of Smart Grid, which enables the integration of heterogeneous energy sources and energy storage systems that can be monitored and controlled using communication networks [57]. EI is also visualized to be a key application realized through the capabilities of future 6G communication networks [1]. Multiple decentralized and self-operating electric charging points need to be placed to facilitate the charging of autonomous vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and self-operating robots [275]. Distributed energy sources that can be in the form of solar power generators, and wind power generators in households or commercial entities, will contribute to the smart grid to cater to the substantial energy demands of nearby devices [276]. Using such distributed energy sources would reduce the losses incurred during power transmission and increase the power quality of the consumer. Having more renewable energy resources and minimizing the losses will also minimize the carbon footprint. Energy markets will facilitate the trade and supply of energy generated using various sources using wholesale peer-to-peer energy trading platforms [277]. Cryptocurrencies and energy tokens will be used in these energy marketplaces to perform secure and transparent transactions. 6.5.1. Key challenges Some of the key challenges that should be addressed to deploy EI in the future are as follows. • The existing centralized business model will suffer scalability and management issues when used for renewable energy sources, which are distributed in nature [278]. Thus, EI requires an open and decentralized marketplace for future energy businesses. • EI will encounter growing number of stakeholders in terms of suppliers and consumers, and they will be varying in real-time. Thus, for such dynamic (at times ephemeral) energy trading developing a complete automated system will be challenging but essential. • Security and privacy of EI, if not instilled precisely, will result in stealing of energy, unavailability of services, leakage of sensitive information, and damages to costly equipment and appliances. • Measures of energy sharing amongst various IoT devices, including EVs should be facilitated. 6.5.2. Role of blockchain Blockchain is envisioned to play a cardinal role in enabling EI through future communication networks. For instance, a study on how blockchain will enable future smart grid applications is presented in [279]. Blockchain facilitates decentralized smart grid management while ensuring security privacy and trust in the EI. One of the blockchain applications in EI is Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) that enables energy suppliers and consumers to interact with each other. Smart meters can send time-stamped records to create a new block in the distributed ledger once a transaction happens. Also, edge intelligence capabilities combined with blockchain can strengthen energy security in EI. Similar other applications include decentralized energy trading, open marketplaces, and monitoring, measuring and controlling the grid. Nevertheless, issues including less number of transactions per second, and prevailing security and privacy vulnerabilities in blockchain should see developments towards realizing blockchain-enabled EI. Furthermore, [280] proposes the use of a blockchain based marketplace as a business model archetype for the energy trading industry. This can function without the requirement of an orchestrator and will lead towards providing full autonomy to the energy market stakeholders. Authors introduce a system-oriented architectural insight in to the structure and management resulting in a orchestrator-led energy market that is capable of decentralizing the peer-to-peer energy market realized banking on blockchain. Furthermore, a decentralized access control mechanism using blockchain for smart grids is presented in [281]. This method operates without the involvement of a trusted third party and is capable of bringing data from service providers from smart meters. Each block in the private blockchain is verified using a leader selection process in the network. The leader runs the consensus algorithm in order to validate blocks by peer nodes using PBFT. Also, the encryption algorithm used to encrypt transactions is ECC. Khalid et al. [282] proposed blockchain to perform load balancing in decentralized hybrid P2P energy trading market for Smart Grids. Their work intends to minimize cost and electricity peak to average ratio. Khalid et al. [282] proposed blockchain to perform load balancing in decentralized hybrid P2P energy trading market for Smart Grids. Their work intends to minimize cost and electricity peak to average ratio. The proposed solution for the energy trading market is fully decentralized allowing members to trade energy with each other without the involvement of a third party. Smart contracts are utilized to impose the rules and regulations related to energy trading. Three smart contracts are presented towards implementing the hybrid energy trading market. They are the main smart contract (to perform user registration and data storage), peer-to-peer smart contract, and prosumer-2-grid smart contract. Another application of blockchain, as presented in [283], is to realize secure and distributed power transfer in UAV networks. More specifically, the authors proposed a blockchain-enabled UAV-assisted wireless power transfer framework named aerial-ground chain to charge low-power smart devices. In particular, their framework utilizes consortium blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). Energy micro-transactions are verified by UAVs through heterogeneous consensus, where a cumulative weight based consensus mechanism is utilized in aerial nodes while the ground nodes use a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus scheme. The time-out for energy micro-transactions is confirmed through access points utilizing consortium blockchain. Also, this method develops a resource cooperation mechanism to motivate UAVs to take part in wireless power transfer actively. Access points that contribute to verify micro-transactions cooperatively are also incentivized. Payments are made through energy tokens, a new cryptocurrency that is managed and stored by wallets of participating nodes. 6.5.3. Summary Blockchain is recognized as a key enabler of EI or Smart Grid 2.0 applications in future communication networks. Blockchain combined with smart contracts enables many EI features, including decentralized grid management and autonomous operations, secure logging of smart meter readings, transaction verification, decentralized marketplace for energy trading, and enhanced security, privacy, and trust. Further research and development work in improving blockchain scalability, transaction speed, and addressing blockchain-related security and privacy issues will be instrumental in realizing EI applications through future communication networks. Moreover, establishing blockchain-based large-scale infrastructure for energy with well-defined APIs can accelerate the development in the EI sector. Table 9. Role of blockchain for 6G use cases with expected operational parameters and potential platforms (see [284], [285], [286], [287], [288], [289], [290], [291], [292], [293], [294], [295], [296], [297], [298], [299], [300], [301]). Table 10. Mapping deployment challenges to 6G technical aspects and 6G applications and use cases ([302], [303], [304], [305]). 6.6. Other use cases 6.6.1. Extended reality Extended reality (XR) is another use case visualized with 6G. In particular, XR is expected to harness the extremely highly reliable connectivity, massive data rate, and ultra-low latency offered by 6G networks [306], [307], [308]. XR incorporates AR, MR and VR to a wide range of applications, ranging from smart healthcare, education, haptics, CAVs, to Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCI) [35]. Moreover, XR-enabled applications are expected to revolutionize manufacturing by providing new methods for designing, prototyping, marketing, and maintenance [309], [310]. Blockchain integrated 6G networks will be instrumental in facilitating XR applications. For instance, blockchain can offer its subscribers to enjoy live events (e.g., music, sports, interactive games) with a fully immersive and virtual experience. Such offering can be a part of a subscription as a value-added service or can be purchased explicitly. In either case, blockchain can be utilized for creating a marketplace for virtual experience [299]. Moreover, blockchain can resolve the issue of incorrect file formats, which arises with the increasing use of VR/AR applications in heterogeneous domains [299]. Authors in [311] propose blockchain-powered 6G-enabled Information-Centric massive Internet of Things (ICmIoT) for Ubiquitous VR/AR services. In particular, they utilize permissioned blockchain and introduce a new consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Cache-Offloading (PoCO). In general, the intrinsic security features of blockchain with decentralized nature can provide security and privacy to XR applications. However, blockchain technology is expected to evolve, specifically by minimizing the processing delay and scalability towards facilitating XR applications in 6G communication networks. 6.6.2. Holographic telepresence (teleportation) The growth of extended reality applications together with ultra-reliable, high throughput, and extremely low latency communication networks in 6G will enable holographic teleportation [312]. Holographic teleportation is expected to teleport users to a computerized virtual environment that resembles the real world to create a sense of presence while collaborating with others in virtual spaces [313]. It is expected that a plethora of new services based on fully immersive holographic experiences will be introduced with the dawn of holographic communication, such as virtual schools and universities, virtual tourism, and virtual sports and activities [232]. The use of blockchain can help the realization of holographic applications. For instance, large amounts of raw data obtained through cameras and sensors supporting holographic communication can be processed efficiently using edge intelligence nodes facilitated through blockchain and smart contracts. Higher data rates in the wireless access network or wireless backhaul could also be achieved by minimizing interference related issues using blockchain based spectrum sharing [314]. Network security and user privacy can be ensured owing to the inherent security features of blockchain. Faster processing, scalability, and blockchain security and privacy need further research to realize holographic telepresence applications utilizing blockchain-based 6G networks. 6.6.3. Smart cities Smart cities are envisaged to cater to the requirements of over 70% of the world population by the year 2050 [315]. Moreover, these requirements are expected to be diverse and complex in the future. Thus, the future smart cities are to be equipped with modern information and communication infrastructure [316]. Environmental pollution, energy management, traffic management, and disaster management are a few of the applications of ICT tools in future smart cities. These will be facilitated through heterogeneous IoT devices and sensors towards IoE. The Big Data extracted through these IoT devices need to be analyzed using advanced learning techniques to obtain insights on city planning and city development activities [317]. Blockchain is considered to be an enabling technology of smart cities. One of the major blockchain applications towards smart cities is to ensure information security and privacy [318]. Blockchain also offers enhanced fault tolerance, better reliability, and scalability. Furthermore, blockchain is instrumental in weaving a communication platform that can connect a large number of heterogeneous and distributed IoT devices and sensors in a smart city environment. For instance, the authors in [319] present a hybrid network architecture combining Software Defined Networking (SDN) and blockchain. This architecture consists of a core network and an edge network to enable distributed networking applications. In addition, a blockchain-based vehicle network architecture for smart cities, named Block-VN, is presented in [320]. This architecture facilitates reliable, secure, and distributed functioning of vehicle networks. However, scalability in terms of transactions per second and storage turns out to be a bottleneck to use blockchain for 6G-enabled smart cities. 6.6.4. Digital twins The underpinning of 6G will support an effective realization of DTs which is an emerging paradigm for smart industries, smart cities and smart healthcare facilities [321]. The concept of DTs is about creating an exact digital replica of any physical entity or process in a computerized virtual world. Thus, any given physical entity (either living or non-living) has existence in both the physical world and the virtual world. These replicas in physical and virtual worlds are called as DTs and they enable tight integration via seamless exchange of relevant data between themselves [322], [323]. Systems based on DTs have huge potential in the field of manufacturing, healthcare, aviation, and smart cities [323], [324]. In particular, DTs has potential to enable 3D visualization and simulations, virtual testing, predictive maintenance, and various type of analytics (descriptive, predictive and prescriptive) which pave the way for 6G-enabled industrial applications [322], [324]. Despite the myriad of advantages, an important challenge to successfully realize DTs is to ensure security, privacy, transparency, and trust while communicating and exchanging data between physical and virtual twins as well as with surrounding environment and external parties involved. In this direction, Yaqoob et al. [322] identified various alleviating roles of blockchain for DTs such as decentralized and tamper-persistent data exchanges, providing DTs’ proof of legitimacy and identities, tight access control based on smart contracts and strict adherence to distributed policies and ensuring transparent tracking and accountability. For industrial manufacturing use case, Zhang et al. [325] proposed the use of permissioned blockchain while considering a digital twin manufacturing cell scenario. In particular, authors implemented a prototype of a Manufacturing Blockchain of Things (MBCoT) architecture using hyperledger fabric and demonstrate that their solution can achieve high throughput and low latency while being secure and traceable. Putz et al. [326] developed a Decentralized Application (DApp) using Ethereum blockchain and off-chain data storage. However, simulation data is used for the experiments. 7. Deployment challenges Despite the advantages that blockchain can bring to the 6G realm, there are challenges that will be encountered, and thus, must be investigated to harness the maximum potential of blockchain in 6G. This section expounds on various deployment challenges, their importance to the 6G ecosystem, and possible solutions to mitigate them. Towards the end of this section, Table 10 maps the deployment challenges to the 6G technical aspects and 6G applications. 7.1. Scalability (data) - Throughput and storage For blockchainized systems, scalability in terms of throughput and storage is still challenging. Throughput indicates the number of transactions being successfully processed per unit time. The increasing size of the ledger highlights the need for higher storage capacity at all the full nodes in the blockchain network. Throughput depends on numerous factors such as hardware capacity, network latency, block size, size of the ledger, size of the P2P blockchain network, and complexity of both the cryptographic techniques and the smart contracts used. In general, due to the restriction on the maximum size of a block, the time required to perform transaction validation, and establishing consensus, the throughput of blockchainized systems is less than conventional centralized systems. 7.1.1. Importance in context of 6G Since 6G will cater to a new range of applications and use cases that demand ultra-high data rate (Tbps) and extremely high connection density, high throughput and efficient storage requirements are a must for successful use of blockchain in the 6G realm. Furthermore, with the open business 6G ecosystem, an increasing number of stakeholders (of all sizes) will participate, which will lead to a high access rate and, at the same time, would require higher storage capacity to maintain logs of their activities. 7.1.2. Possible solutions A variety of solutions have been explored to improve the scalability of blockchainized systems. To improve the throughput solutions like sharding [327] (for processing and storing), multiple blocks per leader [328], Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and Payment Channel Network (PCN) [329]. Compared to traditional systems, the difference in throughput of blockchainized systems is significantly large for the public permissionless type of blockchain. Thus, the use of private permissioned (or consortium) type blockchain can narrow down the difference in the performance (throughput), making blockchain suitable for 6G networks. Solutions such as off-chain storage, block (data) compression, sidechain, and hierarchical blockchain are being explored to deal with storage scalability [330]. Interestingly, emerging multi-peer permissioned blockchains leveraging microservice-based architecture (such as Rahasak [331] and Mystiko [332]) have the potential to meet high scalability demands of 6G ecosystem. Instead of conventional full node data replication which is resource inefficient and increases latency, Rahasak carries out limited data replication using sharding algorithm. Moreover, actor-based smart contracts ‘Aplos’ [333] can enable concurrent execution of transactions by executing a given transaction only once at one of the blockchain peers. 7.2. Measure of decentrality Decentralization fundamentally refers to a property of a system that ensures that every user has equal control over the system; hence no single user or a group of users could control a system’s assets or impose changes that other users do not consent to [334]. Hence, decentralization removes the dependency on a central authority by increasing the number of decision-makers [335]. This is a key requirement for blockchainized 6G networks. However, the measure of decentrality in those systems is a challenge. 7.2.1. Importance in context of 6G For security in 6G, this property needs to be maintained for any blockchain-based solution. A blockchainized system itself needs to be inspected carefully for properties, including decentrality and verified/validated operation. As blockchain is supposed to provide decentralized means of trust among untrusted users by withstanding a large number of fake identities in a peer-to-peer network-based system and prohibiting them from gaining higher influence, decentralization is an important requirement in that regard. 7.2.2. Possible solutions The authors in [336] identify the emergence of centrality in the governance, network, and storage layers of blockchain-based systems. Subsequently, they presented various metrics to measure decentrality in respective layers. In particular, metrics such as Gini coefficient, entropy, Euclidean distance, and Minkowski distance are used to measure decentrality in the governance layer. Similarly, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality metrics are used to measure decentrality in the network layer. For the storage layer, the distribution index is used, which measures the extent to which the information is stored in a distributed way. Baran et al. discussed the importance of measuring these properties in centralized, decentralized and distributed systems in [337]. Buterin discussed the meaning of decentrality in a blockchain system [338]. In [334], an entropy method from information theory is proposed to quantify the decentralization of blockchains. Using this technique, the discrete degrees of blocks mined and address balances are calculated to quantify the degrees of decentralization for Bitcoin and Ethereum systems. In [339], the authors define a new metric centralization level where a blockchain is N ϵ centralized if the top N nodes perform more than 1 − ϵ fraction of transactions. Given the same ϵ , a blockchain is more centralized if it has a smaller N . In blockchainized 6G, such a decentrality measurement and monitoring system should be a part of the general security architecture to ensure proper operation of network functions. However, how that integration will be achieved in that multi-party and large-scale system is still an open question. 7.3. Security and privacy Although blockchain is identified as an enabling technology to tackle security and privacy issues in the networking and telecommunication industry, using blockchain itself may create security and privacy issues making this a double-edged sword. In particular, the transparency of the records and transactions in the blockchain may create potential privacy breaches with in the network. Each transaction in the blockchain is signed using asymmetric keys and a list of several transactions joins together to form a block. Each block contains a hash pointer of the previous block and a hash of the listed transactions. This makes the transactions or the blocks immutable and secure. However, this will no longer be secure with a powerful adversary capable of breaking the cryptographic materials. In addition to that, several other security attacks related to blockchain have been identified, e.g., majority 51% attack, double-spending attacks, re-entrancy attack, sybil attacks, authentication access control attacks, security misconfigurations, and privacy attacks. 7.3.1. Importance in context of 6G There are many potential scenarios in 6G that can be secured by blockchain, such as advancing spectrum sharing security, eliminating tampering of the lease records, and assuring trust among market players. However, how the blockchain can be protected from many security threats, including Sybil attacks and privacy leakages, are yet to be addressed. In the long run, 6G is expected to use the devices in the post-quantum era with higher processing capability. Therefore, it is highly likely that the security and privacy solutions developing with the current blockchain technology will be no longer safe for quantum-based security threats. The combined use of AI/ML and blockchain will also create additional security threats while protecting the integrity of AI data which are shared among different stakeholders. 7.3.2. Possible solutions It is clear enough that when the blockchain-based security solutions are adopted in 6G networks, it is necessary to design possible mechanisms to mitigate the blockchain-specific security threat. The introduction of post-quantum cryptography to the blockchain and the use of quantum key management schemes may make the blockchain-based security solutions quantum-safe in 6G. When the adversaries become unconquerable with the quantum level powers, the existing public-key encryption and signature schemes will no longer provide secure connectivity. The security of quantum cryptography can be proven mathematically without imposing any restrictions on the abilities of an eavesdropper. The longer symmetric key derived and distributed by quantum cryptographic approaches will ensure the lifetime security of many schemes and digital systems. Therefore, a gradual shift to quantum-resistant cryptography will be necessary for blockchain technology. Another possible solution, to prevent security attacks and threats related to miners, is to model, verify and ensure correctness of secure and trustworthy blockchain-based systems. The security of the consensus protocol will be ensured by formally specifying security properties such as persistence, liveness, safety, fault tolerance and fraud resilience. Similarly, the trust of the consensus protocol shall be assured by formally defining trust properties, i.e., miner and verifier trust to prevent their malicious behaviors [340]. For such verification and assurance goals in blockchain-based systems, formal methods can be used [341]. In particular, model checking can be used for the formal verification of the consensus protocol as it successfully uncovers errors in the model in the form of counter examples [342]. In detail, formal specification language, such as, Communicating Sequential Processes can be used to formally specify the consensus protocol. Subsequently, the correctness of the protocol will be verified using formal verification tools, such as, Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT) model checker [343]. However, the appropriate modeling and verification techniques are still open research questions for blockchains in large-scale systems like 6G networks. 7.4. Consensus algorithms The consensus algorithm plays a vital role in running the blockchain system. Different types of consensus algorithms are developed and used in different applications. However, most general purpose consensus algorithms such as PoW are not optimal for mobile networks and the associated service. Specially, the direct utilization of generic consensus algorithms of well-known blockchains in pre-6G telecommunication networks had several negative impacts such as high operational cost and extended latency [344], [345]. For example, PoW like consensus algorithms are highly computationally intensive, and it is very costly to operate mining nodes. Moreover, a considerable amount of energy gets wasted just to perform some cryptography operations that have no benefits other than selecting the winning node. 7.4.1. Importance in context of 6G The greening of networks is a fundamental driver for the design and implementation of future networks, including 6G as evidenced by the recent regulatory and policy developments [346]. However, blockchain will be a big challenge against this goal due to its computationally intensive and high-energy consuming consensus algorithms. Moreover, with the positive development of quantum computing, 6G networks may have to address the issues related to the post-quantum era. Specially, most of the existing contemporary cryptographic mechanisms used in current consensus algorithms (e.g., PoW currently utilized hash scheme such as like SHA256 or KECCAK256 [347], [348]) can be easily breakable with quantum computing. Thus, using such legacy computation-oriented and energy-intensive consensus algorithms may not be possible in 6G networks, especially for ELPC use cases. 7.4.2. Possible solutions To mitigate the above challenges, new custom-made consensus algorithms for 6G should be developed. For instance, a quantum-safe consensus algorithm can be designed by focusing on randomness than computational difficulty [349]. As a wireless communication medium, 6G networks will also consist of a variety of random data sources. For instance, wireless channel state information, user traffic and mobility patterns, and interference level are possible sources with random nature. Such sources can be used to design consensus algorithms. Moreover, 6G specific consensus algorithms can be designed in a way that miners have to focus on useful tasks such as spectrum sensing, abnormality detection, and traffic pattern analysis than meaningless cryptography operations such as hash value calculations [137]. That will also eliminate the extra energy use and wastage to run consensus algorithms. 7.5. Standards, policies and legal issues As an emerging technology for various use cases including future networks, blockchain is still in its infancy terms of standardization and regulations. The popularity of cryptocurrencies and various pitfalls and negative incidents have also painted blockchain as a high-risky technology in public perception. Therefore, to reap the benefits of the standardization and help the stakeholders, community-driven standardization and well-informed blockchain regulations are crucial. These regulations should also foster the blockchain’s role in addressing various challenges to fulfill potential impact on future 6G systems. 7.5.1. Importance in the context of 6G The integration of blockchain into 6G networks will require well-defined and industry-approved standards. The 6G infrastructure is supposed to be multi-X (multi-vendor, multi-technology and multi-domain) network of networks. Moreover, telecommunication networks are tightly regulated for a service-level agreement based user experience and service quality. From a practical point of view, interoperability and clear guidelines on how to use blockchain in network infrastructure and use cases are crucial. To realize their key benefits in digital infrastructure including 6G networks, blockchains should be interoperable between themselves and with incumbent systems in other domains [350]. Moreover, high-gain use cases should be identified and addressed first to boost the blockchain’s role in 6G networks. 7.5.2. Possible solutions ETSI Industry Specification Group (ISG) Permissioned Distributed Ledger (PDL) is actively working on the foundations for the operation of permissioned distributed ledgers to improve the trust and dependability of digital services supported by global and open telecommunications networks [305]. They have developed a reference architecture framework specification and published it as ETSI GS PDL 012 in May 2022 [351]. As an industry organization of mobile operators, GSMA has already developed “GSMA eBusiness Network”, a new private-permissioned industry-wide blockchain network, focusing on the wholesale roaming clearing and settlement process as the first application [352]. Similarly, ITU SG3 working on tariff and accounting principles and international telecommunication/ICT economic and policy issues has an active work item on usage of DLT to handle accounting, policy, regulatory and economic issues in the international telco/ICT domain [353]. Such solutions will be more important with the pervasive 6G user experience, which should be seamless across different serving networks and minimize roaming overhead among service providers. ITU SG13 on future networks and emerging network technologies is developing recommendations on requirements and architecture for network resource sharing including site-sharing and RAN-sharing [354]. NIST Blockchain group has been investigating blockchain technologies at multiple levels ranging from use cases to protocols, security guarantees, and cryptographic mechanisms [355]. The fundamental contributions from this standardization organization may provide input to 6G networks in terms of blockchain design, interoperability and access control. ISO Technical Committee ISO/TC 307 Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies has been actively developing widely-applicable standards on various aspects including use cases, interoperability and security of blockchain and DLT [356]. These fundamental standards are all currently under development and will be important not just for future 6G networks, but for ICT systems in general. Regarding oversight and policy making, policymakers could provide two-pronged contribution to the use of blockchain in digital infrastructure such as 6G networks: to clarify existing oversight mechanisms, including regulations, or create new mechanisms to ensure appropriate oversight of blockchain applications [357]. They should identify legal actors and responsibilities in a well-defined framework and establish accountability for relevant stakeholders. In that regard, an important effort is by EU: It has a strategy on blockchain aiming to build a pan-European public services blockchain while promoting legal certainty and increasing funding for research and innovation [350]. Overall, these activities will have a profound impact on how blockchain can be integrated in future networks and exploited for realizing the envisaged benefits. 7.6. Interoperability The existing blockchain ecosystem incorporates multiple blockchain platforms. However, these platforms are not fully compatible with each other. One of the main reasons for this phenomenon is the lack of governance of various blockchain platforms through protocols and standards, especially in the case of communication networks. However, this may give rise to interoperability issues with multiple blockchain platforms envisaged in future 6G communication networks. Presently, functions such as sending tokens, authentication, executing smart contracts, and validating data are not possible among multiple blockchain systems [358]. Such issues should be resolved to realize blockchain/DLT as an integral part of future communication networks. 7.6.1. Importance in context of 6G The envisaged blockchain-based 6G networks demand the seamless integration and operation of multiple blockchain platforms. For instance, smart contracts are expected to execute seamlessly regardless of the platform to enable the automation of many 6G features. Also, umMTC requires support for scalability via distributed control, universal identity management, and automatic authentication and access control irrespective of the platform used. Moreover, network security through security orchestration and automation, and privacy measures through DApps should operate flawlessly across multiple blockchain platforms that are envisaged with blockchainized 6G. Therefore, enabling seamless interoperability among multiple blockchain platforms is essential towards realizing blockchainized 6G networks. 7.6.2. Possible solutions Establishing interoperability among multiple blockchain platforms has been explored in several research and development work. A trustless cryptocurrency exchange in terms of atomic cross-chain swaps to allow different cryptocurrencies to swap assets was presented in [359]. However, to ensure that no assets are destroyed in case of atomic swaps, cross-blockchain tokens can be used to hold assets in any required blockchain. Furthermore, a secure cross-platform token transfer mechanism and inter-blockchain communication protocols are developed, facilitating the incompatibility of consensus mechanisms, hash algorithms, smart contract interactions, and data exchanges. In addition, interoperability issues across blockchain systems can also be solved using blockchain gates [358], [359]. Also, ETSI is developing interoperability guidelines while Ethereum and Hyperledger are also taking measures to minimize the issues raised due to blockchain interoperability [303], [304], [360]. 8. Lessons learned and future research directions This section discusses the lessons learned, and based on these lessons, synthesizes the future research directions that can pave the way for a profitable blockchain integrated 6G ecosystem. 8.1. 6G requirements 8.1.1. Lessons learned Blockchain related works from the 6G requirements perspective lead to the following lessons learned: Extreme Data Rate: Blockchain-based optimized resource management has the potential to achieve extremely high data rates requirement for 6G. Its use is particularly beneficial for flat network structures with less centralized control. Moreover, the required cooperative nature of 6G RAN can be realized using blockchain [361]. Extreme Reliability: Despite the tangible security gains via the encryption and digital signature enabled by blockchain integration into IoT for extreme reliability, security is still a key concern in such systems due to potential vulnerabilities of blockchain-integrated IoT systems [362]. Extreme Connectivity: A promising approach to enable massive connectivity is to use heterogeneous and multi-tiered networks such as integrated aerial and terrestrial networks [363]. To this end, blockchain can enable extreme connectivity by helping multi-mode connectivity in heterogeneous networks. The openness of permissionless systems provides more degrees of cooperation among different RAN elements of a 6G network to boost capability for ubiquitous coverage. For instance, blockchain can support extreme coverage by operating network clusters with intermittent connectivity where it can be used to manage the operations within the cluster [364]. However, such systems are more complex and may require more advanced security measures. Thus, a trade-off exists between the openness of a blockchain system for expanding coverage versus the complexity and security issues. Extreme Sensing: The current goal of supporting small-packet and sensing-based URLLC services in 5G systems will be challenged and disrupted for an entirely new degree of massive connectivity. This level of connectivity requires blockchains to enable ultra massive sensing applications in 6G. 8.1.2. Future directions Some of the important research directions on how to better utilize the blockchain to address 6G requirements are as follows: • Position-based optimization: Accurate indoor positioning is vital for capacity management since the location of users and devices provide crucial inputs for optimization. However, positioning accuracy and reliability are boosted with cooperative techniques. For instance, blockchain is used to enable a crowdsourced indoor navigation system in [27]. In that regard, how to develop blockchain driven data sharing among disparate entities in the network infrastructure is an important research direction for 6G networks. • Roaming frauds in 3D networks: Already, secure and transparent roaming against frauds is a big challenge in current networks. Moreover, roaming in 6G networks will become more complicated due to the existence of 3D networks and their roaming requirements [98]. Therefore, efficient integration of blockchain for 3D roaming frauds involving heterogeneous networks is an interesting research question. • Trustless sharing ecosystem: Pragmatic blockchain-driven mechanisms for “X-sharing” for capacity maximization and efficiency is a promising research direction. • Blockchain for heterogeneous networks: Though blockchain is considered as a promising solution for data sharing and distributed control for network monitoring and management in the 6G ecosystem comprising of heterogeneous networks. Nonetheless, an important research question is how to control latency overhead due to blockchain integration in these disparate and physically distant networks in 6G ecosystem. Multi-peer blockchain clusters [331] and dockerized micro-services [333] turns out to be proposing solutions to effectively implement scalable and trustless mobile network of heterogeneous networks. • Management of blockchain-based solutions for decoupling eURLLC verticals in case of hazards/risks: The concept of blockchain is inherently promising for cooperation and sharing among 6G verticals. However, the drawback can be the strong coupling among different verticals, a situation which may sporadically impair the latency performance of various verticals in case of malicious events or security incidents occur in an eURLLC vertical [94]. Therefore, management schemes and modular approach in such malfunctions and performance issues form an important research direction. • Fundamental limits on the applicability of blockchain to eURLLC: A fundamental research question to explore is the theoretical limits of blockchain schemes with respect to their applicability to various eURLLC applications. Such research can shed light on what the valid and invalid vertical scenarios are for the blockchain in the eURLLC regime. Moreover, use of multi-peer permissioned blockchains has potential to push the performance limitations of conventional peer-to-peer monolithic blockchains [331]. • Rigorous testing of 6G consensus algorithms: While the design of energy-efficient and secure consensus algorithms is already an active research topic from a 6G perceptive, the developed solutions still need to be thoroughly tested at large scale test networks and accordingly may need further improvements. 8.2. 6G technical aspects 8.2.1. 3D networking Following are the lessons learned and future research directions for using blockchain for 3D networking in 6G. Lessons Learned: With the emergence of altitude as a third dimension and the proliferation of flying technologies (particularly UAVs and LEOs), the next-generation mobile networks aim to extend radio footprints both horizontally and vertically. This implies ultra-tight integration of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks in 6G era which will offer a multitude of benefits including global coverage. Nevertheless, 3D networking will give rise to new challenges such as automated and trustless interoperability, privacy-protected and decentralized data exchanges, secure control plane functionalities, avoiding air-collisions of ABSs, and automated decision making. In this context, blockchain has been considered to mitigate these challenges, thanks to its intrinsic features. Future Directions: To overcome the downside of using blockchain for 3D networks, which are high latency, large storage facility, significant computational and communication overheads, researchers have proposed a wide range of solutions, including multichain, modified structure of the block, and mix of resourceful and resource-constrained ABSs. However, experimental testing using real-world mobile network test-beds is still missing. Also, issues like flexible interoperability between heterogeneous (decentralized) networks, lightweight consensus mechanism, and cross-chain security and isolation among multiple blockchains are yet to be improved upon. 8.2.2. Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) The lessons learned and future research directions for using of blockchain for spectrum management for 6G networks are as follows. Lessons Learned: To maximize the use of the radio spectrum, its management in 6G should be more dynamic and real-time than static allocation. In this regard, DSM can improve spectrum efficiency by enabling effective sharing between primary (incumbent) and secondary users. Although DSM has clear advantages, the inherent centralized management counteracts and results in high administrative cost, security and privacy vulnerabilities, existence of centralized entities for spectrum trading, slow process of creating spectrum sharing agreement and less transparency in actual spectrum usage. Moreover, using cognitive radio, unlicensed secondary users can maliciously access unused spectrum and mount various attacks. To overcome these issues, blockchain can play a cardinal role. The spectrum management activities where blockchain can strengthen are spectrum (auction-based) trading, spectrum allocations, payment settlement based on spectrum usage, and secure recording of all the activities involved during spectrum trading. Thanks to decentralized decision making and disintermediation of centralized entities, its use can eliminate dependency on trusted third parties such as spectrum licensees, band managers, and spectrum access system administrators [25]. Also, to ensure that the primary users are compensated for sharing their licensed bands with secondary users, the sharing and leasing policies can be coded into smart contracts to enforce the contractual agreements between parties digitally [137]. Future Directions: Despite numerous advantages that can be gained using blockchain technology, an important hurdle is the on-boarding of various entities to a blockchain-based decentralized and open spectrum management system. This requires proper standardized APIs and well-defined architectural procedures. Furthermore, privacy preservation must be exclusively dealt within (or outside) blockchain to ensure trade secrets are not leaked. The reason being a blockchain, by default, does not guarantees privacy. 8.2.3. Security in 6G Following are the lessons learned and future research directions for using blockchain to strengthen security in 6G networks. Lessons Learned: The envisaged massive connectivity, native-AI capabilities, complete network automation, heterogeneous and specialized service demands, never-seen-before use cases, various business entities of different scale, and blending of new technologies would demand pervasive security by design in a complex 6G ecosystem. Blockchain is an envisioned enabler for facilitating the expected pervasive security and trust in 6G networks as presented in Section 5.3. Future Directions: Although blockchain has the potential to meet security requirements for 6G networks, however, a blockchain-based implementation itself needs to be inspected carefully for security properties such as decentrality and verified operation. Specifically, the correctness of the consensus protocol needs to be verified as the consensus protocol is the backbone of every blockchain-based system. Therefore, the protocol should be clearly modeled, the correctness should be adequately verified, and all its desired properties should be validated [365]. Nevertheless, it is extremely difficult because of the distributed nature of blockchain. Moreover, the security of the consensus protocol will be ensured by formally specifying security properties such as persistence, liveness, safety, fault tolerance and fraud resilience. Similarly, the trust of the consensus protocol shall be assured by formally defining trust properties, i.e., miner and verifier trust to prevent their malicious behaviors [340]. 8.2.4. Privacy-protection in 6G The lessons learned and future research directions for protecting privacy in 6G using blockchain are as follows. Lessons Learned: With everything and every aspect of human lives getting connected in the envisioned 6G networks, privacy will be indispensable. Typically, both data privacy and user privacy need to be carefully handled. Blockchain has been considered as an enabler for preserving privacy for 6G networks in terms of decentralized identity management, tight access control using well-defined smart contracts, modified/tailored block structure to hide sensitive information, and obfuscation intended blockchain-based encryption like homomorphic encryption. Future Directions: Despite the potential use of blockchain to preserve privacy in the 6G network, the enhanced privacy-protected blockchain solutions come with a performance trade-off. Hence, a balance needs to be maintained between the level of blockchain-based privacy and the system performance. Furthermore, a well-defined framework and formulation of test cases are required to check the level of privacy offered by blockchain-powered solutions in mobile networks. Also, blockchain-based experiments and testing on real testbeds networks need to be explored to understand better the pros and cons of rolling out blockchain-enhanced privacy. 8.2.5. Resource management The lessons learned and future research directions for using blockchain in 6G are discussed as follows. Lessons Learned: Efficient resource management leads to increased utilization efficiency, reduced cost, improved QoS, and higher revenue generation. However, with the ever-growing number of subscribers, connected IoE devices, and industry verticals, there is no wonder that resources management as a whole will be challenging for the 6G networks. The resources include networking, computation and storage resources, and these can be virtualized or made available physically. In addition to the massive connectivity demands, what makes resource management complicated is the heterogeneity and time-varying nature of demands. Hence, conventional centralized management is not the best match. Moreover, the availability requirement for 6G networks impels secure resource management against threats and attacks [25]. Blockchain provides visibility and memory to multiple parties regarding the current and past network resource conditions due to its immutable and transparent logging operation. Moreover, blockchain-based decentralized slice brokering offers a way to carry out secure resource trading between network tenants, infrastructure/resource providers, local network operators and mobile network operators. Such a platform can allow automatic trading (i.e. negotiation, leasing of resources and payment settlement) between unknown entities in the telecommunication ecosystem. Some of the other uses of blockchain in resource management are securing the life-cycle management of VNF (involving network operator, edge platforms, and third-party VNF providers) and incentivizing the sharing of nearby unused resources. Future Directions: Although blockchain is introduced as a solution for resource management in the future networks, the research is still in its infancy stage. A substantial amount of work should be focused on integrating blockchain-based resource management solutions in wireless networks and proceeding with the standardization process. As usual, the inherent security and privacy issues of blockchain technology need to be tackled. In a fully automated 6G network management architecture, resource management needs to be performed with higher intelligence in a very responsive manner. Monitoring and updating network resource availability should be performed in real-time, and they can be fed as inputs for intelligent resource trading. 8.2.6. Ubiquitous intelligence Following are the lessons learned and future research directions for the ubiquitous intelligence in 6G networks. Lessons Learned: Much deeper integration of AI at all levels of the 6G network communications is visualized with the ultimate goal to make our society super-smart, super-efficient and greener. In particular, the advantages of native-AI based 6G networks are seen at the network management level with complete automation in heterogeneous settings (multi-tenants, multi-operators, and multi-vendors), at the network service level with flexibility, customization and self-adaptability, and also at the application level. However, the optimized adoption of AI in the complex 6G ecosystem, the trustworthiness of AI/ML agents, the efficacy of distributed AI system, and the scalability of ubiquitous intelligence are the challenges. Blockchain has been found to be apt to meet these challenges. For instance, blockchain is capable of handling the secure exchange of training data for AI-driven solutions [366] and uploading of locally trained ML model in FL-based solutions [367]. Thus, different operators, tenants, or mobile end users in 6G networks can securely share their data for training or incremental updates of AI models as in federated learning [232]. Also, blockchain can make the decision process of the AI/ML methods more coherent and auditable as all the underlying elements on which the decisions are made can be traced back. Moreover, since blockchain provides a distributed database, it can protect a massive amount of data expected to be processed by AI in 6G, leading to enhanced security and transparent operation against corruption and hacking. Specially designed consensus algorithms can provide fault tolerance, reduced requirement of computational resources, and efficient and coherent learning at the same time. Furthermore, ultra-large-scale sensing and tracking in 6G will be well supported by blockchain. Future Directions: The convergence of blockchain and AI has huge potential for 6G networks, and thus there are many research avenues for research. Computationally light, attack immune, and learning-based consensus algorithms need to be developed to ascertain the use of blockchain for native-AI 6G networks. Another direction for successful integration of blockchain and AI/ML is setting up of platforms and testbeds to put such solutions through rigorous testing. This would require collective efforts from blockchain alliances and telecommunication regulatory bodies. The key challenges for ubiquitous intelligence in 6G have two aspects: the challenges against realizing ubiquitous intelligence and the challenges once intelligence is embedded in every layer of 6G networks (from the PHY layer functions to applications). Although we focus on the former, the latter is also a critical research topic and may be integrated with blockchain technology, e.g., how to enable flexible and secure resource sharing with network intelligence [95] or for trust scoring for ICN contents in B5G networks [96]. 8.2.7. Mobility management The lessons learned and future research directions for blockchain-based mobility management in the 6G network are discussed below. Lessons Learned: On the one hand, small cell size (due to the high-frequency spectrum) and 3D network will result in high mobility and a large number of handovers both in horizontal and vertical directions. On the other hand, the 6G requirements pose mobility management to happen transparently and with high reliability. Thus, mobility management will be a crucial technical aspect to achieve ultrahigh-speed with low-latency communications in the 6G era. Numerous key requirements for mobility management are immunity to security attacks, perfect forward secrecy, mutual authentication and key agreement, traceability, decentralized authentication facility, and immunity to roaming frauds. Blockchain has been found capable of resolving many of these issues. In particular, blockchain can enable session key confidentiality, secure authentication during handover, decentralized authentication server, dynamic roaming agreements, preventing roaming frauds, fair economic incentive policies and immunity towards numerous attacks like reply attack and Sybil attack. However, high storage redundancy due to the distributed ledger and computational overheads is the downside of using blockchain. Future Directions: One of the challenges to support mobility is to manage handover among diverse wireless technologies as different handover strategies affect the signaling overhead and handover delay. Even though blockchain has been found beneficial for secure and decentralized mobility management, there are few areas where blockchains role needs to be explored. For example, blockchains role for physical layer fingerprinting based authentication during mobility has yet to be explored. Similarly, the impact of blockchain to manage the resource constraint problem during handover is an open research topic. The existing blockchain systems have a low block throughput to reach a consensus about new block addition. So, ensuring higher block throughput in a dynamic and mobile environment is still an open research question. While continuous improvements are being observed from the low throughput consensus protocol, like PoW, to high throughput consensus protocol, like Mystiko [332], there is still a need for better mechanisms to achieve higher throughput to meet the 6G requirements. 8.3. 6G applications 8.3.1. Industrial applications in Industry 5.0 Following are the lessons learned and future research directions for the use of blockchain for 6G-powered industrial applications. Lessons Learned: Future industrial applications in Industry 5.0 with underpinning of 6G will see machines and humans coming together on the same floor and working in a synergistic environment with close interactions. 6G-enabled integration of technologies like VR/AR/XR, advance robotics (in form of cobots), AI/ML techniques, and Brain Control Interface (BCI) will help humans to perform creative, high-level, controlled and finer tasks in Industry 5.0 era. Nevertheless, there are concerns like connection scalability, secure and privacy-protected storing and processing of generated Big data by human robot interaction, centralized management of on-demand cloud manufacturing, secure logging of trade secrets, and automated detection of copyright violation or patent infringements. Blockchain potentially can resolve many of these concerns as discussed in Section 6.1. Moreover, industrial applications that requires powerful computational resources can be securely offloaded to edge servers using blockchain. This significantly improves the performance of these applications while keeping the latency minimal. Furthermore, blockchains and smart contracts can also be instrumental in automating the agreement processes between companies and their partners or customers. Future Directions: In spite of promising roles the blockchain can play in Industry 5.0, there is need to build standard platforms where smart contracts are integrated with industry-scale robotic operating systems, and APIs are made available for wide adoption DApps in industrial environment. Moreover, blockchain-based industrial ecosystem can also be crippled with availability-targeting attacks such as incentive-based DoS attacks (e.g., Blockchain Denial-of-Service (BDoS) [368]) or non-malicious glitches during the operation (e.g., due to bugs [369]) [370]. Hence, the extreme high reliability objective requires more effort in the blockchain domain for adaptability and usability in IoE-enabled 6G industrial application scenarios. 8.3.2. Smart healthcare The lessons learned and future research directions for blockchain empowered smart healthcare in 6G era. Lessons Learned: 6G-powered smart healthcare ecosystem will revolutionize the landscape of medical services like real-time monitoring, intelligent preventive healthcare, early diagnosis, H2H services (i.e. mobile hospitals), and tele-surgeries with holographic presence of doctors. Although, on the one hand, the increasing digitization of healthcare activities with the integration of numerous technologies (e.g., IWDs, AI/ML, IIoMTs, and big data analytics) and the solid underpinning of 6G, will offer numerous advantages. However, on the other hand, the increased digitization is also highly prone to security and privacy breaches of medical data. Such medical data breaches result in exposing the sensitive/personal information, economic losses, faulty treatment, and permanent or long-time damages [241]. Blockchain together with smart contracts and lightweight cryptographic techniques can elevate the performance of 6G-powered smart healthcare platforms. Specifically, decentralized medical data management, enhanced security from attacks (both external and internal attacks), strict access control, and uninterrupted service availability are some of the offerings of blockchain in healthcare sector. Future Directions: Despite the promising benefits blockchain can bring to the realm of 6G-enabled healthcare ecosystem, strong privacy by design is required for such systems. This should be followed with real-life rigorous testing and formal verification of these systems. Also, blockchain-based unified healthcare ecosystem would need required update to the existing legal frameworks to allow decentralized storage and processing of private medical data. Especially, if blockchain nodes are spread across countries [246]. Also, a well-defined system to check the compliance to privacy laws of medical world. 8.3.3. UAV applications: The lessons learned and future research directions for blockchain supported 6G-enabled UAV applications. Lessons Learned: UAVs, initially conceptualized and developed for military applications, have demonstrated their immense applicability in public and civil domains as well. With the availability of 6G networks, wide range of UAV-based advance use cases such as flying fire brigades, airborne short distance taxis, and flying cargo services, will become reality. However, UAVs will be easy victim of security attacks like route or mission hijacking, jamming, eavesdropping, and rouge device. Moreover, privacy will be at stake since UAVs with its easy maneuvering, small size and controlled aerodynamics can silently enter personal space. Blockchain has demonstrated its benefits in overcoming these challenges. For instance use of blockchain for identity management can efficiently detect rouge UAVs. Blockchain based secure logging of UAV’s trajectory, decentralized route and resource management, trustless cooperation, and smart contract based storage and computational offloading some other use of blockchain for 6G-envisioned UAV applications. Future Directions: However, further research is required in several areas such as improving privacy, scalability in terms of number of transactions per second, security in terms of 51% attacks, and resource utilization in terms of power and energy. 8.3.4. CAVs Following are the lessons learned and future research directions for the use of blockchain for 6G-enabled CAVs. Lessons Learned: Convergence of fully connected and highly autonomous vehicles in form of CAVs will be another popular 6G automation use case. Some of the much awaited advantages of CAVs are reduction in accidents and fatal consequences, decrease in insurance claims, less traffic congestion, effective and automated route planning, P2P vehicular resource trading, and even reduction in fuel consumption. However, since with every advancements there are associated challenges, the ones with CAVs are support for real-time and computational decentralized services, strong security towards the use of AI/ML/FL techniques, all time service availability, and trustless and privacy protected P2P resource trading. Blockchain along with smart contracts, lightweight cryptographic techniques, edge intelligence has shown encouraging solutions towards solving these issues. Future Directions: An interesting open questions on how to reconcile data protection and privacy issues with immutability and transparency in blockchain. Moreover, use of multiple chains and their interoperability may be required but to find effective way to do that is still a challenging task. 8.3.5. Energy Internet (EI) The lessons learned and future research directions in context of EI are as follows. Lessons Learned: EI is an emerging internet-based paradigm that integrates variety of energy sources (including renewable sources), heterogeneous storage systems and advance control and monitoring techniques. With the advent of 6G, EI will receive the underlying support to meet the future energy demands. However, there are number of impediments that need to be addressed before one can achieve full benefit of EI. These are scalability issues with current centralized energy business models, nonavailability of complete automation keeping in mind the growing number and the time-varying nature of renewable energy sources, non-existence of large scale dynamic energy trading platforms, and strict security provisions. Recent research demonstrate the applicability of blockchain to mitigate many of these issues. For instance, decentralized smart grid management, secure logging of smart meter’s readings, decentralized market place for energy trading, auditing with strict access control and load-balancing are some of the appealing benefits that blockchain can bring to 6G-enabled EI. Future Directions: In future, establishment of blockchain-based energy infrastructure and associated APIs will ease the advancements in EI sector. Moreover, efficient consensus algorithms will be required that can sense and adapt based on energy related parameters. 8.4. Relation to other 6G enabling technologies Following the 6G vision and capabilities in the previous parts of this section, the most outstanding research opportunities for 6G enabling technologies regarding blockchain technology are elaborated in this subsection. 8.4.1. Internet of Everything (IoE) The distinguishing role of IoE as discussed in [371] will be the total transformation of business processes and business models. By the optimization and automatization of such processes with intrinsic digital technology, new business models and value chains in different industries become feasible. From the business perspective, it will be worthwhile to the impact of integrating IoE in future ICT systems [372]. Particularly, the unprecedented business velocity and agility will lead to a high competition pressure among businesses. To this end, the pros and cons of integrating blockchain-based technologies for enabling interoperability among different entities and industries, e.g., charging and billing, is an important research topic. 8.4.2. Data storage and analytics As the IoE concept is realized in future networks, an enormous number of things and objects will continuously generate and stream new data in real-time. That phenomenon leads to the fundamental requirement of efficient and capable centralized and decentralized data storage technologies in 6G. Blockchain enabled technologies for data storage, management and processing can play a key role to address this challenging need. However, it is an open question how to distribute and synthesize these technologies in different network domains (e.g., edge, fog, and cloud). Moreover, research on data analytics methods will be critical to analyze and then extract the crucial elements out of this large amount of data for effective and accurate decision making. The appropriate methods mainly depend on the type of use cases and applications. The four main categories of methods in that regard are descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics as listed by [373]. As a future research direction, investigation on efficient ways to integrate these data analytics methods with a blockchain based distributed data storage and smart contracts for process automation can be studied. 8.4.3. Quantum Computing There are specific vulnerabilities of blockchain technology manifested by the development of quantum computers. Namely, the security of distributed ledger technology depends on the difficulty of solving certain cryptographic problems which are undermined by the potential of quantum computation [374]. However, two research questions for blockchain are relevant to quantum computing era in 6G: (i) Hashing security: A key assumption for hashing security is that inversion is computationally difficult. However, a quantum computer can mitigate this barrier. Then the authenticity of the upstream blockchain is not guaranteed anymore and the blockchain entries can be compromised in terms of authentication. (ii) Quantum informational modeling: With quantum computing in operation, quantum informational versions of systems such as blockchain are essential. In that regard, an envisaged research direction is quantum resistant cryptography, also known as post-quantum cryptography, which further studies potential attacks exploiting a quantum computer for the analysis of conventional cryptographic algorithms. With the parallel developments in quantum computing and blockchainized 6G networks, this is an important research question to have future-proof 6G specifications and standardization. 8.4.4. Edge computing Edge computing is an inherently distributed environment that needs mechanisms for secure and trustworthy data as well as computation fluidity [375]. Therefore, blockchain is to be integrated into edge computing in 6G networks [376]. It is possible for resource owners to join the ecosystem and to lend the compute resources as needed. IoT devices can offload some of the edge computation to the resource owner nodes when required [377]. In [378], the integration of smart contracts with the edge nodes acting as a platform hierarchical and distributed control systems is presented. The executive process control is based on a micro-services architecture where Docker containers implement function blocks with Kubernetes platform used as the edge orchestrator. Blockchain technology has also emerged as a solution for managing MEC services, with consensus protocols and data integrity checks that enable transparent and efficient distributed decision-making [35], [379]. An existing blockchain cannot be directly applied to an edge network since it requires all participants to store the entire history of the data provenance, which clearly cannot be achieved by most end devices under certain resource constraints [380]. To summarize, existing security and fault tolerance approaches pose unrealistic expectations on compute, network, or storage in the context of edge computing. For edge computing in 6G, blockchain driven scalability enhancement and resource management is an interesting research direction [376]. Blockchain provides techniques to address these aspects albeit also bringing forth its own challenges (e.g., complexity and scalability). Blockchain can also support self-organization due as an enabler for distributed data exchange and control. Furthermore, how to provide security is a crucial research question as the case for the overall 6G network. 9. Conclusion 6G wireless networks, driven by the vast and heterogeneous demands of hyper-connected existence of everything, will indeed give rise to new use cases as well as business avenues. In line with ongoing resurgence of research activities centered around 6G, this paper took a deep dive to comprehend multitude of benefits that can be achieved with integration of blockchain in 6G. In particular, the survey began with tracking the trends, requirements, applications and key technological enablers for 6G, which revealed the panoramic view of current 6G evolution. Then, the paper assimilated various technical aspects of 6G by presenting the key challenges and benefits that blockchain can usher. Further, the paper presented that blockchainized 6G ecosystem can offer diverse and substantial underpinning to future envisioned use cases and applications. Towards the end, dedicated efforts have been put to delineate numerous research opportunities. In summary, blockchain has immense potential that can be harnessed for designing next generation of mobile networks, however, more research efforts are required to ensure the extent to which it can be pragmatically used.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

Abstract: Soil temperature is an essential factor for agricultural, meteorological, and hydrological
applications. Direct measurement, despite its high accuracy, is impractical on a large spatial scale due
to the expensive and time-consuming process. On the other hand, the complex interaction between
variables affecting soil temperature, such as topography and soil properties, leads to challenging
estimation processes by empirical methods and physical models. Machine learning (ML) approaches
gained considerable attention due to their ability to address the limitations of empirical and physical
methods. These approaches are capable of estimating the variables of interest using complex nonlinear
relationships with no assumptions about data distribution. However, their sensitivity to input data
as well as the need for a large amount of training ground truth data limits the application of machine
learning approaches. The current paper aimed to provide a review of ML techniques implemented
for soil temperature modeling, their challenges, and milestones achieved in this domain.
Keywords: soil temperature; direct measurement; empirical methods; physical models; machine learning
1. Introduction
Soil temperature is an essential environmental parameter in earth sciences, such as me-
teorology and climate change; soil processes, such as evaporation, inﬁltration, and nutrient
cycling; and agricultural purposes, such as precision farming and irrigation scheduling at
many developmental stages. As an important meteorological parameter, soil temperature
controls the heat transfer from the soil to the atmosphere and vice versa. In addition,
agriculture applications including potential evapotranspiration, root development, crop
growth, and yield of crop are affected by soil temperature variations. Soil temperature
also plays a remarkable role in determining hydrological parameters, such as evaporation,
precipitation, and inﬁltration of water through soil.
Accurate estimation of soil temperature is complicated because of the physical, chem-
ical, and biological processes governing the soil-plant-atmosphere system [1]. Since soil
temperature is highly localized and can be difﬁcult to measure directly, indirect methods of
assessing soil temperature using more easily measured variables such as air temperature
and readily available weather data gained much attention.
Generally, estimation methods for soil temperature are classiﬁed into three groups
(1) in situ measurements, (2) satellite observations, and (3) model-based estimates.
The most reliable method is in situ measuring using local instruments such as ther-
mistors, thermocouples, thermocouple wires, and averaging thermocouples, which can
provide accurate estimates of soil temperature. Although in situ measurements, which
are necessary to validate the two other methods, can provide soil temperature with a
relatively high degree of accuracy, the low density of sensors and ﬁne spatial resolution of
sampling restrict the use of point (or ﬁeld) observations to map the soil temperature over

a wide geographical area because of expensive equipment. In other words, continuous
monitoring of soil temperature at different depths requires a variety of sensors installed at
short distances to represent the spatial heterogeneity in soil temperature. However, high
costs of installation and maintenance, equipment requirement, special expertise, and point
measurement limit the application of these ﬁeld soil temperature sensors.
Therefore, satellite sensors received signiﬁcant attention over the past few decades. Yet,
scaling issues and measurement depth, despite current advances, are the most considerable
challenges of remote sensing techniques.
The model-based approach, including empirical and physical models, can retrieve
soil temperature by surface information and weather-forcing variables. Empirical models
use statistical regression techniques and parametric functions to map the soil temperature
through in situ measurements. These models are simple to implement without a speciﬁc
background. Although these models are useful to model soil temperature dynamics with
an acceptable accuracy, the need for suitable reference samples of the desired target variable
for calibration and validation of results restricts the use of the models due to the costly and
time-consuming process of in situ measurements. Moreover, the estimation accuracy of
reference samples can be affected by errors during the measurement process. The statistical
regression-based relationship between input and output is site dependent; therefore, empir-
ical relationships, despite their fewer input data requirements, are valid only under speciﬁc
operational conditions in which the samples were collected [2–4]. Furthermore, varying
environmental conditions in addition to some matters such as nonlinearity, outlier data,
multicollinearity, and heteroscedasticity can decrease the estimation accuracy of statistical
models due to the lack of physical structure.
Physical models, including agronomical models, hydrological models, earth system
models, and land surface models (LSMs), are based on assumptions that simplify the
real phenomena, which leads to more general use in comparison to collections of in situ
measurements. However, these simplifying assumptions lead to uncertainty in estimating
the soil temperature at the continental or global scales. Physical models suffer from high
complexity, intensive input data requirement, and high computational cost in estimating
near-real-time soil temperature, which makes accurate estimation of physical parameters
challenging [5]. Additionally, errors due to forcing data and parameters potentially lead to
uncertainties in the long-term monitoring of soil temperature. Although data assimilation
techniques such as the land data assimilation system (LDAS) can improve the accuracy of
estimates, errors due to the physics of these models are inevitable [6].
With the signiﬁcant progress in computer technology, various machine learning (ML)
techniques, known as computational artiﬁcial intelligence-based (AI) models with a dy-
namic input-output mapping approach, were developed to address the aforementioned
drawbacks. These data-driven models are mathematical representations built based on
training data to estimate target variables by analyzing data attributes. They are capable
of approximating complex nonlinear relationships, including nonlinear, nonmonotonic,
and multimodal relationships, with limited assumptions about data distribution as well
as predeﬁned conceptual relationships between input and output data because of their
advanced learning strategies. Due to this property, a wide range of diverse datasets with
unknown probability density functions can be used to estimate variables of interest using
ML with better performance than other parametric methods [2] Moreover, multi-source
usage makes ML models suitable for large-scale studies such as climate and hydrology
studies. Since ML techniques rely on the relationships between model inputs and desired
outputs, they can accurately represent earth processes without an explicit structure.
Unlike empirical models, ML-based outputs can be applied as important information
sources to retrieve soil temperature in unsampled areas [7,8]. In addition, these methods
with high computational speed and high adaptability to different inputs and conﬁgurations
are superior to LSMs and Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) models [9]. However,
ML methods need a large number of samples with known target labels to capture the
Sustainability 2023, 15, 7677

variability of complex systems. Other challenges are overﬁtting the models to the training
data as well as low convergence during the learning process [10].
If an ML-based model is sufﬁciently trained to represent the physical process, it can
provide accurate predictions of data not included in the training process, i.e., the general-
ization concept [11]. Thus, introducing physical principles and constraints into machine
learning techniques can improve the estimation accuracy of the model by reducing the
optimization search space to physically based possibilities [12–14]. Furthermore, apply-
ing a penalty to the optimization process because of inconsistent predictions can drive
the optimization process to reduce error and generate physically meaningful results. In
addition to the training process, ML models are highly dependent on input variables that
are correlated with soil temperature, including climatic variables such as air temperature
and precipitation, soil properties such as soil texture and land cover, and vegetation in-
dices [15,16]. In other words, the quality and quantity of training data signiﬁcantly affect
the performance of ML models. As a result, the ML models are incapable of capturing
the relationships between data and generalizing appropriate patterns to new datasets for
small datasets, resulting in an overﬁtted model. In contrast, noisy data may lead to the
model underﬁtting to the training datasets if a relatively simple learning structure is used.
Furthermore, limited datasets representing speciﬁc conditions cause the model to fail to
recognize true underlying patterns. A data preprocessing process, such as bias reduction,
data normalization, and data size increment, can mitigate these issues, in addition to the
feature selection process that determines which data are appropriate for input.
The advent of ML-based soil temperature prediction occurred when [17] used relative
humidity, wind speed, and air temperature, as inputs in both single-layer and multi-
layer neural networks to predict soil temperature, thereby providing a foundation for
machine learning as a method for soil temperature estimation using climate variables. Since
then, many studies proposed other ML models and input variables for soil temperature
prediction. Given that ML models were successfully used to retrieve soil characteristics for
two decades, the current research addresses the application of different machine learning
methodologies in predicting soil temperature. These predictive models along with decision-
support systems can alleviate the time and operational costs associated with instrumental
measurements. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, different
artiﬁcial intelligence-based models are classiﬁed into four main categories: (i) artiﬁcial
neural networks, (ii) deep learning, (iii) kernel models, and (iv) hybrid models, in which
the studies carried out by these methods are assessed in detail. The limitations and future
perspectives are also discussed in Section 3.
2. AI-Based Models for Soil Temperature Estimation
2.1. Artiﬁcial Neural Networks
An artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), which is a universal approximator for nonlinear
mapping, classically comprises three layers including input, hidden, and output layers, as
shown in Figure 1. The model can learn the multivariate non-linear relationships between
the input and output without physical concepts and generalize them to other points [18,19].
Thus, ANNs eliminate the need for an explicit conﬁguration of physical relationships by
deﬁning the input–output relationship, which prevents the models from errors caused by
incorrect associations. Moreover, these models beneﬁt from a relatively low computational
cost due to the one-time calibration.
The most widely used variants of ANN include feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs)
or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), radial basis neural networks (RBNN), and generalized
regression neural networks (GRNNs). Despite the different structures of ANN models, all
of them consist of two functional components, i.e., learning and optimization processes for
classifying inputs to hidden layers and to outputs, respectively. The first component, known as
the input-hidden component, detects nonlinearity in the input data and classifies inputs into
hidden layers by a learning algorithm (supervised or unsupervised). The second functional
component, known as the hidden-output component, includes an optimization process to find
Sustainability 2023, 15, 7677

the best match between the classified inputs and targets. The classified inputs are mapped to
the outputs by linear projection, which adjusts the model parameters by a negative gradient
algorithm by minimizing the mean square error between the ANN output and target data.
ANNs are capable of dealing with a large amount of data because of the separate training
process of the components. In addition, an adaptive procedure can be used to recursively
update the parameters when the observational data of interest are sufficient.
(FFNNs) or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), radial basis neural networks (RBNN), and 
generalized regression neural networks (GRNNs). Despite the different structures of 
ANN models, all of them consist of two functional components, i.e., learning and optimi-
zation processes for classifying inputs to hidden layers and to outputs, respectively. The 
first component, known as the input-hidden component, detects nonlinearity in the input 
data and classifies inputs into hidden layers by a learning algorithm (supervised or unsu-
pervised). The second functional component, known as the hidden-output component, 
includes an optimization process to find the best match between the classified inputs and 
targets. The classified inputs are mapped to the outputs by linear projection, which adjusts 
the model parameters by a negative gradient algorithm by minimizing the mean square

amount of data because of the separate training process of the components. In addition, 
an adaptive procedure can be used to recursively update the parameters when the obser-
vational data of interest are sufficient.

ANNs are the most popular type of AI models for approximating hydrological and 
environmental components such as soil temperature with a long-term history. For exam-
ple, ref. [20] compared the performance of three AI-based models, i.e., MLPs, GRNNs, and 
RBNNs, as well as multiple linear regression (MLR) in modeling monthly soil tempera-
tures at different depths. They assessed the effect of climatic data, including relative hu-
midity, solar radiation, wind speed, and air temperature, on the resulting soil temperature 
by GRNN, among which the air temperature was identified as the most effective variable. 
According to the results, RBNN performed better than MLP and GRNN in estimating soil 
temperature at depths of 5 and 10 cm, while MLR and GRNN models presented the best 
accuracy at 50 and 100 cm, respectively. In addition to climatic data, the effect of periodic-
ity on model accuracy in the training, validation, and test periods was investigated, lead-
ing to a decrease in the root mean square error (RMSE) of GRNN, MLP, RBNN, and MLR 
by 19, 15, 19, and 15 %, respectively.

ANNs are the most popular type of AI models for approximating hydrological and
environmental components such as soil temperature with a long-term history. For example,
ref. [20] compared the performance of three AI-based models, i.e., MLPs, GRNNs, and
RBNNs, as well as multiple linear regression (MLR) in modeling monthly soil temperatures
at different depths. They assessed the effect of climatic data, including relative humidity,
solar radiation, wind speed, and air temperature, on the resulting soil temperature by
GRNN, among which the air temperature was identiﬁed as the most effective variable.
According to the results, RBNN performed better than MLP and GRNN in estimating soil
temperature at depths of 5 and 10 cm, while MLR and GRNN models presented the best
accuracy at 50 and 100 cm, respectively. In addition to climatic data, the effect of periodicity
on model accuracy in the training, validation, and test periods was investigated, leading to
a decrease in the root mean square error (RMSE) of GRNN, MLP, RBNN, and MLR by 19,
15, 19, and 15 %, respectively.
Ref. [21] used several data-intelligent ML models, i.e., ANN, extreme learning machine
(ELM), and M5 Model Tree (M5 Tree), to estimate monthly soil temperatures at 5, 50, and
100 cm. The models were trained by meteorological information obtained from two stations
in Turkey, including air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and
periodicity. The ELM model, with the highest accuracy and lowest error, was considered
the most accurate model at a depth of 50 cm.
Even though climatic data may be unavailable in some regions, most studies use
meteorological parameters as input data to estimate soil temperature. For example, ref. [22]
employed geographical information, i.e., latitude, longitude, and altitude as well as the cal-
endar month, to estimate monthly soil temperature at depths of 5, 10, 50, and 100 cm using
Sustainability 2023, 15, 7677
5 of 26
ANN, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and gene expression programming
(GEP). According to the results, the ANFIS model provided the most accurate estimates,
followed by the ANN and GEP. Ref. [23] predicted the monthly soil temperature at a depth
of 10 cm by ANN over a large spatial domain with complex terrain in southwestern China.
The independent variables included geographical information obtained from a digital
elevation model and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from
satellite imagery. Compared to multiple linear regressions, ANNs improved the RMSE,
mean absolute error (MAE), and R2 by about 44%, 70%, and 18%, respectively.
Using Earth observation satellite data, ref. [24] evaluated the predictive capability of
feed forward back propagation neural network (FFBPNN) for land surface temperature by
past land surface temperature (LST) values as well as geographical characteristics. They
conﬁrmed the ability of ANN to learn and predict a non-linear complex dataset.
The aforementioned studies modeled soil temperature on a monthly time scale while
daily or sub-daily resolutions are more advantageous for agricultural purposes. Moreover,
the applicability of these models is limited due to the lack of environmental and atmospheric
data used for soil temperature estimation. To address these issues, ref. [25] employed ANN
and wavelet neural network (WNN) models to forecast soil temperature 1–7 days ahead
by only surface air temperature data with hourly temporal resolution. The results showed
that a wavelet transform, which decomposes the inputs into low and high-frequency
components, can improve the prediction accuracy of soil temperature.
The methods of ELM, GRNN, backpropagation neural networks (BPNN), and random
forests (RF) were exploited to derive half-hourly soil temperatures at depths of 2 cm, 5 cm,
10 cm, and 20 cm from datasets of air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,
wind speed, and vapor pressure deﬁcit [26]. Despite the desirable performance of all the
models, the ELM model with a high computational speed showed more accurate results at
different soil depths. Ref. [27] used the MLP model, RF, Gaussian process (GaP), and M5P
models to estimate daily soil temperature in arid regions by climate data obtained from
two stations, which included sunshine, wind speed, relative humidity, and air temperature.
It was found that the MLP model with RMSE ranging from 3.3 to 6.3 ◦C performed
better than the other models in estimating soil temperature at a depth of 5 cm. Ref. [28]
employed MLP and MLR models to estimate the daily soil temperature at 5, 10, 20, 30, 50,
and 100 cm by daily meteorological data, including relative humidity, solar radiation, air
temperature, and precipitation. The results showed the superiority of MLP to MLR as well
as the higher effectiveness of air temperature and humidity over other variables. Ref. [29]
applied MLP and ANFIS models to estimate the daily soil temperature at two stations
in Illinois, USA. A variety of weather data, including air temperature, relative humidity,
dew point temperature, potential evapotranspiration, wind speed, solar radiation, and soil
temperature at 10 and 20 cm depths were used to model the soil temperature. The input
data for air temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation were recognized as the best data
combination for both models. In addition, it was found that the MLP model outperformed
ANFIS for both stations at depths of 10 and 20 cm. Ref. [30] exploited ANN, MLR, and
GEP to estimate the multi-depth daily soil temperature at a station with a semiarid climate
in Iran. To adopt the best input data, they used 12 combinations of meteorological data
including relative humidity, wind speed, extraterrestrial radiation, sunshine hours, and
minimum and maximum air temperatures. Although all models were able to estimate
soil temperature, the ANN model exhibited the best performance. Ref. [31] applied ANN,
WNN, and GEP models to estimate the daily soil temperature at different depths in Iran
based on single-station measurements. At all depths, air temperature, radiation, and
sunshine hours had the greatest effect on the soil temperature prediction. The results
revealed that the best performance belonged to WNN with the lowest RMSE and highest R;
however, the estimation accuracy as well as the effect of climatic factors decreased with
increasing soil depth.
Since neural network (NN)-based soil temperature models are location-speciﬁc, they
cannot be extended to other locations because of the unique relationships between soil
Sustainability 2023, 15, 7677
6 of 26
temperature and climate conditions at the training location. However, it is possible to build
spatially distributed temperature models if sufﬁcient temperature data are initially known.
In this regard, ref. [32] used an ensemble approach using machine learning techniques such
as ANN, decision tree (DT), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to predict spatially distributed
land surface temperatures from a given dataset of land temperature at known locations. The
statistical indices showed good performance of the proposed model built by DT, variable
ridge regression (VRR), and conditional inference tree (CIT).
Some studies evaluated the efﬁciency of ML models for predicting soil temperature
only at shallow depths, while the relationship between effective parameters and soil
temperature changes with the depth of the soil temperature sample, leading to a need for
multi-depth evaluation. In this regard, ref. [33] used an ANN and a co-active neuro-fuzzy
inference system (CANFIS) to predict the soil temperature at two locations in Iran at depths
from 5 to 100 cm using only air temperature data. The resulting models performed better
for shallower sample depths, and stations in dry climates. The authors hypothesized that
moisture in humid climates may act as a thermal insulator, interfering with the relationship
between the air and soil temperatures. Ref. [34] modeled soil temperature at depths from
5 to 100 cm at Mersin station, Turkey, by using ELM, ANN, classiﬁcation and regression
trees (CRT), and the group method of data handling (GMDH). They also investigated
the models’ sensitivity to the input variables, including air temperature, solar radiation,
wind speed, relative humidity, and soil temperature. According to the results, the ELM
performed best among all the models. The models for shallow soil temperature performed
best and were found to rely only on the climate input of air temperature; while at deeper
depths, more input variables (namely wind speed and solar radiation) were required.
The aforementioned studies used input data that associate concurrent climate pa-
rameters, and each individual set of measurements stands on its own, with no inherent
connection in time to other data points. This data structure makes it necessary to introduce
other techniques to account for time-related behavior. The simplest technique to account
for seasonal cycles in soil temperature is to include the month of the year and, optionally,
the day as well, as another input parameter. With this approach, ref. [35] investigated soil
temperatures in Adana, Turkey, at ﬁve depths from 5 to 100 cm. The soil temperature was
modeled using linear regression (LR) and nonlinear regression (NLR) as well as a feedfor-
ward neural network using different input sets depending on the season: air temperature,
depth, and month were used year-round, and in the hot season atmospheric pressure,
and solar radiation inputs were added. The results revealed the superior performance
of FFNN over linear and nonlinear models. In addition, the results did not show any
change in the model performance with sample depth for the neural network. Ref. [36]
modeled soil temperature data from across Turkey using ANN, ANFIS, and MLR models.
The study found that monthly soil temperature could be predicted using monthly mini-
mum and maximum air temperatures, soil depth, calendar month number, and monthly
precipitation. The models were built using all soil temperature data from different soil
depths and climate regions, which would implicitly have different relationships with the
climate input variables. The success of the models, especially the ANFIS model, indicates
that these differences could be accounted for using the inputs of climate variables and
soil depth, allowing for a model that was not intrinsically tied to a single location or soil
depth. [37] used ANN models to predict soil temperature at locations across Turkey using
the input climate parameters of solar radiation, sunshine duration, and air temperature;
location parameters of altitude, latitude, and longitude; and time parameters of month
and year. The best performing model was for the 20 cm depth, and the 100 cm depth
model performed marginally worse. The inclusion of the year in the input is an interesting
choice: it limits the models’ applicability to make predictions for the future, where the
year will, by nature, be outside the range used for training the model. However, within
the range of historical data, using year as an input variable allows the model to account
for changes in seasonal patterns from year to year. Including only the month and day in
the input variables inherently assumes that the seasonal patterns do not vary from year to
Sustainability 2023, 15, 7677
7 of 26
year; however, natural variation in weather patterns as well as climate change contradict
this assumption.
Another way of accounting for time without assuming identical yearly patterns is to
use a sliding window approach. With this method, the soil temperature at a given time
is modeled with an input of climate variables from the same time and from one or more
previous time steps. Ref. [38] modeled the soil temperature at two study sites in Iran
using MLPs and support vector machines (SVMs) with and without optimization via the
ﬁreﬂy algorithm (FFA). The input climate variables (air temperature, wind speed, relative
humidity, and sunshine hours) from the current day, the previous day, and, in some models,
the day prior to that were all used as model inputs. The study concluded that using two
days of previous data led to the best results, and the models that used FFA outperformed
the standalone models without optimization. Ref. [39] investigated two stations in different
climate regions of Iran, with sampling depths ranging from 5 to 100 cm. They used seasonal
autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), a linear stochastic approach, with
seasonal standardization and spectral analysis in preprocessing. This model was compared
to three machine learning models, i.e., ELM, self-adaptive evolutionary ELM (SaE-ELM),
and ANFIS, and was shown to outperform them. The SARIMA model showed no loss of
quality for deeper soil temperatures and performed moderately better at deeper depths.
One difﬁculty in the sliding window approach is that it makes assumptions about the
lag time between the causal climate variable and the effect on soil temperature (namely, lag
times equal to or less than the window length). The actual lag times may be long or follow
complex patterns. Along with building several machine learning models to predict hourly
soil temperatures at their sites in Iran, ref. [40] used wavelet decomposition to assess the
coherence between various climate parameters and soil temperature. They observed that
air temperature and soil temperature were highly coherent at a periodicity of 4 to 8 h for
a soil depth of 5 cm, and 8 to 16 h at depths of 10 and 30 cm. Relative humidity and soil
temperature were coherent at a periodicity of 16 to 64 h for 5 cm depth, and 4 to 8 h for
10 and 30 cm depths. While most studies examine soil temperature over larger time scales
(i.e., daily, not hourly), the different periodicities between different climate variables and
soil temperatures imply that the best sliding window models of soil temperature would
need to include data from many different previous time steps. Furthermore, the fact that
the periodicity of different climate variables changed in opposite directions upon changing
the soil depth indicates that the sliding window would have to be different for models
predicting temperatures at different depths.
Compared with other artiﬁcial intelligence models, ANNs can better extract the hidden
features of big data. However, they are usually based on single data feature extraction
without accounting for the spatiotemporal patterns of the data, which leads to a decrease
in the prediction accuracy of soil temperature. In this regard, increasing the neural network
depth can improve the optimization rate and model expression such as in deep learning
(DL) models [41], which are discussed in the next section. A list of studies related to soil
temperature estimation by ANN models is given in Table 1.

2.2. Deep Learning
Traditional neural network models are incapable of processing big data and have
limited generalization ability and scalability. Moreover, their slow training process and
easy falling into local optima are other weaknesses of standard neural networks. There-
fore, ref. [42] developed deep learning (DL) models to deal with large multi-feature data
through a multiple hidden layer structure. Compared to traditional neural networks, DL
models, which are known as large-sized neural networks, as shown in Figure 2, have
strong computing power which can automatically extract high level features from low level
input data by intermediate layers with learning complex nonlinear functions in different
ﬁelds such as search engines and image recognition. Since soil has extremely complex and
nonlinear structural characteristics, DL models are more effective in analyzing soil particle
size and soil texture than traditional models [16,43]. In addition, these methods simulate
land-atmosphere interactions without complex knowledge governing physical models.
These models can efﬁciently process future data with a high computational speed and
integrate more data to improve prediction accuracy through additional learning. However,
an inappropriate sample size of the input data may cause overﬁtting, thereby decreasing
the prediction accuracy.
The most common DL models for environmental prediction include spatial models
(Convolutional Neural Networks, CNNs by [44]), temporal models (Long Short-Term
Memory networks, LSTMs by [45]) and spatial–temporal models (Convolutional LSTM,
ConvLSTM by [46]).
The CNN, as a classical data-driven DL model, provides a powerful feature extraction
tool to improve the predictive process by identifying the spatial features of data in multiple
arrays. However, the CNN model, with decreasing number of layers, performs poorly in
feature extraction. To address this issue, ref. [47] developed the residual network (ResNet)
by introducing the residual block to construct deep neural networks.
LSTM models, which are a type of recurrent neural networks (RNN), are applied
to deal with sequential data in order to predict the time series of target variables by
learning from past observations. Therefore, these models, which are able to simulate
nonlinear dynamic systems with minimal input data, retain the advantageous information
of long-term time series data across multiple time steps. Although RNN is well suited for
simulating time series data because it preserves the information of previous time steps
Sustainability 2023, 15, 7677
10 of 26
through internal self-looped cells, the problem of gradient disappearance occurring in the
long-range memory of the original RNN restricts its applicability in predicting targets.
To overcome this problem, ref. [45] used a gate mechanism to obtain information in an
RNN-based LSTM network model. However, LSTM neglects the learning of backward
features, which leads to the development of the Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network
model by combining backward and forward LSTMs.
easy falling into local optima are other weaknesses of standard neural networks. There-
fore, ref. [42] developed deep learning (DL) models to deal with large multi-feature data 
through a multiple hidden layer structure. Compared to traditional neural networks, DL 
models, which are known as large-sized neural networks, as shown in Figure 2, have 
strong computing power which can automatically extract high level features from low 
level input data by intermediate layers with learning complex nonlinear functions in dif-
ferent fields such as search engines and image recognition. Since soil has extremely com-
plex and nonlinear structural characteristics, DL models are more effective in analyzing 
soil particle size and soil texture than traditional models [16,43]. In addition, these meth-
ods simulate land-atmosphere interactions without complex knowledge governing phys-
ical models. These models can efficiently process future data with a high computational 
speed and integrate more data to improve prediction accuracy through additional learn-
ing. However, an inappropriate sample size of the input data may cause overfitting, 
thereby decreasing the prediction accuracy. 
 
Figure 2. Structure of the DL model. 
The most common DL models for environmental prediction include spatial models 
(Convolutional Neural Networks, CNNs by [44]), temporal models (Long Short-Term 
Memory networks, LSTMs by [45]) and spatial–temporal models (Convolutional LSTM, 
ConvLSTM by [46]). 
Figure 2. Structure of the DL model.
The CNN and LSTM models only capture spatial and temporal variations, while the
target variables have a correlation between space and time. This problem was solved via
the ConvLSTM model, which is a combination of the CNN and LSTM models. Unlike the
CNN and LSTM models, ConvLSTM using the output of the previous layer as the input for
the next layer is capable of extracting both temporal and spatial features by a convolution
layer at the same time without decreasing the map size.
Some researchers exploited CNN, LSTM, and ConvLSTM models to estimate and pre-
dict the soil temperature. For example, ref. [48] modeled soil temperature using persistence
forecast (PF), BPNN, LSTM, and CNN trained with data decomposed using ensemble em-
pirical mode decomposition (EEMD). They investigated three sites in Switzerland, at depths
between 5 and 30 cm. The EEMD-based models provided the best results, and no model
performance differences were noted between depths. Ref. [49] built on this work, focusing on
the proposed EEMD-Conv3d model and extending it to predict spatiotemporally distributed
soil temperature by air temperature data. The model showed the best performance among the
Conv (2d and 3d), ConvLSTM, EEMD-Conv2D, and EEMD-ConvLSTM models.
Ref. [50] predicted the soil temperature in Ottawa, Canada, at depths between 0 and 7 cm.
They used a wide variety of models and input variables in order to form a comprehensive view
on the best possible models for soil temperature prediction. Their modeling methods included
LRs, k-NNs, DT-based models, SVMs, stacking methods, MLP, DL, and ANFIS models. The
input variables were the air temperature, precipitation, surface pressure, evaporation, wind
speed, dew point temperature, solar radiation, and thermal radiation. The three best-performing
models were the DL model, MLP, and stacking model; the choice of the best model among the
three depended on the size of the dataset and the computational requirements. These three
models were used in a sensitivity analysis to determine the most relevant input parameters,
which were identified as air temperature and solar radiation.
Ref. [51] used 30 measurement stations across the US, representing different climates.
BiLSTM was used to model soil temperatures at these locations, which trains models with
data points from both previous and future time steps. BiLSTM outperformed the other
Sustainability 2023, 15, 7677
11 of 26
models at all but the shallowest depth, demonstrating that using climate variables and time
data together eliminate the decreased effectiveness of models at deep depths. The study
also explicitly shows the correlation of different climate variables with soil temperatures
at different depths, all of which decrease with increasing depth except for month and day.
This is in keeping with the result from ANNs that using current climate variables without
time data leads to less accurate models at greater depths.
Ref. [52] proposed an embedded network prediction model based on the gated recurrent
unit (GRU), a modified type of LSTM, to learn the features of the historical soil temperature
at local and global scales. By comparing the model with ANN, ELM, and LSTM, it was
concluded that the proposed model outperformed the other models in predicting multi-depth
soil temperature at different time points, including 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h.
Ref. [53] compared the performance of ML-based models, including the DL model
and RBNN, with conventional approaches for soil temperature interpolation in southeast
Canada. According to the results, the spline deterministic spatial interpolation method, even
with increasing the spline nonlinearity, failed to provide the spatial distribution for the soil
temperature and soil water content. On the other side, the ML models could capture the
spatial variability of soil temperature even in sharp transition areas. It should be noted that
deep learning, with a normalized RMSE of 9.0% and R2 of 89.2%, outperformed the RBNN. A
list of studies related to soil temperature estimation by DL models is given in Table 2.

2.3. Kernel Models
Kernel functions play a signiﬁcant role in machine learning because of their simplicity
and generality. Various kernel function embedded models were developed to capture
non-linear relationships among which the support vector machine (SVM) is a well-known
kernel model. This model was originally developed for classiﬁcation purposes in which a
classiﬁcation hyperplane is obtained by maximizing the margin between different classes
as shown in Equation (1) [54].
wx + b = 0
(1)
where w is a weighting vector, x is the independent input vector, and b indicates the bias.
To distinguish negative and positive samples, the hyperplane provides two dashed lines
w·x + b = −1 and w·x + b = 1 with a maximum distance of
2
∥w∥. The optimization function
is also expressed as follows:

min 1
2∥ w ∥2
yi(wxi + b) ≥ 1, i = 1, 2, . . . l
(2)
where y is the dependent output vector and l is the number of samples.
SVMs models, which are based on the statistical learning theory, can solve inverse
problems by past data to obtain variables of interest forward in time. To predict the variables
of interest, these models formulate quadratic optimization by structural risk minimization
(SRM) instead of empirical risk minimization (ERM), which is their outstanding charac-
teristic, to ensure a global optimum [55]. This ML-based approach, considered a sparse
method without being affected by dimensionality, utilizes the generation error bound and
intensive loss function, leading to precise predictions. Furthermore, SVMs can resist noises
and generalize concepts under limited data conditions [56]. However, kernel function
selection is a challenging stage of their learning process. In addition, the scale and speed of
the learning process can be other limiting factors of SVM, especially for real-time data.
SVM models, because of their high processing speed and the need for fewer training
data besides appropriate performance, recently gained attention for extracting geo-/bio-
physical parameters. For example, ref. [57] developed an SVM-based model comprising an
annual average soil temperature prediction model and a daily soil temperature amplitude
prediction model to retrieve the daily soil temperature. The annual average of humidity,
wind speed, radiation, soil, and air temperature are employed to train the annual average
soil temperature prediction model and the daily soil temperature amplitude prediction.

Despite the signiﬁcant role of soil temperature in meteorological, ecological, and hy-
drological processes, studies did not address soil temperature evaluation with ﬁne temporal
resolution in data-scarce regions. Furthermore, most studies employed air temperature
as an input training dataset to estimate soil temperature while a signiﬁcant correlation
was observed between soil temperature drop and soil moisture rise. To this end, ref. [58]
exploited the SVM model along with an extreme gradient boosting system (XGBoost),
RF, and MLP to predict the spatiotemporal variability of soil temperature in the Indian
Himalayan Region (IHR) by hourly and half-hourly time series data, including rainfall,
soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, vapor pressure deﬁcit,
and solar radiation. Different input data combinations were utilized to estimate the soil
temperature: Meteorological parameters, Meteorological parameters + rainfall, Meteorolog-
ical parameters + soil moisture, and Meteorological parameters + rainfall + soil moisture.
Among the models, XGBoost showed the best performance, followed by RF, MLP, and SVM.
Moreover, the addition of soil moisture, unlike rainfall, to meteorological data improved
the estimation accuracy signiﬁcantly.
In addition to classiﬁcation, SVM can be used for regression purposes, which is
known as support vector regression (SVR). The basis of SVR is the iterative process of the
sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm [59]. Similar to SVM, SVR, which can
capture nonlinear relationships between input and output variables, is used to estimate soil
temperature due to its robustness to noise and generalization ability under conditions with
limited reference samples [60]. Ref. [61] investigated soil temperature at depths from 10 to
100 cm at ﬁve different locations across Iran, ranging from hyper-arid to hyper-humid. SVR
models were built with and without an input corresponding to the month of the year, and
the models containing the month parameter were found to be more accurate, especially in
deeper layers. Furthermore, the results showed that SVR models were better in deep layers
than in shallow ones while MLR models could predict daily soil temperature at surface
layers with relatively good accuracy.
Ref. [62] assessed the accuracy of SVR and Elman neural network (ENN) as well as
SVR and ENN coupled with the ﬁreﬂy algorithm (SVR-FFA and ENN-FFA) and the krill
herd algorithm (SVR-KHA and ENN-KHA) in modeling soil temperature at depths of 5, 10,
20, 30, 50, and 100 cm. Various meteorological data combinations were evaluated under ﬁve
scenarios, which included (air temperature), (air temperature, sunshine), (air temperature,
sunshine, relative humidity), (air temperature, sunshine, relative humidity, wind speed),
and (air temperature, sunshine, relative humidity, wind speed, pressure deﬁcit). With the
best performance at 10 cm soil depth, all models showed a decrease in error from 5 to
10 cm and an increase from 10 to 100 cm. Additionally, optimization algorithms provided
relatively satisfactory results in modeling soil temperature, especially at lower depths.
Ref. [63] estimated the daily soil temperature at depths of 5, 10, 20, and 50 cm for
two stations with semiarid and humid climates in Turkey by Bayesian Tuned Support
Vector Regression (BT-SVR), Bayesian Tuned Gaussian Process Regression (BT-GPR), and
LSTM models. A variety of daily meteorological indicators, including cloudiness, air
temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and pressure, were used as input variables,
and soil temperature at different depths was the output variable. To increase the accuracy,
the study used a novel scheme based on the Bayesian optimization method to optimize the
parameters of kernel functions of the GPR and SVR models. A number of kernel functions
were used for GPR, such as constant, linear, polynomial, squared exponential, rational
quadratic, power, and Matern-3, as well as linear, polynomial, Gaussian, and sigmoid
functions for SVR. Among the models, the BT-GPR model exhibited the highest accuracy
for both stations at depth of 5 cm. Table 3 presents a list of studies carried out to model soil
temperature using kernel function embedded models.

2.4. Hybrid Models
Despite considerable progress achieved in dealing with dynamic, non-stationary, and
non-linear data by AI methods, the single models suffer from insufﬁcient accuracy in some
cases of environmental simulation. To overcome the limitations of any single method,
coupled prediction models were developed to improve the accuracy in both the prediction
and optimization stages by incorporating the superior features of individual models.
Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), which are a combination of ANN
and fuzzy logic, comprise an important category of hybrid models (Figure 3). These models
map input variables to output targets through an ensemble of membership functions and
if-then rules. Although ANFIS can predict target variable dynamics with limited input
requirements and acceptable prediction accuracy, the long-term generalization capability
of NN is restricted by the ad hoc nature of fuzzy logic rules. Moreover, additional pre-
processing requires extensive time and frequency domain computations. However, ANFIS
is one of the most popular models for simulating and predicting environmental compo-
nents such as soil temperature. Ref. [64] built several ANFIS models for soil temperature
prediction to explore different optimization schemes. Using only air temperature as an
input variable, the models predicted soil temperature at locations in North Dakota, U.S., at
10 cm depth. The optimization schemes were the PSO, SSA, grey wolf optimizer (GWO),
genetic algorithm (GA), dragonﬂy algorithm (DA), grasshopper optimization algorithm

(GOA), and a proposed hybrid SSA-GOA algorithm including a mutation phase (mSG). The
proposed optimization scheme resulted in a model with improved predictive power over
other ANFIS models, though the convergence time was longer than for most optimization
schemes except GOA.

fication layers (yellow), product and normalization layers (green). 
In addition to ANFIS, researchers developed other hybrid models by combining 
ANN, SVM, DL, etc. For example, two ML-based models, FFBPNN and GEP, a time-se-
ries-based model, fractionally autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA), and 
two hybrid models, FFBPNN-FARIMA and GEP-FARIMA, were used to estimate the 
daily soil temperature at depths of 5, 10, 50, and 100 cm [71]. To generalize the models to 
different climate classes, the stations were selected in arid, semi-arid, and very humid 
climates. At all depths, the ML-based models outperformed the time-series-based model, 
and the hybrid models were superior to classical models. 
In order to overcome the generalization issues of classical standalone models, opti-
mization algorithms, such as GA, GWO, and PSO were integrated into the models to de-
velop strong knowledge-based predictive systems. In this regard, some researchers ad-
dressed the lack of optimization algorithms by developing optimized AI techniques. Ref. 
[72] evaluated the performance of three hybrid models including SVM, MLP, and ANFIS 
boosted by the slime mold algorithm (SMA), PSO, and spotted-hyena optimizer (SHO) in 
forecasting daily soil temperature at 5, 15, and 30 cm in a semi-arid region of Punjab, India. 
Since the performance of ML models highly depends on the input variables, a gamma test 
(GT) was performed to determine the optimal input dataset for ML models, resulting in 
an optimal combination of relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and air temper-
ature. Among the models, SVM-SMA provided the best accuracy in predicting the soil 
temperature at depths of 5, 15, and 30 cm, respectively. To improve the ELM performance 
in estimating the daily soil temperature at depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 cm, ref. [73] 
used the SaE algorithm to optimize the parameters of ELM’s hidden node. The input var-
iables included the daily minimum, maximum, and average air temperatures because of 
their high correlations with soil temperature data at all depths. Despite the desirable be-
havior of both ELM and SaE-ELM against ANN and genetic programming (GP), the hy-
brid model showed slightly better performance with a lower mean absolute bias error 
(MABE) and a higher correlation coefficient (R). Ref. [74] employed a hybrid multi-layer 
perceptron algorithm integrated with the firefly optimizer algorithm (MLP-FFA) to pre-
dict soil temperature at multiple depths, including 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm, using soil 
depth, periodicity (or the respective month), atmospheric pressure, air temperature, and 
solar radiation as model predictors. They compared the results with MLP model and 
found MLP-FFA model had better performance than the standalone MLP model. Ref. [75] 
employed ENN, which is a type of dynamic recurrent neural network, in combination 
with the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) to im-
prove the estimation accuracy of daily soil temperature. The hybrid models, i.e., ENN-

cation layers (yellow), product and normalization layers (green).
Ref. [65] extended a historical record of 1827 days of soil temperature data from two
sites in Illinois, US, each with data at 10 and 20 cm depths. The data were extended using
MLP and ANFIS with and without PSO as well as auto-regressive moving average (ARMA).
To account for seasonal variation, some models were built using data preprocessed with
spectral analysis or wavelet decomposition to remove the seasonal periodic component.
The ARMA model combined with spectral analysis outperformed the AI techniques for
both depths.
Ref. [66] applied ANFIS, dynamic evolving neurofuzzy inference system (DENFIS),
WNN, and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) to predict land surface temper-
ature using NDVI, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference
bareness index (NDBaI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), urban index (UI), and
elevation. According to the results, ANFIS showed the best performance in training and
test periods with RMSE of 0.78 ◦C and 0.36 ◦C, respectively.
In [67], the performance of ANFIS model against a time-series-based model, i.e., bi-
linear model, was evaluated for daily soil temperature retrieval at different soil depths
(5, 10, 50, and 100 cm) by daily recorded soil temperature. Furthermore, two hybrid
models built by combining ANFIS with bi-linear and wavelet analyses were developed to
improve the retrieval accuracy of soil temperature. Based on the soil temperature results,
the ANFIS model demonstrated better performance than the bi-linear model as well as
the hybrid models were superior to classical models. In addition to local evaluation, an
external analysis was implemented to assess the performance of ANFIS in modeling soil
temperature at 5 and 50 cm depths by soil temperature data at 10 and 100 cm, respectively,
and vice versa, denoting the positive effect of soil temperature data at another depth in
retrieving soil temperature at target depth.
Ref. [68] evaluated the applicability of ANN, ANFIS, and GP in simulating monthly
soil temperature at different depths by using weather data at two stations in Turkey. The
climatic data used to model soil temperature were air temperature, relative humidity, solar
radiation, wind speed, and soil temperature at different depths (10, 20, and 100 cm). The
results illustrated the superior performance of GP in comparison with ANN and ANFIS
in estimating the soil temperature at 10, 50, and 100 cm. By including periodicity (month

of the year) as another input variable, considerable improvement was achieved in the
accuracy of the models.
Ref. [69] used ANN, CANFIS, WNN, and wavelet transformation combined with
CANFIS (WCANFIS) to retrieve soil temperatures at 5, 10, 20, 30, and 100 cm by air
temperature data. The results indicated the suitable performance of WCANFIS followed by
ANN, CANFIS, and WNN. In addition, the minimum and maximum errors were obtained
for the depth of 20 and 100 cm, respectively. Long-term soil temperature data are required
to model soil temperature, which restricts the prediction models in most situations due
to insufﬁcient stations recording soil temperature [35]. To address this gap, ref. [70] used
short-time soil temperature data recorded by thermal sensors along with air temperature,
environmental parameters, and soil properties to model soil temperature at 5 and 10 cm by
ANN, ANFIS, and MLR. The air temperature was found to be the most effective parameter
in soil temperature modeling. In addition, the best performance belonged to ANFIS,
followed by ANN and MLR, respectively.
In addition to ANFIS, researchers developed other hybrid models by combining ANN,
SVM, DL, etc. For example, two ML-based models, FFBPNN and GEP, a time-series-
based model, fractionally autoregressive integrated moving average (FARIMA), and two
hybrid models, FFBPNN-FARIMA and GEP-FARIMA, were used to estimate the daily soil
temperature at depths of 5, 10, 50, and 100 cm [71]. To generalize the models to different
climate classes, the stations were selected in arid, semi-arid, and very humid climates.
At all depths, the ML-based models outperformed the time-series-based model, and the
hybrid models were superior to classical models.
In order to overcome the generalization issues of classical standalone models, op-
timization algorithms, such as GA, GWO, and PSO were integrated into the models to
develop strong knowledge-based predictive systems. In this regard, some researchers
addressed the lack of optimization algorithms by developing optimized AI techniques.
Ref. [72] evaluated the performance of three hybrid models including SVM, MLP, and
ANFIS boosted by the slime mold algorithm (SMA), PSO, and spotted-hyena optimizer
(SHO) in forecasting daily soil temperature at 5, 15, and 30 cm in a semi-arid region of
Punjab, India. Since the performance of ML models highly depends on the input variables,
a gamma test (GT) was performed to determine the optimal input dataset for ML models,
resulting in an optimal combination of relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and
air temperature. Among the models, SVM-SMA provided the best accuracy in predicting
the soil temperature at depths of 5, 15, and 30 cm, respectively. To improve the ELM
performance in estimating the daily soil temperature at depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and
100 cm, ref. [73] used the SaE algorithm to optimize the parameters of ELM’s hidden node.
The input variables included the daily minimum, maximum, and average air temperatures
because of their high correlations with soil temperature data at all depths. Despite the
desirable behavior of both ELM and SaE-ELM against ANN and genetic programming
(GP), the hybrid model showed slightly better performance with a lower mean absolute
bias error (MABE) and a higher correlation coefﬁcient (R). Ref. [74] employed a hybrid
multi-layer perceptron algorithm integrated with the ﬁreﬂy optimizer algorithm (MLP-FFA)
to predict soil temperature at multiple depths, including 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm, using
soil depth, periodicity (or the respective month), atmospheric pressure, air temperature,
and solar radiation as model predictors. They compared the results with MLP model and
found MLP-FFA model had better performance than the standalone MLP model. Ref. [75]
employed ENN, which is a type of dynamic recurrent neural network, in combination with
the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and ant colony optimization (ACO) to improve
the estimation accuracy of daily soil temperature. The hybrid models, i.e., ENN-GSA and
ENN-ACO, exploited optimization algorithms to train the ENN’s parameters. The training
data were mean temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, dew point
temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, precipitation, sunshine, and soil temperature
at depths of 5, 10, 50, and 100 cm, which were used under different scenarios, including
temperature-based, other meteorological parameters-based, and combined-based scenarios.

Although hybrid models outperformed the classical ENN, the ENN-GSA was identiﬁed as
the best-performing model at all depths. In addition, the highest accuracy was achieved at
the full-input pattern for both standalone and hybrid models.
In spite of the fact that ANNs are suitable models for soil temperature prediction,
there are a number of problems related to their application, including the scaling problem,
the intensive computational effort, and the local minimum. To address these issues, Gill
and [76] developed an ANN-based model boosted by genetic algorithm to predict daily
soil temperature at depths of 5, 10, and 30 cm by air temperature and rainfall as well as
past soil temperature data. The results showed that the developed model was successful
in predicting soil temperature. Table 4 presents a list of studies conducted to estimate soil
temperature using hybrid models.

3. Input Dataset
Three general categories of input variables are used to train ML-based models, includ-
ing climate data, time series of soil temperature, and a combination of soil temperature
time series and climatic data. Climate variables applied to ML models are relative humidity
(average, maximum, and minimum), solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature (average,
maximum, and minimum), vapor pressure deﬁcit, sunshine hours, precipitation, dew point
temperature, potential evapotranspiration, evaporation, atmospheric pressure, and cloudi-
ness. According to the studies, air temperature was identiﬁed as the most effective variable
in predicting soil temperature [20,28,31,50,70,73]. The importance of climate variables such
as solar radiation, relative humidity, precipitation, and soil moisture is disputed between
different studies; this may be because the effect of moisture on soil temperature varies with
the soil depth and the type of climate. However, most studies demonstrated that both
relative humidity and solar radiation are more effective than other variables [28,31,40,50].
Moreover, [58] showed a signiﬁcant correlation between soil temperature and soil moisture
than soil temperature and precipitation.
The models using climate parameters are less effective at greater depths, where above-
ground climate has a decreased impact and the effect of previous temperatures is corre-
spondingly increased. It can be due to the relationships between climate parameters and
soil temperature change with the soil depth. Therefore, the inclusion of periodicity (number
of days, months, and years) as another input variable led to a considerable improvement
in estimation accuracy, especially at deeper soil depths [20,61,68]. In addition, combining
current climate conditions with temporal information is recommended for the best results
for deep soil temperature predictions [24,51].

4. Conclusions and Future Outlook
Soil temperature is a key factor affecting the physical, chemical, and biological prop-
erties of soil. In addition to meteorological variables, soil temperature depends on to-
pographic conditions and soil characteristics. The complex interactions between these
variables make the estimation of soil temperature challenging.
Direct measurement of soil temperature by instruments such as thermistors, thermo-
couples, and thermocouple wires on a large spatial scale is impractical because it is an
expensive and time-consuming process. Therefore, soil temperature is mainly estimated
using physically and statistically based models with a tradeoff between resolution, accuracy,
and computational efﬁciency.
Physically based models, despite their wide use in soil temperature estimation, are
complex with intense data requirement. On the other hand, the empirical approach is
a simple method that requires less input data; however, the statistical regression-based
relationship between input and output is site dependent. The limitations of the above
methods led to the development of data-driven ML techniques, such as ANN, DL, and
SVM, to estimate the soil temperature at multiple depths.
ANNs, as the most widely used data-driven models, are capable of capturing nonlinear
data trends but these models are used to extract single data features without learning
spatiotemporal patterns. DL techniques can address this issue by increasing the depth
of neural networks. However, the prediction accuracy may decrease as a result of an
inadequate sample size of the input data. Although the use of kernel function embedded
models such as SVMs ensures a global optimum, the selection of kernel functions restricts
their application. These traditional ML models have some drawbacks, including ANN’s
low generalization performance, ANFIS’s need for accurate weighting of the membership
function, ELM’s large training datasets requirement, and SVM’s high sensitivity to hyper-
parameter selection, which limit their applications.
The best ML technique for soil temperature retrieval generally depends on training
datasets, model structure, and target level of accuracy. Based on studies carried out
to estimate soil temperature, DL models, such as BiLSTM and LSTM, showed better
performance than other models. After that, ANFIS exhibited the best performance followed
by SVM, WNN, ELN, and ANN. On the other hand, most studies found that hybrid
models, which are mostly standalone models boosted by optimization algorithms, were
superior to classical models. In addition to hybrid models with optimization schemes,
a new generation of standalone AI-based models has the potential to offer promising
alternatives to traditional models because of their ﬂexibility.
In addition, combining current climate conditions with time information is necessary
for the best results, especially for deep soil temperature predictions. In this regard, im-
proving both machine learning and statistical methods to account for periodicity increases
the accuracy of the soil temperature prediction. If modeling for deeper soil depths can
be brought up to the standard currently achieved by models for shallow depths, it may
be possible to reduce the number of climate variables needed as input. This can simplify
the process of soil temperature prediction and make the models more generalizable to
different climates. For this purpose, there are several approaches. The simplest approach
is to add the month to the set of input climate variables. This method should be easy to
implement for any model using the current climate conditions for prediction. It relies
on seasons being relatively consistent in terms of temperature and timing from year to
year. Another approach is the sliding window approach, which uses climate variables
from previous time steps as the additional input variables. The current conditions are,
thus, situated in a broader context in time without any assumptions about the season. The
sliding window approach relies on choosing a window that is appropriate for the lag time
between climate conditions and their effect on soil temperatures. In complex models, lag
times between climate variables and soil temperatures may not be the same, nor may lag
times between a variable and soil temperatures at different depths. Future studies should
address these issues. Moreover, remote sensing observations of soil properties such as

moisture content and vegetation cover can be combined with machine learning models
as a future perspective to achieve more accurate soil temperature estimation. In addition,
the transferability of models over different regions and climates can be more explored to
determine the effective factors on the model’s performance in soil temperature retrieval
across various soil types and climates.

Abstract: Cognitive radio wireless sensor networks (CR-WSNs) are a type of WSNs that use cognitive
radio technology to enhance the spectrum utilization and energy efﬁciency. This paper proposes an
energy-efﬁcient resource allocation algorithm (EERAA) to prolong the lifetime of a WSN-based smart

considering power and interference constraints in realistic scenarios. The obtained results reveal that
the proposed algorithm attempts to maximize the averaged capacity of the CR-WSN subject to the
total power constraint and tolerable interference. Numerically, the proposed algorithm can reduce
the network energy consumption by up to 30%, compared with conventional approaches, while

1. Introduction
Smart irrigation is a transformative approach that leverages advanced technologies to
optimize water usage in agricultural practices. With the increasing global demand for food
production and the growing scarcity of water resources, efﬁcient irrigation techniques are
crucial for sustainable agriculture. Smart irrigation systems integrate various components,
such as sensors, actuators, and data analytics, to enable precise monitoring and control of
irrigation processes. These systems utilize a network of sensors to collect real-time data
on environmental factors, soil moisture levels, and plant conditions [1]. The collected data
are then analyzed and processed using sophisticated algorithms to determine the optimal
amount and timing of water application. By considering factors such as weather conditions,
crop requirements, and soil characteristics, smart irrigation systems can provide precise
and targeted irrigation, minimizing water waste and maximizing crop yield [2,3].
One key advantage of smart irrigation is its ability to enable remote monitoring and
control. Farmers can access the system through web-based platforms or mobile applications,
allowing them to monitor ﬁeld conditions and adjust irrigation schedules from anywhere
at any time. This remote accessibility enhances operational efﬁciency and reduces the need
for manual labor, saving time and resources. Moreover, smart irrigation systems can be
integrated with weather forecasting systems to further enhance their effectiveness. By
incorporating real-time weather data, these systems can adapt irrigation schedules based
on predicted rainfall or temperature changes, ensuring optimal water usage and reducing
reliance on manual adjustments. The beneﬁts of smart irrigation extend beyond water
conservation and crop productivity. By minimizing water usage, farmers can reduce their

overall operational costs, improve energy efﬁciency, and mitigate environmental impacts,
such as water pollution and soil erosion [1].
A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a network of many low-cost and power-limited
sensors that are distributed in an area to monitor and collect data about the physical or
environmental conditions. The sensors are outﬁtted with a diverse array of monitoring
capabilities, including temperature, humidity, pressure, light, sound, and motion. They
establish wireless communication among themselves to establish a network. The collected
data can then be processed, analyzed, and transmitted to a central control unit or a remote
server for further processing and storage. The primary advantage of WSNs is their ability
to provide a real-time, continuous, and ﬁne-grained monitoring of the physical world,
which can be used in many applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart cities,
healthcare, industrial automation, and precision agriculture [4–7]. However, the design
and deployment of WSNs pose several challenges, such as limited power, bandwidth,
processing capabilities, communication and network management issues, security and
privacy concerns, and the need for robust and energy-efﬁcient algorithms and protocols.
Nevertheless, the widespread use of WSNs is expected to grow in the future as the Internet
of Things (IoT) continues to expand, providing new opportunities for innovation and
improving the quality of life. Recently, several studies related to these challenges have been
conducted [7,8].
Cognitive radio wireless sensor networks (CR-WSNs) are a type of WSNs that use
CR technology to enhance the spectrum utilization and power conservation [9–11]. In
CR-WSNs, the sensor nodes are equipped with cognitive radios that can sense the radio
frequency (RF) spectrum and adapt the transmission parameters to avoid interference and
optimize energy consumption. This allows CR-WSNs to operate in a dynamic and hetero-
geneous RF environment, where different types of wireless devices coexist and compete for
limited spectrum resources. By using cognitive radio technology, CR-WSNs can achieve
higher spectrum efﬁciency, better reliability, and longer network lifetime compared with
traditional WSNs. CR-WSNs have various applications, such as environmental monitor-
ing, smart irrigation, industrial control, healthcare, and smart cities, where reliable and
energy-efﬁcient wireless communication is critical [12–14]. In practical scenarios of CR
networks, the estimation algorithm design can be affected by channel sensing uncertainty
resulting from false alarms and misdetections. As a result, it is of interest to identify how
estimation algorithm quality is affected by channel sensing errors. As such, this paper aims
to investigate the impact of imperfect sensing on the performance of CR-WSNs.
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) [15] is widely regarded as a top
contender for the physical layer of CR systems due to its ﬂexible, reconﬁgurable subcarrier
structure that enables easy adaptation and adjustment of system parameters. OFDM
is also capable of avoiding interference through the addition of the cyclic preﬁx, and it
offers large bandwidth efﬁciency through orthogonality, resilience to frequency-selective
fading channels, and simpliﬁed equalizer design. However, OFDM is very sensitive to
timing discrepancies due to synchronization error. The shortage of OFDM comes from
high side lobes in ﬁlters’ frequency response, which, in turn, lead to high interference
between subcarriers, which is a major source that declines the performance of wireless
communication systems [16–18]. In the current literature, optimizing the radio resources
under power and interference constraints in the CR system remains an area of ongoing
research. This paper seeks to enhance the SU’s average capacity with the consideration
of quality of service (QoS) of the primary users (PUs). Hence, it is necessary to consider
the interference produced by side lobes between primary users and secondary users.
Additionally, the transmit power of each SU subcarrier can be adapted with the best
possible resource allocation algorithm in order to not affect the PU while transmitting
information. Unfortunately, there are few studies that have focused on this problem.
Therefore, in this paper, the trade-off of increasing transmission capacity while maintaining
an acceptable interference will be investigated.

Resource allocation is a critical process that involves distributing resources, such as
time, energy, bandwidth, and computational power, among competing demands. Efﬁcient
resource allocation is essential in various ﬁelds, including communication systems, trans-
portation networks, manufacturing processes, and energy management [12,13]. Concerning
WSNs, resource allocation is especially crucial since the resources available are typically
limited, and the sensors’ energy consumption must be optimized to prolong the network’s
lifespan. Proper resource allocation can lead to several beneﬁts, such as improved system
performance, reduced energy consumption, increased reliability, and enhanced scalability.
Furthermore, resource allocation can help to ensure that critical tasks receive adequate
resources, prevent network congestion, and reduce the risk of system failure. In summary,
resource allocation is vital for optimizing the use of resources, achieving efﬁcient operations,
and achieving the desired system performance in various applications [19,20].
The resource allocation algorithm will take place after the SUs are allocated to the
detected spectrum opportunities. Based on convex optimization techniques, we derive the
resource allocation algorithm for the SU to achieve the highest capacity considering the
interference constraint, along with the peak/average transmit power constraint of the SU.
In summary, this work introduces the following contributions:
(1)
We present a practical scenario for CR-WSNs; then we investigate how imperfect
channel sensing impacts the performance of CR-WSN-based systems.
(2)
We propose a resource allocation algorithm that aims to enhance the SU average
capacity while ensuring that the interference level at the PU is below an acceptable
level considering power constraint and ICI constraint.
(3)
To solve the above nonconvex optimization problem, the proposed algorithm is
presented to search for the optimal transmit power of the SU.

2. Related Work
In [12], the authors presented a resource allocation scheme that utilizes a Stackelberg
game approach to optimize the SUs’ throughput while satisfying the PU’s interference
constraint in a multiuser CR network. The authors in [13] proposed a resource allocation
scheme for CR-WSNs that incorporates energy harvesting capabilities. The authors consider
a CR-WSN with a single CR node and multiple energy harvesting nodes, and they express
the resource allocation formula as an optimization problem that maximizes the network
throughput subject to energy neutrality constraints for the energy harvesting nodes and
interference constraints for the PUs. In [21], the authors proposed an effective resource
allocation technique, namely, the Improved Pliable Cognitive Medium Access Protocol,
designed to address the challenges of multilevel heterogeneity in CR-WSN.
In [22], a computationally efﬁcient resource allocation algorithm in a multi-carrier-
based CR network is presented to maximize the system capacity. The assumption made
in this work is to neglect the interference from PU to SU. The authors in [23] proposed a
trajectory design and resource allocation scheme to maximize the achievable rate of an
SU in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) CR system. They optimized the UAV trajectory,
transmit power to satisfy practical constraints, and an interference temperature threshold.
The work in [24] focuses on the achievable rate analysis and resource allocation of the
cognitive low earth orbit (LEO) satellite system. Speciﬁcally, a joint power allocation scheme
was proposed to maximize the sum rate of the IoT transmission subject to performance
requirements and constraints of the legacy satellite system. The quasi-concave nature of
the sum rate of the IoT users over the satellite terminal receive power was proved, which
allows for optimal receive powers to be derived.
An energy-efﬁcient resource allocation approach in secure CR networks was presented
in [25]. The paper introduces an ergodic secure energy efﬁciency problem for a CR network
with a PU, an SU, and an eavesdropper, and presents a convex optimization problem for
power allocation using fractional programming and dual decomposition techniques. The
proposed approach aims to maximize the ergodic secure energy efﬁciency of the SU with
constraints on the average interference power and average transmit power.
In [26], the authors propose a resource allocation algorithm to improve the sum rate
considering power and interference constraints using a Rayleigh fading channel. However,
the scenario where the SUs communicate while facing channel sensing uncertainty has not
been considered in any of these works. Therefore, we propose an energy-efﬁcient resource
allocation algorithm (EERAA) to enhance the average capacity and prolong the lifetime of
a WSN-based smart irrigation system under realistic scenarios. In the proposed algorithm,
power allocation and subcarrier assignment are performed sequentially.
Our approach differs from that in [26] by considering the capacity reduction on all
subcarriers occupied by a PU, rather than just on the ﬁrst adjacent subcarrier to the SU.
Furthermore, we employ a coarse approximation of the channel’s gain for the SU. The
obtained results illustrate that the average capacity of SUs is close to that of the perfect
channel knowledge scenario.
3. CR-WSN System Model
A WSN-based smart irrigation system is a modern and innovative solution for ef-
ﬁcient and sustainable agriculture. The system comprises a network of sensors that are
deployed in the soil, plants, and environment to monitor and collect data related to soil
moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and other relevant parameters. These data are
then transmitted wirelessly to a central control unit that processes the data and triggers the
irrigation system based on predeﬁned thresholds and algorithms. The WSN-based smart
irrigation system enables farmers to optimize water usage, increase crop yields, reduce
water wastage, and lower energy costs. Additionally, it is easily expandable and can be
adapted to achieve the speciﬁc requirements of various crops and farming practices. With
the rise of climate change and water scarcity issues, WSN-based smart irrigation systems
are becoming increasingly popular and essential for modern agriculture.

The CR-WSN-based smart irrigation system model is illustrated in Figure 1 with an N
cluster each with one cluster head (CH) and many sensor nodes spread over an area with
size A. The transmission between the sensor nodes and the CH within the cluster is carried
out using the unlicensed spectrum, while the transmission between the CH and the sink
node takes place opportunistically through the licensed spectrum. The licensed spectrum
that is being targeted includes M radio channels that exhibit varying PU communications
and signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) [27].

Channel Sensing 
The first step involves using CH nodes (i.e., SUs) to sense the transmission channel, 
to decide whether it is currently available or busy by a PU. Energy detection methods are 
commonly used for this purpose, especially when the transmission modes of PUs are un-
known. Assuming that 𝑦௟ represents the PU’s signal at a specific location, and 𝑛௟ repre-
sents Gaussian white noise with a mean of zero and a variance of 𝜎௡
ଶ for all 𝑙, the CH’s 
measurement can be denoted as 𝐸௟. For each CH, a spectrum sensing function is defined

Channel Sensing
The ﬁrst step involves using CH nodes (i.e., SUs) to sense the transmission channel,
to decide whether it is currently available or busy by a PU. Energy detection methods
are commonly used for this purpose, especially when the transmission modes of PUs
are unknown. Assuming that yl represents the PU’s signal at a speciﬁc location, and nl
represents Gaussian white noise with a mean of zero and a variance of σ2
n for all l, the
CH’s measurement can be denoted as El. For each CH, a spectrum sensing function is
deﬁned by establishing two hypotheses according to the measurement. In this mathematical
expression, the hypothesis checking for the channel sensing problem is performed over M
symbol periods and can be expressed as follows [9]:
H0 : El = nl
l = 1, 2, 3 . . . ..M
(1)
H1 : El = yl + nl
l = 1, 2, 3 . . . ..M
(2)
Agriculture 2023, 13, 1149

In Equation (1), H0 means that the PU signal is absent, while in Equation (2), H1 means
that the PU is present and using the channel. The M received signal sample points are
gathered by cognitive nodes (CH), allowing for the detection statistics for energy detection
to be expressed in the following manner:
E = 1
M

∑
l=1

(3)
If we assume that |El|2 with l = 1, . . . .., M is composed of independently and identi-
cally distributed random variables, to verify the mean E for large values of M, we can use
the central limit theorem. This is demonstrated in [26] as:
E{Z} =
σ2
n,

σ2
s + σ2

(4)
where σ2
s represents the PU’s signal variance. It should be emphasized that the reliability
of spectrum sensing is evaluated using two metrics: the ﬁrst metric is the probability of
detection Pd, which refers to the probability of an SU detecting the presence of a PU when
the spectrum is actually used by the PU. The second metric is the false alarm probability
Pf , which represents the probability of an SU detecting the presence of a PU when the
channel is free [9]. For instance, if H0 is the true hypothesis, then P
 ˆH1
H0
	
indicates the
probability of a false alarm.
4. The Proposed Resource Allocation
Concerning CR-WSNs, our attention is directed to both energy consumption and SU
average capacity, which depends on its resource allocation scenario done by CH nodes.
This paper proposes a resource allocation algorithm that maximizes the average capacity,
taking into account both power constraint and interference constraint [28]. Therefore, the
energy consumption and ICI optimization are strongly interconnected with each other in
this case, making it difﬁcult to solve it in general. To solve this issue, the successive convex
optimization technique presented in [29] is applied.
We consider CR-WSNs with spectrum sharing between PUs and SUs as illustrated
in Figure 2, with the allocation of the PU (labelled “1”) and spectrum holes (denoted by
“0”) with cluster number Nc = 48 and FU = 18 subcarriers in each hole. We have utilized
the unambiguous interference formulas of OFDM, which previously obtained in [30] and
selected the cluster number and size based on the realistic values of WiMAX 802.16.
 
by establishing two hypotheses according to the measurement. In this mathematical ex-
pression, the hypothesis checking for the channel sensing problem is performed over M 
symbol periods and can be expressed as follows [9]: 
𝐻଴: 𝐸௟ = 𝑛௟      𝑙 = 1, 2, 3 … . . 𝑀 
(1)
𝐻ଵ: 𝐸௟ = 𝑦௟ + 𝑛௟      𝑙 = 1, 2, 3 … . . 𝑀 
(2)
In Equation (1), 𝐻଴ means that the PU signal is absent, while in Equation (2), 𝐻ଵ 
means that the PU is present and using the channel. The M received signal sample points 
are gathered by cognitive nodes (CH), allowing for the detection statistics for energy de-
tection to be expressed in the following manner: 
𝐸 = 1
𝑀 ෍|𝑧௟|ଶ  
ெ
௟ୀଵ
 
(3)
If we assume that |𝐸௟|ଶ with 𝑙 =  1, … . . , 𝑀 is composed of independently and iden-
tically distributed random variables, to verify the mean E for large values of M, we can 
use the central limit theorem. This is demonstrated in [26] as: 
𝔼{𝑍} = ൜ 𝜎௡
ଶ ,                     𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 𝐻଴
𝜎௦
ଶ + 𝜎௡
ଶ,               𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟 𝐻ଵ     
(4)
where  𝜎௦
ଶ represents the PU’s signal variance. It should be emphasized that the reliability 
of spectrum sensing is evaluated using two metrics: the first metric is the probability of 
detection 𝑃ௗ, which refers to the probability of an SU detecting the presence of a PU when 
the spectrum is actually used by the PU. The second metric is the false alarm probability 
𝑃௙, which represents the probability of an SU detecting the presence of a PU when the 
channel is free [9]. For instance, if 𝐻଴ is the true hypothesis, then P{ 𝐻ଵ
෢ |𝐻଴} indicates the 
probability of a false alarm. 
4. The Proposed Resource Allocation 
Concerning CR-WSNs, our attention is directed to both energy consumption and SU 
average capacity, which depends on its resource allocation scenario done by CH nodes. 
This paper proposes a resource allocation algorithm that maximizes the average capacity, 
taking into account both power constraint and interference constraint [28]. Therefore, the 
energy consumption and ICI optimization are strongly interconnected with each other in 
this case, making it difficult to solve it in general. To solve this issue, the successive convex 
optimization technique presented in [29] is applied. 
We consider CR-WSNs with spectrum sharing between PUs and SUs as illustrated in 
Figure 2, with the allocation of the PU (labelled “1”) and spectrum holes (denoted by “0”) 
with cluster number 𝑁௖ = 48 and 𝐹௎ = 18 subcarriers in each hole. We have utilized the 
unambiguous interference formulas of OFDM, which previously obtained in [30] and se-
lected the cluster number and size based on the realistic values of WiMAX 802.16.

to each free sub-band. 
Figure 2. Allocation of primary users and available subcarriers considering 18 subcarriers allocated
to each free sub-band.
One or more interferences can exist within a single spectrum hole, as illustrated in
Figure 2, where PUs and SUs utilize neighboring frequency bands. We assume that the
ICI exists from the PU to the CH due to frequency offset. Based on the OFDM ICI tables
obtained in [31], it was observed that “8” subcarriers (OFDM) induce the ICI to the channel.
In cases where a sequence of intricate symbols is transmitted, the interference caused by

a single subcarrier is the total of interference across all the time slots. For the subsequent
analysis, we deﬁne the eight-element interference vectors of OFDM as designed in [32].

of primary users’ presence is 0.25, i.e., P{H 1} = 0.25 and P{H 0} = 0.75. The EERAA
algorithm is validated through Monte Carlo simulations over a frequency selective Rayleigh
fading channel between the secondary transmitter and receiver. The simulations consider
256 subcarriers and QPSK modulation.
Figure 3 presents the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed EERAA algo-
rithm versus Eb/N0 compared with the scenario of no sensing errors. The perfect estimation
has the same performance as the case with no sensing errors, which indicate the validation
of the proposed algorithm. The simulation also considers different levels of sensing errors.
The results indicate that the BER performance degrades as the sensing errors increase.
When the probability of detection Pd drops from 1 to 0, the BER performance is affected.

5. Simulation Results and Discussion  
The following section illustrates the obtained results that assess the performance of 
the EERAA algorithm in the presence of imperfect channel sensing. The probability of 
primary users’ presence is 0.25, i.e., P{𝐻ଵ } = 0.25 and P{𝐻଴ } = 0.75. The EERAA algo-
rithm is validated through Monte Carlo simulations over a frequency selective Rayleigh 
fading channel between the secondary transmitter and receiver. The simulations consider 
256 subcarriers and QPSK modulation. 
Figure 3 presents the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed EERAA algo-
rithm versus 𝐸௕/𝑁଴ compared with the scenario of no sensing errors. The perfect estimation 
has the same performance as the case with no sensing errors, which indicate the validation 
of the proposed algorithm. The simulation also considers different levels of sensing errors. 
The results indicate that the BER performance degrades as the sensing errors increase. When 
the probability of detection 𝑃ௗ drops from 1 to 0, the BER performance is affected.

The following Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the performance evaluation of the proposed
resource allocation algorithm based on the average spectral efﬁciency. Figure 5 depicts
the scenario where an SU, utilizing F available subcarriers, is surrounded by subcarriers
allocated to the PU, causing interference from both sides. In this case, the SU’s spectral
efﬁciency values show an improvement compared with the initial allocation. The power
allocation algorithm attempts to avoid subcarriers adjacent to the PU, leading to the
localization of power allocation in the middle of the spectrum hole.

6. Conclusions 
This paper presented an EERAA algorithm for CR-WSN-based smart irrigation sys-
tems. The proposed algorithm addresses the challenge of prolonging the WSN’s lifetime 
by reducing energy consumption while achieving high secondary users’ average capacity. 
The algorithm performs power allocation and subcarrier assignment sequentially and 
considers the effect of ICI. We formulated the maximization of system capacity under re-
alistic scenarios with power and interference constraints. Simulation results indicate that 
the proposed EERAA algorithm outperforms the conventional approaches by reducing 
network energy consumption by up to 30% while maintaining high average capacity. The 
numerical analysis and simulation results confirm that EERAA can prolong the lifetime 
of WSN-based smart irrigation systems and enhance their energy efficiency. 
In conclusion, the proposed EERAA algorithm can effectively address the energy ef-
ficiency and spectrum utilization challenges in CR-WSN-based smart irrigation systems. 
This research provides a valuable contribution towards achieving sustainable agricultural 
practices by developing efficient resource allocation algorithms for smart irrigation systems.  
Future research can explore the implementation of the proposed algorithm in real-
world scenarios and evaluate its performance in various wireless communication appli-
cations. Future research directions can further investigate the integration of advanced ma-
chine learning techniques into the proposed EERAA algorithm for CR-WSN-based smart

  Main Objective: The main objective of the study is to investigate the potential of machine learning and deep learning models in forecasting irrigation water requirements (IWR) of snap beans and to develop multi-scenarios of the input variables (combinations) to study the impact of meteorological, crop and soil parameters on IWR.
  Study Location: Not explicitly stated, but the research was conducted in an arid region.
  Data Sources: Climate, soil and crop data
  Technologies Used: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), SVR (Support Vector Regression), RF (Random Forest), DNN (Deep Neural Network)
  Key Findings: The proposed hybrid LSTM-CNN model outperforms other machine learning models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in forecasting IWR. The best performing scenario for the model includes maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, fraction of surface wetted, and exposed and soil wetted fraction as input parameters.
  Extract 1: "In addition to what machine learning programs provide an estimate of ETo values for the previous and current agricultural seasons, it gives the possibility to predict the ETo values for the upcoming seasons using the so-called deep learning models, which are restricted to knowing the expected changes in temperature and the amount of precipitation related to global warming, from which it can be make good planning and management of irrigation water for the coming years with an attempt to correct the existing strategies to avoid the negative effects of global warming (Ferreira and da Cunha 2020a, b)."
  Extract 2: To the best of authors’ knowledge, the applied approaches are applying for first time for forecasting of IWR, further, no research has been published in the literature that analyses irrigation water requirement using a combination of climate data, soil data and crop data based novel artificial intelligence approaches applied. Thus, to overcome the gap in literature dealing with the importance of IWR prediction, the main objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate the potential of machine and deep learning models in forecasting IWR of snap beans, 2) develop multi-scenarios of the inputs variables (combinations) to study the impact of meteorological, crop and soil parameters on IWR and, 3) figure out the best scenario with best model performance in IWR prediction.
  Limitations: The paper does not explicitly mention any limitations, but some potential limitations include:

* The model is trained and evaluated using data from a specific region, and its performance may not generalize well to other regions with different climatic conditions or soil types.
* The model requires a significant amount of data for training, which may not be available in all cases.
* The model may be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and it is important to tune the hyperparameters carefully to achieve optimal performance.
  Relevance Evaluation: Highly relevant - The paper addresses the specific point of autonomous planning and scheduling of variable rate irrigation (VRI) using machine learning and optimization techniques, which is within the scope of the literature review section on "Data Collection to Cloud: Automation and Real-Time Processing:". The paper contributes by proposing a hybrid deep learning model that combines LSTM and CNN algorithms to forecast irrigation water requirements (IWR).

The paper is also relevant to the overall theme of the literature review, which is to explore the use of automated systems for real-time irrigation management. The proposed model can help to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation scheduling, which can lead to water savings and increased crop yields.

Abstract
Water scarcity is the most obstacle faced by irrigation water requirements, likewise, lim-
ited available meteorological data to calculate reference evapotranspiration. Consequently, 
the focal aims of the investigation are to assess the potential of machine learning mod-
els in forecasting irrigation water requirements (IWR) of snap beans by evolving multi-
scenarios of inputs parameters to figure out the impact of meteorological, crop, and soil 
parameters on IWR. Six models were applied, support vector regressor (SVR), random for-
est (RF), deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-
term memory (LSTM), and Hybrid CNN-LSTM. Ten variables including maximum and 
minimum temperature, Relative humidity, wind speed, precipitation, root depth, basal crop 
coefficient, soil evaporation, a fraction of surface wetted and, exposed and soil wetted frac-
tion were used as the input data for models with their combination, 8 input scenarios were 
designed. Overall models, the best scenario was scenario 4 (relative humidity, wind speed, 
basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation), however, the best scenario for DNN and RF model 
was scenario 7 (root depth, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, fraction of surface wet-
ted, exposed and soil wetted fraction). While the weakest one was the group of climatic 
factors in scenario 6 (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, 
wind speed, and precipitation). Among the models, the hybrid LTSM & CNN was the 
most accurate and the SVR model had the lowest estimation accuracy. The outcomes of 
this research work could set up a modeling strategy that would set in motion the improve-
ment of efforts to identify the shortages in IWR forecasting, which sequentially may sup-
port alleviation strategies such as policies for sustainable water use and water resources 
management. The current approach was promising and has research value for other similar 
regions.

1 Introduction
The widespread climatic changes in the twenty-first century and the negative impacts that 
follow on the available water resources have become one of the most important issues that 
cast their shadows on the focus of contemporary environmental events and issues (Smith 
et al. 2012; UNEP 1999). The irrigated agriculture sector represents the largest consumer 
of water in Egypt, representing 85% of the total water share available to Egypt, which rep-
resents 55.5 billion cubic meters. In addition, the biggest problem is that most of the irri-
gated lands apply surface irrigation systems where the efficiency of application and dis-
tribution of water do not exceed 50%, which represents the biggest challenge that must be 
faced to reduce water losses (Monem 2021). Irrigated agriculture covers about 25% of the 
cultivated area in the world, yet it contributes 50% of the global food basket. Despite the 
increase in production with irrigated agriculture, it consumes 67% of the water in agricul-
tural production and 87% of the water is consumed in the irrigation sector (Smith et al. 
2012; Shiklomanov 1997). The availability of food is the main element for the survival of 
the human race, although it faces many challenges, the main cause of which is humans, 
perhaps the most prominent of which are the rapid population growth and climatic changes 
resulting from global warming that affect the hydrological cycle (Bellido-Jiménez et al. 
2021). Therefore, irrigation scheduling, which is determining the amount of irrigation 
water added and the time of its addition during the growing season of the crop, is one of 
the things that must be taken into account under conditions of water scarcity (Kalboussi 
et al. 2019).
There are many methods used for irrigation scheduling, including visual and thermal 
monitoring, soil moisture content measuring devices, rainfall estimation devices, and refer-
ence evapotranspiration estimation, from which it is possible to estimate the crop evapo-
transpiration by knowing the crop coefficient, through available climatic data on local basis 
or through commercial scheduling programs available through the international informa-
tion network (Zhang et al. 2013). The actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) is considered 
one of the main criteria for estimating the amount of water consumed by the crop, and 
thus greatly affects the hydrological, environmental and agricultural management, and then 
the ETa is one of the basic elements when designing and managing irrigation networks in 
the agricultural project. ETa is estimated through field measurements using lysimeters or 
through empirical equations by estimating the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and the 
crop coefficient (Djaman et al. 2018). The water balance method for irrigation schedul-
ing includes estimating of the crop water consumption during the growing season, which 
includes the amount of water added, whether through irrigation, precipitation and capil-
lary rise, which subtracts the amount of water losses, whether by evaporation from the soil 
surface, deep percolation the rootzone area, and runoff (Andales et al. 2014; Karam et al. 
2019a, b).
The estimation of ETo is one of the most important indicators used in irrigation water 
management and hydrological studies, and despite the difficult requirements of the empiri-
cal equations of ETo, it gives accurate values in addition to its validity on various climatic 
conditions, which are the main indicators in the empirical equations (Ferreira and da Cunha 
2020a, b; Pereira et al. 2015a, b). In light of the limited climatic parameters available for 
estimating ETo, fast and accurate methods that require least number of meteorological indi-
cators are considered among the most important requirements for irrigation water schedul-
ing (Fan et al. 2021). The Penman–Monteith equation is the standard equation for calculat-
ing ETo and is recommended by the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization.

The Penman Monteith equation requires many daily meteorological parameters to calculate 
such as maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, net solar radiation, and rela-
tive humidity. However, under the conditions of limited climatic parameters available in 
the study area, which requires the availability of methods that require less climatic data, 
while maintaining the accuracy of the calculated values of ETo in the same range to a large 
extent (Fan et al. 2019). The application of the Penman Monteith equation faces many dif-
ficulties, especially in developing countries, which face many challenges represented in the 
limited monitoring stations and their lack of regular distribution in each country, where the 
focus is in the areas of spread of irrigated agricultural areas in addition to the lack of ability 
to measure all the climatic criteria required to apply the Penman–Monteith equation with 
the required accuracy (Fan et al. 2021).
Recently used computer software’s models have shown high accuracy in estimating and 
forecasting ETo, e.g. Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Fan et al. 2019). In recent years, 
the use of machine learning programs for ETo estimation has spread with making rela-
tionships between the inputs and outputs used in ETo estimation, which are mainly mete-
orological data, which gives higher accuracy and power to apply machine learning pro-
grams in ETo modeling (Ferreira and Cunha 2020a, b; Kumar et al. 2011). The use of both 
Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) to predict ETo 
proved highly accurate under local conditions and across-stations applications, but RF was 
better than GRNN (Feng et al. 2017). The common method of predicting ETo values using 
machine learning models is based on the use of former ETo values as input data (Ashrafza-
deh et al. 2020; Landeras et al. 2009; Trajkovic et al. 2003). In addition, the use of former 
daily meteorological data used to estimate ETo through the Penman–Monteith equation in 
addition to the lagged ETo values greatly enhances the performance of machine learning 
models and the accuracy of the forecasting ETo.
In addition to what machine learning programs provide an estimate of ETo values for 
the previous and current agricultural seasons, it gives the possibility to predict the ETo 
values for the upcoming seasons using the so-called deep learning models, which are 
restricted to knowing the expected changes in temperature and the amount of precipitation 
related to global warming, from which it can be make good planning and management of 
irrigation water for the coming years with an attempt to correct the existing strategies to 
avoid the negative effects of global warming (Ferreira and da Cunha 2020a, b). By increas-
ing the forecast period from 1 to 30 days, the accuracy of the resulting data decreases (Fer-
reira and da Cunha 2020a, b). Several deep learning models have been used to forecasting 
time series, including long short-term memory (LSTM) (Son and Kim 2020; Tian et al. 
2018; Zhou et  al. 2019), and a one-dimensional convolutional neural network can (1D 
CNN) (Barzegar et al. 2020). In addition to the above, Barzegar et al. (2020) and Kim 
et al. (2019) create hybrid software from both LSTM and 1D CNN. Although deep learn-
ing programs have proven outstanding performance in many fields, their use in the field of 
climatic and hydrological studies is still limited.
Therefore, this paper aims to participate in saving water tasks by forecasting irriga-
tion water requirement (IWR) for green bean by an on-field scale experiment, where there 
wasn’t common literature about modeling of irrigation water requirement forecasting in 
versus of ETo estimation studies. Moreover, the irrigation water requirements forecasting 
could make irrigation scheduling improved, and so give better solutions for decision mak-
ers. This research is based on determining the most important criteria required to forecast 
IWR of green bean to achieve the best irrigation scheduling in light of the challenges of 
climatic changes and water scarcity using six models (SVR, RF, DNN, CNN, LSTM and 
CNN-LSTM) to forecast IWR. To the best of authors’ knowledge, the applied approaches

are applying for first time for forecasting of IWR, further, no research has been published 
in the literature that analyses irrigation water requirement using a combination of climate 
data, soil data and crop data based novel artificial intelligence approaches applied. Thus, 
to overcome the gap in literature dealing with the importance of IWR prediction, the main 
objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate the potential of machine and deep learning mod-
els in forecasting IWR of snap beans, 2) develop multi-scenarios of the inputs variables 
(combinations) to study the impact of meteorological, crop and soil parameters on IWR 
and, 3) figure out the best scenario with best model performance in IWR prediction.
2  Materials and Methods
The workflow of this study is showing in Fig. 1. The first phase of the workflow involves 
the climate, soil and crops data collection and the calculation of the IWR during two sea-
sons. Within the second phase, we applied five machine learning models (SVR, RF, DNN, 
LSTM and CNN) and hybrid between LSTM and CNN to predict the IWR based on 8 Sce-
narios (combinations of climate, soil and crop data).
2.1  Climate Conditions
The climatic variables (maximum air temperature, minimum temperature of air, the aver-
age air temperature, air relative humidity, and the number of hours of sunshine) were daily 
recorded during both growing seasons. The maximum air temperature ranged during the 
growing season (October to December) between 19–30 °C, while minimum air tempera-
tures ranged from 11 to 21 °C during growing season. The total rainfall was negligible

marizes the monthly mean climatic data during the two seasons.
2.2  Machine Learning Implementations
2.2.1  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a supervised learning algorithm, and it can also be used as a regression model, 
maintain all the main features that describe the algorithm (maximal margin). SVR uses 
a similar theory as SVM for classification method, with a few slightly changes. The main 
aim is minimizing error, individualizing the hyperplane that increases the tolerance limit, 
taking in consideration that the part of error is tolerated. The approximated function in the 
algorithm of SVM is cleared as follows:
where φ (x) is feature space of higher-dimensional converted from the input vector x, ω is 
the weights vector and b are a threshold, which were estimated by minimizing the follow-
ing regularized risk function:
where C is the penalty parameter of the error,  di is the desired value, n is observations 
number, and C 1

L(di, yi) is the empirical error, in which the function  Lε is determined 
as:
where 0.5 Ѡ2 is the so-called regularization term and ɛ is the tube size. The approximated 
function in Eq. (1) is finally expressed in an explicit form by introducing Lagrange multi-
pliers and exploiting the optimality constraints as:

where k (x,  xi) is the kernel function. (Fan et al. 2018) provide detailed information and 
computation procedures of the SVM algorithm.
2.2.2  Random Forest (RF)
The RF model was developed by Breiman (2001) and used Breiman’s “bagging” idea to 
ensemble a collection of decision trees with controlled variance. The RF model is com-
monly used for regression and predicting problems. More detailed information can be 
found at (Ferreira and da Cunha 2020a, b; Breiman 2001).
2.2.3  Deep Neural Network (DNN)
Deep neural networks (DNN) model has become a fundamental but recently still powerful 
deep learning model (Achieng 2019; Montes-Atenas et al. 2016). The DNN is an artifi-
cial neural network (Springmann et al. 2018) with multiple layers between the inputs, hid-
den layers and output layers to learn more complex nonlinear relationships between inputs 
and output. The rectified linear unit (ReLu) was applied as activation function which is 
commonly employed (Ghimire et al. 2019; Achieng 2019).
The loss function in the DNN model is expressed as:
where n is the number of observation data, and T
′ is the estimated value by the DNN 
model, which can be defined below for a three-hidden-layer DNN model with the ReLu 
activation function:
where ω1, ω2, ω3 and ω4 are the weights in the network,  b1,  b2,  b3 and  b4 are the bias 
terms.
2.2.4  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
CNN consists of a sequence of convolutional layers, the output of which is connected only 
to local regions in the input. This is achieved by sliding a filter, or weight matrix, over 
the input and at each point computing the dot product between the two (i.e., a convolu-
tion between the input and filter). This structure allows the model to learn filters that are 
able to recognize specific patterns in the input data. Recent advances in CNNs for time 
series forecasting include (Mittelman 2015). Zuo et al. (2019) stated that the architecture 
of a typical CNN consists of a convolutional layer pooling layer, and fully connected layer. 
Finally, these abstract features are merged through the fully connected layer, and an activa-
tion function is used to solve the classification or regression problem (Fig. 2).

2.2.5  Long Short‑Term Memory (LSTM)
LSTM network contains different memory blocks which are linked through layers. Each 
layer includes a set of frequently connected memory pixels and three multiplicative units, 
namely the input, forget and output gates. LSTM has the ability to automatically store and 
remove temporal state information.
2.2.6  Hybrid LSTM and CNN
LSTM and CNN were trained with the same input, and they were hybrid to forecast results, 
the proposed hybrid CNN-LSTM model uses CNN layers for feature extraction from the input 
data with LSTM layers for sequence learning. The CNN and the LSTM are the most com-
monly used deep learning models. Our main aim in designing the hybrid model of CNN and 
LSTM layers is to exploit their characteristics for developing an efficient model for forecasting.

The hyper parameters of convolutional and LSTM layers were the same ones described above 
for CNN and LSTM models, respectively. Training algorithm, learning rate, batch size and 
number of training epochs followed the same configurations described for LSTM and CNN.
2.3  Input Combination and Performance Evaluation of the Models
In this study, eight scenarios were consisting of various combinations of the climatic, soil and 
crop variables to investigate their effects on IWR and evaluate the contribution of each vari-
able (Table 2). This may help improve water resources analysis for data scarcity regions. The 
two seasons’ data were divided into two subsets with 75% data for training and the remaining 
25% data for testing.
The mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean square error (RMSE), and mean bias 
error (Springmann et al. 2018) were used to evaluate the applied models. Moreover, uncer-
tainty with 95% confidence level (U95) and T-Statistic test (Tstat) to evaluate the signifi-
cant differences between the predicted and calculated yield were used (Behar et al. 2015; 
Gueymard 2014)(Stone 1994).

The input scenarios were randomized and divided into training and testing phases, then 
entered the models. The models were implemented, and their estimations were evaluated 
by the criteria MBE, RMSE and NSE (Table 3).
There are noticeable differences between the models, but also some similarities in rela-
tion to individual scenarios. The performance of the models is more favorable when the 
RMSE and MBE are closer to zero, and NSE are closer to 1. In all models, the NSE values 
are higher than 0.75, which shows that the models are well performed in IWR estimation. 
The best estimation of the models are mostly presented by the S4 scenario and after that S7. 
The weakest accuracy was obtained by SVR model with MBE = 0.007, RMSE = 0.077 mm 
and NSE = 0.850, under the S4 input scenario. The most accurate estimation was 
resulted by DNN model under S7 scenario, with MBE = -0.001, RMSE = 0.055 mm and 
NSE = 0.824. In order to examine the correlation between the actual and predicted IWR 
values, scatter plots were developed (Fig. 3).
The analysis showed that in the S1 scenario, the highest correlation was obtained for 
the LSTM and CNN models  (R2 = 0.9421,  R2 = 0.9119, respectively, the lowest for SVR. 
S1 scenario takes into account air temperature (Tmax and Tmin) and basal crop coeffi-
cient (Kcb) and soil evaporation (Ke). In the second scenario S2, where in addition to S1, 
relative humidity (RH), the strongest correlation between real and predicted IWR was also 
shown for the LSTM model  (R2 = 0.83225), and the weakest for SVR  (R2 = 0.6369). In the 
S3 scenario (4 parameters: temperature, wind speed and Kcb), the best correlation between 
actual and predicted IWR values  was determined for the LSTM & CNN hybrid model 
 (R2 = 0.7618). This is a relatively low correlation, which indicates that the IWR prediction

is also influenced by RH and Ke, and there is Kcb and wind speed, in addition to air tem-
perature, is not sufficient this parameter. In the S3 scenario, the results are not promising, a 
relatively low  R2 was obtained, which means that the predictors used support the prediction 
of IWR within 50–76%. The weakest correlation was shown by the CNN model  (R2 = 0.5)

but the LSTM & CNN hybrid already gives a good correlation result between actual and 
predicted IWR values.
In the S4 scenario, where wind speed, RH, Kcb and Ke are considered, the  R2 value 
ranges from 0.6874 for the RF model to 0.922 for the CNN model. Apart from RF, the 
remaining models showed a high correlation of actual and predicted IWR, which empha-
sizes that the selection of predictors in the discussed scenario is optimal for the prediction. 
In the S5 scenario, considering only the two predictors RH and WS, the best correlation for 
the current and predicted IWR values   was obtained for the CNN model  (R2 = 0.8781), while 
weak correlation applies to the SVR  (R2 = 0.4522) and RF  (R2 = 0.5655) models. In the 
next scenario S6, where the group of climatic factors (Table 3) was considered as Input, the 
highest  R2 was obtained for the CNN model (0.837), while the weakest result in the SVR 
model  (R2 = 0.3948). In this variant, the remaining models showed a weak  (R2 = 0.5–0.6) 
correlation between actual and predicted IWR values, which indicates that climatic factors 
alone are not sufficient for predicting of irrigation requirement (IR), predicting irrigation 
demand (IR). In the S7 scenario, which takes into account only non-climatic parameters 
root depth,  kcb,  ke,  fw and  few (Table 3), in almost all models a similar dimension of the cor-
relation strength between actual and predicted IWR values  (R2 > 0.8) was obtained, except 
for the SVR model  (R2 = 0.7287). In the last scenario S8, in which all predictors were taken 
into account (Table 3), the highest  R2 > 0.9 were obtained for the CNN and DNN models, 
and the weakest correlations concerned the RF model  (R2 = 0.6128). In the next step, for 
the test period, combo charts (combined line-bar chart) were used to compare the scenarios 
based on the CC and  U95 criteria and in the second variant A and PSR (Fig. 4).
Comparison charts (combo-graphs) show that the values  of CC and  U95 show wide dif-
ferentiation. The analyzes show that the highest CC = 0.97 was determined for the S1 sce-
nario in the LTSM model. However, in the case of the CNN model, for most of the sce-
narios (except S3, which takes into account temperature, wind speed and crop factor), the 
CC coefficient is above CC = 90. The uncertainty of the scenarios adopted in modeling was 
additionally determined for the limits of the 95% confidence interval  (U95), which means 
the probability of obtaining the result lying close to the expected value within the range 
defined by this uncertainty. S5 and S6 scenarios do not work for LTSM and LTSM & CNN, 
SVR and RF models. However, they are slightly better for IWR prediction using the CNN 
model itself. The S1 scenario seems to be the most optimal, as it achieves satisfactory per-
formance for all models, except for the SVR model. The S4 scenario is also favorable, with 
the exception of the RF model. However, in the case of the remaining scenarios, a differen-
tiated assessment of the CC and  U95 criteria was obtained.
In the second case, the accuracy (A) and PSR. Metrics were used to assess the cor-
rectness of the scenarios used. These criteria are used to obtain more relevant information 
from the time series. Model accuracy (A) is defined as the percentage of correct predic-
tions for the test data, it denotes the degree of compliance of the actual value with the 
arithmetic mean of the results (predicted value) obtained for the marked scenario and pre-
diction model. For accuracy, results above 80% are considered good. In some scenarios and 
models, the obtained values  were higher than 1, which means that the prediction results in 
these variants may be burdened with a random error, which can be considered a random 
error, i.e., a type of measurement error that does not result from systematic and repeatable 
factors.
In the case of the CNN and DNN models in particular, overestimated A values  were 
obtained, which may be related to a random error. For the S1-S4, the best accuracy was 
demonstrated by the SVR model. For the S5 forecast, the LTSM model was the most accu-
rate, while for the other S6-S7 forecasts, the first 4 models presented the most accurate.

Another analyzed RSR indicator is strongly related to the RMSE criterion, as it is under-
stood as the ratio of the RMSE and the standard deviation of the measured data. Better 
performance is shown by models with a lower RSR value, which at the same time means a

lower RMSE. A very good model is classified when 0.00 ≤ RSR ≤ 0.50, while unsatisfac-
tory when RSR > 0.70. The analyzes show that the lowest RSR values  (≤ 0.50), covering 
very good ranges of classification, were achieved by all models for the S4 scenario (Input: 
RH, WS, Kcb, Ke in Table 2), and then by four models: LTSM, CNN, DNN and RF for the 
S1 scenario (Fig. 4).
The LTSM, LTSM & CNN and DNN models additionally achieved high perfor-
mance in the S7 scenario, and the CNN and DNN models also in the S2 scenario. 
The SVR model was the only one that achieved very good quality in only one S4 
scenario. The SVR model was the only one that achieved very good quality in only 
one S4 scenario. In most models, the lowest RSR was achieved in those scenarios 
where the lowest values  also reached the RMSE criterion (Table 3), which proves that 
the scenarios seem to be the most optimal for IWR prediction. Unsatisfactory results 
were achieved in those scenarios where the RSR criterion > 0.70. The most common 
scenarios are: S3 (Input: Tmax, Tmin, WS, Kcb), S5 (Input: RH, WS) and S6 (Input: 
Tmax, Tmin, RH, WS, P), thus mostly scenarios that include climatic parameters as 
input to the model (Fig. 4). In the next stage (Fig. 5), radar charts were developed to 
compare the models in each scenario based on the SI criterion.
The SI values  obtained for the models in various S1-S8 scenarios. According to 
the value of the SI criteria, the performance of models can be divided into several 
levels. In the discussed case, the SI < 0.1 was not obtained, which would classify the 
models as "excellent". Good (if 0.1 < SI < 0.2) and satisfactory (if 0.2 < SI < 0.3) per-
formance of most models was obtained for the S8 scenario, which takes into account 
all the inputs: climate, vegetation characteristics and soil data, and for the scenarios: 
S4 (takes into account 4 components RH, WS, Kcb and Ke) and the S7 scenario 
(Root depth, Kcb, Ke, Fw and Few). Satisfactory performance was achieved by the 
models in the S1 scenario, which takes into account temperature data, Kcb and Ke, 
and in the S5 scenario, which includes only two outputs, namely RH and WS. Poor 
performance was achieved by the SVR model for the S2 and S3 scenarios, and the 
RF and CNN models for the S6 scenario, which takes into account only climatic 
data. The models in the S6 scenario show the least satisfactory performance (Fig. 5).
The LTSM model, according to the Scatter index, achieved the best performance for S4 
and the weakest for S6, the LTSM & CNN hybrid model for S4 and S1 / S6 respectively, 
the CNN model for S1 / S4 and S6 respectively, the DNN model for S4 / S7 and S5, the 
SVR model for S4 and S3, while the RF model for the S7 and S6 scenarios. Figure 5 shows 
that, apart from the distinguished single cases related to specific scenarios, the prediction 
accuracy in most of the developed models regarding the SI value was good (0.1 < SI < 0.2) 
and satisfactory (0.2 < SI < 0.3). Figure 6 shows the MAE values  for 6 different models for 
2 options: under and over estimation.
The MAE is a measure of performance (model quality) used to evaluate the perfor-
mance of a model after finalization. Investigating the models under and over estimations, 
i.e., the study of underestimating and overestimating model estimates was carried out 
using mean absolute error (MAE). In the context of machine learning, absolute error refers 
to the magnitude of the difference between the prediction of an observation and the true 
value of that observation. The values  on two different data sets indicate that MAE values  
in under estimation in almost all models were higher than after Over estimation, except 
for the RF model, where higher MAE was achieved in over estimation. The RF approach 
is another widely used decision tree method (Cavallo et al. 2017; García Nieto et al. 2017, 
2018) which, using the classification and regression tree procedure, combined with ran-
dom node optimization and packing (Breiman 2001) builds a forest of uncorrelated trees.

However, in the case of noise-rich datasets, RF models tend to over-fit the data. Moreover, 
over-selecting too many characteristic values   also has a greater impact on RF decision 
making, which affects goodness of fit (Naghibi et al. 2017). The MAE values  decrease 
significantly after over estimation in the case of the following models: LTSM, LTSM & 
CNN, CNN and SVR) (they are within 0.05). This proves that over estimation can reduce 
the MAE values  for most tested models. The smallest MAE differences between the two 
variants (under and over estimation) were obtained in the DNN model, while the largest in 
the SVR model. The use of the LTSM & CNN hybrid model reduced the MAE between 
the two options Under and over estimation.
4  Discussion
The assessment of the amount of irrigation for individual types of crops requires the analy-
sis of a large number of parameters, which are often difficult to obtain through direct meas-
urement and observation are often considered burdensome and costly for farmers. Hardly 
any country has a good system for measuring and recording the total water consumption of 
crops, and more than 40% of crops are grown under irrigation conditions. Hence, in order 
to assess the future situation in terms of obtaining high yields and maintaining ration-
alization in water abstraction for crops, it is necessary to model irrigation water require-
ments (Pulido-Calvo and Gutierrez-Estrada 2009; Döll and Siebert 2002). Modeling of the 
irrigation water needs as a function of the irrigated area, climatic conditions and type of 
crops has a broader context, providing the basis for estimating the future impact of climate 
change, as well as demographic, socio-economic and technological changes.

In this study, various machine learning models (SVM, RF, DNN, CNN, LSTM and 
hybrid LSTM & CNN) are investigated to predict the IWR indispensable for the green bean 
crops in Egypt. Importantly, it presents the adaptation of typical deep neural network mod-
els, which include the DNN model and the convolutional neural network, long short-term 
memory network, and finally a combination of some of their variants. An important ele-
ment in the study was the selection of the scenario and model that obtains the best perfor-
mance for the conditions declared in the scenario. Indication of the best predictive model 
for IWR, with the given input data for modeling, is of great importance for the selected 
research area that experiences extreme droughts and the related needs for intensive irriga-
tion of crops. Mokhtar et al. (2021a, b) emphasizes that the droughts in the research area 
in 2015–2019 covered even 80–90% of the area, and 30% in 2010–2019 were affected by 
extreme and very extreme droughts.
The reason for water shortages in the root zone is primarily water consumption by 
crops and evapotranspiration, while rainfall and irrigation ensure water supply (Andales 
et al. 2011; 2014; Karam et al. 2019a, b). However, it should be emphasized that the actual 
evapotranspiration of green bean crops, one of the dominant components in the water bal-
ance, significantly reduces the size of its harvest, which on the other hand, with increas-
ing evaporation, will require increased irrigation of the area. Due to the complexity of the 
evapotranspiration process, it is most often estimated on the basis of meteorological data 
(Pereira et al. 2015a, b; Ferreira and Cunha 2020a, b). However, in this case, monitoring of 
all parameters is often insufficient (El Bilali and Taleb 2020).
In the performed IWR prediction for green bean crops in Egypt, the accurate predic-
tion of IWR was largely dependent on the number of input variables and their impact on 
the modeling results under certain scenario variants. According to Krupakar et al. (2016), 
the sources of parameters influencing the irrigation process tend to differ depending on the 
area where agriculture is grown. In addition, there are new characteristics that we obtain 
thanks to new technologies for terrestrial and satellite measurements. The sources that 
make irrigation water demand prediction possible can be broadly categorized into meteoro-
logical factors, crop input and agricultural parameters. Meteorological factors are impor-
tant in determining the irrigation water needs of crops as rain is the main source of water in 
some areas (e.g., India). Wind speed also affects the amount of irrigation needed, although 
not as much as the temperature (O’Toole and Hatfield 1983; Schlenker and Roberts 2009; 
Krupakar et al. 2016).
In the presented work, the climate data was adapted to the S6 scenario (Table 2), which 
took into account the following parameters: maximum and minimum temperature, rela-
tive humidity, wind speed and precipitation. In the case of having information only from 
the group of climatic factors (treated as input data), taking into account the S6 scenario, 
the best prediction was shown by the CNN model  (R2 = 0.8275), and the weakest SVR 
 (R2 = 0.3).
One of the most important criteria for determining irrigation needs is soil type, and dif-
ferences are seen when the amount of water required for different crops on different soil 
types is compared. The models take into account factors including the type of crop itself 
(Tolk et al. 1999) or other crop area factors that change over time and affect the water 
requirements of plants (Allen 2000). According to Krupakar et al. (2016) the RNN model 
is robust enough to map the differences in observations that occur due to various factors 
such as global warming, faulty hardware, etc. In the presented study, if only data on crops 
and soils were considered as predictors: root depth, basal crop coefficient, soil evaporation, 
fraction of surface wetted and exposed and soil wetted fraction, in the absence of climate

data, as presented in the S7 scenario, the best results were obtained for a hybrid model 
(LSTM & CNN) and separately for LSTM and CNN.
The box plot was developed to show the error distribution in the test section (Fig. 7). 
For IWR prediction, the best models turned out to be LSTM, CNN, LSTM & CNN and 
SVR for the S4, which takes into account the RH, WS, Kcb and Ke parameters, and the 
DNN and RF models for the S7 scenario, which includes root depth, Kcb, Ke, Fw and Few. 
In the group with the S4, the LSTM and LSTM & CNN models performed best because 
they have the lowest values  of Q1, Q3 and IQR (Fig. 7), and the SVR model the worst. 
However, for the S7 scenario, the DNN model turned out to be the best for IWR predic-
tion. In the RF 7 model, the lowest Q3 was obtained among the others, but the IQR was not 
among the lowest and amounted to 0.09. The LSTM 4 and LSTM & CNN 4 have the same 
IQR as the DNN 7 model and slightly lower compared to the RF 7 model (Fig. 7).
In all the models used, the error distribution is around zero, while the median line shows 
the normality of the error distribution, primarily for the LSTM & CNN hybrid model S4. 
Additionally, it should be noted that the models developed for the S4 and S7 scenarios 
obtained the best results in the assessment at the previous stage (Table 2). These scenarios 
are intermediate between the use of all input variables (S8) and the smallest number of 
input data represented by the S5 scenario (RH and WS data).
However, none of the models in the S6 scenario, which takes into account only climatic 
data, was included in the group of the best models distinguished on the basis of distribution 
of the estimation errors of the IWR in the test section for the best model-scenarios (Fig. 7). 
In turn, research by Krupakar et al (2016) showed that ANNs models perform well in predic-
tion based on training but have a lower ability to infer semantic meaning from the sequential 
flow. SVMs models are designed to be tested on normal data, hence they cannot capture the 
essential sequential information. According to Xie and Tang (2010), the factors influencing

the amount of irrigation are complex and non-linear, and the support vector machine (SVM) 
has many advantages for non-linear small samples. A forecasting model of irrigation water 
requirement based on least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) was used in Tarim 
River Basin. These authors demonstrated in their research that the prediction model based on 
the LS-SVM has excellent generalizability and low error, which provides an efficient method 
of forecasting irrigation water requirements (Xie and Tang 2010).
In turn, El Bilali and Taleb (2020), using correlation coefficients, showed the inaccuracy 
of the SVR model in predicting the quality of irrigation water for training and validation 
processes sequentially. Artificial neural network (Springmann et  al. 2018), multiple linear 
regression (MLR), decision tree, random forest (RF), stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and 
adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) demonstrated good prediction accuracy. Krupakar et al. (2016) 
emphasize that the models described for an irrigation prediction system are generally devel-
oped and trained using a large amount of historical data (training data) on objects or character-
istics that influence the amount of water required for irrigation. The new RNN LSTM model 
proposed by them can be used to obtain better results, richer in semantic correlations found 
in the parameters used in real-time data. When testing machine learning models in predicting 
irrigation water, it is emphasized that they are efficient tools for accurately predicting irriga-
tion only using parameters that can be directly measured in a short time. There have been 
a lot of hybrid models that have been used for time series prediction (Ruan 1997; Kavousi-
Fard 2013). Pulido-Calvo et al. (2003) developed a hybrid model of combining CNNs with 
fuzzy membership function, optimized by a genetic optimization algorithm to test the effi-
cacy of irrigation demand prediction, a Pulido-Calvo and Gutierrez-Estrada (2009) presented 
improved irrigation water demand forecasting using a soft computing hybrid model.
For the prediction of irrigation for green bean crops in Egypt, the LSTM & CNN hybrid 
model was proposed, which enhances the information potential for IWR prediction. Deep 
learning concerns multilayer neural networks, which simultaneously act as a generator of 
diagnostic features for the analyzed process and the final function of a classifier or regres-
sion system. It also makes it possible to improve the accuracy of the system operation. The 
recurrent network called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a recursive network character-
ized by a long memory of short patterns (Schmidhuber 2015; Greff et al. 2017). The levels of 
the LSTM and CNN models are often combined when forecasting time series. This allows 
the LSTM layer to account for sequential dependencies across time series, while the CNN 
layer additionally informs about this process through the use of extended convolutions. Unlike 
LSTM, the CNN model does not keep memory of previous time series patterns, and instead 
can only train have based on data entered over a specific period of time. Krupakar et al. (2016) 
propose a novel methodology of using a sequence learning based recurrent neural network 
(RNN) model that uses the LSTM activation function to model for irrigation requirement so 
that it doesn’t have memory problems on long input streams.
The IWR prediction results for Egyptian green bean crops, performed for different scenario 
variants, show the models’ ability to predict irrigation potential. The proposed predictive irri-
gation planning approach, compared to field studies, makes it possible to reduce or prevent 
water stress in crops. Predicting future IWR values   from the results of predictive models can 
improve the real-time irrigation planning system depending on the meteorological situation 
and terrain factors (plants, soil). Sustainable irrigation aims to adjust water availability and 
demand in terms of quantity and quality, space and time, at reasonable cost and with accept-
able environmental impacts, whereby forecasting water demand is proving to be a valuable 
management tool.

5  Conclusions
Water and food need crisis is facing all over world, furthermore agriculture consume the larg-
est amount of water to cover plant requirement of water. Therefore, the current research applies 
machine models in order to predict the irrigation water requirement for one of the most important 
crops in Egypt (green bean) by actual field experiment, which there weren’t common literature 
about modeling of irrigation requirement forecasting in versus ETo evaluation studies.
The main conclusions were reported as follow; the scenario S4 (relative humidity, wind speed, 
basal crop coefficient, the soil evaporation), is the best scenario for SVR, LSTM, CNN and LSTM 
& CNN models, while the best scenario in DNN and RF model was in scenario (S7) (root depth, 
basal crop coefficient, the soil evaporation, fraction of surface wetted, exposed and soil wetted 
fraction). The climatic factors in scenario (S6) presented the highest  R2 for the CNN model and 
the weakest result in the SVR model. Further, by taking into account only the two predictors rela-
tive humidity and wind speed, the performance of all models ranged from very good to satisfac-
tory fit for all models, while it was an unsatisfactory fit for SVR.
On contrast, the hybrid LTSM & CNN model was the best model for the IWR prediction. 
Finally, the models applied can improve the irrigation planning with few available data. The cur-
rent approach was promising and has research value for other similar regions. Therefore, the future 
work will focus much more in predicting the irrigation water requirements in other crops in other 
regions to draw a general picture of the predicting of the irrigation water requirements in order to 
ensure the water resources management under the impact of the climate changes.

Abstract: With the increasing worldwide population and the requirement for efﬁcient approaches to
farm care and irrigation, the demand for water is constantly rising, and water resources are becoming
scarce. This has led to the development of smart water management systems that aim to improve the
efﬁciency of water management. This paper pioneers an effective Irrigation Water Quality Prediction
(IWQP) model using a convolution neural architecture that can be trained on any general computing
device. The developed IWQP4Net is assessed using several evaluation measurements and compared
to the Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector regression (SVR), and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN)
models. The results show that the developed IWQP4Net achieved a promising outcome and better
performance than the other comparative models.

1. Introduction
The United Nations (UN) has asserted that access to safe domestic potable water is
an essential human right and a step towards improving people’s living standards. An
accessible, adequate, clean, and safe drinking water supply is one of the main aspirations
of the Millennium Development Goals (UN-MDGs), and it is one of the core aims of the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [1]. The UN-MDGs concluded that water sustains
life, but safe and clean drinking water is a hallmark of civilization. In order to ensure that
consumers receive the required quality of water supplied from treatment plants, there is
a need to deter, detect and minimize any threats to the water supply such as accidents,
backﬂow, vandalism, hazardous material releases, and terrorism. Natural disasters such
as waterborne disease outbreaks, bushﬁres, and ﬂoods can also affect the quality of water
supplied. The supply of safe potable water to consumers implies that there must be proper
security setups and safeguards in terms of how rapidly to react to disasters and when they
occur [2].
A signiﬁcant amount of freshwater is used in farming and agriculture, especially for
irrigation. Due to a lack of affordable clever irrigation technologies, developing nations use
more water than industrialized nations to produce the same output. For instance, India has
only 4% of the world’s freshwater resources to service 17% of the global population, but
some of its key agricultural products require two to four times more water than those of
other nations such as China and the USA [3]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop
smart methods and systems based on sophisticated technologies for the efﬁcient use of
fresh water.
Many studies have used Deep Learning (DL) approaches for irrigation water sys-
tems [4–7]. The Internet of Things (IoT) was used by the authors of [8] to collect data from
the ﬁeld on a variety of variables, including soil moisture, soil temperature, weather, and
environmental conditions. Their strategy optimizes the nee and thereby uses less energy
with the aid of different information. The collected data from the IoT devices were saved in
the cloud, and they then employed ML models for precise irrigation systems.

In [9], an intelligent irrigation system for precision agriculture based on DL neural
networks is explored. The developed method can maintain its functionality better over time
and in any weather conditions. It uses an extended short-term memory network (LSTM) to
forecast the irrigation schedule, the spatial spread of water needed to irrigate the arable
land, and the volumetric soil moisture content for the following day. In [10], the authors
used IoT sensors to collect soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and time data, and then
they used that data as inputs to LR, Random Forest (RF), SVR, and Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) techniques to classify the produced data from the IoT. Based on the results,
the RF model performed the best compared to the other techniques.
In the study of [11], the regression analysis method showed better results than the
correlation for monitoring water quality and predicting trends in water quality variation.
In [12], an automation approach for the farm irrigation system was reported based on
IoT and ML. The authors established a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN), where
various sensors cover each region of the farm, and then these data were transmitted
to a server. They then used stored data were used to predict irrigation patterns using
ML methods.
In order to estimate the inﬁltrated water in the furrow irrigation system, the authors
of [13] applied the SVR, Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy
Inference System (ANFIS), Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN), and Multivariate Linear
Regression (MLR) models. The results showed that the Fireﬂy Algorithm (FA) has a high
ability to boost the accuracy of the implemented models. The authors in [14] present a
machine learning (ML) algorithm-based smart system to anticipate irrigation needs by
sensing ground parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and water level.
The authors in [15] discussed the recent contributions of both DL and IoT for precision
agriculture. They also proposed a boot-strapping method of transfer learning, where ﬁne-
tuned VGG16 is improved by newly built fully connected layers. The results showed that
their improvement method accomplished better accuracy than the other models used in
their work.
In [16], a stacking model of ML combined with feature selection methods was investi-
gated to accurately calculate the required amount of water for a plant. The relevance of the
features was determined by using RF, state-of-the-art feature elimination, and SelectKBest.
An ensemble of CART, gradient boost regression, and XGBoost regressors was suggested
based on the best subset of characteristics. Several crops, such as tomatoes, grapes, and
lemons, were used to train and test the models, which incorporated information on the
weather, soil, irrigation, and crops. The feature selection results showed the signiﬁcance of
evapotranspiration, depletion, and shortfall levels in maximizing the model’s accuracy.
In [17], the authors investigated several ML-based methods and their performance to
calculate Water Quality Index (WQI) using a dataset collected from the Kim Hai irrigation
system. They applied several feature selection methods to pick key parameters fed to the
ML models. Results conﬁrmed that a combination of feature selection along with ML has
been an effective choice for calculating the WQI. In [18], Long Short-Term Memory LSTM,
CNN, and hybrid CNN-LSTM models, were examined in order to forecast water quality.
The results showed that the hybrid model had a high ability to capture low and high levels
of water quality variables compared to LSTM and CNN alone. As a result, improved water
quality prediction still requires more sophisticated prediction algorithms to deliver an
effective approach with high performance. The main contributions of this paper can be
summarized as follows:
1.
Introduced an effective Irrigation Water Quality Prediction (IWQP) approach based on
an efﬁcient CNN architecture which comprises two convolution layers, a max-pooling
layer, a dropout layer, and two dense layers;
2.
Examined and compared the performance of IWQP4Net with the LR, SVR, and kNN
models using different evaluation measurements and visualizations methods;
3.
Demonstrated the efﬁciency of the developed IWQP4Net for IWQP and its superiority
over the other competitive models.

Section 4 discusses the experimental results of this work. Finally, Section 5 presents the
conclusion of this paper.
2. Methods and Material
2.1. Dataset
On the basis of the input data, which is the historical data of other water-measurement
indices, the spatiotemporal water quality is to be forecast in terms of the “power of hy-
drogen (pH)” value for the following day. The United States Geological Survey publishes
this dataset [19]. Depending on the water system they are a part of, such as the water
system of Atlanta, the Savannah River’s watershed, and others, high-level prior spatial
information is given. It comprises training data collected for 423 days (1 December 2014 to
28 January 2016), and testing data collected for 282 days (25 March 2017 to 1 January 2018).
The input data comprises daily samples taken from 37 water stations and that were used to
calculate the pH levels in Georgia, USA. Due to the complexity of the water system, the
precise connections between each location through water streams, or spatial connectivity,
are unknown. Eleven standard parameters, including temperature, speciﬁc conductance,
and the volume of dissolved oxygen, are used to predict the pH value for each water
station. The input data at any time instant is spatially arranged as a matrix of dimension
(37 × 11), where rows correspond to different water stations and columns correspond to
different features affecting the pH value. Hence, the training input data has a dimension
of (423 × 37 × 11), and a concatenation of 423 days of spatial matrices. Similarly, the test
input data has a dimension of (282 × 37 × 11). The output comprises the pH value for
37 water stations for each day. Hence, the training and test output data dimensions are
(423 × 37) and (282 × 37), respectively. A statistical summary of input and output training
and testing data is presented in Table 1. It can be assumed that both data are generated from
the same distribution and, hence, can be used to train and evaluate the CNN for IWQP.

2.2. Proposed IWQP Approach
DL methods have attracted signiﬁcant research interest due to their response capability
to many data forms in diverse contexts, such as prediction and classiﬁcation issues. They
have been successfully applied to smart homes [20], image segmentation [21], self-driving
vehicles [22], agriculture [23], and to many others. These techniques teach a device to
analyse inputs using several layers, similar to human brain processing, to aid in data
classiﬁcation and prediction, simulating the brain’s capacity to process information and
reach the right judgments [24]. In this work, the water quality dataset requires a quality
value to be predicted for each water station. This indicates that the given problem is

multivariate regression, with 37 outputs to be predicted simultaneously. Figure 1 shows
the overall system ﬂow used in this work to predict the water quality in terms of pH value
in the irrigation system framework. The input data is already divided into training and test
subsets. We use only the training subset for model generation and validation, while the
testing subset is used to evaluate the generalized performance of the model using three

The developed architecture of CNN for irrigation water quality prediction (IWQP4Net)
is shown in Figure 2. It comprises two convolution layers, a max-pooling layer, a dropout

(no. of training examples, no. of water stations, no. of features per station). The training and
test data dimensions are (423 × 37 × 11) and (282 × 37 × 11), respectively. Hence, 2D convo-
lution and 2D max-pooling layers are used to analyze the data [25]. The initial convolution
layer uses 20 kernel functions of (3 × 3) dimensions to extract the coarse features. For the ith
layer, the output y[i](j, k) at jth row and kth column is calculated by convolving the kernel
w[i] with the output of the previous layer {y[i−1](j, k) s.t. j ∈ [0, J − 1] & k ∈ [0, K − 1]} as,

features to pass further. The dimension of the ﬁrst layer’s output is further reduced by a 
max-pooing layer that uses a (2 × 2) window function. With similar assumptions as above,

In simple terms, only the most signiﬁcant (highest-valued) convolutions are retained, 
while others are discarded. The output dimension of max-pooled convolution is (17 × 4 ×

details, another convolution layer comprising ten kernel functions, each of (3 × 3) dimen-
sion, is added. To maintain our objective, zero-padding was not allowed in this layer, sim-
ilar to the previous convolution layer. Hence, the output dimension reduces to (15 × 2 ×

The output dimension of the ﬁrst convolution layer is (35 × 9 × 20), corresponding to
a reduction of 2 in the ﬁrst two dimensions by kernel convolution, and the third dimension
is the same as the number of individual kernel functions. The zero-padding is not used to
eliminate redundant data and bottleneck sooner in the network, forcing only important
features to pass further. The dimension of the ﬁrst layer’s output is further reduced by a
max-pooing layer that uses a (2 × 2) window function. With similar assumptions as above,
the output of any max-pooling layer can be calculated as,
y[i](j, k) = max

y[i−1](j, k), y[i−1](j + 1, k), y[i−1](j, k + 1), y[i−1](j + 1, k + 1)

In simple terms, only the most significant (highest-valued) convolutions are retained,
while others are discarded. The output dimension of max-pooled convolution is (17 × 4 × 20),
compressing the ﬁrst two dimensions by the respective kernel size while the number of ﬁl-
ters dimension is retained. To generate more complex features that capture the ﬁner details,
another convolution layer comprising ten kernel functions, each of (3 × 3) dimension, is
added. To maintain our objective, zero-padding was not allowed in this layer, similar to the
previous convolution layer. Hence, the output dimension reduces to (15 × 2 × 10). This
ends the feature extractor part of the IWQP4Net. The details of layers, output dimension,
and trainable parameters are provided in Table 2.

The 3D output of the feature extractor part is rearranged to only one dimension by the
ﬂattened layer. It should be noted that the ﬂattened layer, the fourth layer shown in the
IWQP4Net architecture, is non-trainable and has no parameters. It can be understood as a
cylindrical convolution layer with a unity valued kernel function of size (1 × 1) and the
number of ﬁlters equal to the total number of coefﬁcients in the previous convolution layer
output. The resulting dimension is 300 (15 × 2 × 10). The large number of parameters
in the CNNs keeps them at risk of overﬁtting. In this work, training examples are 423,
which a large CNN model can easily memorize. To avoid overﬁtting and increase general-
ization [26,27], a dropout layer with 40% of the input being randomly set to 0 is added in
the sequential model. This is another example of a non-trainable layer. It is followed by
another dense layer with 60 neurons that acts as a reduction layer to ﬁlter out important
features for the current regression task. Finally, an output layer with the number of neurons
equal to the number of water stations is added to get the ﬁnal water quality prediction. All
trainable layers in the IWQP4Net architecture use Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU) activation.
3. Evaluation Measurements
The introduced approach and the other models are evaluated using statistical evalua-
tion criteria as given in Table 3. Also, visualization approaches comprising the loss curve of
training and validation, scatter plots of prediction and observed values, and the histogram
of prediction error with Gaussian approximation are used to assess the models. For the
observed water quality WQobs and predicted water quality WQpre, the evaluation measures
can be calculated as follows:

4. Experimental Results and Discussion
The open-source TensorFlow library in Python is used to implement all of the models,
which are then run on an Intel Xenon CPU running at 2.00 GHz with 13 GB of memory
and a 12-GB NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU. Table 4 shows the hyper-parameters used in the
modeling stage of the LR, SVR, kNN, and IWQP models. These settings are chosen after
experimental research showed that they are the most effective ones for model training.

The IWQP4Net has a large number of trainable parameters, as shown in Table 1. The
423 training examples are available in the dataset, which is very small compared to the
trainable parameters of the IWQP4Net. This puts the network at risk of overﬁtting. During
training, the optimum hyper-parameter set for the network was guided by the loss curves
for training and validation. The learning rate and batch size are searched over a logarithmic
range, while epochs are varied linearly. For large learning rates, the loss function is noisy;
hence, the CNN is unreliable due to the high variance problem. This variance can be
reduced up to a level by increasing the batch size, but the predicted MAPE was high.
After reducing the learning rates to very small values, the optimum solution was obtained
after several hundreds of epochs. Figure 3 shows the training and validation loss for the
developed IWQP4Net’s optimum hyper-parameters, as mentioned in Table 4. It can be
seen that both loss values decrease rapidly at the start, and no overﬁtting has occurred.

The average training and testing performance of all competing models for 10 iterations
are tabulated in Table 5, using the three types of evaluation measures provided in Section 3.
The training errors for LR are the lowest, indicating the best training performance. However,
the testing performance of the LR model is the worst. This indicates that the LR model
suffers from an overﬁtting problem. The developed IWQP4Net approach shows the second-
highest training performance, followed by kNN and SVR. All three errors of the developed
IWQP4Net are lower during testing than the three competing models, which indicates its
higher capability than the others for water quality prediction.

Further investigation of the performance of the introduced approach is also carried
out by visualizing the scatter plots. Figure 4 shows scatter plots with the observed pH
predicted on the horizontal axis and the predicted pH on the vertical axis of all four models
for training and testing data. Each scatter plot is superimposed with a regression line with
the regression equation mentioned at the top. As shown in Table 5, LR has the smallest
training MAPE and the testing MAPE is the worst. A similar visualization can be seen in
Figure 4.
The scatter plot for LR training shows the best performance with a minimal deviation
for the regression line, but testing scatter plots show a very high deviation from the
regression line. Scatter plots for the IWQP4Net model show a good match between the
observed and predicted water quality. The SVR and kNN models show slightly higher
deviation from the regression line than the developed model.
The prediction error analysis is examined to understand the behavior of all four
prediction models. Figure 5 shows the histograms (bin width = 0.005) of prediction error
(WQpre − WQobs) of all four models for training and testing data. Kernel density (KDE)
plots superimpose all histograms with Gaussian kernel and bandwidth calculated using
Scott’s method [28]. As stated above, an impulsive training error and an almost ﬂat (very
high standard deviation) testing error characterizes the overﬁtted LR model. The training
histogram and KDE plots of IWQP4Net provide a high concentration with lower prediction
errors. Similar behavior can also be seen in the testing data with a slight bias toward the
value for predicted water quality. The kNN model also shows a concentration of training
and testing errors toward lower values with a slightly higher standard deviation than the
developed method. The SVR model shows a signiﬁcantly large variation in training and
testing errors.

The recent years have seen a rise in the interest in precision agriculture due to the 
increasing demands for food and water from a population that is expanding worldwide. 
To satisfy these demands, farmers thus need access to water and fertile land. In this paper, 
an IWQP approach is developed by using an eﬃcient CNN structure. The IWQP4Net con-
sists of two convolution layers, a max-pooling layer, a dropout layer, and two dense lay-
ers. Some statistical measures, including RMSE, MSE, and MAE, are utilized to assess 
IWQP4Net, and its performance is compared with the LR, SVR, and kNN models. The 
results showed that the developed IWQP4Net approach has the lowest RMSE, MSE, and 
MAE values compared to the other models. In the future, the proposed IWQP approach 
can be applied to a large-scale IoT-based online monitoring system to predict the water 
quality based on the real-time data fed from the IoT system Another possible avenue is

5. Conclusions and Future Works
The recent years have seen a rise in the interest in precision agriculture due to the
increasing demands for food and water from a population that is expanding worldwide.
To satisfy these demands, farmers thus need access to water and fertile land. In this paper,
an IWQP approach is developed by using an efﬁcient CNN structure. The IWQP4Net
consists of two convolution layers, a max-pooling layer, a dropout layer, and two dense
layers. Some statistical measures, including RMSE, MSE, and MAE, are utilized to assess

results showed that the developed IWQP4Net approach has the lowest RMSE, MSE, and
MAE values compared to the other models. In the future, the proposed IWQP approach
can be applied to a large-scale IoT-based online monitoring system to predict the water
quality based on the real-time data fed from the IoT system. Another possible avenue is to
apply metaheuristic methods as a feature selection along with the developed IWQP4Net
approach in the application of agriculture, because these optimization algorithms have
shown great potential in other domains.

The Internet of Things (IOT)-based smart farming promises ultrafast speeds and near
real-time response. Precision farming enabled by the Internet of Things has the
potential to boost efﬁciency and output while reducing water use. Therefore, IoT
devices can aid farmers in keeping track crop health and development while also
automating a variety of tasks (such as moisture level prediction, irrigation system,
crop development, and nutrient levels). The IoT-based autonomous irrigation
technique makes exact use of farmers’ time, money, and power. High crop yields
can be achieved through consistent monitoring and sensing of crops utilizing a
variety of IoT sensors to inform farmers of optimal harvest times. In this paper, a
smart framework for growing tomatoes is developed, with inﬂuence from IoT
devices or modules. With the help of IoT modules, we can forecast soil moisture
levels and ﬁne-tune the watering schedule. To further aid farmers, a smartphone app
is currently in development that will provide them with crucial data on the health of
their tomato crops. Large-scale experiments validate the proposed model’s ability to
intelligently monitor the irrigation system, which contributes to higher tomato yields.

1 Introduction
In recent years, no other invention has generated as much
excitement in the computing world as the Internet. Because of its
tremendous strength and breadth of uses, it is virtually ubiquitous
in every sector of human endeavor (Kumar et al., 2017; Poyen et al.,
2020; Terence and Purushothaman, 2020). People and
organizations have connected with amazing agility and
convenience in recent years, thanks to a vast 5G network of
wireless sensor networks (WSNs), healthcare services, cellphones,
and various sorts of pervasive real-time monitoring systems
(Lakshmiprabha and Govindaraju, 2019; Hassan et al., 2021). The
human population is expanding at an alarming rate, but at the same
time, pollution is slowly depleting the earth’s water and land
supplies. Smart agriculture is seen as playing a crucial role in
responding to these issues. Smart agriculture has the potential to
vastly enhance both the agroecological setting and the yield and
quality of agricultural products while simultaneously decreasing the
need for harmful chemical fertilizers and pesticides (Zhang et al.,
2022). The use of ICTs to automate and intelligently manage
agricultural cultivation and production is central to the concept
of “smart agriculture.” In particular, wireless communications play
a signiﬁcant role in the growth of agriculture, and each new
generation of wireless communication technology propels farming
toward a higher level of intelligence.
People and objects may connect in real-time thanks to the 5G
network-based Internet of Things (IoT), which provides important
services and value to millions of people across the world (Guevara
et al., 2020; Biswal et al., 2021). 5G network-based IoT has
developed organically into a gigantic technology platform. South
America has initiated a yearly warm-season tomato yield that
belongs to the Solanaceae family (Van Eck et al., 2019; Kumar
et al., 2022).
Despite requiring high amounts of fertilizer, tomato is a
popular or demanding plant due to its health signiﬁcance to the
whole world, with high levels of antioxidants such as carotenoid,
lycopene, and vitamins C and A and phenolic compounds, which
provide a wide range of health advantages for the consumers
(Campestrini et al., 2019; Samanta et al., 2020; Chen P. et al.,
2021). Tshiala and Olwoch reported that tomatoes have been used
in food preparation throughout the world as fresh vegetables or as
spices. It has a vital role in the Ethiopian marketing of vegetables
(Guodaar et al., 2020; Biswas et al., 2021). The production of
tomatoes was used as a job opportunity and as an income source
for producers.
Nutrient and water supplies have a signiﬁcant impact on tomato
quality, and their highest water demand is quoted in an unpublished
paper. Some poisonous elements and inorganic substances that are
dangerous to people can demonstrate water quality (Sanjuan-Delm´
as et al., 2020; Chen P. et al., 2021). This may be a problem for
irrigation using municipal wastewater. Although municipal
wastewaters have been applied as much as possible to irrigation,
they contain comparatively maximum sodium quantities that can
be accumulated with this wastewater and have toxic effects on plant
soils during optimized irrigation (Jayalakshmi and Gomathi, 2019;
Leuther et al., 2019; Casadei et al., 2021). The various types of crop
growth models are extremely useful in optimizing irrigation
practices which are based on physical or semi-empirical equations
for simpliﬁcation of the complex mechanism and also having many
parameters in the process (Sanjuan-Delm´as et al., 2020). Because
of its balance of simplicity, accuracy, and robustness, the AquaCrop
model developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
has provided a method for calculating crop yields and optimal
irrigation scheduling for various crops in different climates. In the
current real-time model, parameters like soil moisture (SM), crop
cultivation, leaf area index (LAI), or canopy cover (CC) are
collected using various remote sensing devices. As a result, this
real-time cultivation process is an upgraded and fully dynamic
version of the traditional models (Leuther et al., 2019; Chen P.
et al., 2021).
A fast and dependable Internet connection is necessary for
agricultural IoT devices to function. The current generation of
mobile networks is failing due to insufﬁcient connectivity in rural
areas, and even in areas with high-speed access, failure occurs due to
massive demand. According to a recent survey, nearly 80% of rural
areas, even in the United Kingdom, are outside of the 4G range. The
current degree of network access in rural areas is insufﬁcient in most
nations (Tang et al., 2021). In addition, in some developed
countries, there are multiple farms with a large number of IoT
devices and machines that require a constant reliable high-speed
Internet connection to exchange a large amount of data, and the
technologies of the current generation of mobile networks cannot
cope with these demands (Singh et al., 2022). To fulﬁll these goals,
many promising technologies, such as massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO), network slicing, and smaller cells, are
needed to provide reliable connectivity over a larger distance.
Therefore, the smart mobile network is well suited to support
smart farming by enabling wide coverage, low-energy
consumption, low-cost devices, and high spectrum efﬁciency.
Unfortunately, the IoT-based network’s usage of microwaves
(MWs) as carriers limits its ability to cover wide areas. The
introduction of small base stations spaced at roughly 250 m
intervals over coverage regions that can be extended to any size
allows for continuous connectivity, thanks to the small cell
concept. In order to link the bigger areas, the related small
towers can be placed everywhere (on lamp posts, in trees, on
roofs, on tops of vehicles, etc.). Similar to 4G, this implementation
makes use of the massive MIMO approach by equipping nodes
with many antennas for sending and receiving data in order to
increase the network’s capacity. On the other hand, huge MIMO
makes signal interference more likely. Beamforming is used to
increase the throughput of transmitted data and thereby solve this
issue. Beamforming refers to an antenna’s capability of directing
focused beams of radio waves at speciﬁc targets. An advanced
Internet connection provides very high (MW) operating
frequencies, and the accompanying high bandwidth makes it
possible for larger and more rapid data transactions. In contrast
to the static channels used by the 4G network, the cognitive radio
approach used by the smart network allows for device-speciﬁc
channel allocation.

In 2017, for the ﬁrst time, the 5G RuralFirst project successfully
planted and harvested a crop using autonomous tractors to sow
seeds, drones to monitor crops, and machines to apply water,
fertilizer, and pesticides. The entire procedure was carried out
without the need for any laborers. Another initiative, Hands Free
Hectare, claimed a successful harvest in 2018 (Al-Ghobari and
Mohammad, 2011). With greater technological breakthroughs, 5G
is projected to promote precision farming. As IoT-based network
coverage grows, agricultural sector producers will beneﬁt greatly,
allowing them to manage farms, animals, and other assets from the
comfort of their own homes, thanks to their big capacity, fast data
speed, and low latency. Smart technology will help to advance IoT
sensor connectivity to the next level, paving the way for
unprecedented innovation in smart farming components.
Implementing technology to automate, track, and monitor
agricultural processes is a wise solution to the irrigation problem.
The traditional irrigation method is fully automated by using IoT
integration modules. However, with an advanced network on the
horizon, smart agriculture will take off with lightning-fast
data transfer.
To improve farm produce quality, smart farming combines
traditional agronomic practices with the IoT. The application of
new technology in agriculture can assist farmers in reducing labor
and costs while increasing crop yield and production. To facilitate
all of these agricultural beneﬁts, the IoT includes a wide range of
components under digital and automated technologies. So, IoT-
based connectivity will vastly increase the impact due to low latency,
high bandwidth, and support for many sensors communicating at
the same time.
The IoT technology platform already helps to increase
productivity and ensure proper resource utilization through
precision agriculture. The implementation of IoT, on the other
hand, will help to accelerate the entire process with machine-to-
machine services. The real-time data transfer capabilities of the IoT
module can aid in the rapid operation of these solutions, making
decision-making quick, robust, data-oriented, and real-time. With
an IoT-based network, these devices can send real-time data about
the need for optimal irrigation, spoilt crops, and their location to
follow-up machinery. Farmers can save time and money by
harvesting crops quickly and effectively with automated irrigation
for tomato crop cultivation.
The key contributions of this paper are as follows:
•
An efﬁcient IoT-based framework is proposed for tomato
cultivation.
•
Moisture levels in the soil are predicted with the help of IoT
modules to optimize the irrigation system.
•
A mobile application is also developed that can help farmers
by providing useful information.
The remaining parts of the paper are arranged as follows. Section
2 discusses the literature review. Section 3 explains the things used
for designing smart farming solutions. Section 4 details the proposed
system and the methodology. The simulation setup and results
analyses are described in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 Literature review
Chen et al. (2019) discussed the proper utilization of water for
the growth of tomatoes by using the fuzzy neural network with a
genetic algorithm (GA). It predicted the volume of irrigation based
on the effect of greenhouse and the growth of crops (Guha et al.,
2021). Rodrı́guez et al (Rodr´ıguez-Ortega et al., 2019). developed a
soilless technique to yield tomato crops through the treatment of
salinity. Here, the salinity treatment was speciﬁcally used to
improve the production of vegetables and nutritional imbalance
(psychological of plants) for crops. Zhai et al. (2015) proposed an
idea for the cultivation of tomatoes using saline water and the
blossom-end rot technique. Implementing these two yield methods
enhanced the level of production.
In the study of Shao et al. (2014), two levels of irrigation
techniques were designed for heavy rain shelters and drainage
treatments for improving the productivity of crops. An optimum
irrigation management technique was designed for yielding quality
tomatoes through the proper arrangement of rain shelters (Keswani
et al., 2020; Maroli et al., 2021; Mousavi et al., 2021). In the study of
Gil et al. (2019), the smart grid system monitored the precision for
irrigation of water on demand using IoT. The authors added
desalination and solar energy processes in the agricultural system
for efﬁcient cultivation.
Krishna et al. (2017) designed a smart farming method for
intelligent water-saving irrigation using the Raspberry Pi module
and sensors. So, it automated the yielding of crops in a higher range
that regulates through IoT modules. Qiu et al. (2020) implemented
an in-depth process to collect phenotypic parameters for measuring
the growth of tomatoes. This system precisely calculated the
deﬁciency of water level and fertilizer with the help of a neural
network algorithm for the growth cycle of tomato (Khamparia et al.,
2020; Biswal et al., 2021). An intelligent irrigation system was
deﬁned as the water requirement for the yielding of tomatoes
during a various range of climate states by Mason et al. (2019). In
this study, smart irrigation was used in an adverse situation through
proper integration of the IoT module, sensors, and connectionless
environments (Chen M. et al., 2021).
In the agriculture industry, 4G/3G/NB-IoT wireless network
technology is used to connect IoT-based smart devices for the
purposes of data sharing, precise assessment, accurate calculation,
etc (Dell’Uomo and Scarrone, 2002). Although the 3G/4G
networking paradigm has shown much promise, there are still
several obstacles that may prevent it from being used to its full
potential in the agriculture sector. One of the main restraints is the
available working space. Existing wireless networks do not reach out
to rural areas or dense urban neighborhoods. Channel
circumstances, resource allocation, ﬂuctuating data rates, and
handoff problems between diverse networks all make it difﬁcult to
facilitate quality of service (QoS) in 4G networks (Payaswini and
Manjaiah, 2014; Payero et al., 2017). Mobile devices in this network
have a short lifespan due to the utilization of many antennas and
transmitters. Many modern agricultural sectors rely on battery-
powered technologies like drones and robots, but these have limited
usefulness in far-ﬂung crop ﬁelds. The number of IoT devices used

in smart farming, as well as the amount of research done on these
devices, is growing rapidly, necessitating greater intelligence, speed,
scalability, secure communication capabilities, and processing
power to handle the numerous complex computational tasks and
heavily utilized services. Having ultralow latency in addition to high
connection is necessary for IoT devices to achieve quick
performance and low costs.
The current 4G networks (LTE) are limited in their ability to
enable such functionalities because they only permit connectivity
through IP-based packet switching (Zhaogan et al., 2007). The shift
to 5G cellular networks will eliminate these problems caused by
previous generations of wireless technology. Due to advancements
in 5G connectivity, farmers now have the option of remotely
piloting a drone over extensive distances, either manually or via
predetermined checkpoints (Faraci et al., 2018; Sinha and
Dhanalakshmi, 2022). A farmer can get high-deﬁnition video
streams and other critical sensory data and telemetry from drones
in real time over the 5G cellular network, which is more efﬁcient
and reliable than previous-generation mobile networks
(Bhattacharya and De, 2021). Due to 5G technology, drones will
not need to carry a lot of computing power and instead can upload
their data to the cloud, where it will be processed more quickly.
To demonstrate the importance of smart agriculture,
Thilakarathne et al. (2023) show a cloud-enabled, low-cost
sensorized Internet of Things platform for monitoring and
automating processes related to a tomato plantation in a
controlled indoor setting. We hope that the information gleaned
from this study will be used as a foundation for advancing smart
agriculture solutions that boost productivity and quality and pave
the way for a more sustainable future.
Usman et al. (2022) present a 6G use case for plant health
monitoring using a terahertz (THz)-signal-based integrated
sensor and communication system. Precision agriculture is best
understood as a smart management system with the capacity to
track and regulate plant health and water levels on both a
microscopic and a macro scale. The objective is to maximize
output while minimizing waste of scarce resources. THz-based
sensing technology, which can evaluate plant health on a cellular
level, combined with wireless sensor networks installed within
crops to monitor multiple variables while making intelligent
decisions, could have signiﬁcant implications for agriculture. A
sustainable communication infrastructure that takes into account
the needs of dispersed and adaptable agricultural settings is
necessary for the integration and operation of such a macro–
nano-sensor system.
3 Materials and methods
The growth and productivity of plants depend mainly on how
much water is formed during the seedling phase. During this time,
water demand has an important effect on crops, which have many
environmental aspects like temperature, quality of soil, etc. The
application of IoT in agriculture is limitless, which provides various
intelligent devices to improve yielding performance and proﬁt
(Gomathy et al., 2020; Sivakumar et al., 2020). However, there are
various issues with investing in smart cultivation and also difﬁculty
in the development of agriculture-related IoT apps (Kamienski
et al., 2019; Conesa et al., 2021).
a) Hardware unit:
The information will inﬂuence the development of IoT
solutions for farming, and there is a need to select sensors to
create the custom device that will collect data for the proposed
solution (Althar and Samanta, 2021; Guha and Samanta, 2021;
Zhang et al., 2021). However, the quality of the sensors has a crucial
part in production which depends on the exactness of the collected
data and its consistency.
b) Brain unit:
Smart agriculture should be used as data analytics for a design
solution that will be helpful if yeomen cannot make sense of it, so
there is a need to use powerful data analytics techniques and relate
predictive algorithms and machine learning methods for
collecting data.
c) Maintenance unit:
Hardware maintenance is a signiﬁcant challenge for IoT-based
agriculture, while the sensors are commonly used in the crop ﬁeld.
There are more chances for damaged sensors, which needs to be
addressed by making a smart device that is robust and easy to
sustain. Otherwise, it needs to be replaced with another sensor.
d) Mobility stage:
Smart farming applications can be remotely monitored through
a smartphone or desktop computer for transmitting related yielding
information to the owner (Maheswari et al., 2021; Mekala et al.,
2021). The integration of devices should be autonomous and also
cover enough wireless range to communicate and send data to the
central server.
e) Infrastructure unit:
A solid and robust internal infrastructure needs to ensure that
the intelligent cropping process performs well and securely handles
the data load in it.
If the process disables the security, someone easily breaks the
entire system and steals related data or controls intelligent devices.
3.1 Agricultural/crop production system
The cultivation model can be used to monitor or calculate the
amount of native agricultural products, depending upon the
cultivated area and supported by the decision support system
(Nagarajan and Minu, 2018). Figure 1 shows the agricultural/crop
production prediction factors.
The number of exports and imports of agricultural products can
be derived from the prediction model of the National Statistical
Ofﬁce’s (NSO) statistics database as depicted in this section. The
agricultural product crop and yielded area models are worked under
the production of the smart agricultural prediction model, which
evaluates the updated method as well as the predecessor observation
method to reinterpret it.

where Ax,t is seeding in x yield design at t year, Ax,t−1 is seeding
in x yield design at t−1 year, RPx,t−1 is the marketplace value in x
yield design at t−1 year, and RPy,t is the market place value in y yield
design at t year.

1 is the
weather (temperature) in x yield design at t year, and WTx,t
2 is the
climate (amount of rainfall) in x yield design at t year.
The quantity of domestic products is the summation of
agricultural products of all individual yield areas and each
functional value of it (Gurunath et al., 2018; Mohanty et al., 2019;
Benyezza et al., 2021). The agricultural product amount is the
multiplication of the ﬁeld with the crop model.
The demand method of the crop is the multiplication of the
demand method per method in addition to the demands of the
whole community. The resource purposes of agricultural products
depend on export and import scenarios and other supporting
factors, as depicted in Figure 1. The above equations must follow
“Nerlove’s partial adjustment model,” and the regional weather
information can help concede the prediction although there are
some missing values (El-Zawily et al., 2019).
3.2 Challenges in the purpose system
Despite the many advantages that the 3G/4G networking
paradigm offers, there are still several obstacles that prevent it
from being used to its full potential in the agriculture industry.
Space constraints pose serious problems. Current wireless networks
are unable to reach more remote places or crowded metropolitan
neighborhoods. Supporting the quality of service (QoS) in 4G
networks is difﬁcult due to channel conditions, resource
allocation, varying data rates, and handoff problems between
heterogeneous networks. Due to the heavy use of antennae and
transmitters in this network, the lifespan of mobile devices is short.
In order for Internet of Things devices to deliver quick performance
at low prices, ultralow latency must be paired with a strong
connection. Due to the limitations of IP-based packet switching
connectivity on the existing 4G network (LTE), such features are
now unavailable. These issues, which have plagued earlier
generations of cellular networks, will be eradicated with the
transition to IoT-based networks.
Due to its massive data capacity and speeds greater than 10 Gbps,
IoT-based connection will be able to link billions of devices. For both
download and upload speeds, 5G networks are expected to be up to 100
times faster than their 4G and 4G LTE predecessors. 5G can connect
billions of devices due to its increased bandwidth, in addition to its large
data capacity and speeds faster than 10 Gbps. The download and upload
speeds of IoT-based networks will be up to 100 times faster than those of
4G and 4G LTE networks. Consequently, a 2-h movie that would take 6
min to download on 4G would take less than 4 s to download on an
advanced network. Technical speciﬁcations for 5G are being developed
by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The uplink peak
data rate is 10 Gbps, and the downlink peak data rate is 20 Gbps per
mobile station. Therefore, an IoT-enabled network is used for the
Internet of Things-based smart irrigation system, which allows for
remote monitoring of soil moisture and watering.
3.3 Mobile application
A mobile application is accessed by farmers on farms. Using this
application, we can make predictions utilizing insight data and the
collected cultivation insights data (Dhanush et al., 2017; Hota et al.,
2020; Maheswari et al., 2021). The mobile application will provide
crop-relevant information like crop health alerts, pest control, and
warehouse inventory managing warnings as shown below. The key
features of mobile applications are as follows:
•
observing yield health facts (nutrient levels, pH levels, etc.)
through the functionality of yield inspection (Ahmadi et al.,
2019),
•
the application of organizing fertilizer and insecticides for
the farm (Kiryushin, 2019),
•
automating the irrigation system and controlling water
levels as well as soil health over the farm (Al-Ali et al.,
2019; Li et al., 2020), and
•
tracing yield records and checking warehouse details (bin
inventories) (Quitaleg and Ortiz, 2020).

3.4 Impact of water quality on tomato yield
Tomato yield is a broad view that encompasses the interactions
of various single-quality attributes. Irrigation water salinity
enhanced tomato amounts, fruit thickness, soluble solids, total
acid, vitamin C, and the sugar–acid ratio (Magán et al., 2008).
Fresh tomato yield, canopy diameter, fruit water content,
tomato ﬁrmness, and calcium and nitrogen concentrations
decreased as water salinity levels increased, whereas increasing
salinity levels increased texture strength (Shao et al., 2014). In
addition, saline water irrigation increased tomato fruit’s total
soluble solids and acidity (pH) by 11.1% and 6.9%, respectively.
3.5 Role of the contactless IR sensors for
tomato crop growth measurement
The contactless IR sensors are used to produce infrared
radiation to measure the plant’s growth from its stem, whereas
the radiation is converted into some amount of electricity and is less
than 10 cm from the target. In the proposed system, sensors are
placed more than 10 cm from the plant, which will measure growth
by using a method based on the speculation of infrared energy. The
IR sensors are ﬁtted with infrared ﬁlters to avoid outside disturbing
light. IR sensors are ﬁtted to measure the thickness growth of
tomato crops through the analog output voltage. The energy
radiations of infrared sensors are transformed into distance data,
which is not directly propositional to distance data.
4 Proposed system and methods
The evapotranspiration (ET) crop is described as the amount of
water necessary for the perfect growth of various crops in
connection with the lack of water by evapotranspiration which is
discussed in this system. The demand for yielding waters refers to
an optimally developed harvest, so that a consistent, disease-free
crop is actively cultivated and completely sheltered. An advanced
network can connect billions of devices due to its increased
bandwidth, in addition to its large data capacity and speeds faster
than 10 Gbps. The download and upload speeds of smart networks
will be up to 100 times faster than those of 4G and 4G LTE
networks. So, this method is advantageous in addition to IoT
modules, which gives a perfect way to produce tomatoes in the
seasonal and non-seasonal periods. The cultivation process is
mainly inﬂuenced by the following situations like weather, yield
type, and development stage of the harvest, which is depicted in
Figures 2, 3.
The proposed system is integrated with the following
components which are described below:
i. Arduino Uno microcontroller:
It is an open-source microcontroller that can be programmed
by writing C or C++ code to control the overall system automation.
After installing and programming the Arduino, it is ready to collect
the number of inputs from IR moisture soil sensors and also provide
a remote command to control the irrigation system. However, this
microcontroller remotely controls the overall execution process.
ii. NIR-soil moisture sensor:
Soil moisture is a main attribute of soil and an important soil
property that plays a vital role in a variety of farming activities,
hydrological processes, and environmental concerns. A near-
infrared (NIR) reﬂectance sensor is created for the calculation of
moisture levels in the soil by implementing two light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) of different wavelengths: one with a wavelength of
1,945 nm and a strong water absorption band and the other with a
wavelength of 1,850 nm and a weak water absorption band. It is
linked to an Arduino controller to record the moisture level of the
soil. Accordingly, it gives instructions to the water controller for
irrigation in the tomato cultivation land.
iii. Pinolex drip automatic water controller:
The smart ﬂower irrigation timer is an efﬁcient way to manage
and control tomato crop irrigation needs. When you go on vacation
or anywhere, an automatic water timer is set by the Arduino
microcontroller, which is useful for watering tomato cultivation.
It ﬁts a 3/4-inch (19 mm) thread tap. It can water the plants
regularly, even when no one is at home, and thus improve their
survival rate.
iv. Wi-Fi access point:
FIGURE 2

A high-speed Ethernet wire links a router to an access point,
which transforms a connection-oriented signal into a
connectionless signal. Connectionless connectivity is typically the
only available option for base stations, which use Wi-Fi to establish
links with destination devices. As a result, the Wi-Fi service is linked
to the 5G Internet, and it then provides a direct link with the end
user to remotely monitor and control automatic irrigation as well as
tomato crop cultivation.
4.1 Working principle of the model
The purpose model generally performs the operation in the
following steps:
Step 1:
First of all, the NIR contactless sensor observes the moisture
level of the soil. As a result, it is connected near the tomato plant to
collect soil moisture. A ﬁeld’s soil moisture status is critical for
making planting, fertilizer application, and irrigation decisions.
Step 2:
Secondly, the moisture levels are observed through the Arduino
Uno module, which is also linked with a Wi-Fi access point to send
all the data to the mobile applications with the help of 5G
technology. The 5G network helps to gather the moisture levels
through the cloud service and automatically regulates the
irrigation system.
Step 3:
When the moisture level is monitored through the mobile app,
then the drip irrigation system is smartly controlled through the
5G-enabled IoT module (Arduino Uno microcontroller).
4.2 Evaporation and
transpiration processes
Evaporation and transpiration happen at the same time, and
there is no way to talk about them separately. The fraction of solar
radiation that reaches the cropped soil surface is used to calculate
evaporation. However, once the crop has matured to the point that
it completely covers the soil surface, transpiration becomes the ﬁrst
process. IoT module sensors properly calculate the moisture level of
the soil with the help of the calculation process of ET.
Evapotranspiration is commonly deﬁned in mm/time, and
water quantity lost from a cropped plane is deﬁned in water
depth units. Because 2 hectares has an area of 20,000 m2 and 2
mm equals 0.002 m, a loss of 2 mm of water corresponds to a loss of
10 m3 of water per hectare. Finally, 2 mm day−1 corresponds to 10
m3 ha−1 day−l.
The quantity of energy received per unit area can also be used to
characterize water depths, with energy referring to the amount of
heat or energy required to evaporate free water. The latent heat of
evaporation (l) varies with the temperature of water. At 21°C, for
example, l is approximately 2.50 MJ kg−1. To put it another way,
2.50 MJ is required to evaporate 2 kg or 0.002 m3 of water.
4.3 Impact of weather on the yielding
water requires reference crop
evapotranspiration ETo
The main impact of weather information on crop water
requirements is sunshine, temperature, moisture, and wind speed.
FIGURE 3
Test scenario of the irrigation system.

The reference crop evapotranspiration deﬁnes the evaporation energy
of the atmosphere (ETo). Reference crop evapotranspiration, also
known as reference evapotranspiration, is the evapotranspiration
rate from a reference surface that is not deﬁcient in water and is
expressed as ETo.
ETo values measured in distinct locations or climates are
equivalent because they indicate identical reference surfaces.
These variables inﬂuencing ETo can be parameters for climate,
which can be measured using climate information. ETo intimates at
a given location, the evaporating energy of the atmosphere.
In this research domain, different techniques are available for
calculating ETo. It is tested either by an evapotranspiration pan or
theoretically by using calculated weather information.
4.3.1 Saucepan (pan) evaporation technique
The saucepan evaporation technique allows an environment to
monitor the combined inﬂuence of temperature, moisture, wind
speed, and sunlight on the reference yield evapotranspiration ETo.
The various evaporation pans are class A evaporation pan and
Sunken Colorado pan. The evaporation saucepan is used in the
following equation:
ETo = Kpan  Epan
(3)
where Kpan is the pan coefﬁcient, Epan is the pan evaporation,
and ETo is the reference yield evapotranspiration.
4.3.2 Blaney–Criddle technique
The Blaney–Criddle method is a theoretical technique to
determine the reference yield evapotranspiration ETo, and more
literary techniques have been used, but many of them were locally
calculated. If the process is accessed locally, if it is available or if
local procedures are not available, then the theoretical method is
used for the calculation.
ETo = P(0:46Tmean + 8)
(4)
Tmax = omonth(max)
Ndays=month
Tmin = omonth(min)
Ndays=month
Tmean = Tmax+Tmin
2
(5)
Where ETo = 1 month of average period,
Tmean = regular temperature, and
P = regular proportion of yearly day time periods.
4.4 Impact of yield type on yield water
requires Kc
The single crop coefﬁcient Kc plays a signiﬁcant role in crop
characteristics as well as the averaged effects of soil evaporation.
Average crop coefﬁcients are more relevant and convenient than Kc
computed on a daily time step using a separate crop and soil
coefﬁcient for normal irrigation planning and management,
development of basic irrigation schedules, and most hydrologic
water balance studies (Farg et al., 2012). The impact of yield type on
the yielding water requires dealing with the yield type and the
development yield stage on water needs. The ﬁeld is harvested
between the relationship of reference grown yield and grown yield.
ETY ield = ETo  Kc
(6)
where ETYield = yield evapotranspiration process (month/day),
Kc = yield inﬂuence, and ETo = reference evapotranspiration. Here,
ETYield and ETo are stated in equal units in month/day.
4.4.1 Manipulation of the overall growing stage
From the beginning of transplantation to the last day, the
overall growing stage of the crop is determined. It is primarily
inﬂuenced by the following:
•
the various harvest and its multiplicity,
•
the condition of the weather, and
•
the different stages of planting on the ﬁeld.
4.4.2 Manipulation of growth stages
The manipulation of the overall growing stages of yield is
divided into four stages:
•
the analysis of the yield ﬁrst stage,
•
the observation of the yield development stage in a ﬁeld,
•
the mid-time cultivation stage, and
•
the late-time growth stage of the crop.
4.5 Different steps of estimation of the
crop water requirement
The analysis of the requirement of aquatic crops ETcrop is
evaluated as:
ETcrop = ETo  Kc
(7)
4.5.1 Yield of water quantity requirement of
tomatoes
Table 1 shows the given details of the crop.
Method of calculation:
Step 1: The distinct growth stages of crop estimation are
considered (see Table 2).
Step 2: The month-wise tomato crop’s growth stages are
observed (see Table 3).
Step 3: The Kc factor for each of the four stages is estimated as
(López-López et al., 2014):
Kc, the starting stage of the crop = 0.45
Kc, the development stage of the crop = 0.75
Kc, the mid–time stage of the crop = 1.15
Kc, the late–time stage of the crop = 0.8

Kc = 0:80
Kc : Mar = 5
30 1:15 + 25

Every month is supposed to have 30 days.

Table 4 shows the water requirement for the complete growing
time of tomato crop, which is 638 mm.
5 Simulation setup and results analysis
In the proposed system, the related experimental data are received
through the installed soil moisture and humidity sensor from the
tomato crop ﬁeld. The NIR REES52 Soil Sensor is used to collect the
percentage of moisture in the soil. Based on this,an irrigation process is
automated with a developed mobile application which is depicted in
Figure 4. By using this app, the status of soil moisture and the growth of
plants can be dynamically observed, and the irrigation method can also
be controlled. Similarly, the plant growth parameters like maximum
height, width, and diameter of the stem of the tomato plant are
measured using an infrared sensor. This is tested in a regional area
28 m in length and 7 m in width, but the experimental site is portioned
into two rows, and tomatoes are planted 4 m in length and 1.2 m in
width zone. On the other hand, 50-cm-high PVC plates are applied for
separation from communities, and a 50-cm row spacing is followed for
the plantation of tomatoes. Data are captured continuously from the
ﬁeld of cultivation. The fog nodes are implemented for sensing data in
the area of cultivation. The overall implementation of the proposed
work is depicted in Figure 5.
The cultivation time to the collection period is from 1
November 2020 to 18 April 2021, as depicted in Figure 6, but it is
drawn from the above data (Table 4), which is deﬁned in step 5. The
cultivation of the tomato growth period is evaluated as the crop
sowing period to seedling period (November 1 to December 5), the
development stage of the crop period (December 6 to January 15),
the mid-time stage (ﬂowering) of the growth period (January 16 to
February 5), and the late-time stage of growth (fruiting and mature
picking) period (February 6 to March 30). The analysis of irrigation
data for tomato cropping depends on the relevant factor of the soil
moisture sensor at 22 cm depth. This measure predicts the volume
of irrigation.
By the observation of moisture level from the above, Table 5
shows a dynamic way of the automatic required level of irrigation
for tomato cultivation (Figure 7).
Table 6 shows a feature-wise comparison of this paper with the
existing literature. The existing work has been mostly considered
under normal cultivation methods. However, in the proposed work,
it is found that 5G technology is integrated with the IoT module. As
a result, the irrigation system is working intelligently for
the cultivation.
In Table 7, we can see how the 5G network stacks up against
other existing network generations. High-deﬁnition video streaming
and telephony were made possible on the road by 4G networks, an
improvement above 3G. As network trafﬁc has increased, the
theoretical maximum for 4G speeds has been reached. According
to the ITU, the most recent 5G use cases fall into one of three
categories: ultrareliable low latency communications (URLLC),
massive machine type communications (mMTC), and enhanced
mobile broadband (eMBB).
Table 8 shows that Odisha is in the ﬁfth position all over India.
This table shows only the seasonal production of tomatoes in India.
If the display of tomatoes is required to produce in non-seasonal
duration (August to October), then the state Odisha is considered in
the third position. The implementation of the intelligent cultivation
method improves the situation in the production table.
Table 9 shows the exportation of tomatoes from India to other
countries. The export is done in the seasonal duration of
production, but it is required to export in a non-seasonal period
through intelligent irrigation techniques. Table 10 shows the
importation of tomatoes to India in the case of seasonal duration.
The IoT-based intelligent irrigation method provides a technique to
cultivate tomatoes in the non-seasonal period, so that there is no
need to import from outside of the country, which gives better
performance than the traditional cultivation process.
6 Conclusion with future work
In this approach, traditional ﬁelds such as agriculture require
technology (here, smart farming) to achieve higher crop yields with
less human intervention in a limited time frame. Smart farming, on
the other hand, necessitates signiﬁcant investment, improved
coverage and connectivity, and more bandwidth to manage the

massive amount of data generated by a huge number of sensors and
equipment deployed remotely. Although the 4G network has a huge
capacity and adequate coverage, it is unable to transmit the massive
amount of real-time data between a large number of devices. The
introduction of 5G meets current criteria and demands in smart
farming to boost output with minimal human effort. Thus, the
production of tomatoes mostly suffers due to improper
management of moisture levels and irrigation.
To overcome this problem, a smart irrigation system was
proposed by using the IoT framework. The required moisture

levels and the amount of water were predicted to improve the
production of tomato yield. IoT modules were used to optimally
evaluate the requirement for water amount and smartly process the
irrigation system. A mobile application was also developed that can
help farmers by providing useful information. Extensive
experimental results indicated that the proposed model can
smartly optimize the irrigation system which helps to improve
tomato production. Based on the simulation results and analyses of
previously stored data, our platform could be used to generate
important analytics of real-time monitoring, enabling decisions and
actions like managing the irrigation system or building alters, for
example. Throughout our trial, we have only encountered a few
restrictions, such as the need for a reliable power source and
wireless connectivity to communicate with the cloud. A
comparison of the proposed model and other existing networks
was included in the manuscript as shown in Table 6.
In the near future, we will implement the proposed framework for
other crops. Additionally, we will evaluate the suggested framework in
a simulated environment by combining the nodes and transferring data
based on criteria such as lifetime, throughput, and latency. More
application-speciﬁc case studies would be helpful in tailoring the
general framework for QoS assurance.

Genetic
optimization
T-S fuzzy
neural
network
model (Chen
et al., 2019)
The modiﬁed genetic
algorithm is used to
optimize the weights and
thresholds of the T-S fuzzy
neural network. Finally, the
genetic optimization T-S
fuzzy neural network is
utilized to simulate and
estimate the irrigation
volume for greenhouse
tomatoes based on the real
data set.
The experimental
data were collected
at the
Xiaotangshan
National Precision
Agriculture
Research and
Demonstration
Base’s tomato
sunshine
greenhouse in
Beijing’s
Changping
District.
A water-saving irrigation decision-making
algorithm based on genetic optimization T-S
fuzzy neural network was developed to
optimize greenhouse tomato irrigation water
resource consumption.
We also used the revised
genetic algorithm to tune
the initial weights and
thresholds of the T-S fuzzy
neural network.
Furthermore, using the real
data set, we assessed the
accuracy of the GA-
TSFNN by simulating and
predicting greenhouse
tomato irrigation volume.
The
optimization
algorithm and
constraint
operators are
not properly
included, which
is why it is
required to be
improved.
IoT-based
model using
Raspberry Pi
(Krishna
et al., 2017)
A unique wireless mobile
robot based on the Internet
of Things (IoT) is created
and implemented to
perform diverse ﬁeld
operations.
The various data
are collected
through all the
sensors such as
thermo hygro
sensor, soil
moisture,
humidity,
ultraviolet, CO2,
ultrasonic, and pH.
This suggested wireless robot is outﬁtted with
a variety of sensors that measure various
environmental conditions. It also includes the
Raspberry Pi 2 model B hardware for running
the entire process. The major characteristics
of this revolutionary intelligent wireless robot
are that it can perform activities such as
moisture detection, scaring birds and animals,
spraying pesticides, moving forward or
backward, and switching an electric motor
ON/OFF.
It is outﬁtted with a variety
of sensors to monitor
various environmental
conditions relevant to crop
yield. Wireless crop
monitoring reduces labor
costs while also allowing
for accurate tracking of
changes that occur in real
time in the ﬁeld.
The
construction of
this model is
not always
friendly to the
environment
and is
expensive.
IoT and Big
Data-enabled
self-driven
model
(Keswani
et al., 2020)
This research focuses on the
efﬁcient control of farm
irrigation by leveraging the
capabilities of the Internet of
Things (IoT) and Big Data-
based decision support
system (DSS) to generate
appropriate valve control
orders.
The proposed IoT
node deployment
approach, which
has been ﬁeld-
tested, is used to
capture real-time
data.
An integrated IoT-based DSS framework is
suggested to collect 17 soil and ambient
characteristics in order to forecast future
changes in soil moisture levels in 1 h.
Irrigation regulation by
zone and crop is a key
responsibility in all
agricultural ﬁelds. The
suggested IoT deployment
framework has been
thoroughly tested in the
ﬁeld to obtain uniform soil
moisture levels throughout
the target crop-speciﬁc
zones.
The irrigation
system is not all
climate-
supported,
which means it
needs to be
improved.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.
n summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

  data_sources: Literature review and analysis of existing wireless communication
    protocols and their applications in smart irrigation systems.
  explanation: The study's main goal is to investigate and compare the available wireless
    communication protocols for creating smart irrigation systems in greenhouses.
    It presents a detailed comparison of various global and local communication protocols,
    messaging protocols, and their applicability to smart irrigation in a greenhouse
    environment. The study also explores the factors to consider when selecting the
    optimal protocols for a specific implementation, such as power consumption, range,
    reliability, and scalability.
  extract_1: The study found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication
    protocol for smart irrigation in greenhouses due to its large number of nodes
    and long range. MQTT is recommended as the messaging protocol for smart greenhouse
    irrigation because of its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS)
    options.
  extract_2: GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for
    smart greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost.

  limitations: The study focuses on comparing wireless communication protocols for
    greenhouse irrigation, so its scope may not cover other aspects of real-time irrigation
    management, such as data collection and processing.
  main_objective: To compare and evaluate wireless communication protocols for the
    implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors
    such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability.
  relevance_evaluation: This study directly addresses the point of focus, which is
    a comparison of application layer protocols (e.g., XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, HTTP) for
    real-time irrigation management. It provides valuable insights into the suitability
    of these protocols for data transmission in smart irrigation systems by analyzing
    their strengths, weaknesses, and limitations in this specific context.

  data_sources: Unspecified
  explanation: The study focuses on the development of a smart irrigation system that
    utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) and its related protocols to optimize water
    usage in agriculture. The proposed system employs a combination of sensors and
    microcontrollers to collect environmental data such as temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture, which is transmitted to a cloud-based platform via MQTT (Message
    Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. The cloud platform analyzes the data and
    controls the irrigation process based on predetermined parameters, adjusting water
    flow to meet crop-specific requirements and minimize water wastage. This automated
    and real-time irrigation management allows farmers to remotely monitor and manage
    their irrigation systems, optimizing water usage and crop productivity.
  extract_1: '"MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained
    devices and low-bandwidth networks, making it well-suited for IoT applications
    where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical. MQTT uses a
    simple message format and a minimal header, resulting in a small message size
    and reduced overhead."'
  extract_2: '"In contrast, protocols like SOAP and HTTP are more heavyweight and
    require more bandwidth and processing power. While they offer features such as
    security and reliability, these protocols may not be optimal for resource-constrained
    IoT devices or applications where real-time data transmission is essential."'

  key_findings: MQTT is a lightweight and efficient protocol well-suited for real-time
    irrigation management, while protocols like SOAP and HTTP are more heavyweight
    and may not be optimal for resource-constrained IoT devices. The choice of protocol
    depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency.
  limitations: The study focuses on evaluating the suitability of application layer
    protocols for real-time irrigation management, but it does not delve into the
    specific implementation details or performance analysis of these protocols in
    a real-world irrigation system. Additionally, the study does not consider the
    impact of factors such as network latency and security on the performance of these
    protocols.
  main_objective: To evaluate the suitability of application layer protocols (MQTT,
    XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP) for real-time irrigation management in the context
    of data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point of comparison of
    application layer protocols for real-time irrigation management. The study evaluates
    the suitability of MQTT, XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP protocols in the context of
    real-time irrigation systems, considering factors like data transmission speed,
    reliability, and energy efficiency. The findings and insights presented in the
    paper contribute to a better understanding of the strengths and limitations of
    these protocols, aiding in the selection of the most appropriate protocol for
    specific irrigation scenarios.

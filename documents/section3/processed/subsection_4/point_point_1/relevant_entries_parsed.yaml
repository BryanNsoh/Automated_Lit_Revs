  extract_1: 'System models are graph models. Existing methods use various system
    models. We can distinguish, for example:


    - Task Graph (TG): one of the simplest and most popular methods of representing
    functions at the system level. It is a directed acyclic graph in which nodes represent
    tasks and edges represent the order in which tasks are performed (usually representing
    transmissions). The task is activated when all preceding ones are completed. In
    this way, sequential dependencies between tasks are presented. Transmission volumes
    are represented by edge weights. A sample task graph is shown in Figure 1. The
    graph describes a six-task system. Tasks on the same path in the graph are sequentially
    executed, while tasks from parallel paths can be executed in parallel. Extended
    versions of task graphs can also be found in the literature, e.g., conditional
    task graphs and multimodal task graphs [50,51].


    - Synchronization Data Flow (SDF) or Static Data Flow (SSDF): models representing
    data flow (often used in modeling telecommunications applications). Like the TG,
    SDF is a directed graph. Unlike the TG, cycles can occur in SDF. The synchronization
    mechanism is described by determining the number of tags generated by the execution
    of a given task (for each output edge). The number of tags taken from each input
    is also specified for each task. The task is activated if the required number

- explanation: 'Network coding (NC) is a technique that can be utilized to improve
    the network’s throughput, efficiency, and scalability, which can also be leveraged
    to improve the network resilience to attacks and eavesdropping. NC allows the
    network’s intermediate nodes (e.g., relays) to accumulate arriving messages and
    forward a newly encoded message, which is a linear combination of the accumulated
    packets, multiplying them by coefficients chosen from a finite field. The manner
    in which nodes encode and decode messages depends on the selected coding scheme.
    Network coding (NC) over wireless communication can reduce the number of transmissions
    by leveraging the fact that a single transmission is overheard by multiple nodes
    in the transmitter’s vicinity, and can therefore be utilized by each of these
    nodes, which will forward a coded packet with unique coefficients comprising its
    own message and the messages it overheard (e.g., [155]).

    In WSNs, NC can be utilized for various traffic patterns, including data dissemination
    (one-to-many communication) and data gathering. Works on energy-efficient NC-based
    dissemination can be followed in the survey [156], with multi-hop routing being
    emphasized. In data dissemination in which the base station/sink distributes information
    to the sensor nodes, NC is beneficial mainly for distributing control messages
    (broadcast or multicast traffic) or, in case of unicast traffic, for recovering
    lost packets (retransmissions). The latter utilization relies on the fact that
    different nodes heard or did not hear different packets. Accordingly, nodes store
    packets they overheard, even if not destined to themselves. The transmitter (e.g.,
    access-point) accumulates several packets that need to be retransmitted, each
    for a different receiver. It transmits a coded packet that is a composite of these
    accumulated packets. Each receiver can decode a missing packet by utilizing its
    stored overheard packets (e.g., [157–162], where the last two mainly focus on
    data dissemination of control management messages. It is noteworthy that Cohen
    et al. [157] also present a successful real HW radio deployment of their scheme.
    XOR-CoW [163] exploits the same concept to design an IoT protocol in which relays
    transmit coded packets that mix downlink and uplink traffic. Similar to other
    previously mentioned studies, the coding scheme by Swamy et al. [163] is over
    finite Galois field of size 2 (GF(2)) (i.e., XORing the coded packets).'

  extract_1: '**Temperature Measurement**


    Temperature monitoring technologies enable the study of geological processes and
    the investigation of subsurface thermal properties. Table 2 lists some of the
    temperature measurement technologies applied in complex systems.


    The principles of these specific temperature measurement technologies are further
    described in this subsection.


    **2.1.1. Static Installations**


    Static installations deploy thermistors, thermocouples, ﬁbre optic thermometers
    or

    DTS technology. Thermistors are sensors capable of measuring high-quality temperature–depth
    information from boreholes up to 100 m or more below the Earth’s surface [19].
    Thermocouples are installed to measure temperatures at the inlets and outlets
    of geothermal heat exchangers [20]. Wired optical sensors provide continuous measurements
    with high-resolution temperature proﬁles along pipelines [18] and are often attached
    to the outer surface of the pipe wall or located within the underground structure
    itself [21].


    DTS technology is used for temperature measurements along various types of under-ground
    geothermal structures. Measurements are based on detecting light from Rayleigh,
    Raman or Brillouin backscattering phenomena [15]. DTS technology measures tempera-tures
    using optical ﬁbres that provide a continuous temperature distribution proﬁle
    of the entire cable [22]. This method is able to achieve highly accurate temperature
    measurements over long distances, up to 30 km. This technology is very sensitive
    for monitoring temper-ature, as it is characterized by a spatial resolution of
    1 m at an accuracy of ±1 ◦C and a resolution of 0.01 ◦C [23]. This technology
    works by detecting thermal changes along the optical ﬁbre that manifest as molecular
    or lattice vibrations in the material. In addition, thermal changes cause local
    changes in the refractive index. Changes in the refractive index

    are then manifested as the inelastic scattering of transmitted light. Molecular
    vibrations at

    high frequencies around 10 THz cause Raman scattering. Brillouin scattering is
    caused by

    low-frequency vibrations in the range of 10 to 30 GHz. This scattering can then
    be used to

    measure the temperature along the ﬁbre [24].


    DTS technology is widely applied to inspect subsurface thermal properties. DTS
    can

    be used in various applications, such as investigating the hydro-geological conditions

    of downholes or determining the geological properties of aquifers. Especially
    in deep

    boreholes, its application provides notable beneﬁts over discrete-point temperature
    mea-surements [5]. DTS is widely used in long-term monitoring to determine the
    contribution

    of groundwater ﬂow and thermophysical characteristics to subsurface heat transfer
    and

    storage [16]. This type of technology is used to monitor the conditions inside
    well bores to

    optimize expensive workover procedures [17].


    **2.1.2. Mobile Sensing**


    Mobile sensing systems such as Geoball and Geosniff are small spheres 25 mm in

    diameter and 8 g in weight that have an embedded transceiver, microcontroller,
    temperature sensor and power supply. These miniaturized sensors are inserted into
    the pipes of a

    geothermal underground structure and are then carried by the thermal ﬂuid in order
    to monitor the thermal parameters of the ﬂuid along the borehole heat exchanger.
    These

    sensor systems allow the acquisition of information on the thermal properties
    of the

    subsurface geological structure and their inﬂuence on the thermal properties of
    the borehole.


    A wireless data processing unit sends data and acquires conﬁgurational information
    prior

    to measurement and retrieves measured thermal data from a sensor inside the U-tube
    of

    the borehole heat exchanger [18].'
  extract_2: '**3.4. Edge Computing**


    Edge computing is a method with enormous potential for IoT geothermal monitoring.

    Edge computing allows some computation and data storage to be moved closer to
    the

    source of the data, enabling the optimization of IoT node transmissions.


    Geothermal installations make use of a speciﬁc IoT domain. Table 8 provides a

    summary of some service-oriented architectures for edge computing methods suitable

    for use in geothermal installations. Early warning systems can monitor a geothermal

    installation and evaluate hazardous states. An example of this type of solution
    is an

    early warning system for railway bridges [105]. Edge computing also allows the
    real-time

    monitoring of natural disasters such as ﬁres [106] or earthquakes [107]. These
    solutions

    tolerate multiple node faults and partial network disruptions and store all data
    locally,

    which also enhances privacy [107].


    Other types of edge computing methods manage data compression. Data compression

    performed locally signiﬁcantly reduces the volume of data for transmission [109].
    Data

    compression can be lossy or lossless. The scientiﬁc literature on data compression
    in edge

    computing is vast [110].'
  limitations:
  - IoT devices have the potential to revolutionize geothermal monitoring, but they
    also pose several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure reliable operation
    and minimize the generation of erroneous data.
  - The advance of IoT technology has brought about a push for standardization in
    various aspects of its implementation.
  - In contrast, telemetry systems often lack standardization and are often proprietary,
    leading to increased expenses and longer development cycles.

    are equipped with various sensors that enable them to perform the tasks they were

    to them appropriately.


    For example, if the room temperature is too high, the heating devices will be

- explanation: Leaf spectral reﬂectance, which is measured using optical sensors,
    is a non-invasive and rapid technique to assess both biotic and abiotic stresses
    in plants. Hyperspectral imaging, multispectral imaging, thermal imaging, and
    ﬂuorescence spectroscopy are commonly used methods to capture the spectral reﬂectance
    of plant leaves. Machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines
    and artiﬁcial neural networks, are employed to extract meaningful patterns from
    the spectral data and classify different stress types. The paper outlines the
    relevant theory, technical approaches, advantages, and limitations of these methods
    for researchers in automated systems for real-time irrigation management.

    beet. Remote Sensing, 10(5), 787.
  data_sources: Reflectance measurements
  explanation: "Precision phenotyping and remote sensing technology have shown great\
    \ promise in rapidly and accurately evaluating plant performance in field trials.\
    \ Hyperspectral imagery captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged\
    \ as a powerful tool due to its ability to collect data in multiple spectral bands,\
    \ providing information about crop traits such as chlorophyll content, nitrogen\
    \ status, and biomass. In this study, hyperspectral UAV imagery was used to assess\
    \ the response of sugar beet cultivars to infection by the beet cyst nematode\
    \ (BCN), Heterodera schachtii. The study aimed to determine whether hyperspectral\
    \ data could be used to discriminate between nematode-susceptible and -tolerant\
    \ cultivars and predict sugar yield, with the ultimate goal of improving breeding\
    \ efforts for BCN resistance.\n\nThe study was conducted in a field trial with\
    \ nine different sugar beet cultivars, representing a range of susceptibility\
    \ to BCN. Hyperspectral data were collected at two time points during the growing\
    \ season using a UAV-mounted hyperspectral imager. The data were used to calculate\
    \ a number of spectral vegetation indices (SIs), which are mathematical combinations\
    \ of reflectance values at different wavelengths that are known to be related\
    \ to specific plant traits. The SIs were then used to train machine learning algorithms\
    \ to classify the cultivars according to their susceptibility to BCN and to predict\
    \ sugar yield. The results showed that hyperspectral data could be used to discriminate\
    \ between nematode-susceptible and -tolerant cultivars with high accuracy. The\
    \ SIs that were most useful for discrimination included those related to chlorophyll\
    \ content, nitrogen status, and biomass. \n\nThe study also found that hyperspectral\
    \ data could be used to predict sugar yield with reasonable accuracy. The SIs\
    \ that were most useful for predicting yield were those related to chlorophyll\
    \ content and biomass. The results of this study suggest that hyperspectral UAV\
    \ imagery has the potential to be a valuable tool for improving breeding efforts\
    \ for BCN resistance in sugar beet. Hyperspectral data can be used to rapidly\
    \ and accurately assess the performance of different cultivars in field trials,\
    \ and to identify promising candidates for further evaluation. This information\
    \ can help breeders to develop new cultivars that are more resistant to BCN and\
    \ more productive."
  extract_1: SIs extracted from the hyperspectral imager were able to differentiate
    between the two types of cultivars from group C. After 102 days, the main differences
    between susceptible and tolerant cultivars were related to biomass (NDVI), chlorophyll
    content of the leaves (780/700, CHLG) and general stress (HI). At 152 das, susceptible
    cultivars could also be differentiated from the tolerant ones using the SIs related
    to water content (NDWI1650, NDWI).
  extract_2: The SIs extracted from the UAV hyperspectral imager were not able to
    differentiate between the two types of cultivars from group C. However, CHLG and
    ANTH SIs allowed to differentiate cultivars after 102 and 152 das, respectively.

    Hyperspectral imaging, which captures images across a wide range of wavelengths
    beyond the visible spectrum, provides valuable information about plant health.
    One important application of hyperspectral imaging in plant stress detection involves
    the analysis of reflectance at specific wavelength bands. For example, variations
    in the red-edge position, which marks the transition from red to near-infrared
    reflectance, have been linked to changes in chlorophyll content and leaf structure,
    making it a potential indicator of plant stress.


    Another key aspect of hyperspectral imaging in plant stress detection is the analysis
    of spectral signatures. By comparing the spectral signatures of healthy and stressed
    plants, researchers can identify specific wavelengths or wavelength ranges that
    exhibit significant differences. These spectral signatures can then be used to
    develop classification algorithms for automated detection of plant stress.'

    Hatfield and Pinter, 1993; Jackson, 1986; Nilsson, 1995; Sankaran et al., 2010;
    West et al., 2003), most studies have focused on foliar pathogens in annual crops,
    where disease symptoms are mainly characterized by distinct color changes in the
    aerial parts of the plant. The technology also has shown potential for detecting
    root diseases in several crops (e.g., Raikes and Burpee, 1998; Reynolds et al.,

  explanation: This study uses a sensory system called a “leaf monitor” to predict

    trees within the orchards, and sensors on the monitors collected data on leaf
    temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, photosynthetically active radiation

    to compute the Modified Crop Water Stress Index (MCWSI), which was used to quantify
    the water status of the trees. This index was calibrated against measured SWP,
    the standard method for determining plant water stress (PWS). These relationships

  explanation: This study investigates the use of real-time soil matric potential
    measurements to optimize almond irrigation scheduling and explores the potential
    for deficit irrigation to limit negative effects on crop productivity. The authors
    found that a soil water potential threshold (SWPT) of -45 kPa resulted in significant

    water than the grower treatment, with no decrease in average yield. A SWPT of
    −45 kPa is therefore recommended in sandy loam soils under San Joaquin Valley
    conditions between May and harvest to reduce irrigation water use without diminishing
    productivity.

    for non-invasive plant stress detection. The researchers conducted field experiments
    with onions, manipulating irrigation levels and soil amendment to induce varying
    stress levels. They collected spectral measurements using both a field spectrometer
    (Apogee) and the SCIO scanner and used machine learning to classify the onion
    treatments based on the spectral features. The results showed that the Apogee

  explanation: The Water Index (WI), based on the reflectance of light at specific
    wavelengths, has been shown to track changes in stomatal conductance and is therefore
    a potential indicator of plant water status. In this study, potted grapevine plants
    subjected to contrasting water availability were examined to determine the feasibility
    of using the WI to estimate vine water status at the leaf and canopy levels. The
    results showed that the WI tracked changes in leaf stomatal conductance and was
    closely related to canopy transpiration under a range of moderate to severe water
    stress. The authors conclude that the WI effectively tracked variation in stomatal
    conductance and canopy transpiration under moderate to severe water stress and
    could be a useful tool for monitoring vineyard water status in precision viticulture.
  extract_1: In agreement with other studies conducted in potted plants (Medrano et
    al., 2002) different irrigation supply did not translate into significant differences
    in Ψp. Nonetheless, despite similar Ψp values in both treatments, deficit plants
    underwent earlier decreases in gas exchange parameters (A, gs and E) along the
    day when compared to control plants.
  extract_2: In field grown vines differences in water availability between years
    and among vineyards were translated into differences in canopy development as
    indicated by the close relationship between predawn water potential and NDVI.
    In addition, the WI was closely related to the midday canopy to air temperature
    difference, indicating that the WI effectively tracked variation in stomatal conductance
    within a range of moderate to severe water stress.

    to estimate the water status and grain yield of wheat under different irrigation
    regimes. Agricultural Water Management, 189, 98–110. doi:10.1016/j.agwat.2017.05.001
  explanation: This study assesses the relevance of using hyperspectral passive reflectance
    sensing and thermal imaging to non-invasively estimate the water status and grain
    yield of wheat at three irrigation regimes. Hyperspectral passive sensors measure
    the canopy reflectance with a passive bidirectional reflectance sensor, and thermal
    imaging cameras measure the temperature of the plant canopy, which can estimate
    the water status of plants based on the cooling effect of transpiration. The combination
    of data from these two sensors, along with information about canopy water content,
    relative water content, and grain yield, can improve yield models of different
    irrigation regimes.
  extract_1: '"The use of proximal remote sensing, such as thermal imaing and passive
    reflectance sensing, is particularly and practically suitable to assess the water
    status and implement appropriate management strategies because it presents unique
    advantages of repeatability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness over the ground-based
    surveys for water stress detection (El-Shikha et al., 2007, Zia et al., 2011)."'
  extract_2: '"Therefore, the statistical data fusion of sensor measurements (thermal
    image camera and passive reflectance sensor) with plant traits was used and tested
    to improve the yield models of different irrigation regimes."'

  limitations: '1. The study was conducted in a specific location and may not be generalizable
    to other regions with different environmental conditions.

    2. The study was conducted at the flowering growth stage, and it is not clear
    if the results would be similar at other growth stages.

    3. The study used a specific set of hyperspectral passive reflectance sensors
    and thermal imaging cameras, and it is not clear if the results would be similar
    with other types of sensors.'
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the outline point because
    it presents a novel method for non-invasively assessing the water status and grain
    yield of wheat using hyperspectral passive reflectance sensing and thermal imaging.
    The combination of data from these two types of sensors and the inclusion of information
    about canopy water content, relative water content, and grain yield resulted in
    improved yield models for different irrigation regimes. The research presented
    in this paper is of direct relevance to the development of real-time, automated
    irrigation management systems that can help farmers optimize water use and improve
    crop yields.

  explanation: The study evaluates the performance of different data transmission
    protocols and technologies for real-time irrigation management. In particular,
    the study focuses on the use of hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing for
    non-invasive plant stress detection. The evaluation is based on the accuracy and
    stability of the developed models, as well as their performance in different scenarios.
  extract_1: In practice, machine learning method has been applied to remote sensing
    system and irrigation system19, 20. Many studies have reported plant stress phenotyping
    using machine learning in identification, classification, quantification, and
    prediction of plant water status, but few focused on phenotyping root zone water
    stress10, 21, 22.
  extract_2: In addition, as the treatments of root zone water moisture level was
    applied during the entire growing period, it would have accumulative effect on
    plant phenotype, which increased the model classification accuracy in later stages.

    multiple modalities and using parametric regressions (see Section 5.1);

- explanation: Hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing are two advanced sensing
    technologies that can be used for non-invasive plant stress detection. Hyperspectral
    imaging captures images of an object across hundreds of narrow, contiguous wavelength
    bands. This data can be used to identify subtle changes in plant reflectance that
    can indicate stress. Thermal sensing measures the temperature of an object. This
    data can be used to identify areas of plant tissue that are stressed, as these
    areas will often have a different temperature than healthy tissue.

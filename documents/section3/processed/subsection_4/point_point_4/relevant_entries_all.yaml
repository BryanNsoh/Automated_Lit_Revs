  explanation: Leaf spectral reﬂectance, which is measured using optical sensors,
    is a non-invasive and rapid technique to assess both biotic and abiotic stresses
    in plants. Hyperspectral imaging, multispectral imaging, thermal imaging, and
    ﬂuorescence spectroscopy are commonly used methods to capture the spectral reﬂectance
    of plant leaves. Machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines
    and artiﬁcial neural networks, are employed to extract meaningful patterns from
    the spectral data and classify different stress types. The paper outlines the
    relevant theory, technical approaches, advantages, and limitations of these methods
    for researchers in automated systems for real-time irrigation management.

    \ stresses have been monitored using the imaging or spectrometry of plant leaves\
    \ in the\nvisible (red-green-blue or RGB), near-infrared (NIR), infrared (IR),\
    \ and ultraviolet (UV) wavebands,\noften augmented by ﬂuorescence imaging or ﬂuorescence\
    \ spectrometry. Imaging at multiple speciﬁc\nwavelengths (multi-spectral imaging)\
    \ or across a wide range of wavelengths (hyperspectral imaging)\ncan provide exceptional\
    \ information on plant stress and subsequent diseases. Digital cameras, thermal\n\
    cameras, and optical ﬁlters have become available at a low cost in recent years,\
    \ while hyperspectral\ncameras have become increasingly more compact and portable.\
    \ Furthermore, smartphone cameras\nhave dramatically improved in quality, making\
    \ them a viable option for rapid, on-site stress detection.\nDue to these developments\
    \ in imaging technology, plant stresses can be monitored more easily using\nhandheld\
    \ and ﬁeld-deployable methods. Recent advances in machine learning algorithms\
    \ have\nallowed for images and spectra to be analyzed and classiﬁed in a fully\
    \ automated and reproducible\nmanner, without the need for complicated image or\
    \ spectrum analysis methods. This review will\nhighlight recent advances in portable\
    \ (including smartphone-based) detection methods for biotic and\nabiotic stresses,\
    \ discuss data processing and machine learning techniques that can produce results\
    \ for\nstress identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation, and suggest future directions towards\
    \ the successful translation\nof these methods into practical use.\nKeywords:\

    \ techniques are needed to ensure a sustainable future for the\nagricultural industry\
    \ as the world population continues to increase. There will be over 9 billion\
    \ people\ninhabiting the earth by 2050 [1]. Feeding such a large population is\
    \ a complex problem that will\nrequire the utilization of a variety of ideas and\
    \ techniques across disciplines. Among these is ensuring\nmaximum crop yields\
    \ with minimal losses from plant stresses such as drought, lack of nutrients,\n\
    and disease. If proper attention is not given to the mitigation of these yield\
    \ losses, several components\nof food security such as availability and economic\
    \ access may be aﬀected [2].\nPathogens and biotic stresses have received considerable\
    \ attention in plant stress studies.\nAbout 20–30% of crops are lost due to pests\
    \ and pathogens globally, with many of these losses\noccurring almost every growing\
    \ season [3]. Furthermore, many species of plant pathogens can\ntravel over long\
    \ distances, whether by wind, water, or human activities such as trade and travel\
    \ [4].\nThe distribution of pathogens may also be shifted due to the eﬀects of\
    \ climate change [5]. The detection\nof plant diseases is therefore essential\
    \ not only to implement appropriate disease management strategies\nand mitigate\
    \ potential losses but also to monitor changes in pathogen distribution. Most\
    \ diseases can be\nBiosensors 2020, 10, 193; doi:10.3390/bios10120193\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/biosensors\n\

    \ fully developed due to noticeable changes in the plant’s\nappearance; however,\
    \ early detection is essential in preventing large yield losses. It is also needful\n\
    to detect abiotic stresses such as water and nutrient deﬁciencies at an early\
    \ stage before damages\nsigniﬁcantly aﬀect crop yields; furthermore, these stresses\
    \ will become more prevalent in the agriculture\nindustry due to climate change\
    \ eﬀects such as drought stress and increased salinity [6], which will\nproduce\
    \ a need for increased environmental monitoring for more reﬁned management practices.\n\
    Bioreceptor-based direct detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\
    \ [7],\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [8], and ﬂow cytometry (FC)\
    \ [9] are widely available\nfor the detection of plant diseases; however, these\
    \ methods require specialized training and can be\ntime-consuming and labor-intensive.\
    \ An alternative detection method that can be used both for biotic\nand abiotic\
    \ stresses is a simple visual observation by an expert [10], but this technique\
    \ can be prone to\nbias, with varying results based on the experience of the evaluator.\n\
    Optical techniques hold considerable advantages over the previously mentioned\
    \ techniques,\nsuch as a greater potential for rapid disease detection (with some\
    \ methods producing results in\nnear-real-time [11]), standardized results that\
    \ are not subject to individual biases, and the ability to\ndetect both biotic\
    \ and abiotic stresses. Techniques using proximal (near to the target) sensing\
    \ methods\nhave been utilizing optical sensors that are becoming increasingly\
    \ smaller and more portable. Although\noptical sensors provide greater simplicity\
    \ in the data collection process, the data itself can be complex\nand large in\
    \ size (especially in regard to hyperspectral imaging), requiring the use of sophisticated\
    \ data\nprocessing and statistical methods. Furthermore, images and spectroscopic\
    \ data are not very speciﬁc\nto particular stresses, as opposed to bioreceptor-based\
    \ (e.g., chemical ligands, antibodies, nucleic acids,\netc.) direct detection\
    \ methods. Despite these limitations, stress speciﬁcity and complex data analysis\n\
    can still be achieved using machine learning techniques, which can analyze the\
    \ data provided to\nﬁnd patterns that are speciﬁc to the plant stress in question.\
    \ Many studies have successfully utilized\nmachine learning to interpret optical\
    \ sensor data for the detection of speciﬁc stresses. This review aims\nto provide\
    \ an outline of current optical sensor types and machine learning methods used\
    \ to proximally\ndetect plant stresses.\n2. Spectral Properties of Plant Tissues\n\
    Many physiological and chemical properties of plants inﬂuence the way their tissues\
    \ reﬂect and\nabsorb light. These properties can change when a plant is subjected\
    \ to stress and alter the reﬂectance\nspectrum of its leaves (Figure 1).\nChlorophyll\
    \ is a pigment that is involved in the photosynthesis process. Due to its important\
    \ role\nin absorbing light, changes in chlorophyll content resulting from stress\
    \ will alter the way the plant\ninteracts with light energy. A decrease in chlorophyll\
    \ content may occur when the plant is subjected to\nstress, which can be characterized\
    \ in various ways including an increase of reﬂectance near 700 nm [12]\nand decreased\
    \ reﬂectance in the 530–630 nm range [13]. Other pigments besides chlorophyll,\
    \ such as\ncarotenes [14] and xanthophylls [15], can also alter a plant’s reﬂectance\
    \ properties.\nIn addition to pigmentation, leaf anatomical properties (Figure\
    \ 2) such as the convexity of\nepidermal cells [16], surface texture and thickness\
    \ of the leaf cuticle [17], and high trichome density [18]\ncan be altered under\
    \ stress and consequently aﬀect a leaf’s spectral properties. For example, exposure\n\
    to UV radiation can result in changes to chlorophyll content and increased leaf\
    \ thickness, which can\nalter chlorophyll ﬂuorescence levels [19]. Reﬂectance\
    \ in the 950–970 nm range was found by Peñuelas\net al. (1993) to be inﬂuenced\
    \ by cell wall elasticity, which decreases in response to drought stress [20].\n\
    Small openings on plant leaves (stomata) can also aﬀect leaf properties under\
    \ stress [21].\nThese pores are important to regulate moisture and control gas\
    \ exchange in the leaves; however,\nmicroorganisms such as bacteria and fungi\
    \ can use them to enter and infect a plant. Plants can recognize\nthese pathogens\
    \ using pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs),\n\
    which can then trigger stomatal closure to prevent entry [22]. Stomatal closure\
    \ can lead to an increase\nin leaf temperature, which can be detected in the infrared\
    \ region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nBiosensors 2020, 10, 193\n3 of 27\n\

    \ Rosique et al. \n3.1. Hyperspectral Imaging \nHyperspectral imaging utilizes\
    \ both imaging and spectroscopy methods to produce multi-\ndimensional data. Spectral\
    \ information for a wide range of individual wavelengths is assigned to \nevery\
    \ pixel in an image [28]. Rather than collecting spectra from an entire image\
    \ or an entire plant \nleaf, where spectra from the stressed and unaffected areas\
    \ are mixed together, hyperspectral imaging \ncan provide more sophisticated data\
    \ that can isolate spectra only from the affected area and identify \nspecific\
    \ imaging patterns and characteristics. This method has become increasingly popular\
    \ for plant \nphenotyping and stress detection in agriculture [29–31] and has\
    \ been used to identify plant responses \nto both abiotic and biotic stresses,\
    \ such as drought stress in maize [32] and barley [33], yellow rust \n[34] and\
    \ powdery mildew [35] in wheat, salt stress in okra [36], and Black Sigatoka disease\
    \ in banana \nplants [37].  \nHyperspectral imaging for plant status evaluation\
    \ typically uses a wavelength range of about \n250–2500 nm, i.e., UV (ultraviolet),\
    \ visible, and NIR (near-infrared), with the most important areas in \nthe visible\
    \ and NIR ranges [38]. Other areas of the spectrum are still being explored in\
    \ terms of their \ncapability for plant stress detection. For example, Brugger\
    \ et al. (2019) used hyperspectral imaging in \nFigure 3.\nRanges of the electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum that are utilized by various sensor types.\nUseful wavelengths for\

    Hyperspectral imaging utilizes both imaging and spectroscopy methods to produce\n\

    \ is assigned\nto every pixel in an image [28]. Rather than collecting spectra\

    speciﬁc imaging patterns and characteristics. This method has become increasingly\
    \ popular for plant\nphenotyping and stress detection in agriculture [29–31] and\
    \ has been used to identify plant responses\nto both abiotic and biotic stresses,\
    \ such as drought stress in maize [32] and barley [33], yellow rust [34]\nand\
    \ powdery mildew [35] in wheat, salt stress in okra [36], and Black Sigatoka disease\
    \ in banana\nplants [37].\nBiosensors 2020, 10, 193\n5 of 27\nHyperspectral imaging\

    \ are still being explored in terms of\ntheir capability for plant stress detection.\
    \ For example, Brugger et al. (2019) used hyperspectral\nimaging in the UV range\
    \ to detect salt stress in barley [39]. Due to the sensors’ ability to detect\
    \ a wide\nrange of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, many possibilities\
    \ remain for evaluating new\ncombinations of wavelengths for plant stress detection.\n\
    The data acquired using hyperspectral techniques are often used to compute and\
    \ create vegetation\nindices (VIs). VIs are computed using ratios and combinations\
    \ of reﬂectance measurements at a few\nspeciﬁc wavelengths and have been used\
    \ extensively for plant stress monitoring [40–42]. In addition\nto VIs, hyperspectral\
    \ data can be used to develop spectral disease indices (SDIs) with the purpose\n\
    of discriminating between speciﬁc plant diseases [43] (Table 2). Some examples\
    \ include indices for\ndetecting powdery mildew in wheat [44] and sugar beet [45],\
    \ cercospora leaf spot in sugar beet [45],\nleaf rust in wheat [46], and myrtle\
    \ rust [47]. Notable vegetation indices include the normalized\ndiﬀerence vegetation\
    \ index (NDVI) [48], water index (WI) [49], and photochemical reﬂectance index\n\
    (PRI) [50]. The vast amount of spectral data that is collected using hyperspectral\
    \ imaging provides\ngreat potential in developing new VIs and SDIs for the detection\
    \ of highly speciﬁc plant stresses.\nThe main advantages of hyperspectral imaging\
    \ include its robustness and ability to provide a\nlarge amount of data for analysis;\
    \ however, this can result in instruments being relatively expensive.\nIn addition,\

    \ their\nportability and range of applications; however, the development of handheld\
    \ spectroradiometers and\nsmall hyperspectral cameras (Figure 4) has largely addressed\
    \ this problem. While these instruments\ntypically have a more limited spectral\
    \ range than a standard hyperspectral sensor, they have the\ncapacity to be used\

    \ of NIR wavelengths; Chung et al. (2018) utilized an 800 nm high-pass ﬁlter attached\
    \ to a\nsmartphone to acquire both NIR and red images towards detection of plant\
    \ stress [60].\n3.3. RGB Imaging\nRGB (visible or red-green-blue) imaging employs\
    \ sensors that utilize the red, green, and blue\nregions of the spectrum to produce\
    \ image data (which is the standard working principle of digital\ncameras). The\
    \ wavelengths captured are approximately 400–499 nm for blue light (maximum at\n\
    475 nm), 500–549 nm for green light (maximum at 520 nm), and 550–750 nm for red\
    \ light (maximum\nat 650 nm) [38]. In this sense, RGB imaging may be considered\
    \ as a special case of multispectral\nimaging. However, as RGB imaging data are\
    \ typically acquired using a digital camera or smartphone\nwhile multispectral\
    \ imaging requires more speciﬁc equipment or instrumentation, they are typically\n\
    treated separately.\nThe main advantages of RGB imaging are its aﬀordability and\
    \ small, portable sensor size.\nRGB image sensors are already present on smartphones\
    \ and have been used to successfully evaluate\nplant stresses (Figure 5), such\
    \ as iron deﬁciency chlorosis in soybean [11], various nutrient deﬁciencies in\n\
    black gram [61], early and late blight in potato plants [62], and biotic stresses\
    \ in wheat [63]. Furthermore,\nRGB imaging (especially with smartphones) does\
    \ not require much technical expertise on the user’s\nside since they typically\
    \ make use of commonly used devices such as digital cameras and smartphones.\n\
    Smartphones also have enough computing power to process the captured data, which\
    \ enables rapid\nassessments of plant stresses. However, many factors can complicate\
    \ RGB data, such as lighting,\nenvironmental conditions, time of day, and spectral\
    \ resolution [64,65]. Illumination is a particularly\nimportant concern in terms\
    \ of ﬁeld applications since it can vary greatly depending on the season and\n\
    weather conditions. Diseases with various symptoms and complex image backgrounds\
    \ can create\nfurther complications in processing the data; however, many of these\
    \ diﬃculties can be overcome\nusing image processing and machine learning techniques\
    \ [11].\n3.4. Thermal Imaging/Thermography\nThe main diﬀerence between thermography\
    \ and other methods is its measurement of emitted\nradiation from an object, rather\
    \ than reﬂected radiation [66]. Thermal cameras detect radiation\nin the infrared\
    \ wavelength range, with the resulting measurements being displayed as false-color\n\
    images (Figure 6) where the pixels contain the temperature values. Thermographic\
    \ methods for plant\nstress detection primarily exploit changes in surface temperature\
    \ being a notable stress symptom.\nSmall openings on plant leaves (stomata) that\
    \ control water loss from transpiration may close under\nstress, causing the temperature\
    \ of the plant to increase [67]. Thermography has been used to detect a\nvariety\
    \ of biotic and abiotic stresses, such as Aspergillus carbonarius infection in\
    \ grapes [66], drought\nstress in maize [68], apple scab disease [69], and drought\
    \ stress in sesame plants [70].\nBiosensors 2020, 10, 193\n7 of 27\nBiosensors\

    \ attenuations of incident light by the samples (plant leaves in this case) over\
    \ the range of wavelengths,\ni.e., spectrophotometric detection. Since many components\

    \ the resulting spectrophotometric images tend to be quite\ncomplex. Fluorescence-based\
    \ methods can ﬁx this issue, as only a small number of components in plant\nleaves\
    \ exhibit ﬂuorescence. Fluorescent molecules (e.g., chlorophyll, ﬂuorescent dyes,\
    \ etc.) absorb light\nat a speciﬁc wavelength (excitation) and emit at a speciﬁc,\
    \ longer wavelength (emission), thus incident\nand emitted light can be separated.\
    \ The two main types of ﬂuorescence emitted by vegetation are\nblue-green ﬂuorescence\
    \ (400–600 nm) [72] and chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (650–800 nm) [73]. The latter\n\
    can be useful in evaluating photosynthetic activity, which can decrease under\
    \ pathogenic stresses [74].\nAlthough several techniques are available, two major\
    \ methods for acquiring ﬂuorescence data in\nplants are pulse-amplitude modulation\
    \ (PAM) of the measuring light and continuous illumination [75].\nPulse-amplitude\
    \ modulation devices use a pulsed measuring light source, an actinic light source,\
    \ and a\nsaturating light to obtain ﬂuorescence signals [76]. In contrast, light\
    \ is not pulsed when continuous\nillumination is utilized.\nFluorescence can be\
    \ measured as a spectrum from a single point in time [77], or the change in\n\
    ﬂuorescence over time can be monitored (chlorophyll ﬂuorescence kinetics). The\
    \ basic principle behind\nchlorophyll ﬂuorescence techniques is a lowered rate\
    \ of photosynthesis from stresses and subsequent\ndissipation of chlorophyll ﬂuorescence\
    \ [78]. Fluorescence kinetics measurements require the use of\ndark adaptation,\
    \ which consists of placing a plant (or the part of the plant to be measured)\
    \ in the dark\nfor a certain period of time before ﬂuorescence measurements are\
    \ taken. Dark adaptation allows for\nthe measurement of the minimum level of ﬂuorescence\
    \ [79], which is a fundamental value in kinetics\nanalysis since it provides a\
    \ baseline for the other ﬂuorescence measurements taken after the excitation\n\
    light has been introduced. Plants are usually dark-adapted for a period of 30\
    \ min [80–82]. Regardless\nof whether dark adaptation is utilized or not, it is\
    \ essential to give plants the necessary time to adapt to\nlight conditions before\
    \ measurements (for kinetics applications or standard spectra) are taken.\nFluorescence\
    \ ratios are often used to analyze ﬂuorescence data (both images and spectra)\
    \ for\nevaluating plant stresses. Common ratios involving UV-induced (320–400\
    \ nm) ﬂuorescence include\nF440/F520, F440/F690, F440/F740, and F690/F740; F440/F690\
    \ and F440/F740 are particularly useful for\nearly stress detection applications\
    \ (F represents ﬂuorescence and the numbers represent emission\nwavelengths) [83].\
    \ Bürling et al. (2011) used red/far-red and blue/green amplitude ratios acquired\n\
    from spectral signatures to diﬀerentiate between nitrogen deﬁciency, leaf rust,\
    \ and powdery mildew\nstresses [84]. Although the ratios mentioned above are relatively\
    \ well-established in ﬂuorescence\nresearch, there is still room for exploration\
    \ in determining other ratios that could be used to process data.\nFluorescence\
    \ spectroscopy can identify the location and amount of a speciﬁc component from\n\
    the sample through applying a narrow-range excitation light and detecting a narrow-range\
    \ emission\nfrom such component. Figure 7 is an example of ﬂuorescence spectroscopy,\
    \ where the plant leaves are\nexcited at 488 nm (blue color) and a spectrum with\
    \ wavelengths of >500 nm (green and red colors) is\ncollected. There is a clear\
    \ diﬀerence between the healthy and virus-infected plant leaves. Fluorescence\n\

    \ stresses, including\nBiosensors 2020, 10, 193\n9 of 27\ndrought stress in passion\

    \ of\nlaser light as an excitation light source can be more reliable than other\
    \ optical methods, as excitation\nexactly at the sample’s peak excitation wavelength\
    \ can generate stronger and more speciﬁc ﬂuorescent\nemission (as opposed to passive\

    \ utilizes a camera to obtain images of ﬂuorescence (Figure 8). It is considered\n\
    an improvement over spectroscopy since it obtains ﬂuorescence data with higher\
    \ dimensions, which can\nprovide more information than single spectra. Rather\
    \ than collecting a spectrum from an area of\ninterest (i.e., ﬂuorescence spectroscopy),\
    \ ﬂuorescence imaging can isolate the area of interest from that\nof non-interest.\
    \ For example, Su et al. (2019) used ﬂuorescence imaging to successfully discriminate\n\
    crops from weeds [87]. One category of continuous ﬂuorescence imaging is multicolor\
    \ ﬂuorescence\nimaging, which typically uses UV excitation light and collects\
    \ ﬂuorescence data from multiple bands,\nsuch as red (F680), far-red (F740), green\
    \ (F520), and blue (F440) [83]. Multicolor ﬂuorescence imaging is\nconceptually\
    \ similar to multispectral imaging since only certain ﬂuorescence wavebands are\
    \ collected\nand combined to produce the image. Fluorescence imaging can also\
    \ be used with dark adaptation and\nchlorophyll ﬂuorescence kinetics applications.\n\
    Fluorescence imaging has been used in many studies to detect both biotic and abiotic\
    \ stresses,\nsuch as herbicide stress in soybeans [88], cold stress in tomato\
    \ seedlings [89], and biotic and abiotic\nBiosensors 2020, 10, 193\n10 of 27\n\
    stresses in barley, grapevine, and sugar beet [90]. A relatively simple and portable\
    \ option for ﬂuorescence\nimage acquisition could consist of a smartphone and\
    \ band-pass ﬁlters (as demonstrated in [91]); however,\nit is currently diﬃcult\
    \ to ﬁnd methods with this type of setup for plant stress applications.\nOne advantage\
    \ of ﬂuorescence-based techniques is their sensible cost of equipment [92]; however,\n\
    they do not always produce a clear distinction of healthy and diseased plant tissues\
    \ at the early stage\nof a disease, so additional methods may be necessary to\
    \ complement ﬂuorescence for early disease\ndetection [93]. Fluorescence-related\
    \ methods could beneﬁt from an increased sensitivity that could\nallow them to\

    data from multiple bands, such as red (F680), far red (F740), green (F520), and\

    \ to multispectral imaging since only certain \nfluorescence wavebands are collected\
    \ and combined to produce the image. Fluorescence imaging can \nalso be used with\
    \ dark adaptation and chlorophyll fluorescence kinetics applications. \nFluorescence\

    \ ﬁelds because it can detect patterns using\nsimultaneous combinations of multiple\
    \ factors instead of examining traits individually [102]. The use\nof multiple\
    \ factors is important due to the frequently high complexity of the environment\
    \ surrounding\nplants, where variables such as changing light intensity, direction,\
    \ and leaf angle can alter results.\nMachine learning can be used not only for\
    \ classiﬁcation purposes but also for pre-processing steps\nsuch as feature extraction\
    \ and dimensionality reduction.\nThe assessment of plant health includes stress\
    \ identiﬁcation, discrimination, and quantiﬁcation.\nIdentiﬁcation involves looking\
    \ for symptoms (early or late) of a speciﬁc stress, discrimination consists\n\
    of both identifying a speciﬁc stress and separating the symptoms from those of\
    \ other stresses,\nand quantiﬁcation is a measurement of the severity of the stress.\
    \ Machine learning has been utilized\nfor all these applications, as outlined\
    \ in Table 3.\nThe selection of a machine learning method or pathway depends on\
    \ the speciﬁc problem being\naddressed; as such, there is currently no speciﬁc\
    \ approach that can be recommended for all applications.\nThe following sections\
    \ will provide an overview of machine learning data processing techniques that\n\
    have been used for various agricultural applications.\n4.1. Preprocessing\nData\
    \ preprocessing is essential to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of classiﬁcation\n\
    results [105]. Preprocessing consists of one or more operations that aim to improve\
    \ the performance of\nthe classiﬁcation algorithms by providing data in a more\
    \ accessible and normalized format. Image\npreprocessing techniques may include\
    \ image cropping, background removal, contrast enhancement,\nimage thresholding,\
    \ noise removal with ﬁlters, clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA)\
    \ [102].\nAlthough this section deals mostly with imaging techniques, spectral\
    \ data may also be processed\nusing some of the listed methods, such as PCA. Outlined\
    \ below are some preprocessing steps that are\ncommonly applied to imaging data.\n\
    4.1.1. Color Space Conversion\nColor space conversion is a data processing technique\
    \ that can be used with RGB images as another\nway to represent color. Color spaces\
    \ can be used to acquire additional color features from images to\naid in feature\
    \ extraction and image classiﬁcation. Several studies have used features obtained\
    \ from\nBiosensors 2020, 10, 193\n13 of 27\ncolor space conversion to process\
    \ RGB data for plant stress detection, including L*a*b* (L* = lightness\nfrom\
    \ black to white, a* = from green to red, and b* = from blue to yellow) to detect\
    \ bacterial blight,\nfruit spot, fruit rot, and leaf spot in pomegranate plants\
    \ [106]; HSI (hue, saturation, intensity) to detect\nearly scorch, late scorch,\
    \ cottony mold, ashen mold, and tiny whiteness in plants [107]; and YCbCr\n(Y\
    \ = luma component; Cb and Cr = blue- and red-diﬀerences of chroma components)\
    \ to detect diseases\nin soybean [108]. A few alternative color spaces are outlined\
    \ in Figure 10 [109].\nBiosensors 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n14 of 28 \n \n\

    4.1.2. Dimensionality Reduction \nDimensionality reduction is a process that aims\
    \ to provide a more compact representation of \ndata while preserving as much\
    \ information as possible. A common method for dimensionality \nreduction is principal\
    \ component analysis (PCA), which geometrically projects data onto lower \ndimensions\
    \ (principal components) that act as feature summaries [110]. PCA can combine\
    \ dependent \n(or highly correlated) variables into a common variable while minimizing\
    \ the loss of information. By \ndoing so, the dimensionality of data can be reduced.\
    \ The first principal component (PC1) is evaluated \nfrom the data set. Then PC2\
    \ is evaluated from the remainders, and the process is repeated, e.g., PC3, \n\
    PC4, etc. The principal components (PCs) represent data variances, and these can\
    \ be plotted in 2D or \n3D plots (in the case of two or three PCs) known as PCR\
    \ score plots.  \nAll PCs can also be fed into the various machine learning models\
    \ as a pre-processing step of \ndimensionality reduction. PCA has been used in\
    \ many studies as an important preprocessing step to \nmanage both imaging and\
    \ spectral data. For example, PCA was used in an image preprocessing \npipeline\
    \ by Lu et al. (2017) to aid in acquiring feature maps [111]. While better dimensionality\
    \ \nreduction methods have recently emerged, e.g., linear discriminant analysis\
    \ (LDA) that can maximize \nthe class separation, PCA is often preferred over\
    \ the recent methods as an unbiased dimensionality \nreduction method. PCA can\
    \ be a valuable tool to aid in data interpretation, but one disadvantage of \n\
    this method is its ability to be influenced by outliers in the data [112]. \n\
    4.1.3. Segmentation \nImage segmentation is a process that can organize an image\
    \ into key areas, such as the object \nand its background. This technique is useful\
    \ in agricultural applications due to its ability to reduce \nerrors or misclassifications\
    \ resulting from noise in the background. Notable methods include \nclustering-based\
    \ approaches such as k-means, which can be useful in identifying stressed areas\
    \ of a \nplant in an image [107]. Disease detection applications may require other\
    \ techniques such as pixel \nremoval and masking [113]. For example, Ma et al.\
    \ (2018) used excess red index (ExR), H from the \nFigure 10. An RGB (visible\
    \ or red-green-blue) image represented using other color spaces. Adapted\nwith\

    the dimensionality of data can be reduced. The ﬁrst principal component (PC1)\

    \ in an\nimage [107]. Disease detection applications may require other techniques\
    \ such as pixel removal and\nmasking [113]. For example, Ma et al. (2018) used\
    \ excess red index (ExR), H from the HSV (hue,\nsaturation, value) color space,\
    \ and b* from the L*a*b* color space to discriminate between disease spots\nand\
    \ background in images [114]. An example of segmentation being used to separate\
    \ plants from the\nbackground of an image is demonstrated in Figure 11 [115].\n\

    \ and collecting a set of extracted \nfeatures; for images, available techniques\

    \ \nOnce the necessary preprocessing steps are complete, the data can be fed into\
    \ a machine learning \nalgorithm for classification. These algorithms attempt\
    \ to find patterns in data to use in assigning \nclasses (e.g., stressed vs. healthy)\
    \ to unlabeled data [29]. Machine learning algorithms can be divided \ninto supervised,\
    \ weakly-supervised, and unsupervised categories, all of which can be used for\
    \ \nclassification [119,120]. The major difference among these algorithms is supervised\
    \ learning involves \nthe use of labeled training data to predict the labels of\
    \ testing data; weakly-supervised learning can \nuse smaller datasets, coarse\
    \ labels, or misclassified labels for training, and unsupervised learning \nuses\

    \ forest [123] have been successfully used for plant stress\nidentiﬁcation applications.\n\
    Machine learning techniques can be very robust classiﬁers, yet one drawback is\
    \ their tendency\nto overﬁt the data (especially when the data set is small),\
    \ which results in incorrect classiﬁcations.\nIn addition, machine learning can\
    \ be time-consuming, especially when large image ﬁles are involved.\nBoth issues,\
    \ however, can be mitigated using some of the following processes. One method\
    \ that has been\nused to mitigate overﬁtting errors in image classiﬁcation is\
    \ data augmentation, which consists of slightly\ndistorting the images using techniques\
    \ such as rotation [124], mirroring [125], and color variation [126].\nIf data\
    \ augmentation and image manipulation are deemed necessary in the data processing\
    \ pathway,\nthey must be performed before running the data through the classiﬁcation\
    \ algorithm.\n4.2.1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nSVM is a supervised learning\
    \ method, i.e., requiring training data set to identify classes of\nunknown data.\
    \ Let us assume a simple case that most (e.g., >90%) of the training data set\
    \ can be\nreduced to two dimensions through dimensionality reduction methods such\
    \ as PCA. These data can be\nplotted on a 2D coordinate system (i.e., PCA score\
    \ plot). With known classes (e.g., stressed vs. healthy)\nof the data, it is possible\
    \ to draw a line that can best separate all of the data into two classes; this\
    \ line is\ncalled a decision boundary (demonstrated in Figure 12 [127]). The procedure\
    \ can also be used for three\nor more dimensions of data, where the boundary becomes\
    \ a plane for three dimensions or a hyperplane\nfor dimensions higher than three.\
    \ It may be necessary to use about 10 principal components from PCA,\nbut this\
    \ dimension number is still substantially small compared to the dimensions of\
    \ the raw data,\nwhich could range from hundreds (for spectra) to millions (for\
    \ images). Testing data is fed into the\nsame data processing pathway as the training\
    \ data, and the decision boundary formed during training\ndetermines the class\
    \ of testing data. While SVM is inherently a linear method, non-linear separation\n\
    is also possible using non-linear kernels. Classiﬁcation into multiple classes\
    \ is also possible using\nmultiple decision boundaries.\nBiosensors 2020, 10,\

    \ learning techniques have been used to recognize\nboth biotic and abiotic stresses,\
    \ especially plant diseases. One observation is that machine learning is\ncommonly\
    \ used to process imaging data (especially RGB images), but spectroscopic methods\
    \ more\nfrequently utilize traditional statistical methods. In the future, machine\
    \ learning methods could be\nfurther incorporated into spectroscopic data analysis\
    \ pathways.\nCurrently, many of the studies mentioned are producing detection\
    \ results that are speciﬁc to just\na few plants. Leaf reﬂectance properties can\
    \ diﬀer greatly between plant species, so it is diﬃcult to\nproduce results that\
    \ are generalizable to several plants in diﬀerent circumstances. The development\
    \ of\nmore generalized (rather than species-speciﬁc) results is likely a future\
    \ direction in plant stress detection;\nhowever, more research is needed to ﬁnd\
    \ features and parameters that can lead to such results. Methods\nsuch as smartphone\
    \ imaging, thermography, and ﬂuorescence imaging have the potential to be scaled\n\
    up to larger-scaled systems to analyze plant canopies in open ﬁelds or controlled\
    \ environments.\nImaging devices (especially multispectral/RGB sensors) have improved\
    \ in quality and become\nmore compact over recent years. Optical resolutions of\
    \ recent smartphones’ cameras are comparable\nto most standalone digital cameras,\
    \ eﬀectively eliminating the bulk of digital camera markets and\nonly leaving\
    \ the high-end markets. Sensitivity has also improved dramatically; the white\
    \ LED ﬂash\nis rarely necessary with recent smartphones. Computing power and memory\
    \ have also improved\nsigniﬁcantly for recent smartphones, which has enabled on-board\
    \ image processing to become a\nreality. Cloud storage and computing for remote\
    \ ﬁle management and execution also complements the\nsmartphone’s computing power\
    \ and memory capacity, allowing for more advanced data processing\noperations\
    \ to be performed. Optical zooms (which magnify images mechanically using optical\
    \ lenses)\nare possible with recent smartphones, although limited at 2x − 4x at\
    \ the time of writing. Furthermore,\nsmartphones have the data processing power\
    \ needed to run machine learning algorithms and thus can\nprovide a rapid, on-site\
    \ assessment of plant stresses.\nThe discrimination of speciﬁc stresses (especially\
    \ stresses from speciﬁc nutrients) remains a\nchallenge. Discrimination may become\
    \ more feasible with improvements in the sensitivity of optical\ndevices; however,\
    \ this increased sensitivity may result in data being more prone to noise from\
    \ the\nsurrounding environment. Environmental noise could be overcome by the use\
    \ of image segmentation\nand machine learning models to help distinguish between\
    \ noise and the targeted characteristic.\nMany improvements are being made with\
    \ imaging technology and data processing techniques that\nwill enable the development\
    \ of robust, portable devices for plant stress detection. Although research is\n\
    still needed in many areas such as the fusion of data from multiple sensors and\
    \ discrimination between\nspeciﬁc biotic and abiotic stresses, current developments\
    \ have great potential to be deployed as useful\ntools for the agriculture industry.\n\

    Abstract: Recently, there has been a significant increase in the use of proximal
    or remote hyperspectral imaging systems to study plant properties, types, and
    conditions. Numerous financial and environmental benefits of using such systems
    have been the driving force behind this growth. This paper is concerned with the
    analysis of hyperspectral data for detecting plant diseases and stress conditions
    and classifying crop types by means of advanced machine learning techniques. Main
    contribution of the work lies in the use of an innovative classification framework
    for the analysis, in which adaptive feature selection, novelty detection, and
    ensemble learning are integrated. Three hyperspectral datasets and a nonimaging
    hyperspectral dataset were used in the evaluation of the proposed framework. Experimental
    results show significant improvements achieved by the proposed method compared
    to the use of empirical spectral indices and existing classification methods.

    Publisher: IEEE CFS uses the correlation between features and classes to evaluate
    the significance of the features. It uses Shannon''s entropy and information gain
    to measure average feature-class and average feature-feature correlations. The
    features are then evaluated heuristically on merit to determine the significance
    as follows: The search strategy in this algorithm is based on the best first search
    and the process halts if no improvement is achieved after five consecutive iterations.

  explanation: "Precision phenotyping and remote sensing technology have shown great\
    \ promise in rapidly and accurately evaluating plant performance in field trials.\
    \ Hyperspectral imagery captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged\
    \ as a powerful tool due to its ability to collect data in multiple spectral bands,\
    \ providing information about crop traits such as chlorophyll content, nitrogen\
    \ status, and biomass. In this study, hyperspectral UAV imagery was used to assess\
    \ the response of sugar beet cultivars to infection by the beet cyst nematode\
    \ (BCN), Heterodera schachtii. The study aimed to determine whether hyperspectral\
    \ data could be used to discriminate between nematode-susceptible and -tolerant\
    \ cultivars and predict sugar yield, with the ultimate goal of improving breeding\
    \ efforts for BCN resistance.\n\nThe study was conducted in a field trial with\
    \ nine different sugar beet cultivars, representing a range of susceptibility\
    \ to BCN. Hyperspectral data were collected at two time points during the growing\
    \ season using a UAV-mounted hyperspectral imager. The data were used to calculate\
    \ a number of spectral vegetation indices (SIs), which are mathematical combinations\
    \ of reflectance values at different wavelengths that are known to be related\
    \ to specific plant traits. The SIs were then used to train machine learning algorithms\
    \ to classify the cultivars according to their susceptibility to BCN and to predict\
    \ sugar yield. The results showed that hyperspectral data could be used to discriminate\
    \ between nematode-susceptible and -tolerant cultivars with high accuracy. The\
    \ SIs that were most useful for discrimination included those related to chlorophyll\
    \ content, nitrogen status, and biomass. \n\nThe study also found that hyperspectral\
    \ data could be used to predict sugar yield with reasonable accuracy. The SIs\
    \ that were most useful for predicting yield were those related to chlorophyll\
    \ content and biomass. The results of this study suggest that hyperspectral UAV\
    \ imagery has the potential to be a valuable tool for improving breeding efforts\
    \ for BCN resistance in sugar beet. Hyperspectral data can be used to rapidly\
    \ and accurately assess the performance of different cultivars in field trials,\
    \ and to identify promising candidates for further evaluation. This information\
    \ can help breeders to develop new cultivars that are more resistant to BCN and\
    \ more productive."
  extract_1: SIs extracted from the hyperspectral imager were able to differentiate
    between the two types of cultivars from group C. After 102 days, the main differences
    between susceptible and tolerant cultivars were related to biomass (NDVI), chlorophyll
    content of the leaves (780/700, CHLG) and general stress (HI). At 152 das, susceptible
    cultivars could also be differentiated from the tolerant ones using the SIs related
    to water content (NDWI1650, NDWI).
  extract_2: The SIs extracted from the UAV hyperspectral imager were not able to
    differentiate between the two types of cultivars from group C. However, CHLG and
    ANTH SIs allowed to differentiate cultivars after 102 and 152 das, respectively.

    \ phenotyping methods based on ground-operating\ndevices or unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAV) has increased our ability to evaluate traits of interest\nfor crop breeding\
    \ in the ﬁeld. A ﬁeld site infested with beet cyst nematode (BCN) and planted\
    \ with\nfour nematode susceptible cultivars and ﬁve tolerant cultivars was investigated\
    \ at different times\nduring the growing season. We compared the ability of spectral,\
    \ hyperspectral, canopy height- and\ntemperature information derived from handheld\
    \ and UAV-borne sensors to discriminate susceptible\nand tolerant cultivars and\
    \ to predict the ﬁnal sugar beet yield. Spectral indices (SIs) related to\nchlorophyll,\
    \ nitrogen or water allowed differentiating nematode susceptible and tolerant\
    \ cultivars\n(cultivar type) from the same genetic background (breeder). Discrimination\
    \ between the cultivar\ntypes was easier at advanced stages when the nematode\
    \ pressure was stronger and the plants and\ncanopies further developed. The canopy\
    \ height (CH) allowed differentiating cultivar type as well but\nwas much more\
    \ efﬁcient from the UAV compared to manual ﬁeld assessment. Canopy temperatures\n\
    also allowed ranking cultivars according to their nematode tolerance level. Combinations\
    \ of SIs in\nmultivariate analysis and decision trees improved differentiation\
    \ of cultivar type and classiﬁcation of\ngenetic background. Thereby, SIs and\
    \ canopy temperature proved to be suitable proxies for sugar\nyield prediction.\
    \ The spectral information derived from handheld and the UAV-borne sensor did\
    \ not\nmatch perfectly, but both analysis procedures allowed for discrimination\
    \ between susceptible and\ntolerant cultivars. This was possible due to successful\
    \ detection of traits related to BCN tolerance\nlike chlorophyll, nitrogen and\
    \ water content, which were reduced in cultivars with a low tolerance\nto BCN.\
    \ The high correlation between SIs and ﬁnal sugar beet yield makes the UAV hyperspectral\n\
    imaging approach very suitable to improve farming practice via maps of yield potential\
    \ or diseases.\nMoreover, the study shows the high potential of multi-sensor and\
    \ parameter combinations for plant\nphenotyping purposes, in particular for data\
    \ from UAV-borne sensors that allow for standardized\nand automated high-throughput\
    \ data extraction procedures.\nKeywords: hyperspectral images; spectrometry; canopy\

    Sugar beet is a root crop widely cultivated in Europe and North America for sugar\
    \ production.\nTwenty percent of the world’s supply of sugar is derived from sugar\
    \ beet [1].\nOne of the main\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 787; doi:10.3390/rs10050787\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 787\n2 of 21\nsoil\
    \ borne parasites that limits sugar beet production worldwide is the Beet Cyst\
    \ Nematode (BCN),\nHeterodera schachtii. It is the most important pest of sugar\
    \ beet [2]. BCN causes severe damage and\nsignificant yield losses of up to 60%\
    \ [3]. In addition, this pathogen can infect more than 200 different plant\nspecies,\
    \ making their management in the crop cycle a challenging task [4,5]. Most nematode\
    \ damage\noccurs belowground including reduction of beet growth and the appearance\
    \ of many secondary roots\nto compensate for those infested by nematodes. BCN\
    \ also causes shoot symptoms such as stunted\ngrowth, decreased chlorophyll content,\
    \ and wilting of the canopy due to water stress [6,7]. In the ﬁeld,\nnematodes\
    \ occur in patches and have very low mobility. This makes sugar beet breeding\
    \ with respect\nto BCN infestation a good target for the use of non-destructive\
    \ ground and aerial based phenotyping\nmethodology in the ﬁeld.\nApart from direct\
    \ observation of nematode-induced damage in excavated roots, an indirect\nobservation\
    \ of belowground damage via performance of the aboveground shoot performance is\
    \ the\nonly way to address the severity of crop deterioration. Such assessment\
    \ can be done via remote sensing\nmethods. For nematode-induced stress, several\
    \ sensor-based methods have been tested in a variety of\ncrops such as potatoes,\
    \ soybeans or sugar beet using ground and airborne platforms [8–11].\nFor differentiation\
    \ of nematode infested and non-infested treatments under greenhouse and\nsemi-controlled\
    \ ﬁeld conditions, ground based visible imaging has been successfully used on\
    \ sugar\nbeet [12,13]. The canopy area of the plant can be robustly calculated\
    \ and reﬂects root biomass\nin a variety of plant species [14–17]. Phenotyping\
    \ methods based on multi- and hyper-spectral\nmeasurements showed promising results\
    \ for evaluating the symptoms caused by BCN on sugar\nbeet plants under ﬁeld and\
    \ semi-controlled ﬁeld conditions [11,13]. These methods are based on the\ncalculation\
    \ of spectral vegetation indices (SIs). SIs are combinations of spectral bands\
    \ that enhance the\nsensitivity to speciﬁc canopy characteristic while reducing\
    \ the effect of non-desirable factors such as\nsoil background [18]. In the ﬁeld,\
    \ the use of speciﬁc SIs has been reported to predict the ﬁnal beet yield\nand\
    \ the nematode population in the soil [19]. Schmitz et al. [20] reported the ability\
    \ of aerial remote\nsensing thermography to detect changes in the canopy temperature\
    \ of sugar beet plants infested with\nnematodes in the ﬁeld. This increase in\
    \ canopy temperature of the nematode- infested sugar beet\nplants was also observed\
    \ in semi-controlled ﬁeld conditions under artiﬁcial nematode infestation on\n\
    nematode susceptible and tolerant cultivars [13].\nThe recent technological advances\
    \ in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), miniaturization of sensors\nand developments\
    \ of software and algorithms enabled the application of digital imaging methodology\n\
    from aerial view covering larger areas in a shorter time [21–23]. Recent work\
    \ has demonstrated the\nability of UAV coupled with a range of imaging sensors\
    \ to provide suitable phenotype information\nfor several purposes such as breeding\
    \ support or precision farming and for different crops [24–28].\nVery few studies\
    \ have made use of the new technologies for investigation or detection of sugar\
    \ beet\nBCN infestation in ﬁelds.\nFor aerial crop phenotyping, applied sensors\
    \ and methodology comprise usage of visible, multi- to\nhyperspectral sensors\
    \ [29–32], thermal imaging [31,33], and extraction of crop height information\
    \ [34,35].\nAmong the applications of UAV based phenotyping are detection of weeds,\
    \ soil characteristics,\nwater status, diseases, pest management and fertilization\
    \ support or yield estimation [36,37].\nNevertheless, robust and reliable extraction\
    \ of information from airborne sensors remains one of\nthe biggest challenges.\n\
    For visible and spectral images, information can be extracted by band combination\
    \ math [29,32]\nor via other methods such as partial least square regression [38]\
    \ or machine learning algorithms [39].\nAlthough SIs have been proven robust trait\
    \ indicators in many studies, machine learning algorithms\nare not yet applied\
    \ without task speciﬁc learning or calibration in agriculture. Thermal information\n\
    can be retrieved from calibrated or non-calibrated cameras and often needs consideration\
    \ of the actual\nweather conditions for correct interpretation. Crop or canopy\
    \ height information can be extracted\nusing “Structure from Motion” (SfM) algorithms\
    \ subtracting the soil elevation model from the canopy\nelevation model. Although\
    \ it is technically feasible, combinations of sensors have rarely been applied\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 787\n3 of 21\nfor phenotyping tasks. The use of different\
    \ sensors in combined or single mode and post processing\nmethodology, SIs and\
    \ SfM for instance offer a high return of information for applications in crop\n\
    phenotyping and large-scale precision agriculture.\nFor crop breeding or research,\
    \ such aerial-based information retrieval offers faster and more\nfrequent measurements.\
    \ For precision agriculture, it enables the evaluation of larger areas and the\n\
    robust use of information for crop management decisions.\nFor the sugar beet BCN\
    \ infestation scenario, aerial derived trait maps combined with a\nreduced number\
    \ of soil samples in the ﬁeld can conﬁrm the presence of nematodes and allow\n\
    exact determination of spatial distribution and density of nematode infestation\
    \ in agricultural ﬁelds.\nSuch knowledge may help to select the optimal sugar\
    \ beet cultivar.\nThere is still a need to develop fast and reliable methods to\
    \ evaluate the status of soil borne\npathogen infestation such as BCN under real\
    \ ﬁeld conditions and give a ﬁrst prediction of the yield\npotential. Applications\
    \ would be proﬁtable not only for breeding purposes but also for farmers to help\n\
    for the selection of the best countermeasures such as crop rotation and the use\
    \ of appropriate cultivars\nor catch crops.\nThe present study therefore investigates\
    \ the ability of thermography, ﬁeld spectrometry and aerial\nhyperspectral imaging\
    \ to identify the stress caused by nematodes on susceptible and tolerant sugar\n\
    beet cultivars in the ﬁeld. More speciﬁcally, the main objectives were to (1)\
    \ Compare the ability of\nthermography and spectrometry methods to discriminate\
    \ and rank susceptible and tolerant sugar\nbeet cultivars; (2) Evaluate the capability\
    \ of the phenotyping methods to predict the sugar beet yield\nand (3) Validate\
    \ the ability of aerial UAV-based and hyperspectral imaging to discriminate and\
    \ rank\nsusceptible and tolerant sugar beet cultivars and predict nematode population\
    \ and ﬁnal yield.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Experimental Site\nTwo sugar\
    \ beet ﬁeld trials were carried out side by side in 2016 in a ﬁeld (0.4 ha) in\

    \ is located 49◦68′N, 8◦15′E at an altitude of 244 m above sea level.\nThe ﬁeld\
    \ site was selected based on its natural infestation with BCN. The soil is a sandy\
    \ loam (pH 7.5)\ncontaining 29.5 kg P2O5 ha−1, 45 kg K2O ha−1, 9.2 kg Mg ha−1.\

    \ of 159 kg N ha−1, 54 kg P2O5 ha−1, 96 kg K2O ha−1 and\n24 kg Mg ha−1 prior to\
    \ sowing on 24 March.\nHerbicide was applied during the first two months after\
    \ sowing to avoid the influence of weeds on\nthe plant growth (18 April: 1.2 L\

    2.2. Experimental Design\nTwo trials were established in two separate block designs\
    \ (Table 1 and Figure 1) with the initial\npurpose of the trial to compare susceptible\
    \ and tolerant cultivars from the same seed provider;\nplots were gathered at\
    \ the same locations in order to minimize the variability in nematode pressure.\n\
    No gradients in soil conditions were observed within the experimental ﬁeld. Individual\
    \ plots were\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 787\n4 of 21\nthree meters wide by eight\
    \ meters long with a row distance of 0.5 m and a target sowing density of\n11.1\
    \ seeds per m2. In trial 1, one susceptible and two tolerant cultivars were planted\
    \ (Sus A, Tol A1,\nand Tol A2 from the breeder A). In trial 2, three susceptible\
    \ and three tolerant cultivars were sown\n(Breeders B, C and D). In the present\
    \ manuscript, A, B, C, and D are groups of cultivars corresponding\nto four different\
    \ breeders (companies), supposedly reﬂecting different genetic backgrounds.\n\
    Sugar beet cultivars were randomized in a block design with 16 and eight replicates\

    \ were harvested 196 days after sowing (das) on 6 October 2016. Three middle rows\
    \ were\nharvested for each plot (17 m2). Final beet fresh weight and white sugar\
    \ yield were determined for\neach single plot as described in Reuther et al. [40].\n\
    The initial BCN population density (pi) in the different plots was assessed at\
    \ the time of planting\nand the ﬁnal BCN population (pf) was assessed at harvest.\
    \ Soil cores were sampled in each plot\nwith a hydraulic soil sampler (Nietfeld,\
    \ DUOPROB 60-UP, Quakenbrück, Germany). Ten samples\nwere collected and automatically\
    \ separated in topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (30–60 cm) in the soil\nsampler.\
    \ They were mixed to obtain one topsoil and one subsoil sample of minimum 500\
    \ g each per\nplot. Samples were stored in the dark at 4 ◦C before analysis. The\
    \ nematode population was evaluated\nusing a method described by Grosse et al.\
    \ [41]. Based on the observation that 50% of the dormant\nnematodes hatched, the\
    \ nematode infestation levels were determined by multiplying the observed\ninfestation\
    \ levels by a correction factor of two [42]. Infestation level was expressed as\
    \ the number of\njuveniles (J2s) of H. schachtii per 100 g of soil.\n2.4. In-Field\
    \ Measurements\nCanopy height measurements were performed manually in the ﬁeld\
    \ 102 das using a ruler.\nTwo measurements were taken from the middle of two rows,\
    \ respectively on the ﬁrst third of each plot\nand subsequently averaged (CHruler).\n\
    Thermal images were acquired 152 das using an infrared camera (Testo 885, Testo\
    \ Ltd., Alton, UK),\nhaving a Si sensor with 320 × 240 pixels covering a spectral\
    \ range of 8–14 µm, and a sensor sensitivity\nof <30 mK at 30 ◦C. As in a previous\
    \ study [13] the thermal device was calibrated prior to taking\npictures by setting\
    \ up the emissivity to 96% and the reﬂected temperature compensation parameter\
    \ to\nthe current air temperature [43]. One picture was taken from the same side\
    \ of each plot with an angle\nof 45◦ at a height of 1.5 m above the ground. Canopy\
    \ temperature (TC) was determined by combining\nboth thermal and visible images\
    \ generated by the thermal camera. Temperature ﬂuctuation in the ﬁeld\nwas assessed\
    \ by evaluating the naked soil temperature (TS) between rows with the thermal\
    \ camera ten\ntimes during the measurements. On average, TS was 28.7 ◦C (±0.4\
    \ ◦C) and relative humidity was 54%\nat the time of measurement. Because of the\
    \ stable ambient temperature (ﬂuctuating less than 1.5%)\nduring measurements\
    \ no normalization to ambient temperatures was applied.\nSpectral measurements\
    \ in the ﬁeld were performed at das 88, 102 and 152 during the plant\ndevelopment\
    \ using a non-imaging spectro-radiometer (ASD FieldSpec® 4, Analytic Spectral\
    \ Devices,\nBoulder, CO, USA) with a spectral range of 350–2500 nm. Canopy spectra\
    \ were acquired from\nnadir view of the plots at a height of 1 m above canopy\
    \ with a 25◦ ﬁeld of view. For each plot,\nﬁve spectra were randomly taken at\
    \ distinct positions consisting of ﬁve spectral samples and averaged.\nInstrument\
    \ radiometric optimization and reﬂectance calibration were performed each time\
    \ prior\nto spectral sampling in every third plot using a Zenith Polymer® (SphereOptics,\
    \ Herrsching am\nAmmersee, Germany) 99% reﬂectance target as white reference.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 787\n6 of 21\nUAV-Based Data Acquisition\nAerial image\
    \ spectroscopy was acquired 102 and 152 das with a Gamaya OXI VNIR 40 camera\n\
    system (Gamaya, SA, Lausanne, Switzerland) consisting of two individual cameras\
    \ measuring\n16 bands in the visible (VIS) and 25 bands in the near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ range, respectively. The System\nwas mounted on a Solo drone (3D Robotics, Inc.,\
    \ San Diego, USA). The camera system provides\n40 spectral bands between 475 nm\
    \ and 875 nm with a full width half maximum (FWHM) ranging\nfrom approximately\
    \ 15 to 25 nm. It was equipped with 25 mm focal length optics. The images were\n\
    captured from an altitude of 80 m with at least 75% overlap and 60% sidelap. VIS\
    \ and NIR images\nwere de-convolved with the Sprocket software provided by Gamaya,\
    \ using the raw images and a\ncamera speciﬁc calibration proﬁle resulting in two\
    \ megapixel images (2048 × 1088 pixels) for each\ncamera. Both sets of images\
    \ were processed in Agisoft Photoscan Professional (v. 1.26, Agisoft, LLC,\nSt.\
    \ Petersburg, Russia) resulting in a digital surface model (DSM) and an orthophoto\
    \ for VIS and NIR,\nrespectively. Geometrically correct overlay was facilitated\
    \ using virtual markers such as distinctive\nﬁeld (stones, plot corners) or infrastructure\
    \ (street breaks or gully covers) features.\nReﬂectance computation was also done\
    \ with the Sprocket software from Gamaya and the ﬁnal\nhypercube was exported\
    \ as a band interleaved by line (bil) format. Three targets of different reﬂectance\n\
    were placed in the ﬁeld, measured with the ASD spectro-radiometer and selected\
    \ in the hypercube\n(Figure 1). The radiance spectra of those targets, as seen\
    \ by the hyperspectral camera, are then used to\nestimate the most likely sunlight\
    \ spectrum, which is assumed constant throughout the data acquisition.\nThe sunlight\
    \ spectrum can be estimated for each target, by dividing for each band the target’s\
    \ radiance\nfrom the camera by its known reﬂectance measured in the ﬁeld. As three\
    \ different targets were used,\nthe three sunlight estimations were fused into\
    \ the most likely one through the least square regression\nfunction in the sprocket\
    \ software.\nRegions of interest (ROI) reﬂecting individual plots were manually\
    \ identiﬁed on the hyperspectral\nimages using the ENVI software (v. 5.1, Harris\
    \ Corporation, Melbourne, FL, USA). For each ROI,\nthe average spectrum was extracted.\
    \ At 102 and 152 das, canopy height measurements were extracted\nfrom the DSM\
    \ computed from the hyperspectral drone images (CHDSM). CHDSM for each plot was\n\
    calculated as the difference between the average canopy elevation extracted from\
    \ a ROI on the ﬁrst\nthird of the plot (1.8 m2, 3500 pixels ± 500) and the average\
    \ soil elevation extracted in front of each\nplot (1.8 m2, 3500 pixels ± 500),\
    \ respectively.\nFor each date of measurement and each plot, 123 published SIs\
    \ were computed using the ﬁeld\nspectrometer measurements. Seventy-seven SIs (reduced\
    \ spectral range) were calculated from the\nhyperspectral images using the closest\
    \ available channels for the SI calculation. The number of\nSIs was reduced subsequently\
    \ for both spectral devices using a correlation matrix as described by\nJoalland\
    \ et al. [13] to a small number of SIs, reﬂecting a range of traits, selected\
    \ for further analysis\n(Table 2). In brief, SIs highly inter-correlated to each\
    \ other (Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient p > 0.8)\nwere grouped. One SI was then\
    \ selected for each group. Selected SIs reﬂect the broad range of traits\nfor\
    \ which the SIs were initially developed.\nTable 2. Selected SIs, their respective\

    \ analyzed with the statistical program R [54]. Beet fresh weight, white sugar\
    \ yield\nand BCN population were exposed to analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a\
    \ signiﬁcance level of 0.05.\nANOVA was used to compare and differentiate the\
    \ cultivars for the computed or measured traits.\nPCA (Principal component analysis)\
    \ was performed using the main selected phenotyping parameters\ncomputed from\
    \ the inﬁeld measurements (thermal images and ﬁeld spectrometer) and the UAV\n\
    hyperspectral imager respectively.\nTo build decision trees we used the WEKA software\
    \ (The Waikato Environment for Knowledge\nAnalysis v. 3.8, 2016) and the J48 algorithm\
    \ [55]. The decision trees were calibrated and cross-validated\nusing an n-fold\
    \ approach with n = 10 [56]. This cross-validation is considered as a conservative\n\
    estimation of model accuracy. The total dataset was partitioned into 10 groups\
    \ and 10 new subsets\nof the total were created using nine out of the 10. Ten\
    \ test trees were then built using the reduced\ndatasets; the unused 10% in each\
    \ case was used to compute the classiﬁcation error for each tree.\nOnce the 10\
    \ test trees were built, their classiﬁcation error rate as a function of tree\
    \ size was averaged.\nFinally, the reference tree was pruned to the number of\
    \ nodes matching the size that produced the\nminimum cross validation cost [57].\
    \ The decision trees were built for two sets of data: (1) Ground\nphenotyping\
    \ (123 SIs, TC and CHruler) and (2) UAV derived parameters (77 SIs, CHDSM) at\
    \ 102 and\n152 das.\n3. Results\n3.1. Spatial BCN Distribution in the Field\n\
    The spatial distribution of the initial BCN population density varied strongly\
    \ throughout the\nexperimental ﬁeld (Figure 1). At sowing, BCN population densities\
    \ ranged from 306 to 2284 J2s\nper 100 g of the topsoil and from 320 to 3457 J2s\
    \ per 100 g in the subsoil. Overall, BCN population\ndistribution was relatively\
    \ even and high, with 90% of the plots infested with more than 600 J2s per\n100\
    \ g of soil (Figure 1c).\nThe initial BCN population density per treatment (cultivar)\
    \ varied from 814 to 1283 J2s per 100 g\nsoil on average in the topsoil (CV of\
    \ 15%) (Table 3). There was no signiﬁcant difference between the\ninitial BCN\
    \ infestations of the treatments, which were all affected by a high BCN pressure\
    \ on average.\nThe ratio pf/pi is an indicator for reproduction and represents\
    \ the ability of the cultivar to prevent\nnematode reproduction in the roots [58].\
    \ The reproduction index pf/pi in the topsoil was on average\n1.1 for the tolerant\
    \ cultivars and 8.6 for the susceptible cultivars (Figure 2). Tolerant cultivars\
    \ B and D\nperformed the best with an average pf/pi ratio below one (0.65 and\
    \ 0.55, respectively).\n3.2. Beet Fresh Weight and Nematode Population\nThe tolerant\
    \ cultivars produced higher beet fresh weight (BFW) than the susceptible cultivars.\n\
    The highest white sugar yield (WSY) of 17.17 t ha−1 was observed for the tolerant\
    \ cultivar D.\nOn average, BFW and WSY were signiﬁcantly higher for the tolerant\
    \ cultivars compared to the\nsusceptible ones (on average +18% and +17%, respectively).\
    \ There was no signiﬁcant correlation\nbetween the initial BCN population density\
    \ and the yield of the different cultivars. Thus, we assume\nyield differences\
    \ between cultivars were not caused by differences in initial BCN population density\n\
    but by differences in the cultivar response to nematodes.\nFor both susceptible\
    \ and tolerant cultivars, ﬁnal beet fresh weight was not signiﬁcantly correlated\n\
    with the pf/pi ratio (Figure 3). However, there was a trend showing that the more\
    \ nematodes reproduce\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 787\n8 of 21\nin the roots, the\
    \ higher is the yield-reducing effect. This trend was higher for the susceptible\
    \ cultivars\n(R2 = 0.58, p = 0.24) than for the tolerant ones (R2 = 0.28, p =\
    \ 0.37).\nTable 3. Beet fresh weigh, white sugar yield and initial BCN population\

    \ a good correlation 102 das (R2 = 0.55, p < 0.01) demonstrating that\nthe DSM\
    \ derived from a UAV platform is a valuable source to evaluate the canopy height\
    \ (Figure 4a).\nThe error on the canopy height evaluation was less than 3 cm.\
    \ The DSM tends to underestimate the\nCHruler by 14.5 cm measured in the middle\
    \ of rows. However, the amount of CHruler measurements\nwas limited in number\
    \ due to the need for physically entering the ﬁeld and plot. The relatively\n\
    high underestimation is likely caused by the selective use of the middle row height\
    \ only for CHruler,\nbeing higher than the average plot height reﬂected by CHDSM\
    \ because inter-row height were not\nmeasured on the ground. Nevertheless, CHruler\
    \ reﬂects a genotype speciﬁc height measure sufﬁcient\nto differentiate tolerant\
    \ and susceptible genotypes. Therefore, we consider CHDSM as equivalent or\neven\
    \ better.\nSugar yield prediction power using CHDSM extracted 152 das was weak\
    \ but signiﬁcant (R2 = 0.39,\np < 0.01).\nHowever, CHDSM of the tolerant cultivars\
    \ was signiﬁcantly higher than the CHDSM of the\nsusceptible ones at the two dates\
    \ of measurements (Figure 4d), which was not the case for CHruler,\nwhere no signiﬁcant\
    \ differences were observed between the two types of cultivars 102 das (Figure\
    \ 4c).\nInterestingly, CHDSM of susceptible cultivars was signiﬁcantly lower by\
    \ 1.4 cm at the measurement on\n152 das, while CHDSM of the tolerant cultivars\
    \ signiﬁcantly increased by 3.6 cm during the same time.\nFigure 4. (A) Relationship\

    Canopy temperature (TC) allowed us to rank cultivars according to their ability\
    \ to cool down under\nmoderate environmental stress (TAIR 28.7 ◦C, RH 54%). Average\
    \ TC of the susceptible cultivars was\nsigniﬁcantly higher than TC of the tolerant\
    \ ones (24.7 ◦C ± 0.1 vs. 23.8 ± 0.1 on average). The average\ncooling effect\
    \ of the tolerant cultivars was 5.4% higher than that of the susceptible cultivars\
    \ (data not\nshown). Three susceptible cultivars displayed the highest TC (Figure\
    \ 5). Susceptible cultivar D\ndisplayed a TC similar to the tolerant cultivars.\n\

    \ between TC and sugar yield are presented at the plot and cultivar levels in\

    \ canopy temperature and the white\nsugar yield for the susceptible cultivars\
    \ (R2 = 0.40, p < 0.01). The correlation was very high at the\ncultivar level\
    \ for the susceptible cultivars (R2 = 0.99, p < 0.01). In contrast, no correlation\
    \ between TC\nand ﬁnal yield could be observed for the tolerant cultivars.\nFigure\

    11 of 21\n3.5. Spectrometry and UAV Hyperspectral Imaging\n3.5.1. Discrimination\
    \ of Susceptible and Tolerant Cultivars\nWe found several SIs suitable for discriminating\
    \ susceptible and tolerant cultivars of each group\nfor both ﬁeld spectroscopy\
    \ and UAV hyperspectral imaging (Table 4). The selected SIs reﬂect plant\ntraits\
    \ such as leaf chlorophyll and water content, leaf area index, and biomass which\
    \ are expected\nto be affected by severe BCN infestation. Surprisingly, it was\
    \ not possible to ﬁnd SIs to signiﬁcantly\ndiscriminate susceptible and tolerant\

    \ related to the small plant size in early growth stages. For later stages, the\
    \ SIs HI, CHLG or\n780/700 were particularly suitable for differentiating susceptible\

    \ After 102 days, the main differences between susceptible\nand tolerant cultivars\
    \ were related to biomass (NDVI), chlorophyll content of the leaves (780/700,\n\
    CHLG) and general stress (HI). At 152 das, susceptible cultivars could also be\
    \ differentiated from the\ntolerant ones using the SIs related to water content\
    \ (NDWI1650, NDWI). The range of the hyperspectral\nimager on the UAV did not\
    \ include short wave infrared bands, which prevented the calculation of\nspectral\
    \ indices related to the water absorption bands. SIs extracted from the UAV hyperspectral\n\

    Studying single parameters allowed to differentiate between susceptible and tolerant\
    \ cultivars\nfrom the same group and to predict yield with a fairly good accuracy.\
    \ Multivariate analysis allowed us\nto go further and discriminate between the\
    \ type of cultivars independently from the group.\nTwo PCA were performed separately\
    \ using ground data (PCAground) and UAV data (PCAUAV)\non the third date of measurements\
    \ 152 das (Figure 8). Sugar yield and beet fresh weight were\nused as explanatory\
    \ variables. In the PCAground, 81% of the variance is explained by the two ﬁrst\n\
    principal components (Figure 8a,b). Results conﬁrmed that high canopy temperature\
    \ is correlated\nto yield reduction. Canopy temperature and HI appeared particularly\
    \ suitable for differentiating\nsusceptible and tolerant cultivars (Figure 8a).\
    \ Cultivars from breeder A and D could be easily\ndiscriminated using indices\
    \ related to chlorophyll (CHLG, 780/700, TGI) and biomass (NDVI)\n(Figure 8b).\
    \ Cultivars from the two other companies showed a similar proﬁle in terms of canopy\n\
    reﬂectance. Overall, principal component F2 represents the ability of the sugar\
    \ beets to tolerate\nnematodes while principal component F1 seems more related\
    \ to the genetic background of the plants.\nFigure 8.\nPrincipal component analysis\

    \ the low correlations between\nSIs computed from the ﬁeld spectrometer and from\
    \ the UAV hyperspectral imager. Variables used did\nnot allow us to discriminate\
    \ easily between the types of cultivars (Figure 8c). One reason is surely the\n\
    missing thermal data at the UAV level. Another reason is that height measurements\
    \ at ground level\nwere not sufﬁcient to reveal genotypic differences between\
    \ the investigated sugar beet types, which in\ncontrast UAV-based height measurements\
    \ could show on plot level. PCAUAV conﬁrmed the close\nrelationship between canopy\
    \ height and sugar yield at this advanced stage of the sugar beet growth.\nCultivars\
    \ from groups A and D could be differentiated using CHLG and TGI indices conﬁrming\
    \ the\ngood ability of chlorophyll related indices for the characterization of\
    \ genetic background.\n3.7. Decision Trees\nThe univariate decision trees (UDT)\
    \ were used to classify sugar beet according to the type of\ncultivar (susceptible\
    \ or tolerant) or the genetic background (breeder) using multiple traits. The\
    \ cross\nvalidation produced accurate results without an independent dataset for\
    \ assessing the accuracy of\nthe model [59]. We found that decision trees could\
    \ classify cultivar type and genetic background\nusing just a few parameters (Table\
    \ 6). Model accuracy was very similar using parameters evaluated\nat the ground\
    \ level and information sensed with the UAV hyperspectral imager. Average cultivar\n\
    classiﬁcation accuracy was 77% and 83% on 102 and 152 das, respectively. Classiﬁcation\
    \ of plots\nwas slightly higher for the type of cultivars compared to the genetic\
    \ background of the cultivars.\nOverall coefﬁcients of agreement were good. The\
    \ Kappa coefﬁcient varied from 0.46, which can be\nconsidered as a “moderate”\
    \ agreement to 0.74, which corresponds to a “substantial” agreement [60].\nTable\

    \ das\nusing the UAV information with 88%. The UDT using UAV based data for the\
    \ classiﬁcation of\nsusceptible or tolerant cultivars used the CHDSM as a main\
    \ parameter for classiﬁcation. This was\nnot the case for the classiﬁcation according\
    \ to the genetic background. Overall, information related\nto vegetation density,\
    \ height, water content and pigment content in the leaves were suitable for\n\
    cultivar type classiﬁcation (see the Supplementary Materials). Physiological information\
    \ related to\nphotosynthesis, canopy temperature, nitrogen content and water content\
    \ were selected in the UDT to\ndifferentiate genetic backgrounds.\n4. Discussion\n\
    The results of this study demonstrated that ground-based and airborne phenotyping\
    \ methods\nincluding imaging, spectrometry and thermometry can be used in the\
    \ ﬁeld to evaluate the level of beet\ncyst nematode (BCN) tolerance of sugar beet\
    \ cultivars and predict sugar yield.\nInfestation levels observed in this ﬁeld\
    \ study can be considered as moderate to high. The tolerance\nlimit, which is\
    \ the nematode population below which no damage is detectable, could not be precisely\n\
    evaluated in this study. However, it is estimated to be between 300 and 1000 J2s\
    \ per 100 g of soil for the\nnine cultivars according to the ﬁeld location and\
    \ soil temperatures observed during the season [61,62].\nUnder such nematode stress,\
    \ it was possible to rank cultivars according to their ability to withstand or\n\
    Remote Sens. 2018, 10, 787\n15 of 21\nrecover from the nematode attack and yield\
    \ well. As expected, the ﬁve cultivars described as tolerant\nshowed higher yield\
    \ than the ones known to be susceptible [63]. The high nematode multiplication\
    \ rate\nobserved in the four susceptible cultivars is aligned with the lower yield\
    \ observed for these cultivars.\nInterestingly, two tolerant cultivars (B and\
    \ D) presented a multiplication rate below one, indicating\nthem as resistant\
    \ since they decreased the nematode population in the ﬁeld [40,64]. Cultivar D\n\
    combines high tolerance (high yield under nematode infestation) and high resistance\
    \ (prevention of\nnematode multiplication), which is of advantage for use in infested\
    \ ﬁelds. No signiﬁcant correlation\ncould be found between the initial number\
    \ of BCN and the ﬁnal yield. This was also shown by\nReuther et al. [40] and may\
    \ possibly be explained by the range of initial BCN population in the ﬁeld,\n\
    which was above the damage threshold.\nCanopy height extracted from the DSM allowed\
    \ us to differentiate between susceptible and\ntolerant cultivars which was not\
    \ the case for the manual measurements CHruler. Since CHDSM takes\napproximately\
    \ 3500 pixels representing single height estimates it can be assumed that the\
    \ derived\naverage canopy height is more realistic compared to the too few ground\
    \ measurements per plot.\nThis clearly shows a beneﬁt of UAV-based imaging evaluation\
    \ of traits such as canopy height that\nrequire lots of time and effort for manual\
    \ evaluation in the ﬁeld. The higher CHDSM differences\nbetween susceptible and\
    \ tolerant cultivars observed 152 das can be explained by the higher nematode\n\
    effect on susceptible cultivars, which increased over the season in contrast to\
    \ the tolerant ones.\nHowever, DSM estimates can likely be improved with a higher\
    \ overlap of images and crosswise\nﬂight paths and eventually a lower ﬂying altitude.\
    \ Additionally, stationary markers as used in [35]\nfor geo-localization will\
    \ further improve UAV-based height measurements. Such markers will also\nfacilitate\
    \ automated feature extraction based on geo-coordinates and thus reduce data extraction\
    \ time.\nThe canopy temperature (TC) showed high potential for classifying cultivars\
    \ according to their\nsusceptibility or tolerance to nematodes. Three out of four\
    \ susceptible cultivars had the highest TC,\nreﬂecting the lower ability of these\
    \ plants to transpire water and thus cool down. TC is closely correlated\nwith\
    \ the prevailing temperature of the local environment, the leaf transpiration\
    \ rate and the stomatal\nconductance [30,42,65,66]. BCN damage in the roots decreases\
    \ water uptake, which subsequently\nreduces the leaf transpiration rate and results\
    \ in a higher TC [67–69]. The high correlation observed\nbetween TC and ﬁnal sugar\
    \ yield for the susceptible cultivars likely reﬂects the nematode damage\neffect.\
    \ The higher the BCN damage on the roots is, the higher is the TC. Schmitz et\
    \ al. [20] and\nJoalland et al. [13] had similar results for susceptible cultivars\
    \ under ﬁeld and semi-ﬁeld conditions,\nrespectively. That no correlation was\
    \ observed for tolerant cultivars is likely related to the less affected\nwater\
    \ uptake and transpiration rate compared to those of susceptible cultivars [70–72].\
    \ Thus, TC is\nsuitable to determine the level of susceptibility but less for\
    \ determination of tolerance level or to\npredict ﬁnal yield.\nSIs were found\
    \ to be useful indicators for quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the sugar\n\
    beet canopy. Under moderate to high BCN infestation, single SIs related to chlorophyll\
    \ content (CHLG),\nphotosynthetic activity (PRI), plant biomass (NDVI) or general\
    \ stress (HI) were able to discriminate tolerant\nand susceptible cultivars from\
    \ the same breeder (same genetic background). This is in line with many\nstudies\
    \ using spectroscopy methods to investigate genotype trials or plant stress detection\
    \ [11,19,27,53].\nThus, for crop improvement studies or other experimental trials,\
    \ spectrometry and/or spectral imaging is\na fast and reliable screening method\
    \ to characterize and rank different cultivars from the same genetic\nbackground\
    \ according to their reaction to treatments or stresses. Here, we were able to\
    \ demonstrate this\nfor sugar beet cultivars and for their ability to tolerate\
    \ nematodes. Yet, when the genetic background\nbetween cultivars differed widely\
    \ (namely between cultivars from different seed companies), it was not\npossible\
    \ to use a single SI to robustly discriminate the tolerant and susceptible cultivars.\
    \ Here, the use\nof several relatively independent SIs was needed to identify\
    \ the type of cultivars under BCN infestation.\nCombining SIs and thermal information\
    \ integrates various aspects of plant growth and development\nsuch as canopy structure,\
    \ biomass, pigment and water content, and photosynthetic activity, so such\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2018, 10, 787\n16 of 21\na combination can be a powerful tool to classify\
    \ cultivars, even in experiments incorporating high\ngenetic diversity.\nIn this\
    \ study we combined the various measured parameters by using decision trees.\n\
    After 152 days, CHDSM, chlorophyll- and water-content-related SIs were essential\
    \ for discrimination\nbetween susceptible and tolerant cultivars, which demonstrates\
    \ the high diversity and non-speciﬁcity\nof nematode-caused symptoms [6].\nInterestingly,\
    \ cultivars from group A and group D could be classiﬁed with high accuracy. This\
    \ is\nclearly reﬂected in the PCA where plots from both groups were separately\
    \ clustered. Such results\nillustrate the high variability caused by the intrinsic\
    \ genetic background of each breeder, which is\nreﬂected in the plant physiology\
    \ (water content, pigment concentration, photosynthetic activity)\nand plant performance\
    \ (CHDSM, biomass). Cultivars that were bred using different germplasm\npools\
    \ may display very different reﬂectance spectra although depicting a similar tolerance\
    \ level.\nWhile CHDSM appeared as an important parameter for the cultivar type\
    \ classiﬁcation, it was not useful\nfor classiﬁcation of the breeder.\nSIs related\
    \ to leaf chlorophyll showed high correlations with the ﬁnal sugar yield for all\n\
    ground and aerial measurements for the susceptible cultivars. This observation\
    \ is consistent with\nthe observation that more nematode damage on the roots triggers\
    \ more visible symptoms on the\nshoots and thus causes yield reduction. As early\
    \ as 88 das, SIs related to nitrogen status and water\ncontent such as 780/700\
    \ and NDWI, respectively could be used to predict yield with high precision.\n\
    Hillnhütter et al. [19] also showed correlations between water content or leaf\
    \ pigment related SIs and\nbeet fresh weight in an infested ﬁeld. However, yield\
    \ prediction on tolerant cultivars was best after\n152 days, when environmental\
    \ conditions were more constraining (air temperature 28.7 ◦C, RH 54%)\nand likely\
    \ the nematode stress affected the sugar beet growth for a longer period making\
    \ differences\nmore pronounced. Such moderate environmental stress as observed\
    \ in this ﬁeld study was obviously\nincreased by the nematode stress and allowed\
    \ to signiﬁcantly differentiate tolerant cultivars and better\npredict ﬁnal yield.\
    \ Stronger symptoms were also observed on a tolerant cultivar under semi-ﬁeld\n\
    conditions when drought stress was higher [13].\nThe data obtained from the ﬁeld\
    \ spectrometer and the hyperspectral imager were not consistently\ncorrelated,\
    \ which is also reﬂected by the differences observed between PCA computed with\
    \ ground and\nUAV data. Such partly mismatch can be explained by differences between\
    \ sensors and the measurement\nand calibration procedure. The instruments used\
    \ have different sensor and ﬁlter technology causing\ndifferent spectral resolution\
    \ and spectral response, which causes the slightly altered shape of the\nderived\
    \ spectra. The ﬁeld spectrometer had a very high resolution, while the hyperspectral\
    \ imager\nhad a lower spectral resolution. As a consequence, some SIs, such as\
    \ HI, were computed using slightly\ndifferent bands, which resulted in low correlation\
    \ between them [19]. In addition, the ground sampling\nresolution differed between\
    \ the two measurement approaches. Whereas the average spectra per\nplot for the\
    \ ﬁeld spectrometer are the average of ﬁve point measurements with a footprint\
    \ of about\n50 cm diameter at random locations in each plot, the plot spectra\
    \ obtained from the hyperspectral\nimaging were an average of thousands of pixels\
    \ with an instantaneous ﬁeld of view (ifov) of two\ncm. Further, the processing\
    \ and calibration steps of both instruments differ. The ﬁeld spectrometer\nis\
    \ calibrated every 15 measurements (every three plots) using a white reference.\
    \ The hyperspectral\nimages are orthomosaicked using structure from motion procedures\
    \ in Agisoft software before being\ncalibrated to reﬂectance with a partial least\
    \ squares regression using three reﬂectance panels differing\nin absolute reﬂectance\
    \ intensity (Figure 1). Better understanding of the procedures in the sensors\
    \ used\nand the consequences for the resulting measurements will surely improve\
    \ the use of aerial imaging\nmethods in the future. First attempts can be seen\
    \ in the standardization of calibration methodology\nand cross validation [73].\n\
    Although SIs computed from the ﬁeld spectrometer and from the spectral imager\
    \ were not fully\nconsistent, results and conclusions regarding the sugar beet\
    \ phenotype were similar. Both tools\nwere able to detect stress caused by nematodes\
    \ and predict the ﬁnal yield. This showed the great\nRemote Sens. 2018, 10, 787\n\
    17 of 21\npotential of UAV hyperspectral imagery to generate maps of nematode\
    \ symptoms and yield potential\nof sugar beets with a high throughput. Such maps,\
    \ combined with a reduced number of soil samples\nin the ﬁeld to conﬁrm the presence\
    \ of nematodes, allow determination of spatial distribution and\ndensity of nematode\
    \ infestation in agricultural ﬁelds. Such knowledge may help to select the right\n\
    countermeasure such as optimized crop rotations or use of catch crops or appropriate\
    \ tolerant sugar\nbeet cultivars. For breeding purposes, such technology can make\
    \ selection monitoring more efﬁcient\nand thus accelerate crop improvement [74].\
    \ In our experimental ﬁeld, tolerant and susceptible cultivars\ncould be classiﬁed\
    \ with an accuracy of over 80% on average. Speciﬁc SIs alone or combined and\n\
    added to canopy height and temperature information have the ability to quantify\
    \ traits related to\nBCN damage and to ﬁnal sugar yield. Cultivar response to\
    \ nematodes can be deduced in a fast and\nefﬁcient manner and might be linked\
    \ to physiological traits such as chlorophyll and water content,\nplant biomass\
    \ or photosynthesis rate. Such a targeted analysis of traits will signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the\nefﬁciency of sugar beet breeding for nematode tolerance and resistance.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nRemote sensing methods were able to identify BCN symptoms on sugar\
    \ beet plants and\ndiscriminate the type of cultivars under real ﬁeld conditions.\
    \ While thermography appeared suitable\nfor yield prediction on susceptible cultivars\
    \ only, ﬁeld spectrometry and aerial UAV hyperspectral\nimaging were able to predict\
    \ yield on susceptible and tolerant cultivars, likewise. Despite disparities\n\
    in spectral and spatial resolution, both spectral tools can be used to characterize\
    \ nematode symptoms\nand classify cultivars. Multivariate methods were precious\
    \ tools to identify genetic backgrounds of\nthe sugar beet cultivars and their\
    \ ability to tolerate nematodes using a diversity of spectral indices.\nThe UAV\
    \ equipped with a hyperspectral imager proved to be a valuable tool for BCN stress\
    \ diagnosis\nin the ﬁeld and for improving breeding efﬁciency facilitating the\
    \ monitoring of multiple traits at the\nsame time and potentially at multiple\
    \ sites. The most valuable remotely sensed traits to monitor\nfor BCN tolerance\
    \ and yield potential were canopy height, spectrally inferred chlorophyll content,\n\
    leaf area or biomass, and canopy temperature.\nSupplementary Materials: The following\

  description: 'Internet of Things (IoT) technology adds new direction to the significant
    monitoring of soil, plants, and agriculture fields in smart agriculture. In this
    system, IoT-based solutions are employed to enhance the agricultural outcomes
    and resolve the different problems. Here, an IoT-based device is proposed namely
    “SmartTech-Agri.” This device is designed to supervise the different parameters:
    soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity, smoke detection, and animal motion
    detection in the agricultural field. Our proposed device uses a PIR motion sensor
    to detect movement of intruders, smoke sensor to detect smoke, soil moisture sensor
    to evaluate moisture percentage, and temperature–humidity sensor to measure environmental
    temperature in the agriculture field. The proposed design consists of three main
    major portions: (a) an Arduino-based IoT gadget, (b) a Smartphone application,
    and (c) a Web server application. The SmartTech-Agri can evaluate different parameters
    and instantly communicate vital associated information via web-based technologies.
    The proposed design has been compared with existing recent related works. The
    accuracy of our device varies from − 2.82 to + 3.85% for humidity and − 2.66 to
    + 3.14% in case of temperature. This low-cost technology can be utilized for farming
    production and management in a convenient and effective manner. This approach
    will lower the overall labor costs and cut down on water waste.'

  explanation: The research paper focuses on the design and development of an IoT-based
    device called "SmartTech-Agri" for monitoring soil and field conditions in precision
    agriculture crop fields. The device comprises sensors for measuring soil moisture,
    air temperature, air humidity, smoke detection, and animal motion detection. The
    data collected by these sensors is transmitted to a web server and a smartphone
    application for monitoring and control. The paper discusses the architecture,
    flowchart, and design of the SmartTech-Agri device, as well as its implementation
    and experimental results.

    Explore all metrics Abstract Internet of Things (IoT) technology adds new direction
    to the significant monitoring of soil, plants, and agriculture fields in smart
    agriculture. In this system, IoT-based solutions are employed to enhance the agricultural
    outcomes and resolve the different problems. Here, an IoT-based device is proposed
    namely “SmartTech-Agri.” This device is designed to supervise the different parameters:
    soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity, smoke detection, and animal motion
    detection in the agricultural field. Our proposed device uses a PIR motion sensor
    to detect movement of intruders, smoke sensor to detect smoke, soil moisture sensor
    to evaluate moisture percentage, and temperature–humidity sensor to measure environmental
    temperature in the agriculture field. The proposed design consists of three main
    major portions: (a) an Arduino-based IoT gadget, (b) a Smartphone application,
    and (c) a Web server application. The SmartTech-Agri can evaluate different parameters
    and instantly communicate vital associated information via web-based technologies.
    The proposed design has been compared with existing recent related works. The
    accuracy of our device varies from − 2.82 to + 3.85% for humidity and − 2.66 to + 3.14%
    in case of temperature. This low-cost technology can be utilized for farming production
    and management in a convenient and effective manner. This approach will lower
    the overall labor costs and cut down on water waste. Similar content being viewed

    of Things-Based Hardware and Software for Smart Agriculture: A Review Chapter
    © 2020 Introduction According to a survey, it is predicted that Global population
    will increase approximately upto 9.73 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100
    [1]. A rise in the demand for agriculture food production increases in direct
    proportion to population expansion [2]. Food production always hampers due to
    various environmental issues including climate change and harsh weather conditions
    [3, 4]. Climate change has a significant negative impact on agriculture due to
    rising water demands and decreasing agricultural productivity in areas that require
    the only irrigation [5]. Irrigation technologies based on rain-fed agriculture
    and groundwater irrigation are required to grow better crops. A diverse irrigation
    system for managing water, as well as agricultural field monitoring systems, are
    required in precision agriculture crop fields (e.g., wheat, potato, and onion),
    where each crop has particular water requirements and agriculture crop field protection.
    Apart from water management and agricultural field monitoring systems, transferring
    important information to farmers is essential to supervise and control the ongoing
    activities without go to the field in real-time. Researchers in [6, 7], have considered
    only the monitoring of soil moisture and environmental conditions but do not handle
    with field monitoring system in agriculture field from remotely and easily without
    farmer-field direct contact. Farmers may lack the ability to employ the existing
    technologies. It plays an important role in changing traditional and new technology
    from homes to offices and everywhere in between. So an easy and simple way out
    is very attractive from the farmer’s perspective. The most pressing issues, such
    as dwindling water supplies and environmental concerns, necessitate a smart agriculture-based
    solution. A remote sensor network (WSN) is connected to IoT which can be used
    for a smart water system framework. Thus, employing WSN can provides a way for
    correspondence, calculation, and data detection from nearby and remote locations.
    The IoT and sensor network innovation collaborate with the board of water assets
    for the framework of a water-saving system. In this system, the moisture sensor
    detects the amount of water in soil, a water siphon supplies the essential amount
    of water to plants, and a Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) block transmits observed data
    to internet [8, 9]. Then IoT framework has developed, tested, and approved by
    observing the different parameters of commercial agriculture farming [10]. In
    this sector, by employing smart farming via IoT can be able to improve operational
    efficiency, lower costs, reduce waste, and better product quality. In order to
    increase the profits, the agriculture sector will need to incorporate new technologies.
    In this sector, the high labor cost of routine manual monitoring must be reduced.
    It should be crucial to properly manage water when it is not in use. Recent studies
    have emphasized the need of smart agriculture in enhancing and growing agricultural
    output to help close the food supply–demand gap. An efficient and economical smart
    gadget is very important for precision agriculture system to maximize agricultural
    farm product, anticipate crop health, and protect crops from animals and fire.
    To resolve these issues, we have proposed a device namely SmartTech-Agri for soil
    and agriculture field monitoring systems well-being checking framework for improved
    yield of the harvests, particularly in rural regions where internet is available.
    The major contributions of our research work are as listed below: i. Design a
    real-time smart device for agriculture crop fields using IoT to measure and monitor
    the health condition of soil as well as condition of environment. ii. Proposed
    device is also responsible for safety and protection of agricultural field especially
    in firing condition, and attacking of birds and animals. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. The Sect. 2 discusses the related existing works. Architecture
    of proposed design is given in Sect. 3. The flowchart and working procedure are
    presented in Sect. 4. The detail design of proposed work is presented in Sect
    5. Implementation of our proposed designs is described in Sect. 6. Details observation
    of our proposed designs is explained in Sect. 7. In Sect. 8, the paper is concluded.
    Related Works In this section, different existing related works are discussed
    briefly. The wireless sensor network (WSNs) with the AgriSens architecture consists
    of various parts like water-level sensor, sensor node, remote server, and IoT
    gateway [6, 11, 12]. Adopting a WSN is anticipated to address both system-level
    concerns and end user needs for effective agricultural monitoring. It is difficult
    to compare all of these topologies because several WSN topologies have been built,
    and each topology has its own scenario [13]. A conceptual architecture based on
    WSN namely FarmFox architecture is described in [7], which is cost-effectiveness,
    user friendly, versatile, energy competence, reliability, and hardiness. In [14],
    a low-cost agro-climatic monitoring system based on the IoTs is made up of a number
    of stations placed both inside and outside the greenhouse and connected to an
    IoT platform via a WSN. Each station is equipped with a variety of sensors to
    detect many variables including humidity, temperature, soil moisture, wind direction,
    wind speed, precipitation, pH, radiation, etc. [14]. Precision farming with IoT
    technologies like AgriTalk does for the cultivation of turmeric which improved
    the quality dramatically [15]. A low-cost, highly accessible IoT platform for
    agriculture is introduced namely FarmBeats [16] which utilizes TV White Spaces
    (TVWS), long-range technique that supports high bandwidth sensors. This FarmBeats
    employs an intelligent Gateway and a weather aware base station to make sure that
    services are accessible both online and offline. There are also new path-planning
    algorithms that help to extend the battery life of drones [16]. Small amounts
    of water and electricity can be used to cultivate healthy plants. The authors
    in [17] primarily focus on cultivating tomato plants, which were successfully
    cultivated using an IoT-based automated approach. In this approach, a Node MCU
    is used to drive the DC motor and IoT technology is utilized to evaluate the different
    parameters such as soil moisture level, humidity level, temperature, and rain
    status. These parameters are all transmitted through Wi-Fi to the smart phone
    [18]. A system is designed that could automatically adjust the humidity and temperature
    of a confined environment and VLSI systems can be used to achieve inexpensive
    automation [19]. The design in [20] is an agricultural embedded system based on
    CMOS technology and it is used to implement the FPGA board [20]. With data monitoring
    utilizing LoRa and IoT Technology for smart farming, this effort is reviewed in
    real-time, with temperature, humidity, and soil moisture regularly communicated
    to the cloud with better data quality (QoD) [21]. In order to prevent animal invasions
    into crop fields, the authors describe the creation of a WSN application for crop
    safety. The nodes in the agricultural field have RF modules, LED flashers, PIR
    sensors, and sound generators. An intrusion detection system is installed to allow
    for early identification of the animal in the field [22]. In [23], an automatic
    irrigation system is used to manage and track irrigation. For precise field monitoring
    and control, two different types of sensors are employed. The PIC microcontroller
    serves as the project’s brains for automatic irrigation and the PIC’s internal
    ports are attached to the moisture and touch sensors [23]. The authors of [24]
    suggest an IoT-based smart stick that will enable ranchers to have real-time information
    about soil moisture and climate temperature for a very low-cost, allowing for
    live monitoring. The study in [25] shows the detail design and construction of
    a system that tracks humidity, temperature, and soil moisture at the agriculture
    field level. An IoT scheme in horticulture is made up of electronic devices that
    supervise the condition of air, water, and soil [26]. Architecture of Proposed
    “SmartTech-Agri” The architecture of SmartTech-Agri is briefly illustrated in
    Fig. 1. In our proposed device, we have employed the traditional conceptual architecture
    of WSN which is based on the architecture of IoT. Fig.1 Architecture of proposed
    SmartTech_Agri Full size image The proposed SmartTech_Agri is combined with three
    layers which are discussed in the following. (a) Sensing and Data Actuating Layer
    Wi-Fi technology is used by sensor nodes in the field to collect data about the
    field’s properties and transmit it to IoT gateway nodes. The data are then sent
    as packets by the gateway nodes to the distant server. In order to facilitate
    the integration and interconnection of virtual and physical entities, Wi-Fi produces
    the fundamental IoT-based communication architecture. (b) Remote Processing Layer
    It is the middle layer between the bottom layer and upper layer. Smart technology
    organization processes requests as well as data from the top and bottom layer.
    The advantage of being able to oversee field operations from a distance is made
    possible by the remote processing layer. (c) Application Layer The farmers may
    easily utilize the analytics to visualize the data that has been collected on
    their smart phones and personnel computers (PCs) with the aid of an internet and
    Wi-Fi connection. The farmers can locate a specific node’s position. Additionally,
    farmers can view their field data at any time via the Web server utilizing the
    Internet. Through Wi-Fi and the internet, farmers can also manage field operations
    in accordance with requirements. In the next section, flowchart and working procedure
    are discussed. Proposed Flowchart of SmartTech-Agri The flowcharts of SmartTech-Agri
    for two different microcontroller units are given in Figs. 2 and 3. Figure 2 represents
    the flowchart of proposed SmartTech-Agri devices using UNO_R3_ATMEGA328P. The
    proposed design works as follows. Fig. 2 Flowchart of proposed SmartTech-Agri
    Devices using UNO_R3_ATMEGA328P Full size image Fig. 3 Flowchart of proposed SmartTech-Agri
    Devices using UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266 Full size image The steps of working
    procedure of Fig. 2 are represented as follows: 1. First set up pin mode. 2. Connect
    with serial port to ESP8266 with a baud rate of 115,200 bps. 3. Wait for smoke
    and motion signal (To calibrate the result keep smoke sensor in clear air and
    PIR sensor away from motion. LED will blink when it is calibrated.) 4. Collect
    sensor data one by one and send to ESP8266 via serial port with delay of 3 s.
    5. Repeat step 4. Figure 3 represents the flowchart of proposed SmartTech-Agri
    devices using UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266 and their working steps are shown
    in the following. 1. Set up pin modes buzzer will beep 2 times after this. 2.
    ESP8266 to connect with Blynk software, make sure Wi-Fi is ON, buzzer will beep
    2 times.) 3. Wait for data available in serial port. 4. Read the different data
    from serial port and pass the data for each type through Blynk. 5. Obtain sensor
    value from data and send to Blynk. 6. Repeat step 3. Design of SmartTech-Agri
    The details of proposed SmartTech-Agri have been presented here. Details of all
    sensors are also presented in this section. A. Block Diagram of SmartTech-Agri
    Device: Cost-effectiveness, energy economy, reliability, and resilience are the
    main concepts that drove us to build these nodes. (a) Integrated Design of the
    Sensors Four sensors that have been recalibrated and utilized to measure moisture,
    temperature, motion of birds or other animals, and fire detection. The PIR sensor
    detects intruders near the field, soil moisture sensors measure the percentage
    of moisture content of the soil and smoke sensor senses the smoke from fire. Figure
    4 displays the deployed block diagram in more detail. The basics of different
    sensors are briefly described in the following subsection. Fig. 4 Block diagram
    of SmartTech-Agri Full size image i. Moisture Sensor (REES52) The resistance of
    the fork-shaped moisture sensor probe varies with soil moisture content and operates
    as a variable resistor (similar to a potentiometer). Soil conductivity and resistivity
    improve as soil moisture content increases. We can determine the soil moisture
    content by measuring the output voltage generated by the sensor in accordance
    with the resistance. To get our threshold value, we will first take an analogue
    reading from absolutely moist soil. If the analog reading exceeds this value,
    we will notify the user to water the soil. ii. Smoke Sensor (MQ-2)The smoke sensor
    can be used to detect flammable gas leakage and smoke. All the measuring parameters
    of this sensor can be measured from the datasheet of MQ-2 [27]. It is shown that
    the clean air has Rs/R0 value of 9.8. We can determine the R0 value of fresh air
    using this ratio. By running the sensor in fresh air and applying the analogue
    voltage output of the sensor according to Eq. (1), we can determine the Rs_air
    value of fresh air by analyzing the circuit of the MQ-2 sensor. $$ Rs\\_{\\text{air}}
    = ((5.0 - {\\text{Analog Voltage}}) \\, /{\\text{ Analog Voltage}}) $$ (1) We
    can calculate the value of Rs_air of fresh air from the Rs/R0 ratio. Now the Rs_air
    and Rs/R0 will change in the presence of smoke, and since Ro is fixed, we can
    compare this information with the data sheet to estimate the smoke concentration.
    iii. Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DTH11) This is a low-cost digital temperature–humidity
    sensor which computes the temperature and humidity in soil and environment. This
    sensor consists of 3-pin. Its data sensor output pin is connected with microcontroller
    digital pin. iv. Motion Sensor (PIR) The motion sensor (PIR) detects the movement
    of a human or animal within a range of around 10 m across the sensor placed in
    the agriculture field. This PIR sensor is capable of detecting different infrared
    radiation levels. The majority of PIR sensors feature a 3-pin connector on the
    bottom or side. One pin will be utilized for ground, another for signal, and the
    last for power. Power levels of up to 5 V are normal. The PIR sensor’s output
    remains low until motion is detected. It takes some time for the PIR sensor to
    warm up and begin functioning properly. (b) Integrated Design of IoT Gateway It
    serves as a communication bridge by establishing connections between the sensors
    and other devices like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. using internet. In SmartTech-Agri,
    an IoT gateway is employed to pass data from field to the processing unit. To
    achieve the stated goal, Wi-Fi and TCP, two widely utilized protocols, are used.
    We have created a webpage for managing and keeping track of the sensors. Additionally,
    it aids in the sensor data retrieval. (c) Integrated Design of Remote Servers
    We have created a Web server as part of our design. The files that make up a website
    are kept on the Web server along with the web server software. The servers are
    kept in a cloud-based environment. The SmartTech-Agri system is a \"unique system
    for precision agriculture\" since it uses this server to monitor the soil health
    monitor, intruders close to the field, and a smoke sensor to identify the smoke
    emitted from the fire. (d) Integrated Design of Sensor Nodes In order to produce
    SmartTech-Agri, sensor nodes are organized in a waterproof design. The android
    application displays the different parameters like temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, smoke, and motion which can be programmed into a microcontroller. B.
    Circuit Diagram of SmartTech-Agri Device: We have used UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266.
    It is used to obtain the sensor nodes active sleep mode. The UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266
    microcontroller is low-cost compared to other commercial alternatives. The device’s
    reliability qualification findings show that the expected data retention failure
    rate is substantially less than 1PPM during a 20-year period in hostile atmospheric
    conditions [12]. Figure 5 shows the circuit diagram of our proposed SmartTech-Agri
    device. The connections between the various node components and the processor
    are shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Circuit diagram of proposed SmartTech-Agri device
    Full size image Implementation of SmartTech-Agri After successful design of our
    proposed SmartTech-Agri device, we have to implement the prototype of our model.
    Experimental set up is shown in Fig. 6. It shows the SmartTech-Agri prototype
    of our proposed device which will monitor the different parameters of agricultural
    crop field. Fig. 6 Proto-type model of SmartTech-Agri device Full size image The
    humidity sensor, temperature sensor, soil moisture sensor, smoke sensor, motion
    detection sensor, buzzer, LED, relay, and motor are all connected to the microcontroller
    UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266. These sensors detect numerous soil parameters,
    and a motor is then used to provide the soil with water. The power supply for
    this microcontroller is 5 V DC is required to operate it. Moisture sensor is measured
    the soil moisture content in agricultural soil; the temperature and humidity sensor
    is measured the temperature and humidity in environmental condition in agriculture
    field; Smoke detector is detected the smoke of fires; and the PIR sensor is detected
    animals crossing fields by detecting their movement. Wild animals become agitated
    when the buzzer is used, and they vacate the place. The UNO_R3_Wi-Fi_ATMEGA328P_ESP8266
    microcontroller contains a Wi-Fi module that enables access to upload data to
    the cloud. The cloud-based web server for IoT applications (Blynk), is a basically
    open source. It can be operated by supplying a username and a password; we have
    developed our own channel for IoT-based agricultural monitoring. We will submit
    data via the Blynk API so that we can observe the soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, smoke, and animal detection on the web with visualization on a Blynk
    platform. This device displays the various readings based on various parameters.
    The Status LED has started to glow; it can set the threshold by positioning the
    gas sensor close to the smoke or gas you want to detect. After that, it turns
    around till the LED turns off. This sensor detects upto ranges approximately 5
    m. Whereas, PIR sensors detect the distance ranges from around 25 cm to 20 m.
    If any animal or bird close to within the detection range then the LED will ON
    otherwise the LED will OFF. Table 1 represents the performance comparison of SmartTech-Agri
    device with existing work. Cost of the proposed device is approximately four thousand
    only. So our device is cheaper compare to all existing designs [6, 7]. Table 1
    Comparisons of SmartTech-Agri with other existing systems Full size table Result
    Analysis Here, we have discussed the details of results obtained from our experiment
    setup. The snapshots are directly taken from our implemented project. Figure 7
    demonstrates how the hardware is examined for moisture, humidity, soil temperature,
    motion, and smoke. It also mentioned the actual values. Fig. 7 Visualization of
    sensed data displayed on user Web application Full size image Visualization of
    sensed data displayed on Android application is shown in Fig. 8 for our experiment
    set up. We have collected all the data at Balichak, West Bengal, Paschim Medinipur
    (latitude:22.360145 and longitude: 87.55689), during August–September, 2022. All
    the observations are shown in Table 2 for duration of 15 days. Fig. 8 Visualization
    of sensed data displayed on Smartphone Full size image Table 2 Data collected
    from various sensors Full size table The reading differences between the farm
    meter (thermo-hygrometer) and used sensors for the nearby weather node are observed
    in Table 3. The digital thermo-hygrometer and DHT11 have variation between − 2.66
    and 3.14% for temperature. It is observed that there is not much of an average
    temperature difference between the thermo-hygrometer and DHT11 sensor. The reason
    for the little variation is that DHT11 measures temperature in positive integers,
    which have a range of 0–50 °C. The DHT11 and digital thermo-hygrometer results
    have an average humidity variation between − 2.82 and 3.85%. Different humidity
    measurement ranges are the cause of the reading discrepancy between the sensor
    and digital thermo-hygrometer readings. So accuracy of our proposed device is
    nearly within an acceptable maximum tolerance level of ± 4%. Table 3 Data accuracy
    analysis Full size table Conclusion The IoT has been employed in agriculture to
    increase crop yields, enhance quality, and lower expenses. Hence, we have proposed
    an IoT-based SmartTech-Agri device to monitor the soil condition and field monitoring
    of precision agriculture. The proposed device is designed and employed in agricultural
    field. We have observed the real-time data from different sensors placed in agriculture
    field. Cost of SmartTech-Agri device is very low. Accuracy of the proposed device
    is upto the satisfaction level. If the farmers successfully employ this agricultural
    IoT-based solution, they will produce enough crops for the upcoming population’s
    rapid growth. The cloud sense data will likely be utilized in our future research
    to build the machine learning models for intelligently automated in precision
    agriculture. References Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

    IEEE Conference Location: Stellenbosch, South Africa SECTION I. Introduction Water
    scarcity and inefficient water management in agricultural practices have become
    major concerns worldwide. Traditional irrigation techniques frequently cause overwatering
    or under watering, which reduces crop yields and wastes water. The ESP32 microcontroller-based
    smart irrigation system we demonstrate in this research combines sensor data,
    connectivity, and intelligent control to provide accurate and effective water
    management. Agriculture has been essential for sustaining human diets for thousands
    of years. However, global food production has been declining since the twentieth
    century due to rising population and shrinking cultivable land. The global population
    is expected to increase to 8.5 billion by 2030 and 9.7 billion by 2050. Furthermore,
    the growing threat of global warming has had a significant impact on agricultural
    productivity around the world. With agriculture employing 75% of the global population,
    there is an urgent need for solutions to address the ongoing food production crisis
    and combat global warming. South Africa has the largest agricultural land on the
    African continent. As of 2020, the country’s agricultural land amounted to over
    96 million hectares and still be ranked as one of the 30 driest countries in the
    world with an average rainfall of about 40% less than the annual world average
    rainfall. Water management is needed and to address this situation, various strategies
    and innovative agricultural practices need to be implemented to uplift the farming
    culture. Researchers have proposed different approaches to monitor irrigation
    using embedded system technology. These approaches involve the use of smart systems
    to assess moisture content and plant growth. Automation of irrigation systems
    can be achieved by continuously monitoring moisture levels and activating the
    irrigation system accordingly, rather than relying on predefined schedules. Some
    systems utilize solenoid tubes to control irrigation, cutting off water supply
    when the desired moisture level is reached. These developments can significantly
    benefit regions facing water scarcity by increasing agricultural productivity.
    This paper discusses a smart agricultural system that assists farmers in efficiently
    managing water levels. The system consists of a controller unit and various sensors,
    including moisture, temperature, humidity, and water level sensors. Data from
    these sensors is transmitted between the cloud and the system through both wired
    and wireless connections. The system incorporates a mobile app that enables users
    to control water irrigation. By making use of technologies such as the Internet
    of Things (IoT) and wireless communication, farmers can design irrigation plans
    based on their specific agricultural profiles, optimizing water usage according
    to user input. Additionally, moisture sensors continuously monitor soil dryness,
    and plant root temperature is monitored for smart farming practices. The system
    processes sensor data and triggers actuators to transmit information online to
    the application as shown on figure 1. Fig. 1. System structure of the proposed
    design. Show All Numerical calculations based on the sensor data are performed
    to control water irrigation. Effective planning of water systems and fertilization
    is crucial for proper crop development. Environmental factors such as humidity,
    climate conditions, and pesticide usage also influence water consumption. Therefore,
    data on challenging climate conditions are collected and utilized to make informed
    decisions to increase crop production. For instance, hot, dry, sunny, and windy
    conditions require more water for irrigation, while cold, humid, snowy, and less
    humid conditions require less water. The process involves three steps as shown
    in Fig. 1: data collection, data processing, and obtaining results. Initially,
    environmental information is collected through sensor nodes, which is then transmitted
    to the processing unit. The data is subsequently fed into three different microcontrollers,
    controlling distinct operations. After processing, the results are directed to
    their respective outputs, including a liquid crystal display commonly called LCD
    display, the water pump, and the Telegram app. Briefly, the results of the research
    will contribute to agriculture by enabling users to rationalize water and power
    usage as well as reducing financial cost. After the introduction, the paper has
    five major sections to in order to get results expected. Firstly, a deep literature
    review was done to gain insight information on the smart irrigation system. Secondly,
    after choosing an appropriate approach, the next section is to clarify the methodology
    that will be apply which is the design science research method. In addition, the
    budget and component list are discussed into the same section. Thirdly, the results
    will be presented and explained in relationship to the objective assigned. The
    last section of this paper is conclusion followed by references. SECTION II. Literature
    review The concept of precision farming or smart farming has been in existence
    for nearly thirty years, and numerous research projects have been conducted in
    this field. Wireless sensor networks have been utilized to collect field information
    such as temperature, soil moisture, and pH levels, enabling real-time monitoring
    through IoT technology. Researchers in [1] and [3] developed an ESP32-based and
    Arduino-based model based on soil moisture sensing which is the most used approach.
    Some systems have been developed specifically for farmers with limited technological
    knowledge, employing a smart control board to monitor the entire system. Several
    research studies have focused on greenhouse temperature and humidity monitoring
    systems, providing real-time data through IoT using boards like NodeMcu. Some
    studies such as [2] used a solar powered irrigation system with incorporated soil
    moisture data along with temperature and humidity measurements. A cloud-based
    greenhouse [3] environment monitoring system has been proposed, storing temperature
    and humidity data on a web server. The concept of urban farming has gained attention
    due to decreasing cultivable land and increasing urban populations. Research has
    explored alternatives to conventional glass greenhouses, such as fully polythene-covered
    steel structures known as Poly Houses, which incorporate various sensors to monitor
    different aspects of the environment [3]. Efficient irrigation methods have been
    a key focus in precision farming research based on advanced techniques involving
    machine learning [8], computer vision, and unmanned aerial vehicles are also being
    employed in precision farming. While numerous research articles exist on greenhouse
    climate control, IoT-based farm monitoring systems, and irrigation systems, there
    is a lack of integration among these components into a comprehensive IoT-based
    precision farming solution. This project aims to fill that gap by combining all
    aspects of precision farming into a single IoT-based farm environment controller
    with a smart irrigation system. The system enables monitoring and control of the
    climate both locally and remotely, as well as automatic irrigation without human
    intervention. SECTION III. Methodology A. System Architecture Fig. 2. DC power
    supply, dc-dc buck converter powering the system. Show All Fig. 2 is a complete
    illustration of the functional block diagram of the smart irrigation system developed.
    It is powered to a 220-volt ac source and uses a power supply to convert to dc.
    Finally, a buck converter, a dc-to-dc converter will step down the dc voltage
    in order to supply the entire system. As inputs to my ESP32 microcontroller, the
    system makes use of one digital sensor for temperature and humidity sensing (DHT11),
    three soil moisture sensors and one water level sensor to check the water level
    in the tank. The ESP32 has an integrated Wi-Fi feature that will enable the system
    to be monitored in real time via telegram and are display on the LCD screen. The
    pump gets activated via a relay through output pins of the microcontroller. B.
    Harware Development Fig. 3 illustrates the hardware design of the water monitoring
    system. Fig. 3. The functional block diagram of the system. Show All The main
    component of this project is the ESP32, it is a development board, a series of
    low-cost and low power systems on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi
    and dual-mode Bluetooth. It has 36 General Purpose Input and Output (GPIO) pins,
    18 on each side of the board. The schematic diagram is designed using Fritzing
    Software. Five sensors are connected to the microcontroller which are DHT11, soil
    moisture and water level. Their signal pins are connected respectively to pin
    2, 3, 4, 6 and 27 while their positive and negative are respectively connected
    to +3V3 and GND pins of the ESP32. The LCD screen has 4-pin, I2C module mounted
    at the back, which are connected to Vin, GND, SDA and SCL pin of the microcontroller.
    The 20 by 4 LCD screen does not have enough space to display all information continuously,
    a push button switch is used to switch between screens to enable the user to see
    the data and it is connected to pin 10 of the microcontroller. And finally, the
    relay module is used to activate the pump, it has 5 pins connected to pin Vin,
    GND, 7, 8 and 9 of the ESP32. The component used in the schematic are listed in
    table 1. TABLE I. LIST OF COMPONENT C. Software Development Fig. 4. Arduino IDE
    interface. Show All Fig. 4 depicts the Arduino IDE interface. The Arduino IDE
    interface plays the main role of this section as it will be used to program the
    ESP32 DevKit module board. This last one has assigned pins on the hardware that
    can be software controllable as well. Those pins can be assigned considering their
    pin numbering or position such GPIO 27, GPIO16, GPIO33. The microcontroller recognizes
    the number assigned to the GPIO as a port to interact with. Considering the previous
    example those ports will be 25, 16 and 33. Any GPIO input of the ESP32 can be
    used as digital input to read external digital signals interacting with the microcontroller
    such as small push buttons or digital sensors. The major priority is given to
    the push button. The interrupt command acts as its name, while the program is
    running, it gives the priority to a group of commands that are under the interrupt
    loop. In the current project, the interrupt will be used to read the state of
    the push button switch which will result in starting the process and switching
    the display from the main menu to the measured values screen and vice versa as
    shown in Fig. 5. The second priority is given to the communication process between
    the ESP2 and cell phone via Telegram text message anytime once the process has
    started. 4 Analogue sensors are being used (3 soil moisture sensors and 1 water
    level), and will use GPIO pins with an analogue to digital conversion capability
    those are GPIO 32, GPIO36, GPIO 39 & GPIO34 strictly input and 1 digital sensor
    that is the DHT11. The digital sensor will use GPIO27 as a signal input pin. The
    DHT11 has the 3rd priority when it comes to temperature going lower than 4º Celsius
    to prevent plants from frost and overwatering. Some components require special
    libraries that are not included by default on the Arduino IDE interface, and those
    must be individually added. Those components are the I2C LCD display and the DHT
    sensor as well. The recorded data can be viewed into Telegram, which is a cross-platform
    cloud-based instant messaging. This application was chosen for its ability to
    create bots, these small programs are found on the servers and we can “call” them
    at any time to get hundreds of different functionalities to use with our chats
    in the application. Fig. 5. Software design flowchart. Show All Fig. 5 is an illustration
    of the software design logic. Other software were used in order to build this
    project. The schematic diagram and PCD were done using Autodesk Eagle and physical
    or practical model using fritzing. To ensure the proper operation of the system,
    a simulated model was developed using Proteus. When the device gets powered, the
    LCD goes ON, it will establish the wi-fi communication and get IP address from
    the internet sharing device (router, cellphone or laptop). The moisture sensor
    on its location will provide, the moisture level of the soil it is placed on.
    Before starting any irrigation process, the water level sensor checked the level
    of water, to protect the motor from running inefficiently. An LCD screen is used
    to give the state of each sensor placed on a particular field (moisture, temperature
    and water level in the tank). The user can use their mobile phone, tablet or laptop
    to view the readings and this is achievable through Wi-Fi communication. The complete
    flowchart of the design is illustrated in Fig 6. Fig. 6. Complete flowchart of
    the system. Show All Fig. 6 shows the flow diagram of the entire process as explained
    on the section above. SECTION IV. Results A. Hardware Prototype Fig. 7 presents
    the prototype of the smart and safe irrigation system. The ESP32 is placed on
    a printed circuit board (PCB) and the combination with the power supply, relay
    module, the dc-to-dc converter are placed into a black project enclosure. While
    the LCD sticks on top of the box. The ESP32 is connected to the rest of the equipment
    via terminal blocks. The wiring is made using category 6 network cables and they
    are soldered with components to the other end. The water level sensor is placed
    in the water reservoir to show the current level of water. The three pumps are
    immersed into water and are irrigating the fields placed in the 3 plastic plant
    pots via green pipes where the moisture sensors are placed. Fig. 7. Complete setup
    of the smart and safe irrigation system. Show All B. Data Analysis The irrigation
    data is collected over a period of a day and on three different fields and are
    plotted as shown in the graph in Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. The soil is dry if
    the moisture reading is between 0 and 300. If the moisture reading is above 300
    and the temperature and irrigation window are in the proper range, the ESP32 activates
    the pump to irrigate the field. The soil is considered wet if the reading is between
    301 and 600, and very wet if the reading is above 600 and the pump has to go off.
    Fig. 8. Field 1 sensors results. Show All Fig. 8 shows the results obtained on
    field 1. The result shows the values recorded by the sensor at a particular time
    of the day. The parameters monitored are soil moisture level, environmental temperature
    and humidity. The external conditions play a considerable role. It is observed
    that the sensor is performing within the range and irrigation process takes places
    more during the day around peak time than at night. Fig. 9. Field 2 sensors results.
    Show All Fig. 9 shows the results obtained on field 2. They are related to the
    result recorded on field 2 reinforcing the accuracy of the sensing devices for
    the same parameters. Fig. 10. Field 3 sensors results. Show All Fig. 10 shows
    the results obtained on field 3. All three fields are giving similar readings
    for the given interval. Fig. 11. Irrigation duration per field. Show All The 3
    fields are exposed to the same environment (ambient temperature and humidity).
    From the results shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, a parallelism can be observed
    in their behavior. The moisture level of the 3 tends to decrease during the day,
    especially at peak hour when it requires more irrigation than at night. On the
    other hand, the humidity during the night tends keep the moisture constant until
    sunrise. On the other, the time required to irrigate the 3 fields also follow
    the trend as shown in Fig. 11. The average time being 1578 seconds or 26 minutes.
    The values recorded can be viewed via telegram, the user will have to send a text
    in the telegram bot to request readings. Fig. 12. Requested data from Telegram.
    Show All Fig. 12 is an illustration of the telegram request. The user will have
    to send the command \"/Start\" in other to receive the opportunity to send the
    second command \"/readings\" to request the readings. C. Advantages Improves water
    efficiency by sing sensors to measure soil moisture levels, weather data, and
    other environmental factors. This approach intends to prevent over-watering or
    underwatering. Remote Control capability increases flexibility. This allows for
    easy adjustments to watering schedules and other settings, even when the user
    is away from their garden. Cost Savings It takes into consideration personal safety,
    because non authorized user can access data or control the device. SECTION V.
    CONCLUSION This paper presents the concept of utilizing smart agriculture and
    irrigation systems for crop and water management by public users especially by
    farmers. The various data recorded such as soil moisture level, tank level, temperature
    as well as humidity through sensors are fed into the ESP32 and accessible via
    telegram. The visualization of this data enabled the demonstration of automatic
    watering of crops. By utilizing these systems, the user can make well-informed
    decisions regarding the irrigation process. It enables the user to optimize the
    water usage as well as the irrigation schedule. Additionally, the integration
    of a smart irrigation system allows prevention of overwatering and underwatering.
    By decreasing the dependance on human labor, this system encourages sustainable
    and effective agricultural methods, resulting in improved agricultural results
    for healthier plants. It is expected that the practical integration of an IoT-based
    monitoring and smart irrigation systems represent a step toward affordable and
    sustainable farming technology. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More

    New breakthroughs have been made by humans since generations ago. Every time people
    experience changes and discover new things, they called them technologies. In
    the last several decades, wireless-based network access and resources develop
    rapidly and in some ways have replaced wired networks. Lately, one of the newest
    inventions that has been implemented and is still being developed is the Internet
    of Things (IoT). This is due to its advantages relating to functionality and interoperability
    without the use of cables. In this digital era, IoT is needed by many kinds of
    businesses in various industrial sectors [1]. With the advent of IoT, many businesses
    are evolving successfully, creating advanced innovations and services with smart
    and integrated technologies. Data mining is a procedure of gathering or dredging
    and processing data to acquire valuable information [2]. This process of gathering
    and extracting information can be achieved using software that can perform either
    mathematics, statistical calculations, or Artificial Intelligence. To analyze
    data, one can use more accurate information filtering techniques. These techniques
    are usually performed to find certain patterns that still have relevance to the
    goals or instructions from users. One of the data mining techniques is classification.
    Classification is an action for predicting an object’s class that serves to conclude
    several definitions of characteristics in a group or a class. C4.5 is a data mining
    algorithm for classification of data with numeric and categorical attributes.
    It works by forming a decision tree, which is a method that is used for prediction
    and classification. One can use it for data exploration and also for finding invisible
    relationships between some potential input variables and a target variable. A
    classification process produces rules, which are used for predicting the value
    of a new record’s discrete type attribute. Data mining helps IoT devices communicate
    intelligently. This happens as IoT devices that are equipped with one of the data
    mining techniques not only be able to collect various data but also can perform
    more complex analytical capabilities. These include data collection, network management,
    and even algorithm development [3]. Hence, at the beginning, a machine can only
    respond to commands from users directly, but now it can run various activities
    on its own without waiting for instructions from users. Thus, IoT devices can
    provide various sources of complete data and information which are the outcome
    of algorithm analysis. This article presents implementations of C4.5 in IoT-based
    monitoring systems. Specifically, the systems to monitor two activities that can
    be found in people’s daily lives—caring for ornamental fish in an aquarium and
    growing ornamental plants. Sometimes, these activities can be troublesome for
    people who are busy, because they must regularly check the condition of the objects
    that are being taken care. IoT technology helps people by using sensors to periodically
    get and send data for analysis. For the aquarium case, IoT system can give recommendation
    to users based on the aquarium water condition, while for the ornamental plant
    case, it gives recommendation based on the soil condition. The main contributions
    of this article are: 1. The design and implementation of a wireless monitoring
    and recommendation system for aquarium. It utilizes a NodeMCU ESP8266 and three
    sensors: temperature, turbidity, and ultrasonic sensors. 2. The design and implementation
    of a wireless monitoring and recommendation system for ornamental plants. It utilizes
    a NodeMCU ESP8266, an Arduino Uno, and three sensors: temperature, soil moisture,
    and soil pH sensors. 3. The implementation of C4.5 to analyze sensor data to give
    recommendation regarding monitoring condition for users. Parts of this work have
    been presented in [4] and [5]. This article is arranged into several sections
    as follows. Some works that are considered relevant to this article are given
    in Sect. 2. Section 3 presents the wireless monitoring system design, and Sect.
    4 gives detailed classification method. Aquarium monitoring and ornamental plant
    monitoring are elaborated in detail in Sects. 5 and 6, respectively. Then, Sect.
    7 summarizes this work and mentions some further research directions. 2 Related
    Works IoT (The Internet of Things) uses Internet technology to allow ordinary
    objects exchange data wirelessly. To be able to communicate, some battery-operated
    or batteryless sensor devices [6] are attached to these objects. One example is
    a device with a soil moisture sensor for an automatic plant watering system [7].
    The program ran in a WeMos DI module gave low and high values to a relay. When
    moisture was detected by the soil moisture sensor, it sent data to WeMos DI so
    it could control a connected relay to activate a water pump. Another example is
    a chilli irrigation system [8]. It had a soil moisture sensor that was attached
    to a NodeMCU, so it could detect and sent data to NodeMCU. NodeMCU notified a
    relay by sending a signal to turn on an irrigation pump. Nowadays, people deal
    with massive amounts of data. Huge amounts of data are generated from many kinds
    of sources every day. The data can be new and can be processed into meaningful
    information. Data mining is a procedure for examining data sets to determine their
    relationships and summarize them in an easy-to-understand manner. With data mining,
    people can perform automated or semi-automated analysis for large amounts of data
    to obtain some patterns that are previously unknown. Some methods applied in data
    mining are clustering, classification, and association rules. Data mining’s analysis
    result can support decision making, that is supported by knowledge. In [9], data
    mining was utilized to analyze sentiment or public opinion toward the presidential
    candidate in the 2019 general election in Indonesia. The tweet data were collected
    by Twitter by scraping the data. In [10], data mining’s linear discriminant analysis
    method was used to identify reproductive organs in Brachypelma tarantula species.
    Various data mining methods are used in practical implementations. Clustering
    is an unsupervised method for identifying sets of natural cases based on one attribute
    set. This method groups data that have similar characteristics. One example is
    in [11, 12], where the k-means algorithm was used to group pothole types on roads
    based on data from a sensor device. Association analysis or association rule mining
    is a data mining technique to find rules for combinations of items that occur
    together. In the business world, it is often referred to as affinity analysis
    or shopping basket analysis. In [13], the authors utilized the Apriori algorithm
    to improve the efficiency of parallel computing on data generated by online education.
    The authors studied and analyzed the characteristics of education and big data,
    then collected and processed data regarding the frequency of course visits by
    users. The results showed that the accuracy of extracting association rules was
    improved and also helped school decision making in teaching management and education
    by providing instructive information. Classification is a procedure to discover
    one function to describe one class for a specific purpose. In other words, it
    is a process to find common characteristic definitions within a group or a class.
    An absolute classification has to show the target attribute or class [14]. In
    data mining, classification is one of the most common methods to be implemented.
    This method aims to estimate an object’s class that is previously unknown. Decision
    tree is one of classification methods that produces result like a tree. It decomposes
    complex problems into simpler ones to help decision makers solve problems [15].
    This method transforms data into decision rules and decision trees. In the tree,
    a leaf node corresponds to a class, a branch represents a test output, and an
    internal node corresponds to a test attribute. In [16], the authors used the Iterative
    Dichotomiser 3 (ID3) algorithm—a decision tree algorithm—for predicting swimming
    pools’ water quality. Their simulation results using Weka achieved 100% accuracy.
    Another example is in [17], where ID3’s classification results were used to support
    future investment decision making based on analysis of market and current financial
    situation. C4.5 is a well-known algorithm in data mining that is utilized for
    classification. It is utilized to examine data to find relationships between input
    variables or standard attributes and target variables or decision attributes.
    In C4.5, decision trees are built from data exploration results. For example in
    [18, 19], the C4.5 algorithm was utilized to count how many vehicles in a parking
    lot. In this case, C4.5 was implemented to distinguish detected moving objects
    as either people, cars, or motorcycles. Sensor devices were deployed at parking
    gates to collect sensor data. Each sensor device was built using an MPU-9266 accelerometer,
    an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a NodeMCU ESP8266. Another example is [20],
    where C4.5 was used to forecast soil quality using soil composition as training
    data. The experimental results supported precision fertilization and improved
    the accuracy of forecasting. Then, the works in [21, 22] used C4.5 for finding
    the relationship history of diseases to identify diseases. Furthermore, in [23],
    the authors used C4.5 to determine debtors’ eligibility based on 1000 records,
    including 30% rejected clients and 70% approved clients. The results showed that
    C4.5 had the highest precision (78.0%) and the highest recall rate (96.4%). In
    addition, C4.5 was also used to classify provinces based on dropout rates, where
    the results showed 71.2% accuracy [24]. 3 System Design The systems described
    in this article are IoT-based monitoring and recommendation systems. The design
    of the systems is shown in Fig. 1. In a monitoring system, there is a sensor device—with
    one or more sensors and Wi-Fi capability—that periodically senses nearby physical
    phenomena and sends the gathered data wirelessly through a Wi-Fi router. A web
    application utilizes C4.5 to process the received data and saves the data to a
    database. Users can get notifications regarding the monitoring conditions via
    this web application as well. The design of sensor devices for aquarium monitoring
    and ornamental plant monitoring will be discussed in Sects. 5 and 6, respectively.
    Fig. 1 The wireless monitoring system Full size image Figure 2 shows a flowchart
    for the program that runs on the sensor device. Arduino IDE is used to develop
    this program. Firstly, the program initializes the sensor device. Secondly, it
    checks for the availability of the Internet connection. If the device is connected
    to the Internet, sensors attached to the device start to sense and get data. The
    data are then sent for further processing through the Internet. These processes
    at the sensor device are repeated at a predefined interval. Fig. 2 Flowchart for
    sensor device Full size image Figure 3 shows a flowchart for the web application
    developed using Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). This is basically the C4.5 algorithm
    that will be explained in Sect. 4. The input to the algorithm is the data training.
    First, C4.5 calculates the total entropy. Then, it calculates entropy and gain
    for every attribute. After that, it finds the highest gain and creates the root
    node. A decision tree is the output of the algorithm. In addition, after the rules
    are created, the list of rules also becomes the output. Fig. 3 Flowchart for web
    application Full size image 4 Classification Method Classification is a process
    of finding the same characteristic in a set of objects and grouping them into
    several categories based on the chosen classification model. The objective of
    classification is to discover a model from a set of training data that classifies
    attributes into the correct classes or categories. Then, the model is utilized
    to classify other attributes whose class has not been known yet. This is called
    the testing data. There are several classification techniques, one of which is
    decision tree. Decision tree is a popular method for prediction and classification
    in data mining. This method has a relatively fast development, that is, by converting
    a large amount of facts into a decision tree that corresponds to some rules in
    order for human to understand them easily. The decision trees are used for data
    exploration and for discovering unseen relationships between target variables
    and a number of potential input variables because the decision trees combine modeling
    and data exploration. A decision tree is a structure that applies a set of decision
    rules to split a large data set into smaller record sets. With each division set,
    the result set’s members are similar to each other. As a decision tree algorithm,
    C4.5 needs a training data set and testing data as its input. The training data
    are sample data that are utilized to construct a tree that has a class or label
    and has been tested for truth. The testing data are data fields that will be used
    as parameters in performing data classification. C4.5 is the evolution of ID3
    (Iterative Dichotomiser 3). The C4.5 improvements include the ability to handle
    missing values, continuous data, and pruning. C4.5 works as follows to build a
    decision tree. It firstly chooses the root from an attribute. Then it creates
    a branch for every value and splits cases into branches. This process is repeated
    for every branch until all cases in a branch have the same class. To select the
    root from an attribute, it takes the highest gain value of the existing attributes.
    The formula to calculate entropy is given in Eq. 1, where \\(P_i\\) is the number
    of the sample proportions for class i. Equation 2 is the formula to calculate
    gain is, where S is the number of sample data, x denotes an attribute, n is the
    number of partitions from S, \\(|S_i|\\) is the number of cases in i partition,
    and \\(|S|\\) is the number of cases in S. $$\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned} {}
    \\mbox{Entropy}(S) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}-P_i \\times \\mbox{log}_2(P_i) \\end{aligned}
    $$ (1) $$\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned} {} \\mbox{Gain}(S, X) = \\mbox{Entropy}(S)
    -\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{|S_i|}{|S|} \\times \\mbox{Entropy}(S_i) \\end{aligned}
    $$ (2) In addition, information gain is one of the attribute selection measures
    that is utilized to choose the test attribute for every node in a tree. The attribute
    with the highest information gain is selected as a node’s test attribute. In the
    process of calculating gain, it is possible to have a missing value. After using
    C4.5 for classification, a multi-class confusion matrix is used to measure the
    level of accuracy obtained. A positive value where the actual class result and
    the classification class result are the same is True Positive (TP). False Positive
    (FP) refers to a negative value whose classification result is positive. True
    Negative (TN) refers to a negative value that has the correct class from the classification
    results, and False Negative (FN) refers to a positive value that is incorrectly
    classified as a negative value. $$\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned} {} \\mbox{Accuracy}
    = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} \\end{aligned} $$ (3) $$\\displaystyle \\begin{aligned}
    {} \\mbox{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} \\end{aligned} $$ (4) $$\\displaystyle
    \\begin{aligned} {} \\mbox{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} \\end{aligned} $$ (5)
    Accuracy is a measure of the level of closeness of the analysis results compared
    to the actual content. This shows the fraction of the total sample that is correctly
    classified by C4.5. The formula to calculate accuracy is Eq. 3. The proportion
    of relevant instances between retrieved instances is called precision. In other
    words, precision is the percentage of positive predictions that are absolutely
    correct. The formula to calculate precision is shown in Eq. 4. Recall refers to
    a fraction of the total number of relevant samples actually collected or as a
    sensitivity. The formula to calculate recall is Eq. 5. 5 Aquarium Monitoring 5.1
    The Sensor Device Figure 4 illustrates the sensor device’s design for the aquarium
    monitoring system. The device is built with an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04), a
    turbidity sensor (TS-300B), a temperature sensor (DS18B20), a NodeMCU ESP8266,
    and a power supply. The power pins of NodeMCU and the three sensors are connected,
    as well as the ground pins. The data pin of the temperature sensor and both the
    echo and trigger pins of the ultrasonic sensor are connected to the digital pins
    of NodeMCU. A 4.7k Ohm resistor is also added between the temperature sensor’s
    power and data pins to stabilize the data transfer. The turbidity sensor has analog
    output, so its output pin is connected to the analog pin of NodeMCU. Table 1 shows
    the pin configuration for the aquarium’s sensor device. Fig. 4 Hardware design
    for aquarium’s sensor device Full size image Table 1 Pin configuration for aquarium’s
    sensor device Full size table 5.2 System Implementation and Evaluation The aquarium
    monitoring system is divided into two parts: a sensor device for collecting data
    and a web application for processing the data. The sensor device obtains data
    from an aquarium by using temperature, turbidity, and ultrasonic sensors. While
    the turbidity and temperature sensors are immersed in water, the ultrasonic sensor
    is mounted on top of the aquarium as shown in Fig. 5. The ultrasonic sensor reports
    water level by measuring its closeness to the water surface. The device uses NodeMCU
    to send the data via the Internet. When the data are received by the application,
    they are stored in a database. Then, C4.5 is used to analyze the data by building
    a decision tree, where the attributes are based on the acquired sensor data. The
    values in Table 2 are used to decide categories from sensor data for each attribute.
    Fig. 5 Hardware implementation for aquarium’s sensor device Full size image Table
    2 Categories for aquarium’s sensor data Full size table For evaluation purposes,
    there are 455 data records as training data, which are divided into two classes,
    that is, normal and change water, as shown in Table 3. The training data were
    gathered with a 30-minute interval for around ten days. The labeling of the training
    data obtained from the sensor device was done according to a person’s experience
    and observation in keeping the aquarium in a clean condition. In this experiment,
    the aquarium water was changed every two or three days. Hence, the number of training
    data that belongs to the normal class was greater than the change water class.
    Table 3 Training data for aquarium Full size table The classification algorithm
    for the aquarium monitoring system is implemented in a web-based application.
    Figure 6 shows the web application’s interface that informs the recent state of
    aquarium water according to the classification results, which are formed using
    C4.5. In this evaluation, confusion matrix is used to measure the performance
    of C4.5 based on the collected training data. Fig. 6 Web application’s interface
    for the aquarium monitoring system Full size image There are three kinds of partitions
    to separate the training data, that is, 60:40, 70:30, and 80:20. Figure 7 shows
    the performance comparison results for accuracy, recall, and precision from these
    three partitions. The 80:20 data partition achieves the highest recall, precision,
    and accuracy, with 97.8% accuracy. The lowest of them all is the 70:30 data partition,
    with 96% accuracy. The 60:40 data partition’s accuracy is approximately 0.2% higher
    than that of the 70:30 data partition as the training data are dominated by the
    normal class. The percentage of data with the normal class in the 60:40 data partition
    is much lower than in the 70:30 data partition. Fig. 7 Performance comparison
    of training data for the aquarium monitoring system Full size image Figures 8,
    9, and 10 show the analysis results for the training data with 60:40, 70:30, and
    80:20 partitions, respectively. These include the recall, precision, accuracy,
    and F1-Score values of each class. Figure 11 presents the rules for aquarium water
    according to classification results, which is formed using the C4.5 algorithm.

    Device The hardware design for the ornamental plant monitoring system is depicted
    in Fig. 12. The sensor device is equipped with a soil pH sensor, a temperature
    sensor (DHT11), a soil moisture sensor (YL-69), a NodeMCU ESP8266, and an Arduino
    Uno. NodeMCU is connected directly to the soil pH sensor and the temperature sensor.
    NodeMCU has only one analog pin, so Arduino Uno is utilized to provide additional
    analog pin to connect the soil moisture sensor. The pin configuration for the
    ornamental plant’s sensor device is shown in Table 4. Fig. 12 Hardware design
    for ornamental plant’s sensor device Full size image Table 4 Pin configuration
    for ornamental plant’s sensor device Full size table 6.2 System Implementation
    and Evaluation Similar to the aquarium monitoring system, the system for monitoring
    ornamental plant also consists of two parts: a sensor device for collecting data
    and a web application for processing the data. The sensor device is inserted into
    a plant pot as shown in Fig. 13. It gets air temperature and humidity data from
    the temperature sensor, pH data from the soil pH sensor, and soil moisture data
    from the soil moisture sensor. The data are transmitted by NodeMCU, received by
    the application, stored in a database, and analyzed by the C4.5 algorithm to give
    recommendation for the plant. The values in Table 5 are used to decide categories
    from sensor data for each attribute. Fig. 13 Hardware implementation for ornamental
    plant’s sensor device Full size image Table 5 Categories for ornamental plant’s
    sensor data Full size table In the evaluation, the training data consists of 524
    data records, which are divided into three classes, namely normal, need water,
    and need fertilizer, as shown in Table 6. The data were collected every 15 minutes
    for around six days. The training data were labelled based on a person’s treatment
    for the plant. While most data were labelled as normal, some of them were labelled
    as need water when the plant was watered twice a day, and need fertilizer when
    fertilizer was applied once during this experiment. Therefore, the number of training
    data that belongs to the normal class was greater than both the need water class
    and the need fertilizer class. Table 6 Training data for ornamental plant Full
    size table The experimental results for the ornamental plants monitoring system
    in a web-based application are given in the following. Figures 14 and 15 show
    the web application’s interface that gives information about the state of ornamental
    plants according to classification performed using C4.5. Fig. 14 Normal condition

    confusion matrix is implemented to measure the performance of C4.5 based on the
    training data, which are split into the 60:40, 70:30, and 80:20 partitions. Figure
    16 presents the performance comparison results of recall, precision, and accuracy
    for each training data partition. The 80:20 partition has the highest values of
    precision, recall, and accuracy, with 89.68% accuracy. Meanwhile, the 60:40 partition

    and Future Work The proposed article presents the design and implementation of
    two kinds of sensor devices for two IoT monitoring systems, that is, for aquarium
    and ornamental plants. The aquarium sensor device has three sensors—ultrasonic,
    temperature, and turbidity—connected to a NodeMCU. The ornamental plant sensor
    device has temperature, soil moisture, and soil pH sensors, as well as a NodeMCU
    and an Arduino Uno. The sensed data are sent from the sensor devices to the web
    applications to be analyzed using C4.5 to classify the monitored objects’ conditions.
    The recommendation given by the system for an aquarium based on its condition
    is either normal or change water. While for an ornamental plant is either normal,
    need water, or need fertilizer. In the experiment, the performance of training
    data for the aquarium monitoring system achieves 97.8% accuracy, while the ornamental
    plant monitoring system achieves 89.68% accuracy. To improve the systems, one
    can modify the hardware by adding different sensors. For example, a TDS sensor
    to sense total dissolved solids in water and a pH sensor to sense water pH level
    may be useful for the aquarium monitoring and recommendation system. For the ornamental
    plant, an electrochemical sensor to detect soil nutrient and a leaf humidity and
    temperature sensor to detect humidity and temperature on leaf surface may also
    be beneficial. As for the software, one can implement other classification algorithms
    and compare the results to see if they have better accuracy than the C4.5 algorithm.
    In addition, having some kind of notifications sent to WhatsApp or Telegram if
    the objects need attention is better than having them displayed only on the web
    applications. The last but not the least is having actuators to take care of the
    objects automatically. References Y. Yang, X. Chen, R. Tan, Y. Xiao, IoT technologies

  description: In India, agronomy industry needs automation for monitoring the overall
    farm and plant health as due to the presence of plants’ diseases and ecological
    inadequacy which causes significant damage and dissipation to agriculturists.
    Therefore, various geographical conditions are required for plants and crops growth
    as it needs a humid climate with rainfall of 200 and temperature above 25 °C.
    Thus, various conditions required for farming are moderate temperature, rainfall,
    and lots of sunshine. As it requires lots of drainage for the fertile soil. Although
    India is the second largest manufacturer of various types of dry fruits, feedstock,
    and no vegetables, also they uses various methods of cultivation for the farming
    process like manuring, irrigation, weeding, cultivation, and sowing for better
    quality crops that grow in the primary step of sowing. The investment of pesticides
    in the Indian industry sector in 2022–23 is nearly 140 crore which is done by
    SP Gupta Chief Financial Officer of Indian Pesticides Limited. Various types of
    pesticides have been used for the betterment of farm like insecticides, bactericides,
    and fungicides for killing insects and various pests but the overuse of pesticides
    harm the fertility of soil and land for good quality crops and growth; thus due
    to these, farms get damaged and lands get infertile, because of these, farmers
    cannot do farming on that land to overcome this issue; this paper shows the solution
    for the farmers and land by using a prototype robot by using IoT which holds a
    record of plants as well as monitor the farm in any weather if any insect gets
    detected by the caretaker; the advanced robotic mechanism starts activating and
    sprays pesticides on the affected portion of plants. Due to this, land can be
    saved by unwanted spraying of pesticides and infertility of soil.

    Chapter © 2024 1 Introduction India is the world''s largest producer of sugar,
    fruits, and jute and also the largest manufacturer of 25% overall production.
    The extremely familiar types of disease attacks on plants’ leaves are alternative
    of viruses and fungoid diseases. As for proper growth of plants and crops, the
    geographical conditions are required 15–20 °C for spraying time, and 20–26 °C
    for maturing and picking with rainfall around 75–100 cm. The growing rate of population
    and advanced conditions of climate also cause harm to plant diseases. Now, the
    main cultivation in India is groundnut, cotton, fish, species, livestock, etc.
    For this, various methods of cultivation have been used like livestock farming,
    arable farming, nomadic farming, sustainable farming, and mixed farming. Livestock
    farming is best for employment and waste which gets activated by animals is used
    as natural manure for the maintenance of soil fertility as agriculture enables
    a large number of quantities of grains and other foodstuffs, and arable farming
    is used for the production of crops that include various types of crops from the
    growth of plants it also produces an extensive range of yearly crops the annual
    crops means total life cycle of the crops from germination to grain production
    enclosed by 12 months. Nomadic farming is a type of primary sustainable farming,
    nomadic live in arid and semiarid parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe in Africa
    nomadic herd cattle, goats, sheep, camels, and other animals managed by nomadic
    including horses, mux-oxen, yaks; mixed farming is used to involve growing crops
    and raise of livestock. Thus, pesticides take an essential role in the production
    of food and the pesticide industry had done contribution in 2018 of over 6.75
    billion and the Indian industry cultivated 9%, the investment is evaluated at
    16.7 million. Although there are various types of pesticides used in farming like
    rodenticides larvicides, overuse of fertilizers and pesticides affects soil organisms
    that are similar to humans overworked with antibiotics. For example, plants may
    depend on different types of microorganisms to convert atmospheric nitrogen into
    nitrates, which plants can use. As per the Indian government, 40% land about 150
    billion corrupted. As in agricultural generation, 25% of land gets degraded and
    the soil carbon, nitrous oxide exists the atmosphere. Once there, they can infect
    plants and animals ranging from favorable microorganisms, insects, fish, and birds.
    The detection can be done by using plants leaf, temperature, gas sensor, humidity,
    and soil moisture readings will be received from the sensors. Now, in the advanced
    period of agriculture epoch of Industry 4.0 faces many objections, and IoT with
    automation is used for the fulfillment of “Automatic disease detection to monitor
    the plant health for various plants leaf using image processing techniques and
    TensorFlow algorithm.” 1.1 Literature Review The apple leaf disease affects the
    yields of apples; they show a detecting process in real time and a deep learning
    approach on CNN detection of leaves of brown spots, gray spots, and mosaics [1].
    In this paper, they have discussed and used the technology of bacteria foraging
    algorithm, image segmentation, and neural network. The image processing is done
    for processing of leaf images by using methods like soft computing and conventional
    method [2]. The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus on growth and development of blast
    resistance is used and examined all rice types which were sensitive root colonization
    by AM fungus [3]. This paper shows plant detection of disease in real time that
    is affected using a convolutional neural network for appropriate fertilizers spread
    on the damaged portion of plants. For improving the accuracy of the system, they
    have used a TensorFlow framework; the accuracy is increased by up to 95%. The
    remaining area infected by diseases is calculated by k-means algorithm [3]. In
    this paper, they show the detection of diseases that affect various plants by
    using image processing techniques. As commonly we know farmers spray pesticides
    on the plants but also affect humans directly and indirectly through health issues
    or any other [4]. This paper uses the technology of ML and processing of image
    to allow the viral disease from the snaps of leaf, and this method identifies
    the injury of potato leaf disease. Their segmentation approaches the utilization
    by using multiclass SVM [5]. The algorithm has used deep learning network for
    detection of tobacco plants in photos captured by using unmanned aerial vehicles.
    This algorithm has three stages the primary stage with morphological and watershed
    segmentation, the second is convolutional neural network is assembled and train
    with tobacco plant region and the third part is post-processing are performed
    to discard the non-tobacco plant [6]. This paper uses forest in identifying plant
    disease between healthy and disease plants for extracting the features of the
    image. This is used by using the trained dataset to detect the virus by using
    ML technology [7]. They have used a data augmentation technique that has been
    used to do the deviation of the leaf photos in dataset. As they have also used
    the CNN model for image classification, the accuracy is 98.56% [8]. This paper
    shows about image detector and the resource-constrained using a convolutional
    network implemented in a low-cost, platform to perform the types of plant infection
    [9]. In this paper, they discussed current trends and challenges for plant leaf
    disease using deep learning method using a k-means clustering algorithm [10].
    This paper shows the present surveys on current techniques and prediction models
    for the validation and diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases based on image processing
    and the IoT for the verification and various types of tomato plant diseases [7].
    They show leaf diseases that can be effectively used to detect the leaves of plants
    but the unhealthy plants that we get are unbalanced that’s why it is difficult
    to detect the diseases from the unhealthy plant''s dataset for solving this they
    have used double GAN to generate higher-resolution pictures of unhealthy plants
    leaf using samples [11]. 2 Methodology First of all, the robot system will start
    activating and it will move into the farm for taking photos; it will check the
    height of plants; if it''s too low, then the mechanism will spray the fertilizers
    for the proper growth of plants; if the height is proper, then it will again go
    for taking photos for detection of insects on plants; if any parasitic detected,
    then it will spray pesticides on the affected portion of plants and send alert
    message to the farmer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Flowchart for prototype device Full size
    image Algorithm Used for Plants Disease Detection: TensorFlow: It is a library
    of Python language used for rapid arithmetic calculations, and it can also create
    models of hierarchical learning exactly. This model detects leaf spot diseases
    and also predicts healthy leaves. The TensorFlow algorithm also uses a neural
    network for training the image classification model. The TensorFlow should be
    run on single central processing unit as well as on graphic processing unit and
    mobile devices. The used dataset is used in training and testing of dataset 1000
    from that 700 images of plants are used for training and remaining 300 images
    are uses for testing. The dataset is identified across the model for the procedure
    of building to escape overfitting. The tested dataset is independent for the training
    set. The test dataset is used to identify the performance of model or accuracy
    of model, and the images of plants classify leaves based on the below parts: Healthful
    part: In this case, the plants’ leaves are healthy and show no symptoms of bacteria
    or infections of any kind (change in color, of leaves, etc.) Bacteria part: In
    this, the bacterial spots are identified, and therefore, the system gives alert
    message to farmer. Viral part: In this case, the color of leaves gets changed
    due to DNA virus that’s why it changes the color. Late Blight part: In this part,
    the harmful plants infection especially affects rice. 2.1 Block Diagram Figure
    2 shows systematic diagram for the observation of farms as the Esp32 module is
    used to collect all data from sensors like LDR. Various sensors are used in the
    farm like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and gas sensor. As temperature
    sensor is useful while growing the crops which needs wet and dry climatic conditions,
    the temperature sensor measures the presence of heat energy of the soil and also
    determines whether it is good for plants growth. If the temperature rises high
    in the farm, then it causes erosion to the cultivation of yields. If temperature
    is too low on the farm, then it decreases the plant''s enzymes and it causes to
    stunt growth or may cause it to die. The humidity sensor is used for controlling
    and monitoring [12] the humidity as well as the air temperature of the farm. As
    if humidity arises high, then plants get to die and crops get fail. If it arises
    low, then the growth of plants takes more time for the growth and smaller leaves
    get to drop off and the quality of plants is not so good. The moisture sensor
    is used for the capacity of water level of soil and also for good irrigation management
    which gives better crops and increases the profit of the farmer as well as the
    land; if the moisture level is too low in the farm, then plants may not mature
    and they may die. So for the betterment of crops and plants, normally 21–40% of
    moisture level is required. The gas sensor is used on the farm for how much amount
    of gas is present in the farm and environment or if anyone tries to spread petroleum
    in the farm at that time this sensor senses it and gives an alert message to the
    farmer; due to this, our farm can be saved due to unwanted gas spread. The DC
    motor is used in the farm as it plays a necessary part in the farm for scanning
    plants vertically and horizontally for the detection and monitoring of the plant''s
    health if the disease gets detected the LCD will display all the desired conditions.
    And servomotor is used for spraying the pesticides on the affected portion of
    the plant this mechanism is inserted in the robot if any insect is detected, then
    the mechanism will start and spray the pesticides. The water pump is used if the
    moisture of the soil gets low, then water pump will start by triggering the relay.
    If moisture level is too high, then off the water pump. Thus, all the data will
    be sent to on new technology of Blynk cloud to show the data in real time and
    a power supply is provided to all the sensors for proper working and giving the
    results. As in greenhouse automation [13], they used the old Blynk technology
    for controlling the greenhouse system including soil moisture, temperature, and
    humidity. Fig. 2 Schematic diagram of observing farmland Full size image 3 Design
    Implementation The working implementation consists of various parts, processing
    which is defined below: A. Collection of Dataset The analysis depends on the detection
    of affected leaf; [14] I have collected a dataset from an agricultural institution.
    This dataset has images of various disease-affected plants [15] . I organized
    to collect pictures of various types of infection indication. They are apple black
    dots, grape spot, maize gray dots, tomato mosaic virus, and peach bacterial spot
    [16]. One of the most frequent diseases is in apple plants which may be increased
    by fungi. Podosphaera leucotricha is the black spot as its name shows with black
    spots seen on the surface of the leaves. Grape leaf spot shows about fungus Phomopsis
    viticola, and maximal is determined the most critical disease of grapes [17].
    Gray spot on corn results on top side. Yellow spots are viewed on another side
    of white disease wrapping the inner part of a leaf. Tomato mosaic virus is mostly
    known as plant pathogenic [18]. The number of images collected from diseases is
    shown in the table (Figs. 3, 4, and 5). Fig. 3 Table on plants diseases Full size
    image Fig. 4 Various leaves [19] affected by unwanted pesticides Full size image
    Fig. 5 Boxplot on the affected area of the plants (leaf) Full size image 4 Future
    Scope It is used in the animal shed for monitoring domestic animals. It will help
    the farmers to do work in any season and conditions [20, 21] . It reduces the
    time consumed in spraying the pesticides [22]. It works very effectively, and
    it will reduce the danger to farmers [23] from different breathing and physical
    problems. This model is used for the detection of various types of plants disease
    [24]. This system is used for multiple types of plants health and disease. 5 Conclusion
    The agriculture field needs automation in large amounts to make the human work
    easy, [25] and the agriculture [26] hanging robot [27] has been designed for monitoring
    the farm weather (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) and also plants health;
    thus, system will go detection of insects [28] if any found the system will spray
    pesticides only on the affected portion of plants. By using this technology, there
    will be less time consumed and I can protect the farm as well as plants from unwanted
    pesticides. This proposed model is designed for the detection and quality of leaves
    by using different types of sensors like temperature, humidity, gas sensor, and
    soil moisture sensor. The purpose device is used whether the device is healthy
    or diseased. 6 Software Testing See Figs. 6, 7, and 8. Fig. 6 Monitoring the farm
    by using Blynk cloud Full size image Fig. 7 Blynk app results in real time Full
    size image Fig. 8 Visuino results for temperature and humidity Full size image
    7 Hardware Testing Figure 9 shows the output results of the farm on LCD as ESP32
    is the controller module of IoT as to help the farmers and send the data on cloud.
    In this project, I have used various sensors like DHT11, gas sensor also soil
    moisture; apart from these, I have also used water pumps for the proper nourishment
    of crops health. Although these all sensors have been used for monitoring, the
    farm and sensors give values on LCD in real-time mode [29, 30] . Thus, the proposed
    system also gives suggestion to the farmers for the betterment of farm and how
    to get rid of plants diseases by applying the appropriate amount of fertilizers
    and pesticides. Fig. 9 Output results of the farm on LCD Full size image References

  description: Over the last few years, most of greenhouses have been managed traditionally
    based on manpower to monitor and maintain the plants, such as watering, fertilizing,
    and using their skill in detecting plant diseases. Thus, this study focuses on
    developing a greenhouse monitoring system by using IoT technology. It aims to
    assist the local farmers in monitoring their greenhouse, instead of applying the
    conventional methods that are tedious and required more labour works. For data
    collection, parameters for chilli plants are measured using temperature and humidity
    sensors, soil moisture sensor, and light dependent resistor (LDR) sensor. The
    data are sent to microcontroller and transferred to the Ubidots cloud for the
    monitoring purpose. Watering pump and exhaust fan can be activated to control
    the plant parameters so that the plant remains in its normal condition. The sensor
    data are processed through classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to
    analyse the plant condition, whether the proposed method is suitable or not for
    the chilli plant to grow. Overall, a mini greenhouse prototype for chilli plant
    has been successfully constructed with a system interface on Ubidots dashboard
    to monitor the condition of the greenhouse plant. Results show that the developed
    system can be an alternative in monitoring the greenhouse condition with accuracy
    of 94.5%.

  explanation: The paper presents the design and implementation of an IoT-based monitoring
    system for a greenhouse environment, focusing on chilli plants. The system employs
    various sensors to collect data on temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light
    intensity, which are then transmitted to the cloud for monitoring and analysis.
    To ensure efficient data transmission, the authors utilized the MQTT protocol
    and Ubidots cloud platform. The system also incorporates a machine learning algorithm
    for plant stress detection, specifically using the Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    for classifying plant conditions. The results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness
    of the proposed system in monitoring greenhouse conditions and detecting plant
    stress.

  description: With the global population on a rapid rise, the demand for food is
    increasing significantly. Research and development of new agricultural technologies
    that can improve crop production are crucial to address this challenge. Among
    such advancements, Internet of Things (IoT)-based indoor hydroponic cultivation
    has emerged as a practical solution, particularly in urban areas. This approach
    offers the potential for improved, high-quality yields while overcoming the limitations
    of unfavorable climatic conditions. Additionally, IoT-based hydroponic cultivation
    allows for reduced human resource requirements and enables the automation of critical
    processes. Through automated monitoring and control, essential parameters like
    water level, pH, EC, temperature, flow, and light intensity can be optimized for
    optimal plant growth. This study investigated the ability to cultivate lettuce
    as an indoor hydroponic and use a portable IoT-based device to monitor the parameters.
    The study identified the optimal photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at
    200 μmolm−2 s−1 with a photoperiod of 16 h d−1, achieved by employing LEDs with
    an R:B:W ratio of 1:1:1, as the recommended conditions for indoor hydroponic lettuce
    cultivation. We have designed and developed a portable, user-friendly IoT device
    to measure the parameters necessary for hydroponic cultivation, such as humidity,
    temperature, pH, and EC. The device had been able to provide accurate and reliable
    data enabling precise monitoring and facilitating enhanced lettuce cultivation.
    This study will pave the pathway to sustainable and resource-efficient agriculture
    in the face of a growing global population's nutritional needs.

    February 2024 35 Accesses Part of the book series: Lecture Notes in Networks and
    Systems ((LNNS,volume 834)) Abstract With the global population on a rapid rise,
    the demand for food is increasing significantly. Research and development of new
    agricultural technologies that can improve crop production are crucial to address
    this challenge. Among such advancements, Internet of Things (IoT)-based indoor
    hydroponic cultivation has emerged as a practical solution, particularly in urban
    areas. This approach offers the potential for improved, high-quality yields while
    overcoming the limitations of unfavorable climatic conditions. Additionally, IoT-based
    hydroponic cultivation allows for reduced human resource requirements and enables
    the automation of critical processes. Through automated monitoring and control,
    essential parameters like water level, pH, EC, temperature, flow, and light intensity
    can be optimized for optimal plant growth. This study investigated the ability
    to cultivate lettuce as an indoor hydroponic and use a portable IoT-based device
    to monitor the parameters. The study identified the optimal photosynthetic photon
    flux density (PPFD) at 200 μmolm−2 s−1 with a photoperiod of 16 h d−1, achieved
    by employing LEDs with an R:B:W ratio of 1:1:1, as the recommended conditions
    for indoor hydroponic lettuce cultivation. We have designed and developed a portable,
    user-friendly IoT device to measure the parameters necessary for hydroponic cultivation,
    such as humidity, temperature, pH, and EC. The device had been able to provide
    accurate and reliable data enabling precise monitoring and facilitating enhanced
    lettuce cultivation. This study will pave the pathway to sustainable and resource-efficient
    agriculture in the face of a growing global population''s nutritional needs. Keywords

    of Nebraska-Lincoln. Download conference paper PDF 1 Introduction As per projections
    by the United Nations Department of Economics and Social Affairs (2021), the global
    population is estimated to reach approximately 9.8 billion by the year 2050, leading
    to the need of 59–98% increase in global food demand. Increasing crop production
    globally is urgently needed to meet these challenges [1]. Embracing innovative
    solutions such as IoT-based hydroponic cultivations has become imperative to uplift
    and revolutionize the agriculture sector. Hydroponics is a method of cultivating
    crops in nutrient solutions and it has gained significant attention due to its
    vast number of advantages [2]. The nutrient solution is pivotal in this approach
    and should ensure that it provides all the necessary elements for optimal plant
    development. Hence, in hydroponics, it is vital to maintain specific properties
    of the nutrient solution such as pH and electrical conductivity (EC), in their
    optimal ranges. Additionally, crucial environmental factors such as light intensity,
    temperature, and humidity must also be carefully regulated. Continuous and precise
    monitoring of these parameters is imperative to ensure optimal function and robust
    plant growth [3]. Indoor cultivation of food crops is a promising new technology
    that utilizes artificial lighting to optimize agricultural production [4]. Indoor
    hydroponics can be employed in unfavorable climatic and urban environments [5].
    Artificial light significantly enhances the efficiency of indoor hydroponic systems
    compared to natural light [6] through regulating plant growth and physiological
    processes. Different wavelengths, intensities, and photoperiods affect plants
    differently [7]. Integrating IoT in indoor hydroponics allows for monitoring parameters
    such as pH, EC, light intensity, temperature, humidity, and system regulation
    [8]. IoT-based hydroponics reduces the need for human resources, minimizes errors,
    and reduces lead time, ultimately resulting in higher yields and better crop quality
    [9]. However, the specialized sensors and automation lead to increased costs compared
    to traditional field crop cultivation. Therefore, the focus is on the crops that
    offer relatively high profitability, demand, and yield. Due to its high economic
    and nutritional value, lettuce is widely chosen for IoT-based hydroponics cultivation
    [10]. Considering the above facts, this study was carried out to evaluate the
    feasibility of lettuce cultivation within an indoor hydroponics system by monitoring
    the essential parameters using an IoT device designed and developed for this cause.
    2 Literature Review 2.1 Hydroponic Cultivation in Indoor Settings Hydroponics,
    a soilless farming technique that involves growing plants in nutrient-rich water
    solutions, has gained widespread recognition for its resource efficiency, reduced
    environmental impact, and ability to produce higher yields in limited spaces.
    By eliminating the need for soil, hydroponics minimizes water usage, mitigates
    soil-borne diseases, and enables year-round cultivation, making it an ideal solution
    for urban and indoor farming [2]. The adaptability and scalability of hydroponics
    have opened up new possibilities for efficient food production in urban areas
    and regions with limited land availability. The hydroponic system being used varies
    according to the crop species, local climate, and budget. Drip system, nutrient
    film technique (NFT), ebb and flow, and Aeroponics are the most commonly used
    hydroponics systems. The concept of indoor cultivation is gaining momentum worldwide,
    with cities like Japan and Qatar at the forefront of adopting this innovative
    approach. The potential of indoor hydroponics to produce substantial quantities
    of food for more than 60% of the urban population has sparked interest in its
    widespread implementation [11]. By maintaining a controlled environment, indoor
    cultivation allows for precise control over environmental conditions, providing
    optimized crop growth. One unique feature of indoor farming is using artificial
    light instead of relying on sunlight. This provides flexibility in cultivating
    crops regardless of weather changes and allows for year-round production without
    dependence on growing seasons. LED lights have become a popular choice as a light
    source in indoor hydroponics cultivation [7, 12]. 2.2 IoT in Hydroponics In recent
    years, the integration of cutting-edge technology in agriculture has revolutionized
    traditional farming practices, paving the way for innovative and sustainable cultivation
    methods. IoT technology empowers growers with real-time data monitoring, automated
    control, and data-driven decision-making to optimize and enhance the hydroponic
    farming process when integrated into hydroponics. This has revolutionized how
    hydroponic systems are managed, enhancing productivity, precision, and sustainability.
    Smart devices and sensors such as pH meters, EC sensors, and temperature and humidity
    sensors can be used to continuously monitor crucial parameters such as nutrient
    levels, pH balance, temperature, and environmental conditions, ensuring optimal
    growing conditions for plants [8, 11]. Growers can access this data remotely through
    web interfaces or mobile applications, allowing for timely adjustments and interventions
    as needed [1]. 3 Material and Methods 3.1 Determination of the Optimum Light Spectrum
    and Intensity Conditions for Hydroponic Lettuce Cultivation Preparation of hydroponic
    systems The experiment was carried out to evaluate the optimum light spectrum
    and intensity conditions for hydroponic lettuce cultivation in an indoor setting.
    Deep Water Culture (DWC) hydroponic cultivation method was set up using Styrofoam
    boxes. The appropriate amount of Albert''s solution (nutrient solution with a
    well-balanced mix of nutrients) was dissolved in water to achieve the desired
    electrical conductivity (EC) value. The nutrient solution was renewed weekly,
    ensuring the plants received an optimal mix of nutrients for their development.
    The pH of the nutrient solution was kept in the ideal range (5.5–6.5) using NaOH
    and HCl solutions. The nutrient solution was aerated using an oxygen pump strategically
    programmed with a sinotimer. The pump''s programming enabled it to turn on and
    off periodically throughout the day, providing a consistent oxygen supply to the
    hydroponic system. The sinotimer was preprogrammed to activate the oxygen pump
    four times a day, optimizing oxygen delivery without unnecessary wastage of resources.
    This automation reduced human intervention and enhanced the system''s efficiency
    by maintaining a consistent and well-controlled aeration schedule. Plant Materials
    and Growth Conditions The experiment commenced by sowing seeds of “Grand Rapids”
    lettuce in grow trays filled with moistened coir, creating an optimal germination
    environment. Lettuce seedlings were nurtured under a controlled condition of 500
    lx of LED white light, with a photoperiod of 16 h per day for a duration of 15
    days. After 15 days, the lettuce seedlings that reached the 5-leaf stage were
    transplanted into the hydroponic systems, ensuring that the roots were immersed
    in the nutrient solution. To maintain an ideal nutrient concentration in the solution,
    EC was maintained at 1500 μS/cm. Throughout the experiment, the lettuce plants
    were consistently monitored to ensure that they received the right light, nutrients,
    and pH levels essential for their growth. Application of Light Treatments The
    experiment comprised a total of five treatments (listed below), each with three
    replicates. Each replicate had six lettuce plants. All treatments were maintained
    throughout the experiment under a consistent 16-h light and 8-h dark photoperiod
    to ensure uniform conditions. Five different treatments provided for the lettuce
    plants were as follows: 1. L1—LED White light with a Photosynthetic Photon Flux
    Density (PPFD) set at 200 μmolm−2 s−1. 2. L2—white:blue:red light with a ratio
    of 1:1:1 and PPFD of 200 μmolm−2 s−1. 3. L3—blue:red light with a ratio of 1:1
    and a PPFD of 200 μmolm−2 s−1. 4. L4—sunlight simulation inside the experimental
    room (indoor control). 5. L5—natural sunlight outside the building (outdoor control).
    Thick white polythene sheets were used to segregate and control the different
    light treatment groups. Four LED white lights with an output of 18W each were
    employed for treatments involving LED lights to achieve the targeted PPFD of 200
    μmolm−2 s−1. In specific treatments, such as white:blue:red and blue:red light,
    three LED strips from each color were utilized to create the desired light spectrum.
    Throughout the experiment, the number of parameters of the lettuce plants were
    measured weekly for four weeks. These parameters included plant height, number
    of leaves, length and width of the leaves, and the relative chlorophyll content.
    The plant''s fresh and dry weights were also assessed at the treatments’ 2nd,
    3rd, and 4th weeks. By systematically evaluating these parameters over time and
    across the different treatments, the study aimed to elucidate the effects of various
    light conditions on the growth and development of lettuce plants. The data taken
    was statistically analyzed using R software. 3.2 Design and Development of the
    IoT Device An IoT device is designed for monitoring and measuring nutrient solution
    parameters and growth environment, including TDS, pH, light intensity, temperature,
    and humidity. It is comprised two separate circuits. The first circuit integrates
    an Arduino UNO microcontroller and a NodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi module. It incorporates
    a DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity measurements, a BH1750 sensor for
    light intensity measurements, and a gravity analog pH sensor for pH measurements.
    The second circuit utilizes a gravity analog TDS sensor, connected to an ESP 32
    Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module for measuring total dissolved solids content. Before
    usage, the gravity analog pH sensor and TDS sensor were calibrated for accurate
    measurements. The device utilizes two OLED displays to exhibit parameter readings
    from both circuits, and two push buttons facilitate data retrieval. The collected
    sensor data is transmitted to the microcontroller and relayed to Google Docs through
    the Wi-Fi module. TDS sensor data is also sent to a separate Google Doc through
    the ESP 32 Wi-Fi module. Real-time values are displayed on the device OLED display
    during operation. Moreover, a red LED indicates a lack of connection with the
    Wi-Fi network, ensuring prompt awareness of connectivity status. The versatility
    and portability of the designed device make it a valuable tool for hydroponic
    growers, allowing them to efficiently monitor crucial parameters and store data
    in the cloud for analysis and record-keeping. The prototype of the IoT device
    is visually represented, as illustrated in Fig. 1, showcasing its potential to
    revolutionize hydroponic cultivation through advanced IoT-based monitoring and
    control capabilities. Fig. 1 Prototype of “hydromata” device Full size image 3.3
    “Hydromata” Android Application The “Hydromata” Android application depicted in
    Figs. 2a–f was designed and developed to present the parameter readings retrieved
    from the corresponding IoT device. It is a tool for hydroponic enthusiasts and
    growers, providing real-time access to critical environmental parameters, historical
    data, insightful analysis, customizable settings, and quick parameter status checks.
    Its user-friendly interface and comprehensive functionalities ensure that users
    can optimize their hydroponic systems for superior crop growth and productivity.
    Fig. 2 Main interfaces of the “hydromata” Android application Full size image
    The application includes five distinct options, each catering to specific functionalities.
    The option, “Parameter,” is a dashboard, showcasing real-time values of various
    critical environmental parameters. These parameters encompass temperature, humidity,
    light intensity, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) (Fig. 2c). “History,” shown
    in Fig. 2d, provides the historical data accumulated for the two circuits. This
    feature empowers users to delve into past performance, gaining insights and trends
    from previous parameter readings. The “Analysis” feature (Fig. 2e) provides in-depth
    analysis and visualization,” which generates a diverse array of plots based on
    historical data. These plots present a clear and comprehensive picture of temperature,
    humidity, pH, light intensity, and EC trends over time, facilitating data-driven
    decision-making. The option “Settings” allows users to set personalized minimum
    and maximum values for the optimum range of each parameter. This customization
    empowers users to tailor the hydroponic system to their specific requirements,
    ensuring optimal conditions for plant growth (Fig. 2f). To enhance ease of use
    and efficiency, “Check” lets users promptly assess whether the current parameter
    values fall within specific predefined ranges, displaying relevant messages and
    guiding users on the relevant status. 4 Results and Discussion The observations
    of the vegetative growth of lettuce under different light spectrums and intensity
    conditions are shown in Fig. 3. The “Hydromata” device provided accurate measurements
    for all the parameters in indoor hydroponic lettuce cultivation. Figure 4 illustrates
    the graphs showing the readings from sensors for room temperature, room humidity,
    and pH. Fig. 3 Observations of the vegetative growth of lettuce under different
    light spectrum and intensity conditions (L1—white LED, PPFD at 200 μmolm−2 s−1,
    L2—white:blue:red = 1:1:1, PPFD at 200 μmolm−2 s−1, L3—blue:red = 1:1, PPFD at
    200 μmolm−2 s−1, L4—indoor control, L5—outdoor control) Full size image Fig. 4

    Figure 5 shows the mean data of the growth parameters received after statistical
    analysis. Based on the mean height data of lettuce, treatments L1 (white LED,
    PPFD at 200 μmolm−2 s−1) exhibited significantly higher growth during weeks 1
    and 2 compared to L2, L3, L4, and L5 (Fig. 5a). However, during weeks 3 and 4,
    both L1 and L2 (white:blue:red = 1:1:1, PPFD at 200 μmolm−2 s−1) showed comparable
    growth, indicating their equal effectiveness for optimal lettuce growth (Fig.
    5a). Fig. 5 Growth curve obtained for lettuce using a mean height values, b mean
    number of leaves, c mean leaf length, d mean leaf width, e mean relative chlorophyll
    content Full size image On the other hand, L4 (indoor control) displayed significantly
    lower growth throughout the experiment. L3 (blue:red = 1:1, PPFD at 200 μmolm−2
    s−1) exhibited a similar growth pattern to L5 (outdoor control) throughout the
    experiment. L4 displayed lower growth compared to the other treatments, reaffirming
    the significant contribution of artificial light treatments to lettuce height
    increase (Fig. 5a). Regarding the mean number of leaves, treatments L1, L2, and
    L3 showed no significant difference during weeks 2, 3, and 4, indicating that
    the light conditions provided were equally beneficial. In contrast, L4 (indoor
    control) displayed significantly lower leaf numbers than all other treatments.
    Figure 5b demonstrates that L2 had the highest leaf growth throughout the 4 weeks,
    with L3 displaying a similar trend until week 2, followed by a decrease. L1''s
    growth was comparable to L5 until week 2, after which it increased. L4 had lower
    leaf number compared to the other treatments, emphasizing the significant impact
    of artificial light on leaf number increase. Examining mean leaf length data,
    L1 and L2 consistently exhibited relatively high lengths, signifying the effectiveness
    of white LED, PPFD at 200 μmolm−2 s−1, and white:blue:red = 1:1:1, PPFD at 200
    μmolm−2 s−1 for lettuce growth. L4 displayed significantly lower growth compared
    to all other treatments. Figure 5c reveals that L1 and L2 achieved higher growth
    throughout the 4 weeks than other treatments, while L4''s growth remained lower.
    In terms of mean leaf width data, L2 (white:blue:red = 1:1:1, PPFD at 200 μmolm−2
    s−1) exhibited significantly higher growth during weeks 1, 2, and 3 compared to
    other treatments, suggesting its superiority as the best light combination for
    optimal lettuce growth. Figure 5d shows L2 with the highest and most rapid growth
    throughout the experiment. Regarding mean relative chlorophyll content of leaves,
    L2 showed significantly higher growth during weeks 1 and 2 compared to all other
    treatments. Figure 5e shows that L2 had the highest chlorophyll content growth,
    and L3 had similar growth to L5 throughout the experiment. By week 3, all treatments
    (L1, L2, L3, L4) showed similar growth to each other, while L4’s growth remained
    lower. The fresh and dry weight, L2, had a relatively higher mean fresh and dry
    weight throughout the experiment. A similar study by Lin et al. [13] reported
    higher biomass in lettuce grown under red–blue–white (RBW) LED light compared
    to red–blue (RB) LED light. White LEDs offer a broad spectrum, including red,
    blue, and green light, which allows deeper light penetration into plant canopies.
    This, in turn, enhances plant growth and development. The number of leaves directly
    affects the harvestable yield of leafy vegetables such as lettuce. Ensuring increased
    leaves during the early growth stages can positively impact overall yield. During
    the experiment, lettuce seedlings initially grew under natural light with low
    intensity, resulting in leggy seedlings and seedling losses. Subsequently, LED
    white light was introduced to provide optimal light intensity levels for proper
    seedling growth. The “Hydromata” device collects data from sensors placed within
    the system, which is then centralized in a microcontroller. This collected data
    is wirelessly transmitted to a Google Form via a Wi-Fi module. However, the device
    does have some limitations, particularly with the gravity analog TDS sensor used
    to measure TDS and EC values of the nutrient solution. This sensor can only measure
    TDS values within the 0–1000 ppm range. Assessing the vegetative growth of lettuce
    involved monitoring various parameters such as plant height, number of leaves,
    leaf width, leaf length, relative chlorophyll content, fresh and dry weight. Increases
    in leaf length and width directly impact leaf area, enhancing photosynthetic capacity
    and overall biomass. 5 Conclusion IoT-controlled “Hydromata” device, which was
    developed to monitor essential parameters important for hydroponic cultivations
    such as humidity, temperature, pH, and EC, had been able to provide accurate and
    reliable data. The key advantage of this device lies in its portability, enabling
    its application across diverse cultivation areas. The experimental results demonstrated
    that artificial light significantly influenced the growth of lettuce in terms
    of height, number of leaves, leaf width, relative chlorophyll content, fresh and
    dry weight. The best combination for optimal lettuce growth was found to be white:blue:red = 1:1:1,
    with PPFD at 200 μmolm−2 s−1. References Lakshmanan R, Djama M, Selvaperumal SK,

    Introduction Agriculture is one of the key sources that plays a significant part
    in the life of the country''s economy. Traditional agriculture refers to the conventional
    farming methods that have been practiced for centuries, relying on manual labor
    and basic tools. In traditional agriculture, farmers often work in small plots
    of land using traditional seeds and farming practices passes down through the
    generations while traditional agriculture has played a crucial role in meeting
    food demands, it does have it disadvantages. One significant drawbacks is its
    relatively low efficiency and productivity. Manual labor-intensive tasks can be
    time-consuming and labor demanding, leading to potential wastage of water, fertilizers
    and pesticides. Moreover, traditional agriculture is more susceptible to the adverse
    effects of unpredictable weather conditions and environmental factors which can
    result in lower yields and economic losses. Meanwhile, food security is a global
    challenge and impacted by rapidly compounding effects of climate changes, population
    trends and supply chain shortcomings. Agriculture''s global impact cannot be overstated,
    as it remains the primary source of food for humanity. Despite the fact that the
    human population continues to grow, agricultural land remains static (Virk et
    al.2020). The authors (Mesgaran et al. 2017) also discovered that the ever-changing
    climatic conditions significantly reduce agricultural product output in conventional
    agricultural systems. As a result of the varying nature of farming resources and
    poor management, farmers continue to experience low agricultural output. Drawbacks
    of Traditional Farming Due to the low degree of automation in the farming area,
    the current state of the art in agriculture, particularly conventional agricultural
    systems, still confronts significant hurdles in terms of sustainability, labor-intensity,
    and energy efficiency needs. Also, the production level of the crops to be considered.
    Scalability problems also taken into account since the population explosion is
    the major cause. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming In order to overcome
    the limitations and challenges faced in the conventional farming systems, the
    advent of the smart farming and precision agricultural sector to automate the
    farming processes towards achieving many goals towards sustainable agricultural
    systems. Some of them are listed below: • High quantity of crop yield • Better
    quality of the crops • Efficient resource utilization • Effective to handle climatic
    conditions • Decision making in cropping patterns • Environment and user-friendly
    • Easy maintenance • Minimized crop losses • Easy to handle pests, diseases, weeds
    • Minimize the crop growth time duration • Early prediction on the crop loss or
    gain • Ensures and motivates organic way of crop cultivation • Improves the growth
    of wide variety of crops • Reduces the usage of pesticides, fungicides and other
    chemicals that are not good for health. • Though huge amount for installations,
    less chances for failures and lasts for longer life-time. Continue Reading References

    Wireless fidelity 1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture - Population, Climate Change,
    Sustainability, and Globale market size Agriculture was one of humanity''s first
    endeavors, and it remains a mainstay of our civilization. It has changed greatly
    throughout time in order to fulfill the needs of an expanding global population,
    adjust to shifting climatic circumstances, and solve sustainability-related issues.
    The relationship between agriculture and important variables including population
    dynamics, climate change, sustainability, and the size of the global market has
    had a significant impact on the agricultural landscape. The agricultural sector
    needs to provide enough food to cope with the world''s ever-increasing population.
    Innovative agricultural technologies, such as advanced technologies and crop management
    systems, are needed to increase productivit. Due to the high population growth,
    the globe will need to produce more than 70 % of food by 2050 [1]. Moreover, agriculture
    is also at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Agricultural yields
    and livestock are under serious threat from the effects of global warming, manifested
    in variable weather patterns, high temperatures, and changing levels of precipitation.
    Farmers are increasingly exposed to the risks of climate change, which requires
    rigorous strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change in order to maintain
    agricultural productivity [2], [3]. It has become crucial to strike a balance
    between the need to produce food and the need to safeguard the environment and
    conserve natural resources. Sustainable agricultural methods are becoming increasingly
    popular as they promote ecological stability and resilience. According to Dhanaraju
    et al. (2022) [4] sustainable agriculture is a farming technique that tries to
    satisfy the needs of the present generation without jeopardizing the ability of
    future generations to satisfy their own needs. It focuses on reducing the negative
    environmental consequences of agriculture while ensuring that farmers can maintain
    their livelihoods and provide healthful food. It may boost the economy of nearby
    towns and farms, support regional food systems, promote rural development, and
    provide jobs for rural areas [5]. Overall, sustainable agriculture is a vital
    method of farming that may assist to ensure future generations have access to
    food and a healthy environment [6], [7], [8]. In parallel, the interconnectedness
    of the agricultural industry worldwide makes international trade in goods and
    commodities possible. To make wise choices and improve the allocation of resources
    among farmers and agri-food businesses, we need to understand market size, demand
    trends, and trade dynamics. Additionally, in the upcoming years, the value of
    the worldwide smart agriculture market will significantly rise.The rising need
    for food, the requirement for sustainable farming methods, and the adoption of
    cutting-edge technology in the agriculture field are all factors contributing
    to the market''s expansion [9], [10]. 1.2. Application of IoT, Blockchain, Embedded
    electronics, Robotics, and Automation in smart agriculture The rapid development
    of technology in recent years has paved the way for creative solutions in a variety
    of industries, and agriculture is no exception. Modern farming practices have
    been changed by the integration of the latest technologies, such as the IoT, robotics,
    blockchain, embedded electronics, and automation, giving rise to the idea of smart
    farming. This new paradigm involves the intelligent application of data-driven
    technology to improve the productivity, efficiency, and sustainability of agricultural
    methods. Smart agriculture will require the integration of new technologies like
    the IoT in order to gain a substantial competitive advantage. To meet the demands
    of the growing population, agricultural output must be raised [11], [12]. IoT
    is improving farming methods by providing connectivity and intelligence through
    automated irrigation systems and intelligent livestock monitoring. So that the
    agricultural sector will benefit from important advantages such as improving operational
    efficiency, reducing cost and waste, and improving crop quality thanks to intelligent
    agriculture based on the blockchain and IoT [13], [14], [15]. The agricultural
    supply chain is transparent and traceable thanks to blockchain technology. Immutable
    records boost consumer and stakeholder confidence by confirming the provenance
    of products and facilitating interactions between farmers and buyers. Smart agriculture
    also has a connection to the utilization of digital technologies, including embedded
    electronics, robotics, and automation [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Embedded electronics
    are crucial for smart agricultural equipment and gadgets. IoT is reinforced by
    robotics, which automates operations such as planting and harvesting to increase
    production and reduce manual labor. Automation driven by real-time data improves
    yields and optimizes the use of resources while reducing errors in farming practices.
    This technology seeks to simplify operations and improve productivity and decision-making.
    An agricultural control system known as “smart farming” offers a thorough approach
    to dealing with the geographical and temporal variability of soils and crops in
    order to enhance product quality, and boost profitability [21], [22]. 1.3. Application
    of sensors in smart agriculture and focus of this work Through the use of real-time
    data in smart agriculture, made possible by sensor technology, agricultural yields
    can be increased, costs can be cut, and there is less environmental harm. By acquiring
    data on a range of environmental factors, including nutrients, soil moisture,
    temperature, and others, farmers may make decisions about irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control [23], [24]. Thanks to smart agriculture, farmers can continuously
    monitor crop growth and environmental conditions, anticipate potential problems,
    and take quick action in reaction to changes. This approach, which promotes efficient
    and environmentally friendly farming methods, is essential in light of climate
    change and other environmental problems. The application of sensor technology
    in agriculture is anticipated to have a substantial influence on future food production
    [25]. Every element of conventional agricultural operations has been significantly
    improved by the integration of cutting-edge sensors and IoT technology. Currently,
    smart agriculture has the potential to advance agriculture to previously unthinkable
    levels by seamlessly integrating wireless sensors and the IoT [26], [27], [28].
    In order to promote sustainable agriculture, this survey article focuses on cutting-edge
    IoT and sensor applications in smart agriculture. The study also focuses on the
    IoT architecture for smart agriculture as well as the size of the worldwide market
    for smart agriculture in the next years. 1.4. Preceding affined review papers

    [74], [75], [76], [77]. The prevention of disease propagation and the reduction
    of pests'' negative effects on crop yields are made possible by the use of sensors
    and IoT in agricultural disease and pest control [76], [78], [79]. Additionally,
    IoT technology supports data-driven decision-making for pest and agricultural
    disease management [73]. By analyzing data received from sensors and other sources,
    farmers may learn about the effectiveness of their pest management strategies
    and make adjustments to their operations. By evaluating the data produced by IoT
    and sensors using ML and other data analytics technologies, farmers may identify
    patterns and trends in crop health and choose efficient pest management strategies
    [73], [80]. In terms of intelligent agriculture, the application of IoT and sensors
    for pest management marks a significant achievement. IoT technology provides more
    precise and sustainable pest management procedures, minimizing the use of toxic
    chemicals and fostering a more effective and environmentally friendly agriculture
    sector by giving farmers real-time data on crop health and insect activity. 3.4.

    establish connections with each other or the internet to initiate required actions.
    IoT has successfully captivated a vast audience due to the numerous ongoing innovations.
    However, the adoption of IoT technology brings both advantages and challenges.
    The difficulties of using the IoT in smart agriculture have been covered in several
    research [29], [30], [32], [114], [115], [116], [117]. Despite the IoT''s development
    over the past two decades, significant conceptual, structural, and problems remain.
    Fig. 7 depicts the most important challenges to implementing the IoT in agriculture,
    like 1) superior efficiency, 2) cost and standardization, 3) heterogeneity and
    accessibility, 4) adaptability and energy optimization, 5) compatibility and reliability,
    6) mobility and environmental conditions.Here are the most pressing immediate
    problems of the IoTs: 1) Superior efficiency: Agriculture is nowadays a race.
    Despite poor soil conditions, dwindling availability of land, and increased vagaries
    of weather, farmers must produce more. Farmers can monitor their products and
    environmental conditions in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can
    quickly get ideas, anticipate problems before they arise, and decide how to prevent
    them from using knowledge. Automation is also being introduced by IoT solutions
    in agriculture, such as demand-based irrigation, fertilization, and automated
    harvesting. 2) Cost and Standardization: Due to regional economic disparities,
    creating a cost-effective strategy for IoT installations in agriculture is difficult.
    Economic models must be developed to control setup and operational expenses, which
    include the price of IoT devices, recurring subscriptions, data processing, maintenance,
    and energy. For devices, applications, systems, and products to function properly
    together, standardization is essential. Interoperability is challenging to achieve,
    though, because diverse IoT devices lack standardized formats and protocols. To
    enable the success of IoT implementations, interoperability is therefore required
    at the organizational, technological, semantic, and conceptual levels. 3) Heterogeneity
    and Accessibility: System design makes use of heterogeneous devices. Each gadget
    has a different set of operational and maintenance needs. Since the majority of
    models in agriculture use heterogeneous equipment, it is essential to create a
    connection between communication technologies and heterogeneous modules. The network
    becomes increasingly complex due to heterogeneity, which might occasionally result
    in the appearance of falsified results. Any IoT-based or other device-based farming
    decision support system must be built with the assumption that current software
    and hardware are always available everywhere. These problems must be fixed in
    order to ensure that services are available whenever and wherever they are needed.
    A lack of the required tools may result in chaos and service delays. 4) Adaptability
    and Energy Optimization: For smart farming, it is important that the devices are
    able to adapt to other devices in addition to the environment. Some hardware is
    incompatible with one another owing to the environment''s continually changing,
    as well as occasionally because of particular hardware or connection concerns.
    The most recent problem with communication devices, and other IoT is energy. Up
    until now, the designing and operating models have been supported by traditional
    sources of energy. However, with more gadgets on the market, using traditional
    energy is no longer a viable option. Aside from testing unconventional energy
    sources like solar, wind, and water energy harvesting plans, which haven''t had
    much success, new approaches also need to be developed. 5) Compatibility and reliability:
    The produced models or software should be adaptable and scalable in order to comply
    with the criteria of fragmentation and scalability. Reliability is a vital issue
    for IoT devices to effectively and seamlessly transmit data. The devices must
    collect and communicate accurate data since judgments are made utilizing the information
    that has been received and analyzed. Due to system failures, node failures, battery
    problems, and other interventions, reliability is still a difficulty. 6) Mobility
    and Environmental Conditions: The generated systems or models are often static.
    Because most devices and applications are portable, mobility is essential for
    the framework''s efficient implementation. The challenge of sustaining connectivity
    still exists in mobile models. Agricultural landscapes come in a variety. As a
    result, it becomes challenging to respond to those changes, which puts data and
    services at risk. This modifies a system''s accuracy. Download : Download high-res

    in agriculture. 6. Conclusion and perspective In conclusion, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) and sensor technology, then, provide significant potential for enhancing
    food security and sustainable agricultural methods. In addition to presenting
    four layers of the IoT architecture for smart agriculture, including the perception
    or sensing and actuator layer, the network layer, the cloud layer, and the application
    layer, this study also offers insights into the size of the global market for
    smart agriculture in the years 2021 to 2030. This review paper addressed the current
    state of IoT and sensor technologies for agriculture, as well as some of their
    potential applications, such as 1) irrigation monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer
    administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4) monitoring (yield monitoring, quality
    monitoring, processing monitoring, logistic monotoring), forecasting, and harvesting,
    5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. A variety of sensors
    for agriculture are also included in this study, including those that can detect
    soil NPK, moisture, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity, CO2, temperature, humidity,
    light, weather station, water level, livestock, plant disease, smoke, flame, and
    flexible wearable. The advantages of IoT in smart agriculture are also highlighted,
    particularly in terms of of superior efficiency, expansion, reduced resources,
    cleaner method, agility, and product quality improvement. However, there are still
    problems that must be fixed before IoT technology can be employed in agriculture,
    which is what this study has discussed. further offer hints on potential future
    study avenues. Future readers and scholars will benefit from this study''s insights
    into the current status of academic accomplishment in this field. Agriculture
    has the potential to be revolutionized by the development and application of IoT
    and sensor technologies, enabling more sustainable and effective food production.
    The need for food will rise as the world''s population expands, and the agriculture
    industry must come up with novel solutions to fulfill this demand while preserving
    sustainability. IoT and sensors, which provide real-time monitoring and management
    of crops, soil, and environment, present a possible answer to these problems.
    However for them to be widely used and implemented, a lot of money must be spent
    on infrastructure, training, and research. To encourage the use of IoT and sensor
    technologies in agriculture and to address the difficulties facing the industry,
    governments, private sector players, and other stakeholders should work together
    to establish policies and strategies. The development of sustainable and effective
    agricultural techniques that can fulfill the requirements of a rising population
    while protecting the environment for future generations, as well as the successful
    integration of IoT and sensor technologies, are key to the future of smart agriculture.

  description: Urban farming has gained popularity in recent years, as more people
    have become interested in locally grown food and reducing their carbon footprint.
    Smart hydroponic systems can be an important tool for urban farming as they allow
    for precise control over plant growth and require less space and resources than
    traditional farming methods. Urban areas often lack access to land suitable for
    farming, making hydroponic systems a viable option for growing crops in limited
    space. Readily available hydroponic systems in the market are costly and not cost
    effective, thus hydroponic systems are usually only installed in larger scale
    farming. The challenge here is to connect multiple low-cost sensors to microcontrollers
    and to any store-bought hydroponic set. This paper describes the development of
    smart Internet of Things (IoT) hydroponic system integrated with an Android mobile
    application for small scale urban farming. The new set up of IoT hydroponic set,
    coined as SMART GROW, is used to monitor and control various aspects of the system
    based on the basic parameters important in growing a healthy plant. The challenges
    faced during this build were irregular reading of the analog sensor when connected
    to a single board microcontroller (ESP32). This issue was resolved. SMART GROW
    currently is capable of monitoring basic parameters such as pH, EC and water level
    and can cater to additional sensors for monitoring other parameters if required.
    SMART GROW can easily be replicated and built at home and customized to the needs
    of the plant's requirement. SMART GROW is versatile as it can be used to grow
    a wide variety of plants, including herbs, vegetables, and fruits, and offers
    several benefits over traditional soil-based growing methods such as automated
    regulation of the water level.

    Hardware in context Urban agriculture is a growing trend that includes various
    techniques such as vertical farming, indoor farming, hydroponics, aeroponics,
    aquaculture, and aquaponics [1]. Hydroponics is a form of vertical farming that
    grows plants in nutrient solutions instead of soil [2]. It can be done with or
    without the use of smart technology. Smart hydroponic systems are designed to
    improve water use efficiency by applying a combination of hydroponic systems with
    drip irrigation [3]. Recent studies have shown that integrating wireless sensor
    networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) into hydroponic systems can assist in
    optimal plant growth [1]. The architectural design of smart hydroponics systems
    has evolved over the past ten years or more [4], [5], from purely hardware components
    [6], [7] to designs that include server and client services [5], [8], [9]. The
    ability of smart hydroponics has evolved from monitoring only to providing corrective
    ability to maintain equilibrium required by the hydroponics system [10], [11],
    [12]. Smart hydroponics systems commonly consist of the following components:
    1. Hydroponics hardware that provides a planting platform, 2. Data acquisition
    hardware to capture parameters of the hydroponic solution, 3. Server processing
    that analyses data captured by the data acquisition, and 4. Client services that
    provide different choices of services at the user end. Remote monitoring and automatic
    regulation of hydroponic systems have been achieved with systems consisting of
    a network of devices allowing the value of sensors to be remotely monitored and
    controlled in real-time. These systems feature the ability to self-regulate with
    minimal user intervention. For example, [7] developed an auto-calibrated pH sensor
    capable of detecting and correcting out-of-range pH readings through an attached
    irrigation system. However, users could not remotely identify the pH reading in
    real-time. The choice of hydroponics hardware depends on regional needs, with
    most literature choosing nutrient film techniques as less water is required [4].
    Sensors deployed in the data acquisition system mostly focus on the water level
    and pH reading of the system [13]. More recent designs have deployed more sensors
    to detect other parameters such as EC reading and temperature of water [9]. The
    processor connecting directly to the sensors at the hardware level has shifted
    from Arduino UNO [8] to Arduino MEGA boards [14], and later to custom-made PCB
    boards or ESP32 boards [9], [15] that have higher clock speeds and WiFi features
    in their circuitry. For data transfer protocols, WiFi and LoRaWAN are more commonly
    chosen [5]. The server processing has Thingspeak as the most frequently found
    service deployed by the literatures. These literatures do not provide client service
    in the form of a mobile application interface because their main purpose is to
    minimize user manual intervention. The client service is normally in the form
    of notification and does not receive input from the user [5], [13]. Notifications
    are only sent to the user when critical situations occur, such as when water levels
    are lower than normal [5]. [8] uses Firebase, which allows connection to a client’s
    mobile application, but it did not report any GUI. However, there are situations
    where user input is required. Our study proposes a system that allows customizing
    parameters of system to suit different plants, which is not addressed in most
    literatures. Although [14] reported trials for different vegetables planted in
    their system, they did not explain in detail how the changes to parameters were
    made. In addition, the system proposed by [14] costs around 400 USD, which is
    relatively high. According to [16], the cost of a small, uncomplicated hydroponic
    system typically ranges from USD 50 to USD 500. Medium systems cost at least several
    hundred dollars, while large systems can cost several thousand dollars or more.
    In developing countries like Malaysia, a ready-to-use 4-tier waterfall home garden
    costs RM 599 (USD 130) [17], while a DIY hydroponic set with a timer costs RM
    229 (USD 50) [18], both without IoT. A ready-to-use 32-pot full-spectrum system
    including a timer, pH meter, and digital timer but without mobile app IoT control
    costs RM 1099 (USD 240) [19]. SMART GROW outperforms these systems at a lower
    cost, making it more affordable and customizable for developing countries. While
    there are existing works on automated hydroponic systems [10], [11], [12], no
    specific steps or costs are given. Four commercial automated smart hydroponic
    systems were reviewed for their cost, features, graphical user interface design,
    and pros and cons. Additionally, the tools and techniques used to develop the
    prototype were examined for their suitability for this project. Table 1 summarizes
    the comparisons made. Table 1. Comparison of features to Existing Commercial Systems.

    Systems. Espressif ESP32 development board The ESP32 is a microcontroller that
    can readily connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi. The SMART GROW system utilizes
    two DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1 boards. One board is used to capture and upload data
    from the EC probe. The second board is used to capture and upload data from the
    pH probe and ultrasonic sensors, fetch data from the database, including ECValue,
    and control micro water pumps 1, 2, and 3. PH4502C pH sensor The pH sensor is
    connected to one of the ESP32 boards. However, the pH sensor outputs an analog
    signal ranging from 0 to 5 V, while the ESP32 can only receive voltage inputs
    of 3.3 V or below, creating an incompatibility. This issue was resolved by using
    two 1000 Ohm resistors to lower the voltage to below 3.3 V before it reaches the
    ESP32. The output was calibrated through calculations using polynomial regression
    at different points. The regression equation was proposed by an engineer through
    empirical processes and integrated into the SMART GROW Arduino codes. User can
    directly use the code without further calibration. The pH sensor serves as a pH
    level detector, with codes written to continuously fetch data from the sensor
    and send it to the Firebase database via the ESP32. DFR0300 EC sensor The EC sensor
    is connected to a different ESP32 board than the pH sensor. Similar to the pH
    sensor, the EC sensor outputs an analog signal greater than 3.3 V, while the ESP32
    can only receive voltage inputs of 3.3 V or below, creating an incompatibility.
    This issue was resolved by using a single 1000 Ohm resistor to lower the maximum
    output of the EC sensor. The output was calibrated through the same calculations
    that uses polynomial regression at different points which was proposed by an engineer.
    The EC sensor must be connected to a separate ESP32 board to avoid electrical
    interference with the pH sensor and achieve stable readings. DS18B20 temperature
    sensor The temperature sensor is connected to the same ESP32 board as the EC sensor.
    This is necessary because the temperature of the hydroponic solution is required
    for the computation of the EC value, which is integrated into the SMART GROW Arduino
    codes. Users can directly use the code without further configuration. The waterproof
    temperature sensor is placed in the hydroponic solution to measure its temperature.
    JSN-SR04T ultrasonic sensor Three ultrasonic sensors are utilized in this project,
    each serving a distinct function. The first sensor measures the height of the
    water level in the hydroponic reservoir, the second sensor measures the height
    of clean water in the water reservoir, and the third sensor measures the height
    of the nutrient solution in the nutrient reservoir. All readings are calculated
    and converted into percentages to facilitate user understanding. Micro water pump
    Four micro water pumps are utilized in this project, each serving a distinct function.
    The first pump is responsible for pumping clean water into the hydroponic reservoir
    if the pH or EC value exceeds the user-defined threshold. The second pump adds
    nutrient solution to the hydroponic tank when the pH or EC value falls below the
    user-defined threshold. The third pump removes excess water from the hydroponic
    reservoir, while the fourth pump circulates nutrient-enriched water through the
    hydroponic tiers. Software overview The Arduino Integrated Development Environment
    (IDE) is an open-source software that allows users to write, compile, and upload
    code to development boards. It is available for free on multiple platforms, including
    Windows, macOS, and Linux. The IDE is designed to be user-friendly and accessible
    to beginners while also being powerful enough for experienced programmers. It
    includes a code editor, compiler, debugger, and serial monitor for communicating
    with the board and monitoring its output. One advantage of using the Arduino IDE
    when programming ESP32 microcontrollers is its compatibility with the ESP32-Arduino
    Core software. This software bridges the hardware gap between the ESP32 and the
    Arduino, allowing users to use the Arduino IDE as their development environment
    and program the ESP32 using a language similar to that used for the Arduino. Additionally,
    many Arduino libraries can be reused when writing software for the ESP32. Users
    can write code in C++ using the Arduino IDE and upload it to development boards.
    The IDE includes a large library of pre-written code and examples that can be
    used to learn how to program different types of development boards. For instance,
    SMART GROW was coded using C Programming Language as Arduino IDE supports both
    C and C++. Design files summary All packages and files can be downloaded from

    DIY SMART GROW hydroponic set The hydroponic set was customized and built from
    scratch to minimize cost. Fig. 3 is the blueprint of SMART GROW DIY Hydroponic
    set. The maximum capacity of SMART GROW is 10 L. The inner dimensions of the tray
    were 38 cm (L) × 28 cm (W) × 10 cm (H), which would give a volume equal to 10,640
    cm3. The container was filed with a 10 L of water and the water needed to reach
    a certain height depending on the container dimension, which was calculated using
    the equation below: Download : Download high-res image (300KB) Download : Download

    Hydroponic Set Up. Instructions for programming the ESP32 board First, the user
    must download and install the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
    Then, they must install the ESP32 library by choosing version 1.0.6. A step-by-step
    guide can be viewed in the following video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBaS3YnqDaU.
    After that, the user must download the SMART GROW scripts and libraries from the
    link provided in this article (see Section 3). The SMART GROW libraries must then
    be downloaded and stored at the path for the Arduino IDE library (for example,
    on a desktop with Windows OS, the path would be …\\Arduino\\libraries). Next,
    the user must connect the ESP32 to a computer using a USB cable and open the Arduino
    IDE on the computer. The script should then be verified and uploaded to the ESP32.
    Note that there are two ESP32 boards deployed in the system. User must upload
    one of the codes to one of the ESP32s while uploading the other code to the other
    ESP32. Instructions for setting up a firebase real-time database Download the
    SMART GROW database diagram (See Section 3). Create a Google Firebase Real-Time
    database account and create tables in it according to the database diagram. Instructions
    for installing the SMART GROW mobile application First, user must download the
    APK file (see Section 3) to their devices. Before installing it, user must ensure
    that their devices are set up to allow the installation of apps from unknown sources.
    To do this, navigate to the device’s Settings, then to Security, and enable the
    “Unknown sources” option. Once the APK file has been downloaded and the “Unknown
    sources” option has been enabled, user can navigate to the folder where it is
    saved using a file manager app. Tap on it to start the installation process. User
    will be prompted to review the app’s permissions and then asked to confirm that
    they want to install it. After confirming, it will be installed on their devices
    and can be found in their app drawer or on their home screen, depending on their
    device. Operating instructions for SMART GROW Android mobile app From the SMART

    ESP32 A4 captures data from the pH probe and ultrasonic sensors and sends it to
    the database. It also controls all the micro water pumps and is responsible for
    streaming data from the database and updating the variables minrpH, maxrpH, minrEC,
    maxrEC, minrTank, and maxrTank locally. This only occurs when the Firebase library
    detects changes in data in the database. When environmentRegulation() is called,
    the state of three pumps - pumpW, pumpN, and pumpT - is either turned on or off
    based on the latest ECValue, pHValue and air level in the reservoir. PumpW supplies
    additional water to the hydroponics if it lacks water; pumpN supplies additional
    nutrients to the system if it lacks nutrients; and pumpT supplies additional water
    to the water container containing pumpW if its water level becomes too low to
    support the system. On the other hand, ESP32 A3 only captures data from the EC
    probe and sends it to the database regularly over time. Validation and characterization
    The proof-of-concept is when the hydroponic set, IoT and the app must work together
    and ensure that the requirements of the users are achieved. The proof-of-concept
    for SMART GROW focuses on integration testing, functional testing, and user testing
    of the proposed system. There are two parts to the integration testing. The first
    part tests the operability of the low-cost sensors integrated on a single microcontroller.
    The second part was the integration testing, where all the sensors in the SMART
    GROW must be able to relay accurate data to the app developed. Each of the data
    is explained in the separate sub section 7.1. This was then followed by functional
    testing which was to ensure that the developed app is in accordance with the functions
    required by the user. Sub section 7.2 will explain the results further. Integration
    and functional testing are insufficient without the user utilizing and growing
    with the proposed system. Testing was conducted with user growing vegetables using
    the SMART GROW hydroponic system and the test results are explained in sub section
    7.3 and 7.4. Integration testing EC sensor, ultrasonic sensors and ESP32 were
    integrated and tested for the purpose of measuring electrical conductivity and
    water level. The first test carried out was not successful due to the placement
    of the EC sensor and the ultrasonic sensors on the same ESP32. The solution to
    this is to separate the EC sensor and ultrasonic sensors on two different ESP32
    with two different circuits which when tested, showed accurate readings. This
    was an important setup in SMART GROW. The pH and ultrasonic sensors were integrated
    with the ESP32 and tested for their ability to measure pH, nutrient, and solution
    levels in the tower. Preliminary tests were unsuccessful due to the placement
    of the sensors. The ultrasonic sensors require a clearance of 35 cm from the solution
    surface to accurately read the solution level. To resolve this issue, the pH sensors
    were placed further away, and the ultrasonic sensors were placed on top of the
    tower. Additionally, the pH and ultrasonic sensors were connected to different
    GND pins on the ESP32 to avoid ground loops, which can cause interference from
    currents generated by the sensors. With these adjustments, the pH readings fluctuated
    within an acceptable error margin, and the ultrasonic sensors were able to accurately
    read the water level. The sensors and ESP32 are integrated as part of the SMART
    GROW and the purpose of the following integration testing was to assess the communication
    between the SMART GROW and the app. For this testing, the settings were changed
    in the SMART GROW app, when manually evaluated, these settings were applied to
    the SMART GROW box: providing a pass to this integration testing. Functional testing
    In order to perform basic hydroponic plant monitoring, nine functions were requested
    and listed in table below (Table 4). Functional testing was performed based on
    each of these functions. All of the functions passed the functional testing because
    the functions was developed in accordance to the requirement listed by users.

    Library User testing A user test was conducted to evaluate the proposed SMART
    GROW system. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) [17], a theory that models
    how users accept and use technology, was applied to the user testing of the hydroponic
    system. Two main aspects were considered: • Perceived usefulness or how users
    find the system useful for a specific task. • Perceived ease-of-use or how easily
    users can handle the system with minimal guidance. The following factors were
    considered during user testing: • Learn ability and intuitiveness. • Error prevention
    and error handling • Visibility and documentation • Discoverability and exploration
    • Consistency • Interactivity Users were provided with the SMART GROW system,
    including both the physical setup and the app, as well as a user testing form
    with the above factors listed for rating. Based on the user testing results, three
    factors - learnability and intuitiveness, error prevention and error handling,
    and consistency - passed. However, visibility and documentation, discoverability
    and exploration, and interactivity were rated as minor failures. For visibility
    and documentation, users initially found it difficult to update or delete available
    plant data. However, this issue was quickly resolved through exploration of the
    available options. Although users rated discoverability and exploration as a minor
    failure, they did not test all of the functions available in the SMART GROW app
    within the given time frame. Nevertheless, they were able to view the main features.
    This issue was addressed by allowing users more time for exploration. For interactivity,
    developers expected that users would use the app occasionally throughout the day,
    compared to current practice of manually checking the hydroponic set only when
    remembered. In the user testing form, users were asked if they used the app occasionally;
    they reported using it once or twice per day, which was better than expected.
    Overall, users were satisfied with the proposed system. User planting Users were
    provided with SMART GROW hydroponic set and the mobile app. Hydroponic Nutrient
    AB was used in growing solution. Hydroponic Nutrients AB is a water soluble granular
    (SET A) and water-soluble powder (SET B) plant food containing N, Ca & Fe. It
    is a complete balanced fertilizer for hydroponics, indoor/outdoor potted plants,
    vegetables, and herbs. The plant species planted was Brassica juncea (L.) Czern
    var. Ensabi is a new local variety of mustard species, found only in Sabah and
    Sarawak, Malaysia. Users also cultivated Ensabi in conventional soil medium for
    observation. Users observed and documented the growth of Ensabi. Based on the
    results obtained from four weeks of planting till harvesting, the number of leaves
    and height are measured in three days intervals. (Fig. 21, Fig. 22). The average
    value was derived from data collected from 6 Ensabi plantlets at random grown
    with SMART GROW and Soil Medium. This shows that users can easily plant with SMART
    GROW (see Fig. 23a, Fig. 23b). Download : Download high-res image (304KB) Download

  explanation: The key goal of this research paper is to propose an Internet of Things
    (IoT)-based irrigation system for aquaponics that uses real-time sensor data to
    monitor and irrigate crops efficiently. The system's design incorporates a variety
    of sensors, such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, and humidity sensors, to collect
    data that is then wirelessly transmitted to an Adafruit IoT platform for visualization
    and analytics.

    Agricultural practices are rapidly changing in the face of the increasing demand
    for food and water resources. Traditional methods of irrigation have proven to
    be inefficient, causing water scarcity and soil degradation. The concept of aquaponics,
    a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, offers an alternative solution to
    sustainable agriculture. It utilizes a closed-loop system where fish and plants
    are grown in the same environment, creating a symbiotic relationship where the
    waste from fish is utilized as nutrients for plants, and the plants clean the
    water for the fish. Fish waste is converted into nitrates by bacteria present
    in the soil, which can be readily absorbed by the plants. This system also provides
    the plants with a much more consistent nutrient supply as compared to traditional
    irrigation systems. Experts say that the aquaponic way of irrigation conserves
    as much as 90% of the water that is wasted in traditional irrigation systems.
    It is also observed that plants grow faster in this system because nutrients are
    readily available to them and they do not have to expend energy searching for
    them. Overall, the nutrient-rich, controlled environment of an aquaponics system
    provides the ideal conditions for plant growth, making it a superior option for
    growing plants. The proposed system takes various samples of tap water as well
    as Potheri Lake water with varying differences in pH, turbidity, and water temperature.
    The pH level of lake water can vary widely depending on various factors such as
    the surrounding environment, the presence of aquatic life, and the weather conditions.
    In general, lake water can have a lower or higher pH level than tap water, depending
    on the lake''s distinctive characteristics and the way the local area''s tap water
    is treated. For instance, tap water is usually treated to have a pH level between
    6.5 and 8.5, which is considered safe for human consumption and does not cause
    corrosion in pipes. The naturally occurring presence of suspended particles like
    silt, sand, and algae in lake water can cause it to have a greater turbidity level
    than tap water. 2 Literature Review The hardware design of one system [1] includes
    various components such as sensors, actuators, relays, an Ethernet shield, Arduino,
    and routers. The monitoring of temperature and humidity is accomplished using
    an Arduino microcontroller, an Ethernet Shield, an FC-28 humidity sensor, and
    a DHT11 temperature sensor. A router is utilized to connect the Arduino Ethernet
    to a server. The relay module functions as a control switch for various actuators,
    which respond to the sensor output. The aquaponic box contains several actuators,
    such as two 12V DC exhaust fans, a mist maker, a 5V DC fan, two LED Grow Light
    lamps, and a 12V DC pump [2]. Another system kept track of numerous environmental
    factors, and over time it would be able to control how the farm operated and create
    a fully automated system. Publishers (nodes), brokers (local servers), and subscribers
    (local servers) all communicated via the MQTT protocol, which allows for the use
    of any data type. Monitoring can also be done with the help of a GUI program,
    a communication network, and [3] wireless sensors. A graphical user interface
    is provided by AWSM to address the aforementioned issues. Farmers can get real-time
    notifications and advice about water quality even when they are not there by using
    AWSM''s mobile applications built on IoT technology. When compared to the conventional
    approach, the introduction of the AWSM-based IoT application in the Aquaponics
    system has shown substantial gains. Additionally, it is feasible to [4] investigate
    many characteristics observed by smart systems, IoT technologies, and aquaponics.
    A ZigBee module [5] can be used in place of the Wi-Fi module to broadcast the
    data gathered by the Arduino while also displaying the values on the LCD without
    performing any control actions. A fish tank, a grow bed, and a light panel that
    simulates the sun''s rays for plant growth make up the aquaponics system described
    in [6]. The fish waste provides nutrients to the plants, which in turn receive
    water from the fish tank as a filter. The system makes use of actuators to operate
    the water pump, light panel, heater, and oxygen provider as well as sensors to
    monitor and control pH levels, temperature, and humidity. To direct the actual
    citrus production process, nutrient monitoring [7] in citrus plants can also be
    done in real time according to the soil situation. Another method that primarily
    focuses on finding magnesium and nitrogen deficiencies in image processing [8]
    in MATLAB for the detection of rice illnesses and nutritional deficiencies. A
    Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and solenoid valves make
    up the hardware employed in this technique. A deep learning method can help in
    the detection of diseases and the prediction of crop growth by utilizing many
    sensors that measure the pH value, temperature, humidity, and water level [9].
    Astute farming is described by the author of reference [10] as the integration
    of a wireless sensor and irrigation system that keeps track of factors including
    soil moisture, nutritional content, and pH levels. A GSM module is used to manage
    the system via wireless communication. 3 Architecture Diagram The proposed system
    shown in Fig 1 comprises two sets of sensors—one for the fish tank and the other
    for the crop soil. The data from these sensors are sent to the Arduino board.
    The Arduino board processes the data and sends it to the NodeMCU Wi-Fi module
    which sends it to the Adafruit cloud platform for visualization and analytics
    [11,12,13,14,15]. The system gathers real-time sensor data from the fish tank
    and crop soil using a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and water temperature sensor.
    The physical layer or sensor is made up of this. The data is gathered and transferred
    to the Arduino board regularly. Fig. 1 Architecture diagram of proposed system
    Full size image 4 Methodology The construction of an aquaponics monitoring system
    for effective irrigation is the main goal of the suggested system. The system
    uses a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor placed in a tomato
    plant, pH, water temperature, and turbidity sensors. The irrigation process is
    controlled by the readings from these sensors. Hardware Setup: The hardware setup
    consists of an Arduino board that, via Arduino programming in the Arduino IDE,
    receives data from the sensors. The NodeMCU Wi-Fi module, which is set up to work
    on any internet network, receives the data after that. A personal hotspot or local
    Wi-Fi network was used for this project. The data is sent from the NodeMCU to
    Adafruit.io, a cloud-based platform for IoT data analytics and visualization.
    On this platform, real-time data changes can be tracked and examined. Every 30–45
    s, the sensors update their readings. A CSV file containing the data gathered
    from the Adafruit.io platform can be downloaded. Then, using the downloaded data,
    three classification algorithms—KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes—are trained and tested.
    To forecast the soil''s irrigation needs, data is analyzed. Jupyter Notebook is
    used to analyze and visualize machine learning. Utilizing visualization techniques,
    the three classification systems are compared for accuracy. The system’s overall
    goal is to create an aquaponics monitoring system that controls irrigation by
    using a variety of sensors. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the
    sensor data and estimate the need for irrigation, which can result in more effective
    irrigation and higher agricultural yields. 4.1 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
    KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor). To use KNN, we must first select a value for k, which
    specifies the number of neighbors to take into account. Then, when we have a fresh
    batch of data to categorize, we determine how far away each point in the training
    set is from the fresh data and select the k-nearest points. Finally, we designate
    the class for the new data point as being the one that is most prevalent among
    those k points. Naïve Bayes’ classifier. Based on the Bayes theorem, which quantifies
    the likelihood of a hypothesis given evidence, it is a probabilistic categorization
    model. The term “naive” refers to the assumption made in Naive Bayes that the
    features are conditionally independent of the class. ANN (Artificial Neural Network).
    It is a machine learning model that takes its cues from how the human brain is
    organized and works. It is made up of many interconnected layers of neurons that
    analyze data and produce predictions. The features of the instance to be classified
    are sent to the input layer of an ANN classification model, and the predicted
    class is generated by the output layer. There are one or more hidden layers in
    between that process the input and transmit data to the output layer. The weighted
    total of the inputs is applied by each neuron in the hidden layers using a nonlinear
    activation function. 5 Components Used 5.1 Hardware The proposed irrigation system
    based on aquaponics uses various components to measure and transmit real-time
    data to the cloud platform for visualization and analytics. The sensors used in
    the system are summarized below. Soil moisture sensor (LM393). An electrical tool
    called the soil moisture sensor (LM393) measures the amount of water in the soil.
    It measures the soil moisture using the LM393 comparator integrated circuit and
    outputs a digital signal based on the predetermined moisture threshold. This sensor
    comprises two probes that are put into the soil; as a function of the moisture
    content of the soil, the resistance between the probe changes. Temperature and
    humidity sensor (DHT11). A widely used electrical device that can detect both
    temperature and humidity levels in the environment is the DHT11 temperature and
    humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor to monitor humidity levels
    and a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor to measure temperature.
    The sensor sends digital outputs of temperature and humidity data to an 8-bit
    microcontroller through a one-wire protocol. pH sensor and turbidity sensor: A
    pH sensor is an electronic device that determines whether a solution is acidic
    or alkaline. The pH scale, which has a range of 0–14 with 0 being the most acidic,
    14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral, serves as the basis for how it
    functions. The fish tank’s water clarity, which is crucial for fish health, is
    measured by the turbidity sensor. Water temperature sensor. A common sensor for
    measuring the temperature of liquids, including water, is the DS18B20. This sensor
    is a digital thermometer that communicates with other devices via a 1-Wire interface.
    With an accuracy of 0.5 °C in the range of − 10 to + 85 °C, the DS18B20 can measure
    temperatures from − 55 to + 125 °C. Arduino board. Arduino Uno is based on the
    ATmega328P microcontroller. It is an open-source hardware board created for people
    of all skill levels who want to develop a variety of electronic projects. The
    board contains a USB port, a power jack, six analog inputs, an ICSP header, and
    14 digital input/output pins. The Arduino programming language, which is based
    on C/C++, can be used to program the board. NodeMCU Wi-Fi module. The board is
    a great option for IoT applications because it combines the capabilities of a
    microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module. The Arduino IDE or the Lua programming language
    is used to creating programs for the NodeMCU ESP8266 device. Various sensors,
    actuators, and other electronic devices can be connected to the board''s GPIO
    pins. Additionally, it has Wi-Fi connectivity functionality built-in, enabling
    it to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices. A USB cable
    or an external power source can be used to power the board. 6 Implementation The
    sensor data was collected for over a month on an hourly basis. Visualizations
    were created based on the data. The data was also collected in the form of CSV,
    and three different binary classification algorithms were applied to it, namely
    KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes. The working model of the aquaponic system is shown
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Turbidity, water temperature, and pH sensor along with connections
    Full size image 7 Results The suggested technique gives a thorough strategy for
    effective aquaponic irrigation management. Real-time sensor data visualization
    and analytics offer insightful information on fish and agricultural growth conditions.
    The three machine learning methods’ comparison offers useful insights into effective
    irrigation prediction in aquaponics. For visualization and analysis, the Adafruit
    platform can be accessed on a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or any other electronic
    device that can be connected to the internet. Visualization on Adafruit.io is
    shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3 Real-time values of data acquired from sensors

    7.1 Comparing the Accuracy of Various Classification Models The selection of a
    classification algorithm for agricultural data is influenced by the details of
    the data, the resources at hand, and the objectives of the classification activity.
    A standard criterion for assessing a classification model''s performance is accuracy.
    It calculates the percentage of cases in the dataset that were correctly categorized.
    To put it another way, accuracy is the proportion of true positives and true negatives
    in all instances. The model is operating effectively and properly predicting the
    class labels of the instances in the dataset when the accuracy value is high.
    A classification model could be taught to determine whether or not a certain soil
    sample needs irrigation based on its characteristics, such as its temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content. In this situation, a classification model
    with high accuracy might be helpful since it can make precise predictions about
    the soil samples’ irrigation requirements. As a result, farmers may be better
    able to decide when and how much to irrigate their crops, which may result in
    the more effective use of water resources and higher crop yields. On comparing
    the accuracy of all three algorithms as in Fig. 5, Naive Bayes was observed to
    have the highest accuracy of 94.12%. This is followed by ANN with an accuracy
    of 91.18% and then by KNN having an accuracy of 88.24. Fig. 5 Grouped bar chart
    for comparison of the accuracy of different models used Full size image 8 Conclusion
    In conclusion, we have presented an irrigation system based on aquaponics that
    utilizes real-time sensor data to monitor and irrigate crops efficiently. The
    system gathers information from a variety of sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, pH sensors, turbidity sensors, and
    water temperature sensors. This information is then processed and instantly displayed
    on the Adafruit platform. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of three classification
    algorithms, namely KNN, Naive Bayes’, and ANN, for deciding when to irrigate the
    soil. We discovered that ANN had the maximum accuracy, making it the best algorithm
    for our system''s irrigation timing prediction. As a future scope, we plan to
    further enhance our system by incorporating features that will enable the user
    to receive alerts on their mobile device, indicating when the crop needs water.
    We also plan to compare our results with additional classification algorithms
    to identify the best-performing algorithm for our system. Overall, this system
    provides a significant advancement in the automation of aquaponics-based irrigation,
    offering a more efficient, accurate, and sustainable way of managing crops. References

  description: Efficient irrigation is essential for sustainable food production and
    regional water security. Temperature measurements provide information about crop
    water status, which allows the estimation of water needs and precise irrigation
    scheduling. This paper proposes a technology for agricultural irrigation management
    that combines cost-effective implementation with the ability to map crop canopy
    temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on a center pivot.
    The technology integrates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability options,
    IoT capabilities, and web data availability, enabling precise plant water stress
    quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content. It facilitates
    real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion, with canopy
    temperature sensors providing accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C without additional
    calibration. Nonlinear Autoregressive Network with Exogenous Inputs (NARX) and
    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models were trained to predict irrigation
    prescriptions, achieving Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE < 4.18 mm) and correlation
    coefficient (r^2 > 0.82). This technology will allow the definition of real-time
    and site-specific prescriptions for variable-rate irrigation systems using infrared
    temperature sensors. Future work includes exploring LoRaWAN technologies, implementing
    a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), improving spatial resolution
    with data fusion algorithms, refining irrigation prescription models, reducing
    sensor costs and developing models considering soil and crop effects.
  doi: 10.1016/j.measurement.2024.114570
  explanation: This study's objective is to establish a precise methodology for mapping
    crop canopy temperature and for subsequent definition of irrigation prescriptions
    using infrared sensors on a central pivot. This advanced sensing technology, when
    integrated with machine learning techniques, has the potential to simplify management,
    increase yields, and reduce related water use and waste, making it an attractive
    option for producers.
  extract_1: Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots.
  extract_2: Several studies have focused on developing ground-based remote sensing
    systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless sensor networks
    [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate site-specific
    prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information, with a
    graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS) tools,
    enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation (VRI)
    center pivot systems [42], [43].

    the definition of real-time and site-specific prescriptions for variable-rate
    irrigation systems using infrared temperature sensors. Future work includes exploring

    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification
    of their suitability and an exposition of their main features. Then, is discussed
    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical
    current of . The maximum battery voltage during charging is , and the minimum
    battery operation is . Sensor response stops below . Fig. 1 shows the general
    scheme of the proposed system. Download : Download high-res image (252KB) Download

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used

    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance

    Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition
    and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles
    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most
    accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with
    the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum
    user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation
    prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian
    or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt)
    inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file
    with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system
    uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using
    WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after
    the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a
    Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts
    with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications,

    significant because they are stored and used to locate the IRT sensors on the

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    1461.11 According to the University of Georgia’s crop production budget [76],
    a center pivot irrigation system can consume diesel and electricity per every

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

  description: Saffron is a highly prized and globally demanded spice.Still, the rate
    of production is unable to keep up with the exponentially rising demand due to
    a variety of reasons. One of the major problems faced in increasing saffron growth
    is the lack of understanding of the best circumstances. Factors like Temperature,
    humidity, and light intensity play a vital role in the growth and development
    of plants, and continuous monitoring and control of these factors are necessary
    to ensure optimal growth. To address this issue this paper introduces an integrated
    automated system designed to empower farmers in optimizing production while simultaneously
    facilitating data collection for research purposes, aimed at enhancing both the
    quantity and quality of agricultural yields using the utilization of sensors and
    a live data streaming application. It allows for efficient management of saffron's
    growing operations and enables more accurate adjustments. The sensors can be remotely
    located in the saffron growing areas and connected to the app via wireless connections,
    allowing farmers to monitor these factors and suggest changes continuously. Using
    this system, farmers can ensure that the conditions for saffron plant growth are
    optimal at all times, leading to increased production. The developed app utilizes
    technologies such as ReactJS and Google Firebase, and also allows for real-time
    data streaming, enabling farmers to view the current conditions at any time and
    make adjustments accordingly. Additionally, a user-friendly mobile application
    is developed to enable farmers to easily oversee their cultivation conditions.
    This paper bridges the gap between existing research by integrating the factor
    of luminous intensity and its effect on Saffron during it's budding and growth
    stage, an area which is severely under researched and finds almost negligible

    System 1. Introduction Saffron (Crocus sativus) is renowned for its unique flavor,
    aroma, and natural coloring properties and medical applications. (Rezaee Khorasany
    and Hosseinzadeh 2016; Bingcong Xing et al., 2021) Saffron has potential medical
    applications that include its role as an antioxidant, mood enhancer (Peng Zhou
    et al., 2022), neuroprotective agent (Marx et al., 2019), anti-inflammatory, and
    potential benefits for cardiovascular health, weight management, eye health, cancer
    prevention, menstrual health, and skin health (Boskabady and Farkhondeh, 2016,
    Akhondzadeh et al., 2010, Agnihotri, 2015). However, further research is needed
    to confirm its effectiveness and safety for specific medical conditions. It should
    be used in moderation and under medical supervision (Amin et al., 2011, Bani et
    al., 2011), but its cultivation is characterized by substantial manual labor,
    making it one of the world''s most expensive spices. This study addresses a significant
    research gap in the field, focusing on the nuanced growth stages (López Córcoles
    et al., 2015) of saffron and the critical environmental factors that influence
    its development. The aim is to provide novel insights into optimizing saffron
    production through IoT and addressing the challenges posed by its cultivation,
    which have been relatively understudied in existing literature. The two major
    analytical points are: 1. Optimizing Growth Stages: It is hypothesized that understanding
    the specific environmental requirements at each saffron growth stage can lead
    to improved crop management practices, ultimately enhancing saffron yield and
    quality. 2. Greenhouse vs. Open Field Cultivation: The expectation is that greenhouse
    cultivation provides more precise control over environmental factors such as light,
    temperature, and humidity, leading to higher saffron production efficiency compared
    to traditional open-field methods. This comparative analysis fills a gap in existing
    research. The five major stages of the annual saffron cycle—sprouting, flowering,
    leaf development, daughter corm development, and dormancy—are influenced by various
    factors, which have been deduced and summarized from different works as below
    1.1. Temperature Abbasi et al. (2009) and Nehvi et al. (2022) observed no bud
    growth during the first 30 days after leaf withering despite warm temperatures,
    but flowering commenced shortly thereafter. Interestingly, Molina et al. (2005)
    found optimal floral development within a range of 23–27°C for over 50 days, though
    exceeding 150 days resulted in floral abortion. A separate study by Zhang et al.
    (2023) highlighted the crucial role of temperature in flower emergence. They demonstrated
    that lowering the temperature to 17°C after initial incubation at warmer conditions
    (23–27°C) was essential for successful blooming. Higher temperatures, as reported
    by Wang et al. (2020), can impede flower initiation and even cause existing blooms
    to abort. Notably, their research showed that corms kept at 9°C produced no flowers
    at all. Further research by Li et al. (2022) investigated the impact of seasonal
    temperature fluctuations on saffron phenology. They observed rapid leaf withering
    followed by flower initiation in late spring/early summer when temperatures reached
    20°C. Conversely, prolonged hot summers delayed flower emergence until late autumn
    when temperatures dropped to 15–17°C. 1.2. Humidity Research conducted by Singh
    et al. (2021) suggests that maintaining an average air temperature of 23.34°C
    and relative humidity of 65.71% for 60 days during corm incubation promotes efficient
    flower ontogenesis. However, for optimal sprout development, Zhao et al. (2019)
    found that 36 days of incubation at 19.77°C with 67.71% humidity was more effective.
    Interestingly, both excessive and deficient rainfall during the bud sprouting
    period have been linked to decreased saffron production and productivity, as noted
    by Kumar et al. (2018). Additionally, chilling periods in December and January,
    with mean aerial temperatures around 2.4°C, appear to be crucial for successful
    saffron flowering, according to the findings of Khan et al. (2023). 1.3. Light
    intensity The role of light intensity in saffron cultivation remains somewhat
    enigmatic, particularly its impact on daughter bulb quality and seed yield. However,
    recent research by Chen et al. (2024) explored the effects of different light
    intensities and red/blue light combinations on saffron plants. Their findings
    suggest that a light intensity of 200 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ with a 3R2B ratio might be
    optimal for maximizing stigma yield, quality, and nutrient content. On the other
    hand, studies by Liu et al. (2020) indicate that higher light intensities can
    compromise stigma yield and quality, despite promoting leaf growth and photosynthesis.
    Leveraging the wealth of knowledge obtained from previous studies, an IoT-based
    saffron system offers unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize saffron cultivation
    by providing precise environmental control, data-driven insights, and adaptive
    management strategies. This integration of technology and scientific understanding
    holds great promise for advancing saffron production efficiency and sustainability
    in the future. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Technologies used The technologies
    that have been used in developing the prototype after considering all of the parameters
    are: -ESP32 as the primary micro-controller -The sensors used are the DHT11 and
    an LDR -Database management is handled using Google FireBase -The app environment
    was set up and developed using ReactJS Other technologies used by researchers
    in the same field have included Arduino UNOs which are generally more expensive
    than the ESP-32. They have also used separate air moisture and temperature while
    we used a DHT 11 sensor that incorporates both these sensors as one and helps
    reduce the overall cost and size of the equipment. Each of them is explained in
    detail below: 2.1.1. ESP32 The ESP32 family of systems on a-chip microcontrollers
    features dual-mode Bluetooth and integrated Wi-Fi and is cost-efficient and less
    power-consuming. ESP32 series uses Tensilica Xtensa LX7 dual-core The Tensilica
    Xtensa LX6 dual-core or single-core microprocessor, or a single-core RISC-V microprocessor,
    which also has integrated antenna switches, power amplifiers, filters,low-noise
    receive amplifiers, RF baluns, and power-management modules. ESP32 used is shown

    : Download full-size image Fig. 2. (Pinout for LDR sensor and a 10 kohm resistor).
    2.1.2. DHT11 sensor The widely used DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor consists
    of an exclusive NTC for temperature measurement and an 8-bit microprocessor which
    is used to output the temperature and humidity measurements as data which is serialized
    (Bai et al., 2017). 2.1.3. LDR sensor The most common uses for photoresistors,
    also known as light-dependent resistors (LDR), are expected to discern the presence
    or absence of light or to gauge the power of the light. When the LDR sensor is
    exposed to light, the resistance reduces rapidly, perhaps even to scant ohms,
    hinging on the light intensity. In the dark, their resistance is very elevated,
    often reaching 1 M. LDRs are non-sequential devices consisting of variable sensitivity
    depending on the wavelength of the input light. Although they are exploited in
    many applications, other gadgets like photodiodes and phototransistors frequently
    perform this light-sensing function. LDR Sensor used is shown in Fig. 3. Download

    (LDR Sensor). 2.1.4. Soil moisture sensor (under implementation) In our current
    prototype of the IoT-based saffron system, we are enhancing its suitability for
    outdoor cultivation conditions by incorporating a soil moisture sensor. This addition
    will enable real-time monitoring of soil moisture levels, a critical parameter
    for optimizing saffron cultivation. By accurately assessing soil moisture content,
    our system can dynamically adjust irrigation schedules, ensuring that saffron
    plants receive adequate hydration while preventing overwatering or drought stress.
    This proactive approach not only enhances plant health and productivity but also
    promotes water conservation and sustainability in saffron farming practices. With
    the integration of the soil moisture sensor, our prototype aims to provide farmers
    with a robust tool for efficient and environmentally conscious saffron cultivation
    in outdoor settings. 2.1.5. Google firebase Developers can use Firebase, the Google-sponsored
    app development platform, to create web apps, for Android and iOS. Firebase provides
    tools to trail analytics, report and resolve issues regarding applications, and
    create business and test products. Following are some of the benefits of using
    Google Firebase: Google Analytics for Firebase offers free, unlimited reporting
    for up to 500 different events. Analytics provides actionable data for iOS and
    Android app users to make better decisions and app marketing. Authentication with
    Firebase Authentication simplifies the onboarding and opt-in experience for users
    and makes it easier for developers to create secure authentication solutions.
    These features support email and password authentication, phone authentication,
    and access to Google, Facebook, GitHub, Twitter, and more, providing a complete
    identity solution. Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is a free,
    cross-platform messaging app that allows businesses to send and receive messages
    on iOS, Android, and the web. With Firebase Instant Database, a cloud-hosted NoSQL
    database, synchronization and storage of data between users can be done instantly
    between users. When the app is offline, it is still available because the device
    continues to connect to all users. Firebase and Crashlytics A real-time crash
    reporting tool called Crashlytics helps developers monitor, prioritize, and resolve
    security issues that make their applications vulnerable. their goods. With crash
    analysis, developers can focus more on building features for their applications
    rather than managing and troubleshooting crashes. Performance - Firebase Performance
    Monitoring Tools give developers information about the iOS and Android performance
    of their apps, allowing them to analyze where and how their apps are performing.
    When application performances can be improved. Developers can test iOS or Android
    apps on multiple connected devices in a single operation. They can view results,
    including screenshots, logs, and videos in the Firebase console. 2.1.6. ReactJS
    React is an open-source front-end JavaScript toolkit. It is used for creating
    user interfaces that are based on UI components. Sometimes it is known as React.js
    or ReactJS. Meta (previously Facebook) and a group of independent programmers
    and businesses are responsible for keeping it up-to-date. React can be the foundation
    for single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications as it has similar frameworks
    like Next.js. React is only concerned with state management and presenting that
    information to the DOM that''s why creating React applications usually necessitates
    the use of extra libraries for routing and specific client-side functionality.
    2.2. Application development 2.2.1. Application design The purpose of the application
    is to display and store real-time data, study the related objective, and help
    to improve on-field work. The designing of the application is done such that it
    is easy for even a layman to use and comprehend the application. Ease of user
    experience is made by using various UI/UX design methods such as providing white
    space and equal margin-padding to various components. Field testing is important
    for demonstrating the app in a live and demanding environment. As we move forward
    with our research, the next phase will focus on extensive field testing to validate
    the application''s performance in real-world scenarios, ensuring its effectiveness
    in practical on-field use. 2.2.2. Methodology The application is made using React
    JS, which is an open-source front-end JavaScript library used for developing user
    interfaces based on UI components. React can be exploited as a base in the development
    of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications The structure of the appis
    shown in Fig. 3 The application is synced with a real-time Firebase database,
    from which the app gets data simultaneously and displays it on its interface.
    Firebase web APIs (application programming interface) are used to communicate
    between the application and server, as shown in Fig. 4 Download : Download high-res
    image (76KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. (App-Development Structure).
    The same server is also responsible for storing data for research and academic
    purposes. Download : Download high-res image (65KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. (Javascript code for DB insertion). The app is integrated with the
    sensors that need to be installed in the field and collects live data that the
    user can access through the app, unlike the existing apps that only have static
    elements (Dhanaraju et al., 2022). Using the live data and the data that have
    been collected, the app compares the live data with the optimal data and helps
    farmers adjust the conditions to maximize their yield. This app currently focuses
    on saffron, but it will later be generalized to help farmers predict which crops
    will be beneficial based on the live conditions of the soil and field. This way,
    production can be increased significantly. 2.2.3. Interface The application interface

    of the field, and the value will be shown in degrees Celsius. System:- System
    on/off state will be shown if the prototype is switched on/off. 3. Experimentation
    This experiment aims to validate the effectiveness of an IoT-based saffron monitoring
    and optimization system utilizing an ESP32 device. The experiment is conducted
    in a saffron cultivation environment, where the ESP32 device, equipped with sensors
    for monitoring temperature, humidity, light intensity, and soil moisture, is installed.
    These sensors are calibrated to ensure accurate measurement of environmental parameters
    crucial for saffron growth and development. The ESP32 device is configured to
    log sensor data at regular intervals, which is then analyzed by optimization algorithms
    to generate recommendations for optimizing environmental conditions based on saffron
    cultivation requirements. The experiment employs a randomized experimental layout
    with treatment and control groups. Treatment groups receive optimization recommendations
    generated by the IoT-based system, while control groups do not receive any intervention.
    Throughout a predetermined validation period, environmental parameters and saffron
    growth stages are monitored and recorded. Data analysis focuses on evaluating
    the accuracy and effectiveness of the IoT-based system in providing monitoring
    and optimization recommendations. Preliminary results suggest that the IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system effectively monitors environmental
    parameters and generates timely optimization recommendations. Treatment groups
    receiving optimization recommendations demonstrate improved saffron growth and
    development compared to control groups, validating the system''s efficacy in enhancing
    saffron cultivation practices. This experiment contributes to the advancement
    of precision agriculture techniques in saffron cultivation, facilitating sustainable
    production and enhanced crop quality. Future research will aim to further refine
    the system''s algorithms and explore additional functionalities to optimize saffron
    cultivation under varying environmental conditions. 4. Future work In the next
    phase of our research, we plan to integrate a small pump into our existing IoT-based
    saffron monitoring and optimization system. This addition aims to automate irrigation
    by maintaining optimal soil moisture levels in the saffron cultivation plot. Our
    experimentation plan involves selecting a suitable pump, installing it in the
    cultivation plot, and calibrating it to deliver water based on soil moisture sensor
    readings. We will develop control algorithms to activate the pump when soil moisture
    falls below a predetermined threshold and integrate pump control functionalities
    into our IoT system. Through a series of experiments, we will validate the effectiveness
    of the integrated pump in promoting saffron growth and yield compared to manual
    irrigation methods. By automating irrigation based on real-time data, we aim to
    improve resource efficiency, enhance crop quality, and increase saffron productivity.
    5. Results and discussions This study posits the conceptualization and realization
    of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based application designed for the surveillance
    and regulation of pivotal agronomic parameters, encompassing variables such as
    ambient temperature, relative humidity, and luminance levels. The overarching
    objective is to mitigate irrigation challenges while concurrently augmenting the
    cultivation practices of saffron. The resultant application, characterized by
    its intuitive and user-centric interface, harbors the capacity to bolster the
    qualitative and quantitative yield of saffron crops. A salient hallmark of this
    application is its capacity to amass and archive field-derived data, thus serving
    as a comprehensive repository that may be harnessed by researchers for investigative
    and multifarious purposes. Furthermore, the software is inherently adaptable,
    affording the ability to transition seamlessly from saffron cultivation to the
    cultivation of diverse exotic crops in prospective phases, although its current
    purview centers exclusively on saffron. The app is useful to index useful Luminous
    intensity, air moisture, and temperature data along with a radar for the optimum
    range criteria being met or not for a certain study interval. The paramount aim
    of this endeavor resides in the metamorphosis of conventional agricultural methodologies
    into the realm of smart farming, characterized by the judicious economization
    of both temporal and pecuniary resources for the agricultural community. A plausible
    extension of this initiative entails the infusion of IoT technologies within a
    controlled artificial environment, whereby scientific methodologies facilitate
    the cultivation of saffron and other crops within a smart agroecosystem, accompanied
    by rigorous performance assessment and analysis. The Light Dependent Resistor
    (LDR) sensor, a pivotal component in the research, has furnished us with essential
    data. This data, meticulously analyzed and cross-referenced with existing research
    datasets, has played a pivotal role in ascertaining an appropriate environmental
    range conducive to saffron cultivation. Notably, this dataset has been instrumental
    in forecasting optimal growth periods. From a forward-looking perspective, this
    data serves as a foundational basis for the envisaged implementation of opaque
    light-restrictive structures. These structures are strategically designed to regulate
    luminous intensity, thus fine-tuning it to the precise threshold prescribed by
    our application for saffron cultivation. This orchestration ensures that the luminous
    conditions are maintained within the ideal spectrum conducive to saffron growth
    and development. 6. Conclusion The research and prototype have successfully demonstrated
    the integration of cutting-edge technology to address critical challenges in saffron
    cultivation. By developing an innovative mobile application integrated with sensors,
    a tool has been developed for saffron farmers to monitor and manage their crop’s
    temperature and humidity levels more effectively. This project has several key
    takeaways: 1. Resource Optimization: By monitoring saffron fields remotely through
    the mobile app, farmers can optimize resource usage, such as irrigation. This
    also contributes to sustainable farming practices, conserving water and energy.
    2. Data Collection and Analysis: Over time, the data collected through our system
    can serve as a valuable resource for research and analysis. Researchers and agronomists
    can access this data to gain insights into saffron cultivation trends, climate
    change impacts, and improved crop management strategies. 3. Enhanced Crop Management:
    The integration of sensors provides accurate and reliable data on temperature
    and humidity, two crucial factors in saffron cultivation. This data allows farmers
    to take timely actions to prevent or mitigate adverse effects on the crop. As
    a result, saffron cultivation becomes more resilient and efficient. In summary,
    this research and project have successfully addressed the challenges faced by
    saffron farmers by providing a reliable, user-friendly, and data-driven solution.
    By embracing the potential of IoT and mobile technology in agriculture, we have
    not only improved saffron crop management but also contributed to the broader
    goal of sustainable and efficient farming practices. This research paves the way
    for further innovation in precision agriculture and offers a promising outlook
    for the future of saffron cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution statement

  description: Climate instability directly affects agro-environments. Water scarcity,
    high air temperature, and changes in soil biota are some factors caused by environmental
    changes. Verified and precise phenotypic traits are required for assessing the
    impact of various stress factors on crop performance while keeping phenotyping
    costs at a reasonable level. Experiments which use a lysimeter method to measure
    transpiration efficiency are often expensive and require complex infrastructures.
    This study presents the development and testing process of an automated, reliable,
    small, and low-cost prototype system using IoT with high-frequency potential in
    near-real time. Because of its waterproofness, our device—LysipheN—assesses each
    plant individually and can be deployed for experiments in different environmental
    conditions (farm, field, greenhouse, etc.). LysipheN integrates multiple sensors,
    automatic irrigation according to desired drought scenarios, and a remote, wireless
    connection to monitor each plant and device performance via a data platform. During
    testing, LysipheN proved to be sensitive enough to detect and measure plant transpiration,
    from early to ultimate plant developmental stages. Even though the results were
    generated on common beans, the LysipheN can be scaled up/adapted to other crops.
    This tool serves to screen transpiration, transpiration efficiency, and transpiration-related
    physiological traits. Because of its price, endurance, and waterproof design,
    LysipheN will be useful in screening populations in a realistic ecological and
    breeding context. It operates by phenotyping the most suitable parental lines,
    characterizing genebank accessions, and allowing breeders to make a target-specific
    selection using functional traits (related to the place where LysipheN units are
    located) in line with a realistic agronomic background.

    It operates by phenotyping the most suitable parental lines, characterizing genebank
    accessions, and allowing breeders to make a target-specific selection using functional
    traits (related to the place where LysipheN units are located) in line with a
    realistic agronomic background. Background Excessive costs of water and/or limited
    access to it in some agricultural areas do not allow all producers to access available
    solutions [1, 2]. Breeders are constantly searching to identify new phenotypic
    traits in early-generation materials that can indicate drought resistance, and/or
    water-use efficiency, and allow higher crop yields and better seed quality while
    keeping production costs low [3, 4]. This is a challenging task, especially when
    dealing with a wide range of possible adaptations or extremely different final
    product quality (seeds). On the other hand, the room for crop adaptation is limited
    by climate and climate-change volatility. Furthermore, there is not enough precise
    information about how crops will respond to these changes [5]. In the case of
    common beans, drought stress (and its consequences) has a higher level of severity
    than other types of abiotic stresses to which the bean may be exposed [6]. However,
    these problems are present in many other crops. Experiments in diverse but well-described
    and well-managed conditions help researchers to determine crop behavior related
    to a given environment [7]. Experiments focused on important crops need to be
    accompanied by internal and external information on crop physiological reactions.
    The whole set of important responses is related to restricted water availability,
    which should be understood by compiling both physical and climatic components;
    different soil types and soil profile depths; plant density, and crop-atmosphere
    relationships [8]. The physiologically adequate and agronomically relevant stress
    timing and duration connected with high-frequency data will play a crucial role
    in understanding crop responses. Thus, crops’ water use has become a main focus
    and carries different concepts to be considered. Therefore, to define water productivity
    at the plant level, transpiration efficiency (TE) likely plays a crucial role
    as it is an important component of the concept called effective use of water (EUW).
    TE is defined by accumulated economic biomass (i.e., seeds) per water unit transpired
    via the plant body [9]. To measure TE, a long period of plant observation/weighing
    is an indispensable need during the entire crop cycle. Without automation, this
    work has a drudgery component. Additionally, [10] emphasize that EUW studies should
    not be the only factor in optimizing yield under limited water conditions; Understanding
    the role of both limited and non-restricted transpiration during the diurnal phase
    and also across the whole phenology is one of the most important questions connected
    to target-specific breeding. Crop growth models recognize that water scarcity
    is associated with a high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which in turn implies
    a condition of atmospheric water stress [11]. The dehydration resistance of leaves
    to very high VPDs has become a trait that researchers suggest being included when
    considering breeding crop varieties adapted to water-limited environments [12].
    On the other hand, under drought conditions, a limited transpiration rate under
    high VPD could be used to conserve soil water for later use when seeds are filled
    [13]. Logically the soil water availability and dynamic changes in water consumption
    during different phenological steps are crucial factors in determining the impact
    of VPD on crop development and should be included in analyses [14]. The challenge
    of useful phenotyping is aimed at techniques, tools, and databases together with
    the entire phenotypic platforms which rely on “hypothesis-driven” rather than
    “available tool-driven” research outputs [15]. The lysimeters measure changes
    in water movements by weighing the entire system. However, because of their robustness
    and complexity, most designs are considered impractical and expensive thus they
    are not widely used in research centers [16]. Additionally, the weighing lysimeter
    is a very accurate method for studying crop water-related requirements and gives
    valuable data for improving crop water management. Understanding this, some agronomists
    or crop scientists use pots or trays in evapotranspiration calculations [17, 18].
    Undoubtedly, there is a constantly increasing need for plant-phenotyping systems,
    which can (semi-)automatically measure water movement and calculate water use
    to identify genotypes with improved EUW [19]. In support of the above-mentioned
    considerations, the integration of technology to study plant features has reached
    the point at which novelty robotics solutions and mechatronic systems have often
    been offered [20]. Mechatronic systems that analyze plant-pot systems with (semi-)controlled
    irrigation are the next logical step to go further to find conservative crops
    with a limited transpiration rate at high VPDs [13]. Since VPD appears to have
    the greatest influence on transpiration response compared to other environmental
    variables [12], different studies have presented their prototypes reflecting VPD
    values. One of these is the lysimeter developed with a water-use-optimized irrigation
    system developed by Vera-Repullo. The study includes irrigation determined from
    the lysimeter’s dataset processing and an embedded system controller which is
    used as a remote data logger and allows data information access through the internet
    [21]. However, it is crucial that researchers focus efforts on developing tools
    that may be used directly in field conditions, not only in regulated and protected
    greenhouses. Some authors [16] have presented a weighing lysimeter prototype at
    the field level which was used on the farm and placed in the soil. Solutions implemented
    so far also include remote-sensing systems (i.e., wireless sensors with dataloggers),
    which have become an important tool for crop scientists. These technologies allow
    for capturing standardized data, reducing time-demanding operations, and eliminating
    differences in individual data perception [15]. Therefore, it is common that remote
    systems to be integrated with the internet-of-things (IoT). One example of this
    is the solution shown by [17], which implemented a low-cost weighing lysimeter
    that was able to measure the weight of potted crops and use an open-source platform
    to determine water balance in irrigation periods. Data were sent remotely to the
    cloud and accessible via the internet. In that way, [22] the system used 100 balances
    (scales) inside a glasshouse where each one automatically logged weight data every
    minute. In this study [22], two common bean cultivars demonstrate greater drought
    sensitivity compared to soybean cultivars. Thus, it is demonstrated that gravimetric
    platforms allow recognizing of the effects of biomass accumulation and transpiration
    per individual plant, as well as calculations related to the TE at the cycle end
    when seed yield is available. Through the measurements of plant weight changes,
    the extracted transpiration rate profiles can identify water-saving and water-spending
    mechanisms based on daily plant water losses (standardized to actual leaf area
    or other traits) representing transpiration response to VPD [23]. Our study shows
    the development and testing process for a solution-oriented tool that combines
    sensors with IoT technology. We called the device “LysipheN” (also Gravimetric
    Unit—GU). LysipheN is an automated, low-cost, and novel prototype for measuring
    the soil–plant-atmosphere continuum responses. By measuring the weight changes
    of the system (plant sown in a pot with soil) and reducing evaporation by surface
    coverage, LysipheN can automatically obtain the transpiration amount every minute
    diurnally or across the entire crop lifecycle. The system recognizes exactly the
    amount of water that has been irrigated within the system since the beginning
    of the experiment. The internal tissue (stem and pod temperature), soil moisture,
    air humidity, and air temperature sensors have been included in the device to
    capture the climatic data. Electronically, the LysipheN is an autonomous self-standing
    IoT-embedded system that sends data through the internet and stores a backup of
    millions of data locally within each unit. Besides that, the Arduino-based integrated
    system allows the integration of more sensors together. Using a Linux-based operating
    system (OS) allows updating and identifying the responses of different genotypes
    to different environments in an almost real-time manner. Each GU is an independent
    system and can be placed in different sites—growth chambers, greenhouses, and
    even within (remote) field trials. The goal of this study is to present a LysipheN
    system that can identify outstanding parental accessions for a particular region,
    using lines within a realistic breeding context, connected to product profile
    information, to dissect water-use-related traits of different genotypes/species
    and help to characterize genebank accessions. The LysipheN concept is oriented
    to be universal and versatile across a range of special-interest in crops such
    as beans, rice, bananas, tropical forage crops, and others in different stress
    scenarios related to TPEs of interest. Results The research implemented several
    experiments to achieve secure, highly precise measurements via the developed LysipheN
    prototype. Several different prototypes were tested (Gravimetric Units). The prototype
    device is described in “Materials and methods” section. For detailed technological
    adjustment data, please see Additional file 1. Once the defined version was ready,
    10 prototype replicas of LysipheN units were built to be tested. The experiments
    were conducted using the Bioversity International and CIAT Alliance facilities,
    inside a greenhouse in controlled conditions and under a monitored environment.
    The prototypes were set to record data every 5 min. The system weight (Fig. 1),
    air RH, air temperature, internal stem temperature, and soil temperature (Fig.
    2) were monitored. Together with the data from the sensors, every prototype calculates
    and recognizes data such as bean variety, number of irrigation events, total irrigated
    volume, etc. These data are stored automatically and sent to the phenotyping platform
    database. The raw results show that GU’s are stable (1, 2, 3, 5, 6–10), only GU4
    shows some noise data (Fig. 1). The irrigation events are clearly visible close
    to 10 am of each day. Mark higher raw weight changes in younger plants suggesting
    very high transpiration and water consumption connected to active prolongation
    growth on the plants. Fig. 1 Raw weight data from ten prototypes (evaluation of
    3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), GU6
    to GU10 (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). A remaining noise can be noted
    on GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Fig. 2 Air temperature, electronic board

    (PCH) Full size image The results show the environmental and stem temperature
    data from GUs (Fig. 2). The environmental data are logically pretty similar as
    the experiment was conducted in the same greenhouse. The only variable here can
    be visualized in the stem temperature as this is affected by the stem water conductivity
    and other genotype-related factors. Total leaf area (TLA) values were calculated
    for both experimental and control plants. The bar chart (Fig. 3) shows the calculated
    TLA per plant and nicely visualizes the growth differences between groups of smaller
    and big plants. The leaf area of smaller plants were around 200 cm2, meanwhile,
    the big plants’ leaf area was around 3000 cm2. Note, to standardize the row transpiration
    values among plants it is crucial to know the leaf area of each plant. Fig. 3
    Total leaf surface area calculated based on measurements of every single leaf
    surface area per plant (evaluation of 3 consecutive days). GU1 to GU5 contain
    younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain old plants
    close to physiological maturity (> 80 days after sowing; PCH) Full size image
    Data analysis The cumulative transpiration per plant was calculated from GU data
    as the difference between the amount of water irrigated (ml) and the weight loss
    for 24 h (in our case for 3 consecutive days; Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Cumulative transpiration
    was calculated for every single GU. GU1 to GU5 contain younger (PCS) plants (1
    month after sowing), and GU6 to GU10 contain (PCH) old plants (> 80 days after
    sowing). The influence of the remaining noise from the load cell can be noted
    in GU2 and GU10 data Full size image Additionally, from manually measured TLA
    values and cumulative transpiration previously obtained, the net transpiration
    standardized for LA was obtained for PCS (small; GU 1–5) and PCH (big; GU 6–10)
    plants (Fig. 5). Thus, the net cumulative transpiration per leaf unit (ml cm−2)
    by the plants in different phenological stages can be observed. Note the markable
    differences between day (high) and night (low) net transpiration (Fig. 4). Fig.
    5 Net cumulative transpiration was calculated per leaf area unit for every single
    prototype. GU1 to GU5 contains data from young (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing),
    and GU6 to GU10 (PCH) contains data from physiologically mature plants (> 80 days
    after sowing). The influence of remaining noise can be noted in GU2 and GU10 data.
    Mark the difference in the scale between GU1-5 and GU6-10 due to TLA being lower
    on these plants Full size image The results show the significant difference between
    cumulative values of plant transpiration standardized to leaf area (ml cm−2) regarding
    their developmental stage. Figure 5 shows the raw, however stable data of cumulative
    transpiration standardized per leaf area. Discussion The LysipheN prototypes demonstrate
    their ability to measure 24/7 plant water consumption via transpiration (soil–plant–atmosphere
    continuum) changes according to the concept proposed by Poorter et al. [7]. The
    other variables such as stem and pods’ internal temperature, air temperature,
    air relative humidity, and soil water content were measured individually for a
    single plant. At the same time, the LysipheN units successfully supported plant
    growth without any supervision. This was achieved by controlling the daily irrigation
    of the individual plants based on plants’ previous water consumption data. The
    irrigation events were implemented by water injection reaching the defined target
    weight point every day (Fig. 1). The 10 LysipheN units were assembled based on
    the final prototype constructed from different previous versions of the GU. In
    this study, the previous versions are not shown. However, the development prototype
    process can be found in Additional file 1: “Prototype development process” section.
    This process was oriented to solving issues related to irrigation systems, hardware
    selection, sensor stability, and reducing the noise affecting the load cells.
    Some of these issues were related to the electric noise or were caused by vibrations
    [17]. Monitoring water-use efficiency (WUE) in diurnal schemes or for the entire
    growth cycle under different environmental stresses (such as VPD or irradiance
    [24]) is extremely helpful for the detection of preferred phenotypes. The specific
    target population of environments (TPE) needs to be properly considered before
    data mining starts, as only TPE-related outputs are useful for breeders who depend
    on realistic contexts. Evaluation of the final prototype on plants focused on
    showing that the prototype can effectively measure transpiration water losses
    in real-time, precisely capturing the diurnal dynamics (Fig. 1). However, some
    prototypes (GU2, GU3, and GU10) showed noise susceptibilities in the weighing
    measurements (abrupt and non-logical changes in the chart) which affected data
    quality and the analysis. We kept these data for easier detection of transpiration
    variability by former users. This particular erroneous behavior can easily be
    repaired by acquiring a high-load cell-quality sensor. The prototypes revealed
    that PCH transpired 100–200 more grams of water than PCS plants per day (during
    the 3 consecutive days), under the same environment and soil conditions. This
    is an expected result since the TLA of PCH plants was over 2000 cm2 and PCS under
    500 cm2 (Fig. 3). At this point, it is important to mention that plants’ transpiration
    under the same environment depends partly on genetics and partly on the presence
    of other abiotic or biotic stresses, and leaf temperature, thickness, and surface
    area [25, 26]. Knowing the weight losses per day, cumulative transpiration per
    leaf area/plant can be easily calculated using a particular formula (Fig. 4).
    As mentioned above, the transpiration of each plant should definitely be standardized
    per LA (Fig. 5) to unify responses between different plants and eliminate the
    genotype or treatment effect within each group. The calculations standardized
    to LA, allow us to determine that the amount of water transpired per leaf area
    was higher in smaller (PCS) than in bigger (PCH) plants due to the leaf phenology
    and in accordance with other physiological studies. These results demonstrated
    that the LysipheN prototypes are sensitive enough to detect and measure even tiny
    weight changes and then produce good transpiration data from very early to oldest
    plants across developmental stages. With additional measurements (air RH, air,
    soil, and internal stem temperatures) the co-factor effects in varying VPD (Fig.
    2) can be determined and support deeper analysis focused on factors that restrict
    transpiration. Genotypes with restricted transpiration could be more resistant
    to terminal drought but more susceptible to heat waves. However, the particular
    environment/soil scenario needs to be considered before any final decisions are
    made. The developed GU prototype is an innovative low-cost tool for modern phenotyping.
    Our system showed that combining different technologies focused on plant measurements
    creates a synergy that meets specific needs of crop physiologists, pre-breeders,
    genebank curators, and breeders. Due to the previous calibration procedures, the
    LysipheN unit is completely portable, allowing it to work in different environmental
    conditions and be connected to different electrical sources (solar panels, any
    110/220 AC source, batteries, 12 V power plants, etc.). Additionally, as an IoT
    phenotyping tool, each unit allows access to data remotely in real time through
    the web-user application. This application will send an email alert message if
    values are out of the programmed limits. Besides this, every prototype integrates
    an SQL database for data secure storing and algorithms able to calculate the water
    losses. The automatic adjustment (based on the predetermined stress scenario)
    of the next irrigation event based on the programmed watering scenario is another
    advantage of the system. High data precision will facilitate different crops’
    growth such as rice, forages, bananas, and other species according to the researchers’
    interest. Importantly, it will reduce the “preliminary experiments” to a minimum,
    especially when new stress, and more importantly new species are introduced. At
    the time of the study publication, the cost of materials per LysipheN unit (without
    manufacturing costs) was around 500 USD. Conclusions The developed LysipheN prototypes
    could become an important low-cost tool for crop pre-breeding and phenotyping
    teams, especially in places where scientists have limited resources for a big
    phenotyping platform or where the number of studied materials varies or is low.
    Development efforts were focused on the assurance of data stability and quality
    and also on a user-friendly approach for researchers even in remote areas of the
    world. The full availability for remote use of these units is an intended and
    crucial advantage when region-specific responses are needed. In this case, soil,
    water, and other inputs are used from this particular place to ensure outcomes
    suitable for modelers, pre-breeders, and breeders. This process is called “target-specific
    breeding” and is in accordance with the recommendations presented by physiological
    breeding. So far, we built 10 LysipheN prototypes capable of indirectly recognizing
    the growth specifications of individual plants by direct evaluation of their transpiration
    with a high level of precision. Weight measurements can vary between prototypes;
    therefore, easy calibration and mainboard thermal corrections are sufficient to
    solve this problem. However, the load cell noise, water condensation, and vibrations
    can affect high-precision measurements when plants are very small (one or two
    true leaves) because daily weight changes are close to the load cell threshold
    (± 5 g). With bigger plants, prototypes demonstrated successful noise reduction
    and are very reliable. The next development efforts will be focused on implementing
    cleaning algorithms and using robust industrial sensors. Using low-cost devices
    that allow remote connection to collect data in near real-time as also automatic
    irrigation based on feedback with previously transpired water is an important
    facilitation step for even small research groups to verify valuable hypotheses.
    The tool multiplies its benefits when selected functional traits are used in acceptable
    breeding contexts on materials with acceptable agronomic background (outstanding
    parental identification or early-materials evaluation). LysipheN is a tool to
    implement precise crop phenotyping, useful for breeders and physiologists but
    also in pre-breeding teams (characterization of genebank accessions by curators).
    Materials and methods In order to detect errors and challenges and measure plant
    transpiration, from early to ultimate plant developmental stages the following
    methodology is outlined. All additional technical details are included in Additional
    file 1. Experimental design An experiment with one common bean variety was carried
    out with the 10 previously-calibrated GUs inside the greenhouse with one plant
    in each GU. The experiment proved system stability, and automatic irrigation scheme
    viability, and verified the minimum threshold in weight recognition (real cell-load
    accuracy). To assess the contrast in transpiration, plants evaluated using GUs
    were divided into two groups with 5 replicates each according to their phenological
    stage (Fig. 6). The first group was formed with plants 30 days after sowing (PCS)
    and the second group with plants closer to the final harvest (PCH) (> 80 days
    after sowing). Fig. 6 Prototypes with plants—two groups. 1. Right—5 prototypes
    with younger plants (PCS) (1 month after sowing). 2. Left—5 prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Center—water source container for prototypes’
    automatic daily irrigation supply Full size image In addition, 15 extra pots with
    one plant per pot, were placed next to the prototypes for manual evapotranspiration
    monitoring (control plants, Fig. 7). The soil surface of both the control and
    experimental GU was covered with black polyethylene to eliminate evaporation by
    irradiation and so measure only transpiration changes of individual plants. Fig.
    7 Prototypes with experimental (right) and control (left) plants. 1. Five prototypes
    with younger (PCS) plants (1 month after sowing). 2. Five prototypes with older
    (PCH) plants (> 80 days after sowing). 3. Control plants. Note that all pots are
    surface covered with black polyethylene. In the middle (between 1 and 2) there
    is an irrigation basin to feed peristaltic pumps for automatic irrigation Full
    size image Automatic data collection Every GU prototype was scheduled to automatically
    supply water to the plant. The amount of irrigated water depends on the amount
    of weight lost via plant transpiration during the last 24 h, after the previous
    irrigation event. In this case, 100% of the transpired water was added to each
    GU for each irrigation event, and plants were irrigated with the same amount of
    consumed water. For the purposes of this study, 3 consecutive days were selected.
    Manual data collection Some samples were taken manually during the experiment.
    Initially, 1 day before the experiment started, leaf length (LL) (from tip to
    petiole) and leaf width (LW) in millimeters at the leaves’ widest point were measured
    manually. However, these two values, LL and LW multiplied, give a rectangle area.
    Therefore, every single Leaf surface Area (LA) in cm2, was calculated by Eq. 1.
    (1) Note that GF is a genotype factor, which is a constant value of the area inside
    the rectangle that is not part of the leaf. This GF factor was obtained previously,
    and can be specific per used genotype. Thus, the Total Leaf surface Area in cm2
    (TLA) was calculated per plant (Eq. 2) as the addition of every single Leaf surface
    Area (LA). (2) TLA values were calculated for both experimental and control plants.
    Note that in Eq. 2 “n” is the number of trifoliate leaves in the plant, and LA
    is the single leaf area. Additionally, the number of leaves was also obtained.
    TLA measurements are depicted in Fig. 3 (Results section). The LysipheN prototype
    The LysipheN prototype is a mechatronic device, including hardware and software
    implemented in a mechanical structure. The mechanical structure is constructed
    as a robust, compact, and light assembly allowing the LysipheN to be easily portable.
    For the hardware implementation, the electromechanical devices, a microcontroller,
    IoT devices, and other sensors were equipped and plugged into an embedded electronics
    system. The software was developed using different programming languages and communication
    protocols. The LysipheN prototypes can measure different types of variables in
    the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum. The directly measured variable is transpiration,
    calculated via system weight changes over time. Other sensors (the tissue temperature,
    soil moisture, relative air humidity, and air temperature) serve as a source of
    additional data and support the high reliability/repeatability of the experiments.
    Using a peristaltic pump, the prototype can perform automatic and precise irrigation
    during the whole plant life cycle. Each GU is able to accurately quantify the
    transpiration losses and automatically adjust the later irrigation amount together
    with feedback from individual pre-settled unit treatment (irrigation amount in
    ml can vary from 0 to > 100% of the water loss during the evaluated period of
    time, based on the realistic or hypothetical stress scenario). The LysipheN-cultivated
    plants grow without any supervision and their performance is much better than
    in hand-irrigated plants (no damage by errors in over-watering by technicians).
    The initial parameter setting thus serves to supply plants with adequate water
    availability during the entire cycle or support constant under or overwatering.
    Accessing data in real-time is possible since every prototype has integrated a
    remote-access web application. LysipheN prototype portability allows users to
    easily move the tool to the evaluation site. The right combination of genotypes
    (deep understanding of parental lines for further crossing) together with the
    selection upon different stressors (climate, soil, watering regime, response to
    fertilizers, rhizobia etc.) will help to obtain proofs of concept for physiological
    trait/allele combinations that could boost yield, but still within a realistic
    breeding context. Mechanical structure The structure was built (Fig. 8) using
    elements purchased in a home store (our case in Homecenter in Colombia). Construction
    elements of the prototypes consist of commonly used materials such as polyvinyl
    chloride tube (PVC) 6-inch length and tube ½-inch diameter, polytetrafluoroethylene
    (PTFE; Teflon) 6-inch diameter, and electrical square box 12 × 12 cm. The mechanical
    structure contains an integrated weighing sensor (Fig. 10), but also, an irrigation
    system (actuator), cable and water hose protection, and an electronic box. The
    GU prototype structure itself (depending on the load cell capacity) is strong
    enough to support the weight of the complete system (pot, soil, and plant) up
    to 60 kg. Fig. 8 Gravimetric unit. 1. Teflon base for placing the pot. 2. Electrical
    Ip65 box. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch diameter PVC base. 4. Output holes for

    Full size image Hardware Since the GU prototype was developed as a complete embedded
    IoT development system, the hardware required a design adaptation process to build
    a compact electronic board with ports for the sensors, and other devices that
    facilitate the electronic working of the prototypes. This adaptation and electronic
    design process were carried out in different stages oriented to the GU hardware
    to be fully competent for the various parts: sensors’ data acquisition; irrigation
    control; electrical source connection and backup; data collection; control microcontroller,
    and IoT internal communication and application’s device (Fig. 9.). Fig. 9 Hardware

    structure was ready, the physical scope was defined to retain the ergonomics and
    protection of the electronic system without neglecting its basic operation. Sensor’s
    data acquisition Weight system measurements The weighing system (sensor, amplifier,
    and converter) returns the primary and most important variable in the measurements.
    A load cell [27] was used as the sensor to measure raw data in terms of voltage
    changes depending on the compression applied to the sensor (Fig. 10). Thus, after
    signal treatment, the system’s weight changes are measured for every required
    sample time (from milliseconds to hours), and—logically—individually for each
    GU. Therefore, considering a known initial dry weight of the substrate (soil),
    the weight system calculates the actual soil water content in % and according
    to how much water was supplied/lost evaluates the pot humidity in each period
    [28]. The sensor junction with the body of LysipheN was easily assembled in the
    structure using screws (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Weight sensor installation. 1. Weight
    sensor (load cell). 2. Metal box as a support. 3. Circular soft yellow 6-inch
    diameter PVC base of the whole unit Full size image As the load cell works at
    a very low voltage level with 3–5 V input (1 mV in this case as an output signal)
    it is necessary to use the signal amplifier system (instrumentation amplifier)
    [28]. The ADS1232 analog-to-digital converter (ADC) was used for this purpose
    (Texas Instruments, USA). Internal pod and stem temperature measurements The prototype
    includes two thermocouple sensors to measure the temperature inside the stem and
    the fruit/pod. developed a methodology to measure the sap flow (however, this
    concept needs to be verified in our system as the most important part is the sensor
    insulation). In our case, the two sensors measure the internal pod and internal
    stem temperature by using the K-type thermocouple (K-type Teflon thermocouple
    with Nickel chromium and Nickel aluminum alloy) (Uxcell K-Type Thermocouple Wire).
    Each thermocouple (sensor) has an adapted welded end and the temperature changes
    applied to this union generate a small voltage as an output (mV) (Seebeck effect)
    transformed into the temperature. This data provides essential insights for plant
    modelers. Future crop models must accurately use varied tissue temperatures to
    estimate air temperature’s impact on growth in a changing climate. During this
    phase, internal stem and pod temperatures were measured to find links to other
    variables, plant behavior, and the influence of direct sun radiation. Electronical
    board’s temperature measurement There is a recognized temperature-based influence
    on electronic devices during their operation that could directly affect the reliability
    of working [29]. Therefore, methods to reduce the effect of the temperature should
    be applied in the design of electronic embedded boards [17] For this purpose,
    the temperature sensor TMP36 [30] was used to measure the air temperature related
    to the microclimate to which the electronical board is exposed. The data from
    this sensor is used to run an auto-compensation temperature calibration algorithm
    for more precise weight measurements. Environmental variables The monitoring of
    the immediate/cumulative plant responses according to treatment concerning actual
    climatic conditions is a necessary step for climate change-oriented plant research
    [18]. Besides, these variables are extremely important in any comparison of plants’
    responses [31]. However, sometimes climate data from far-set weather stations
    are used. Even if the climate is measured in plant proximity, some basic errors
    can easily occur because of convection, conduction, or radiation. In the developed
    LysipheN prototype, air temperature (Ta) and relative air humidity (air RH) close
    to the GU location are measured to know the dynamics of these variables during
    the experiment. These variables (Ta and RH) play a crucial role in terms of the
    VPD calculation in relation to these and transpiration demand [32]. Thus, based
    on that data, the evapotranspiration models can be calculated [33]. To measure
    Ta and air RH, an SI7021 IoT sensor together with a Sonoff module was used. The
    sensor measurement range is 0–100% RH, and − 10 to 85 °C. The precision of the
    sensors is approximately ± 3% in humidity and ± 0.4 °C for the temperature measurements.
    This sensor does not require a calibration process. Only the Tasmota code [34]
    must be uploaded to the Sonoff module with the Wi-Fi credentials. This module
    is very small. Therefore, plant development is not affected. Water irrigation
    control Poorter et al. [7] proposed different options to evaluate water consumption
    in the sense of irrigating plants in each pot individually. The consumed water
    can be replaced by plant irrigation while maintaining a nearly constant soil water
    status during the day [21]. Irrigation was supplied with high precision actuators
    (water volume error 5–10 ml) which were also used to support two different irrigation
    systems (dripping point from above the soil surface and classic bottom irrigation
    reaching first the roots). Having both systems available will allow a wider range
    of plant types to grow, including lowland rice under simulated flooding [21].
    The developed LysipheN prototype includes a programming algorithm for, among others,
    consulting local network time every 10 s in cases (experiments) where irrigation
    control by a specific time is required (below). The data of actual transpiration
    or tissue (leaf, bud, flower, pod) temperature are immediately available after
    any water supply. For the precise control of the irrigation system, a 12 V peristaltic
    pump [35] was used and connected to a digital relay which is an electronic device
    used to implement switching on/off logic [36]. During each experiment, irrigation
    process parameters may easily be changed depending on the user or plant requirements
    according to the type of water availability scenario in the developed user interface
    (UI) for the prototype (below). In a factory setting, irrigation was scheduled
    every day at a specific programmed time (usually early morning). Electrical source
    connection and backup Any experiment with LysipheN units needs an autonomous electrical
    and commonly used universal 12 V source. This allows its use at any location or
    country. Therefore, all experiments involved a battery backup system, which in
    parallel, secured 100% of the time working for the ten replicas built. Data collection
    and control microcontroller For an electronic system that requires sensor use,
    it is essential to have a microcontroller capable of reading and converting analog
    signals or digital messages into useful data. To solve this problem, the Atmega328p
    was selected [37]. This microcontroller programming is open source (using C++
    language) and can be done using the Arduino IDE. However, to get remote access
    and an internet connection for the prototype, this microcontroller needs to be
    accompanied by another device capable of saving data and sending it via Wi-Fi
    (as the Atmega328p does not have these functions). IoT internal communication
    and application device As mentioned above, Atmega328p (microcontroller) is used
    only for sensors data readings. For the prototype, it was necessary to use another
    device serving as a complement to this microcontroller able to both save and send
    data via Wi-Fi and also show them in an application Node-Red interface (see Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming). To solve this, we selected Raspberry
    Pi Zero W [38]. It is a small development board, a one-core processor with 512
    MB RAM, and integrated with a 32 GB microSD card for storing data and OS working.
    The Raspberry Pi Zero W function is highly important in the prototype’s working.
    It allows, among others: Host the main LysipheN unit web application (Fig. 15)
    where all collected data are shown and plotted in real-time. Store data in an
    internal integrated MySQL database. Control the peristaltic pump. Communicate
    and request data from Atmega 328p Microcontroller. Make easy wireless microcontrollers
    and main web application reprogramming. The use of this development board is like
    having a minicomputer within each LysipheN. Because it will allow easy connection
    and configuration of the main web application as well as allow integration of
    possible behavioral algorithm estimation and correlations that are within the
    limits of what is permitted by Raspberry’s characteristics. Main electronic board
    design The developed prototype has an integrated electronic board that contains
    ports for all devices necessary for the system’s working. For the correct integration,
    the development of the board carried out separate tests per device into an embedded
    system (Figs. 11 and 12). Thus, each sensor was tested individually using Arduino
    Uno to verify the communication working and data consistency. Fig. 11 Schematic
    design in EASYEDA Full size image Fig. 12 PCB design (top view), JLCPCB preview
    Full size image The electronic board is equipped with all devices and connections
    required. It is divided into three different parts. The first part is composed
    by: Supply connections that are connected to the 12 V main source. Internal 5
    V and 3 V converter that will supply to the Microcontroller, Raspberry, and other
    devices. The second part is accomplished by: Microcontroller (Atmega328p). Raspberry
    Pi Zero W with working respective connection. The third part in the main electronic
    board was meant for sensors connection. Weighing system (load cell, electric filter,
    and ADS1232 ADC) using a wired connection to the Atmega328p microprocessor. Two
    K-type thermocouples (tiny Teflon end welded). TMP36 sensor. Relay for ON/OFF
    peristaltic pump control. 12 V peristaltic pump for precise controlling of water
    supply. Finally, each unit has a main button, to start the entire system when
    it is switched off or to do a reboot, if necessary. A mini 5 V fan was connected
    to the IP65 box to cool it and make some airflow over electronic devices inside
    the box. Server web hosting device The GU project now comprises 10 prototypes.
    Even though each GU is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Zero W that works, among others,
    as application web hosting, this application is focused on single prototype information.
    Therefore, a Udoo Neo [39] model has been used as a server where the Node-Red
    general application works. This application contains data information of each
    GU connected to the same network and it is part of a bean phenotyping platform
    (in preparation) developed with MySQL and other saving and processing tools (below).
    Software The prototypes’ Programming routine was built in two different languages
    and programming environments. The microcontroller was programmed in C++ through
    Arduino IDE uses, and Raspberry Pi’s application was developed on Node-Red, which
    is a programming tool based on visual connections of nodes and allows different
    uses of internal Raspberry input and output pins, besides Wi-Fi connection and
    MQTT communication. Communication Perfect communication synchrony between devices
    is critical for any automated IoT development. Establishing the protocols and
    making sure that the data will not be lost, must be considered during system routine
    construction (Fig. 13). In our case, the Raspberry Pi and Microcontroller are
    compatible with serial communication, which makes it easier to share data processes
    between them. These two devices are perfectly synchronized. The Raspberry Pi Zero
    W sends a JSON package to the Phenotyping Platform with the data of each prototype
    using the MQTT protocol at each interval time previously defined. Fig. 13 Prototype
    communication flow Full size image Another important aspect of how to increase
    the communication quality for each LysipheN unit was the direct SPI connection
    between Raspberry Pi Zero W and the microcontroller. This allows the user to change
    the programming routine in both devices at any time and gives the possibility
    to add or change sensors and actuators in the future. Microcontroller programming
    routine A working program was written in C++ language to establish the main routine
    of the device that will collect data from all sensors (Fig. 14). This program
    code considers the working requirements of each sensor. Fig. 14 Microcontroller
    programming routine Full size image First, the program will load whole libraries
    and initial parameters to read the traits of the sensors’ signal data. Then, the
    user can choose in the Raspberry Pi Zero W application (see “Raspberry application’s
    user interface programming”) whether the weight temperature calibration will begin
    or not. If yes, this process will take 1 or 2 days depending on the required quality
    of the calibration. If not, the program will assign the parameters obtained during
    the last calibration to the weighing process which can then start immediately.
    If a data request arrives from Raspberry Pi Zero W, all sensors’ data are read
    and packaged in a JSON message, and it is sent to Pi Zero. Then, Atmega328p and
    the sensors are electrically disconnected for a previously defined time. Raspberry
    application’s user interface programming Every single unit was equipped with its
    user web application (Fig. 15). The role of the Raspberry Pi Zero W is to run
    the main application that uses a Node-Red programming environment, which is based
    on visual Programming through node connection and allows writing functions, Raspberry’s
    GPIO uses, and communication protocols such as MQTT. The flowchart is the name
    of the routine programmed, and it begins a short time before Raspberry starts.
    Fig. 15 Application interface with real-time data during the calibration process.
    Left to right; the last 36 h the weight and temperatures plot; the last 30 min
    weight and temperature plot; total water; and the current amount irrigated in
    the experiment and downloading data panel Full size image The application manages:
    Correcting the microcontroller’s electrical connection/disconnection. Requesting,
    receiving, and storing data from the microcontroller. Watering for daily irrigation
    control. Plotting the real-time weight and temperature changes in a web interface
    (Fig. 15). Sending data to the Phenotyping platform (Fig. 16). Fig. 16 Individual
    prototype programming of the user application Full size image Another important
    feature related to routine programming works in “parallel.” This enables the applications
    to be pending the defined irrigation time and simultaneously request, save, and
    send the data. Thus, when the time of irrigation is reached, the application executes
    the function that supplies the water based on the parameters defined previously.
    All received data are stored automatically in the MySQL database. Then, the database
    updates a CSV file with the new information and this file is ready to be downloaded
    at any time as users require. At the same time, a new JSON package is created
    and sent using the MQTT protocol to the Mosquitto broker (phenotyping platform
    server), where data from the 10 devices were saved into the MySQL database and
    interfaced in the phenotyping application in real-time. Once the data are received
    and saved, the microcontroller state is changed to OFF again and the cycle is
    restarted depending on the sample time defined by the user previously. This not
    only saves energy and protects the system, but also helps to keep the load cell
    in the correct calibration stage. Once the sampling time is reached, the Atmega328p
    state is switched to ON and then, the application requests data using the serial
    path. Phenotyping platform The aim of the platform was to construct an IoT-based
    automation platform to monitor and control environmental conditions inside greenhouses
    [40]. This platform includes vast information from many experiments on beans (Phaseolus
    vulgaris L.) at CIAT. It was developed as an open service able to receive, store,
    and show data in real-time. In addition, the IoT platform includes the application
    developed for requesting, receiving, and storing data from the Gravimetric Units
    (ten replicas), which is a necessary complement for the phenotyping development
    described in this study (Fig. 17). Fig. 17 Phenotyping platform. Note, that it
    is possible to access to complete experiment’s location-measured data and controlled
    variables information together with prototypes’ received data in a global database
    Full size image The phenotyping platform allows a general view of the data from
    the LysipheN unit prototypes in a real-time. In addition, this tool is able to
    integrate physiological and statistical analysis useful for breeders or other
    research purposes. It is important to mention that communication between the Phenotyping
    Platform and the LysipheN is made through the internet connection since both (the
    prototype and phenotyping platform) manage the wireless connection. However, developed
    LysipheN prototypes can be used without the internet, even though Wi-Fi is only
    for real-time monitoring and initial configurations, all the previously specified
    prototypes’ functionalities were programmed to work with only an electrical source.

    support multi-crop usage in different environments. Fig. 18 3D printed prototype

  main_objective: To develop and test a low-cost, automated prototype system for monitoring
    plant water use and transmitting data wirelessly.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is moderately relevant to my point about using
    advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection because
    it describes a prototype system that integrates multiple sensors to monitor plant
    water use and transmit data wirelessly. While the study does not explicitly focus
    on non-invasive plant stress detection, the system could potentially be used for
    this purpose by integrating appropriate sensors.

  description: Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) is an important parameter
    in the plant photosynthesis process, which can relate to plant growth, crop water
    use, and leaf gas exchange. Previously, many researchers utilized commercially
    available sensors to monitor PAR. The high cost of the commercially available
    PAR sensors has limited researchers, agricultural professionals, and farmers to
    use and expand PAR monitoring in agricultural lands. Thus, this paper focuses
    on designing an affordable Internet of Things (IoT)-based PAR sensor monitoring
    system including 3D-printed enclosures (waterproof) for the sensors, performance
    evaluation of multiple light sensors, solar powering configuration, cloud setup,
    and cost analysis. Three sensors, including VTB8440BH photodiode, SI 1145, and
    LI-190R sensors, were evaluated. The 3D-printed waterproof enclosures were designed
    for the photodiode and SI 1145. Particle Boron was used for recording and sending
    the sensor data to the IoT webserver. Both the photodiode and SI 1145 were compared
    to LI-190R, which is the industry standard. In the calibration process, the R2
    values of the photodiode and SI 1145 with LI-190R were 0.609 and 0.961, respectively.
    Field validation data shows that SI 1145 had a strong correlation with LI-190R.
    In addition, the performance evaluation data shows the photodiode had a weaker
    correlation with LI-190R than SI 1145. In conclusion, the study successfully developed
    and designed affordable and reliable IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring systems,
    including a 3D-printed housing, hardware, programming, and IoT website. SI 1145
    with a glass filter is an alternative sensor to monitor PAR at a low cost and
    has the advantage of being connected to IoT microcontrollers.

    Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) is an important parameter in the plant
    photosynthesis process, which can relate to plant growth, crop water use, and

    multiple light sensors, solar powering configuration, cloud setup, and cost analysis.
    Three sensors, including VTB8440BH photodiode, SI 1145, and LI-190R sensors, were
    evaluated. The 3D-printed waterproof enclosures were designed for the photodiode
    and SI 1145. Particle Boron was used for recording and sending the sensor data
    to the IoT webserver. Both the photodiode and SI 1145 were compared to LI-190R,
    which is the industry standard. In the calibration process, the R2 values of the

    the performance evaluation data shows the photodiode had a weaker correlation

    designed affordable and reliable IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring systems, including

    filter is an alternative sensor to monitor PAR at a low cost and has the advantage
    of being connected to IoT microcontrollers. Keywords: Photosynthetically Active
    Radiation (PAR); IoT (Internet of Things); agriculture 1. Introduction Photosynthetically
    Active Radiation (PAR) describes the range of solar radiation that is used by
    organisms in the photosynthesis process. The wavelength of solar radiation in
    the PAR range is 400–700 nm. PAR measurement is important, as solar radiation
    is one of the main components determining plant photosynthesis. When leaf photosynthesis
    increases, PAR increases [1]. Standard commercially available PAR sensors include
    LI-190R (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) and Apogee SQ-500 (Apogee Instruments,
    Inc., Logan, UT, USA). In the past, PAR sensors have been used in various research,
    such as measuring the amount of light above and below the canopy of wheat [2];
    monitoring light in vertical farming for strawberry production [3]; measuring
    and controlling a lighting system for energy efficient crop production [4]; parameterizing
    evapotranspiration rates across a field of asparagus [5]; assessing the effects
    of full sun, medium light intensity, and vegetation shade on diverse species of
    plants [6]; and understanding the effect of PAR on the exchange of CO2, water,
    and energy between plants and their environment [7]. An example of using a PAR
    sensor is estimating the growth of soybeans. Soybeans, a known photosensitive
    crop, have been used to test PAR levels in accordance with simulated surface dimming,
    a way to decrease photosynthetically active radiation. A study within the Journal
    of Agrometeorology took three genomes of soybeans and tested their response to
    altered PAR levels via a custom shading net [8]. The study was done to find the
    best way to decrease PAR levels, which they tested using a Line quantum sensor
    (LI-191S, LICOR). Even though it has been stated that climate change will not
    have a major impact on PAR levels [9], it can be predicted that levels will change.
    These changes, however, are more impacted by local environmental factors, with
    its main parameter being water vapor pressure. Excessive gas emissions can also
    cause PAR levels to lower due to an increase in particulate matter in the atmosphere
    [9], thus absorbing more PAR prior to reaching the Earth’s surface. The cost of
    the standard PAR sensor is between 400–500 USD, and the datalogging system cost
    ranges from 500–2300 USD. This high cost of the commercial version of the PAR
    monitoring systems, including a PAR sensor and a datalogger, limits access for
    researchers, farmers, and agricultural professionals. This motivates the development
    of a low-cost version of a PAR monitoring system. The presentation of a low-cost,
    low-profile Photosynthetic Active Radiation sensor that was developed by Purdue
    University was first introduced at the ISCAS conference in Spain [10]. This sensor’s
    composition includes a silicon photodiode, a 400 to 700 nm optical filter, an
    optical diffuser, and a current-to-voltage conversion circuit. The translucent
    material of the diffuser disperses incoming light, which results in angle dependence.
    To amend this occurrence, the light diffuser uses a cosine corrector. There are
    various commercially available PAR quantum sensors, such as the LI-190R. While
    these sensors are very precise and well-calibrated, they are quite costly. Seated
    in the USD 300–400 price range, this does not include the corresponding meter
    required to display the output. Meanwhile, this newly developed low-cost PAR sensor
    has a total cost of half the amount: 111.83 USD.Light intensity is the factor
    contributing to the level of error displayed by this sensor. For the highest accuracy,
    light intensity must be at maximum intensity. Similar to the sensor developed
    by Purdue University, the GaAsP sensor has a sensor head and body that includes
    a photodiode and an acrylic diffuser that protects the photodiode. This provides
    cosine correction, like the sensor developed by Purdue University. Also, this
    sensor comprises an aluminum tube, a drainage hole, and an acrylic body located
    below the diffuser bonded via methylene chloride. For quick connection and disconnection
    for calibration and repair in a field setting, the sensor was designed with 40–50
    cm of multi-stranded communication wire. The GaAsP does have some sources of error,
    including spatial error, temperature dependence error, spectral response error,
    and signal drift error. Spatial error is the main source of errors, but it can
    be minimized if both the diffuser and photodiode are level with the outer rim
    of the sensor. Temperature dependence error occurs when temperatures reach levels
    above 15 °C, at a 3% margin. Previously, researchers developed an inexpensive
    datalogging system and connected it to a commercial version of a PAR sensor. For
    example, Barnard et al. (2014) utilized an Arduino microcontroller (Arduino, Turin,
    Italy) as a datalogger to read an LI-190 [11]. Harun et al. (2015) used an ATMEGA628
    microcontroller (Microchip, Chandler, AZ, USA) to read an LI-190 [12]. An inexpensive
    data logging system with a commercial version of a PAR sensor still costs around
    700 USD [11]. Other studies have developed a low-cost PAR sensor using a photodiode.
    For instance, the Vishay BPW34 photodiode (Vishay, Malvern, PA, USA) was used
    to measure PAR [13]. This design used a silicon photodiode, a diffuser, and an
    optical filter. This study found that the sensor measured PAR well at high light
    intensities, but had a larger error at lower light intensities. Pontailler (1990)
    also used a gallium arsenide photodiode to measure PAR [14]. This design did not
    use a filter, only the photodiode and a diffuser. The results show a good correlation
    with the LI-190 PAR sensor, but it overestimated by about 23% when measuring monochromatic
    light, which is in the wavelength range of 570–620 nm, one example of light that
    produces this wavelength range is sodium lamps. The University of England carried
    out a case study centered around triticale, where the methodology for measuring
    the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) using both
    active optical and linear irradiance sensors was described [15]. This measure
    of PAR is an important aspect of plant biomass production and plant growth modeling.
    The linear irradiance sensor newly created by Spectrum Technologies was studied
    and applied to agriculture through the crop triticale. The conclusion of this
    study emphasized the importance of sensor placement and solar illumination conditions.
    The linear quantum bar sensor was used to measure soil and canopy PAR (Rs and
    Rcs) but needed to be positioned at least 40 cm above the intended surface. It
    was explained that the linear quantum bar could achieve temporally stable readings
    within an elevation of 5° of solar noon. Also recommended was orienting the linear
    quantum sensor across rows to reduce measurement variance. There have also been
    methods to measure PAR using leaf area index measuring tools. Located in West
    Africa, a study focusing on millet crop and shrub fallow used this method for
    estimating the Intercepted PAR (IPAR). The Li-Coy LAI-2000 hemispherical radiation
    sensor is a sensor originally intended to estimate the canopy leaf area index.
    The LAI provides both canopy structure and angular information, allowing for a
    more efficient manner to measure these values compared to traditional methods.
    These methods allowed for a successful simulation of both instantaneous and daily
    IPAR. Results showed that a reasonable degree of accuracy can be achieved by using
    the LAI-2000. A noteworthy mention explains that both clear and cloudy days lead
    to increased errors [16]. Previous research shows an improvement in the design
    and development of a PAR sensor monitoring system is needed. As technology has
    developed, the IoT (Internet of Things) allows for connecting, monitoring, and
    controlling devices in real-time at a low cost [17]. Examples of many different
    applications for IoT have been implemented by growers in various countries for
    increased efficiency. Increased cost efficiency, energy efficiency, and work efficiency
    are all areas of benefit when utilizing the IoT in agriculture. Data transmission
    efficiency was studied in a review by Xu et al. (2022) on different methods for
    data transmission for the IoT in agriculture [18]. Various tradeoffs exist in
    terms of IoT data-sharing systems. These include Wi-Fi, LoRa, Bluetooth, and WAN
    wireless; these systems are readily available for implementation depending on
    the needs of the producer [18]. This exemplifies the customization that IoT has
    to offer the industry as well as academia to outfit a system to the exact specifications
    needed. An increase in customization and optimization undoubtedly increases the
    user experience as well as ensures that each system is only using what is needed
    for a given project. An example of this was the ZigBee WSN (wireless sensor network)
    optimized for medium-range usage within a large greenhouse space for humidity
    and fan monitoring using nodes [19]. This system utilized in the study demonstrates
    the basics of how an IoT network can store data and, furthermore, allows for it
    to be transported to the correct location. In addition to ZigBee, LoRa and Wi-Fi
    are also utilized to transfer the data and signals to drive actuators at a low
    cost [20]. Emerging communication technologies, including 5G and NB-IoT (narrow-band
    IoT), have started to be implemented in precision agriculture [21]. By 2026, the
    IoT market is expected to achieve an evaluation of USD 13 billion [22]. While
    the costs of the IoT for usage in precision farming may increase growers’ operating
    costs, the savings generated from time usage efficiency negate upfront costs.
    For example, in 2022, a system to monitor indoor environment data using IoT and
    open-source software was able to see a cost reduction from 230,000 USD to 5000
    USD for a 9290 m2 building using a traditional BAS (Building Assessment System),
    establishing a cost-effective, scalable, and portable IoT data infrastructure
    for indoor environment sensing named BDL (Building Data Lite) [23]. By creating
    a cost-effective system for IoT data measurement, the design team was able to
    save thousands of dollars on a monitoring system. The usage of open-source software
    should be noted also as this is becoming an increasingly popular method to drive
    down costs and increase system sharing [24]. IoT creations and optimizations are
    changing the operating landscape in which humans monitor the world. By creating
    systems that are more cost-effective, saleable, and connect more seamlessly, a
    natural trend of increasing profits will follow, barring no other unforeseen circumstances.
    As the cost of the IoT system decreases, the IoT technology has been utilized
    in many applications in agriculture, including plant disease prediction, frost
    protection, and irrigation scheduling [25,26]. This led to an increase in crop
    yields and quality [12,27,28]. The use of IoT technology in agriculture is expected
    to increase further as other previous studies have demonstrated its benefits in
    helping stakeholders make timely and informed decisions [29]. Over the years,
    many open-source photodiodes and light sensors have been developed. However, the
    evaluation and their potential use for PAR monitoring with a glass-cut filter
    have not been demonstrated. Moreover, making the PAR data more accessible through
    the IoT has not been well executed. Thus, the purpose of this paper focuses on
    the design and development of an affordable IoT-based PAR monitoring system, including
    3D-printed enclosures (waterproof) for the sensors, performance evaluation of
    each sensor, solar powering configuration, cloud setup, and cost. This affordable
    IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring system will make the PAR measurements more accessible
    to researchers, farmers, agricultural industries, and environmental scientists.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. PAR Sensors Three sensors were evaluated: an Excelitas
    Technologies VTB8440BH photodiode (Waltham, MA, USA); an Adafruit SI 1145 Digital
    UV Index, IR, and Visible Light Sensor (New York, NY, USA); and LI-190R PAR sensor
    (Lincoln, NE, USA). The LI-190R outputs millivolts but can be converted to μmol
    m−2 s−1 using Equation (1), which was referred to by LI-Cor Biosciences technical
    document. LI-190R has a spectral range of 400–700 nm. The VTB8440BH photodiode
    has a spectral range of 330–720 nm and a viewing angle of 100°. The SI 1145 has
    an IR and a visible light sensor; the IR sensor has a spectral range of 550–1000
    nm, and the visible light sensor has a spectral range of 400–800 nm. In this study,
    the visible light sensor of SI 1145 was used because it has a spectral range closer
    to that of PAR (400–700 nm). 𝑃𝐴𝑅= 𝑉 𝑜𝑢𝑡 ∗240.33 (1) where PAR is the PAR reading
    in μmol m−2 s−1, and Vout is the output from the LI-190R in mV. 2.2. Hardware
    Design For the photodiode and the LI-190R circuit, an Adafruit ADS 1115 analog-to-digital
    converter (New York, NY, USA) was used to read the sensor values in 16 bits, which
    allows for higher resolution measurement. A differential reading was used for
    each measurement, which takes a reading using two pins from each sensor. The circuit
    was controlled by a Particle Boron (San Francisco, CA, USA) microcontroller [30],
    and it has an embedded 4G LTE cell modem to send the data to the IoT cloud web
    server. I2C communication in Boron was utilized to connect it with ADS 1115 and
    SI 1145. Particle Boron 4G LTE was selected in this study due to the availability
    of the device, but any other microcontrollers with 4G or 5G technology can also
    be utilized for data logging. Both the photodiode and the SI 1145 are sensitive
    to light outside of the PAR spectral range. Thus, an optical UV AR IR glass-cut
    filter (Gzikai, Guangzhou, China) was used to filter out light outside of PAR
    spectral range. The optical glass-cut filter allows light between 415 nm and 655
    nm to pass through (Figure 1). The filter has a diameter of 6.5 mm and is 1 mm
    thick. The filters used in this design were 5 USD. A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
    sheet (CGjiogujio, Nanjing, China) was used to diffuse the light entering the
    glass filter and sensor. The sheet is 2 mm thick, and a 7 mm circular section
    was cut using a cork borer. The PTFE sheet sits directly on top of the glass filter,
    and there is a 2 mm gap between the glass filter and the light sensor for both
    the photodiode and the SI 1145. A layout of the sensor, a glass filter, and a
    PTFE sheet is shown in Figure 2. Figure 1. Light penetration of the UV AR IR glass-cut
    filter. Figure 2. Diagram of the layout of the PTFE sheet and glass filter for
    the photodiode and SI1145. An enclosure was designed and 3D-printed for the photodiode
    and the SI 1145. The design was made using Thinkercad (Autodesk Inc., San Francisco,
    CA, USA) software and printed with the MakerBot Replicator 2 3D printer (New York,
    NY, USA). The enclosure consists of two pieces: one piece allows for the glass
    filter and PTFE sheet to be set in place and has a cut-out for either the photodiode
    or the SI 1145. The other piece is a plate that attaches four bolts and nuts.
    The pieces were printed using polylactic acid (PLA). The groove of the enclosure
    allows the use of a cable tie to mount the enclosure to a pipe or a post. The
    enclosure was made waterproof by using a clear silicone caulk at each of the openings.
    The drawing for the enclosure is shown in Figure 3 and printed enclosure is shown
    in Figure 4. Figure 3. Enclosure design. (A): Outside of the enclosure. (B): Bottom
    plate of the enclosure. (C): Inside of the enclosure for the photodiode. (D):
    Inside of the enclosure for SI 1145. (E): Cross-section of enclosure for the photodiode.
    (F): Cross-section of enclosure for the SI 1145. Figure 4. 3D-printed housing
    for SI 1145 and photodiode. To use the PAR sensor monitoring system (Particle
    Boron and PAR sensor) in outdoor conditions, a lead–acid 12 V 7 Ah battery, a
    solar charge controller, and a 12 V 20 W solar panel were used to power the devices.
    An IP67 waterproof enclosure (290 × 190 × 140 mm) was used to house Boron, solar
    charge controller, and a lead–acid 12 V 7 Ah battery. Overall diagram of the affordable
    PAR sensor monitoring system is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. System diagram of
    the IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring system. 2.3. IoT and Program Design The three
    sensors were connected to Particle Boron to measure, record, and send the values
    to Ubidots IoT webserver [31]. Sensor data is stored on Ubidots as raw variables.
    Synthetic variable function on Ubidots allows users to enter equations to solve
    mathematical problems on the cloud. The instructions of functions are provided
    on Ubidots manual. This synthetic variable function was used to enter each developed
    calibration equation for photodiode and SI 1145 in Ubidots to calculate the estimated
    radiation values. Ubidots allow storing the data for up to 2 years. The dashboard
    on the website allows user to display the data in an easy-to-understand and effective
    way (Figure 6). The data is updated every 10 min and allows real-time data monitoring.
    The 10 min time interval was chosen to minimize battery loss. When the sensors
    were not reading, the 4G modem module was deactivated. The flow of the microcontroller
    programming is shown in Figure 7. In the program, the Boron only connects with
    the cell tower when it sends the value to Ubidots. This allows for saving data
    usage and battery. For each sensor, 100 samples were taken with a 100-millisecond
    delay from each measurement, and then the average was recorded. Figure 6. Screenshot
    of the IoT web server that displays data and shares with users. Figure 7. Flow
    of the microcontroller program. 2.4. Sensor Calibration The sensors were compared
    using a full-spectrum light-intensity controllable 1000 W LED grow light (Viparspectra,
    Richmond, CA, USA). This experiment was conducted in a controlled environment.
    The three sensors were all placed 12.5 cm from the light and were taking readings
    simultaneously. The intensity of the light was increased at different intervals
    ranging from off to maximum intensity. The reading from each of the sensors was
    recorded at each of these intervals and compared. 2.5. Sensor Evaluation in Outdoor
    Environments Three sensors, LI-190R, photodiode, and SI 1145, were installed outside
    at Michigan State University Campus, East Lansing, MI, USA. The sensors were at
    a height of 203 cm and mounted on a 5.08 cm diameter PVC pipe with a cable tie.
    There were no obstructions affecting the path from sunlight to each sensor. A
    12 V 20 W solar panel and a solar charge controller were used to charge a lead–acid
    12 V 7 Ah battery. Particle boron was powered through the micro-USB port. Each
    sensor data was collected every 10 min and sent to the Ubidots webserver. 2.6.
    Statistical Analysis To evaluate the performance of the proposed affordable PAR
    sensor designs, the measurements were compared against the LI-190R PAR sensor.
    Statistical analysis was performed using root mean squared error (RMSE), index
    of agreement (IA), mean bias error (MBE), and coefficient of determination (R2),
    and used Microsoft Excel for calculation. RMSE measures the difference between
    the measured and predicted value and is defined in Equation (2), IA is defined
    in Equation (3), and MBE is defined in Equation (4). RMSE= 1 N ∑ N i=1 ( M i −
    P i ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (2) IA=1− ∑ N i=1 ( M i − P i ) 2 ∑

    ∑ N i=1 (P i − M i ) (4) where N is sample size; M is measured value; P is predicted
    value; and M         is average measured value. 3. Results and Discussion
    3.1. Sensor Calibration Figure 8 shows the comparison of the photodiode’s output
    and LI-190R. The relationship was exponential and the R2 was 0.609. Figure 9 shows
    the comparison of the SI 1145′s output and LI-190R. The relationship was fitted
    with 2nd order polynomial, and the R2 was 0.961. This result shows a strong correlation
    between LI-190R and SI 1145. This correlation for the SI 1145 is comparable to
    that of Rocha et al. (2021), who obtained R2 values of 0.962 and 0.958 when compared
    to solar radiation for two prototypes of the PAR sensor using a photodiode [13].
    Fielder et al. (2000) achieved an R2 value of 0.999 when comparing their photodiode
    to a LI-190 quantum sensor [32]. Figure 8. Comparison of photodiode with LI-190R
    from the calibration process. Figure 9. Comparison of SI 1145 with LI-190R from
    the calibration process. 3.2. Sensor Evaluation in Outdoor Environments Figure
    10 shows the comparison of LI-190R, SI 1145, and photodiode data in the outdoor
    environment. Table 1 shows the results of the statistical analysis for comparing
    the SI 1145 and the photodiode measurements to the LI-190R values. The statistical
    analysis indicates that SI 1145 was overestimated by 3.564 μmol  m −2  s −1 based
    on MBE. These errors are relatively small compared to the range measured throughout
    the day, which can be from zero to up to 1700 μmol  m −2  s −1 . The photodiode
    had an underestimate for MBE of −31.399 μmol  m −2  s −1 . The SI 1145 had a much
    higher IA value (0.989) than the photodiode (0.834). The IA of the SI1145 is comparable
    to that of a study conducted by Rocha et al. (2021), which obtained an IA of 0.953
    and 0.950 for the two prototypes of PAR sensors using photodiodes [13]. Figure

    Table 1. Statistical analysis results. 3.3. Cost The goal of this design is to
    be less expensive than a PAR sensor monitoring system currently available on the
    market. The components used in the design are low-cost and easily obtainable,
    making the overall design easy to replicate. Table 2 lists each component necessary
    to replicate the system for the SI 1145, photodiode, and LI-190R, respectively.
    The cost to build a PAR sensor monitoring system with SI 1145 and the photodiode
    is 202 and 207 USD, respectively. This is less expensive than using a microcontroller
    to read a commercial PAR sensor like the LI-190R. For example, the design outlined
    by Barnard et al. (2014), using an Arduino microcontroller with an LI-190 sensor,
    costs 685 USD [11]. Table 2. Material Cost for Power, LI-190R, SI 1145, and Photodiode
    System. The cost is comparable to other studies using a microcontroller and a
    photodiode to measure PAR. The cost of a system utilizing the ESP8266 microcontroller
    is estimated at 200 USD [13]. The advantage of the design outlined in this paper
    is the ability to deploy the sensor anywhere as it uses a 4G LTE cell tower instead
    of Wi-Fi that ESP8266 uses. A cellular module can be added to the ESP8266 to utilize
    3G or 4G technologies, but the total costs, usability, and complexity of the additional
    module are not justified compared to the proposed system. 4. Conclusions The study
    successfully compared both the photodiode (VTB8440BH) and SI 1145 with LI-190R.
    The performance of SI 1145 had a strong correlation (R2 = 0.961) with LI-190R.
    However, the photodiode had a weaker correlation with LI-190R (R2 = 0.609). This
    study successfully designed affordable and reliable IoT-based PAR sensor monitoring
    systems, including a 3D-printed housing, hardware, programming, and IoT website.
    The cost of building the SI 1145 was about 20% of the cost of building a monitoring
    system using the LI-190R sensor. Considering a similar performance between SI
    1145 and LI-190R (IA = 0.989, MBE = 3.564), an SI 1145 with an optical UV AR IR
    glass-cut filter would be the alternative way to monitor PAR. Because of this
    affordable PAR sensor, researchers, farmers, agricultural industries, foresters,
    and environmental scientists may use more PAR sensors for plant/tree growth prediction,
    water uptake estimation, irrigation management, etc. Recent studies show that
    PAR measurement has been utilized in indoor farming [33] and irrigation scheduling
    [34]. Soybeans are known as photosensitive crops; the accurate prediction of the
    growth stages of a soybean will enable precision irrigation scheduling, which
    will improve crop production and irrigation water use efficiency. Incorporation
    of PAR data with other field monitoring data, such as soil moisture monitoring
    [27] and SAP flow [35], for irrigation scheduling is recommended for future study.
    More applications of the developed affordable IoT-based PAR sensor in other agricultural
    systems, such as animal production, aquaculture, and high tunnel, should also
    be explored. Further studies assessing different photodiodes to monitor their
    capability to measure PAR should be performed and compared to this proposed design.

    03 December 2022 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in
    Brazil began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of
    savanna with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques
    for improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence

    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t

    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed
    RNNs and GRUs to identify patterns and trends in soil health indicators as indicated
    in Fig. 6. Figure 6 Agriculture land setup for testing soil fertility. (a) Agricultural

    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

    December 2013   Published: 13 January 2014 Abstract Crop canopy temperature (Tc)
    is coupled with transpiration, which is a function of soil and atmospheric conditions
    and plant water status. Thus, Tc has been identified as a real-time, plant-based
    tool for crop water stress detection. Such plant-based methods theoretically integrate
    the water status of both the plant and its environment. However, previous studies
    have highlighted the limitations and difficulty of interpreting the Tc response
    to plant and soil water stress. This study investigates the links between cotton
    Tc, established measures of plant water relations and atmospheric vapour pressure
    deficit (VPDa). Concurrent measures of carbon assimilation (A), stomatal conductance
    (gs), leaf water potential (Ψl), soil water (fraction of transpirable soil water
    (FTSW)) and Tc were conducted in surface drip irrigated cotton over two growing
    seasons. Associations between A, gs, Ψl, FTSW and Tc are presented, which are
    significantly improved with the inclusion of VPDa. It was concluded that utilising
    the strong associations between Ψl, VPDa and Tc, an adjustment of 1.8°C for each
    unit of VPDa should be made to the critical Tc for irrigation. This will improve
    the precision of irrigation in Tc based irrigation scheduling protocols. Improved
    accuracy in water stress detection with Tc, and an understanding of the interaction
    the environment plays in this response, can potentially improve the efficiency
    of irrigation. Additional keywords: cotton, gas exchange, Gossypium hirsutum,

    \ plant dis-\nease and plant stress are a current challenge in agricul-\nture\
    \ [4, 5]. Standard existing methods of detection often \nrely on crop agronomists\
    \ manually checking the crop \nfor indicator signs that are already visible. Depending\
    \ on \nthe type of crop and the size of the crop area–which for \nmany commercial\
    \ crops is often very large–this method \nof monitoring plant health is both time\
    \ consuming and \ndemanding. Manual detection also relies on the dis-\nease or\
    \ stress exhibiting clearly visible symptoms, which \nfrequently manifest at middle\
    \ to late stages of infec-\ntion. Identification of the causal agent is through\
    \ either \nmanual detection or diagnostic tests [6]. Diseases usu-\nally start\
    \ in a small region on the foliage (e.g. Septoria \ntritici blotch (STB) of wheat\
    \ caused by the fungal patho-\ngen, Mycosphaerella graminicola; Apple scab caused\
    \ by \nVenturia inaequalis), which can be difficult to detect by \nvisual inspection\
    \ if the crop is large; however, the ability \nto identify the disease at this\
    \ early stage would provide \nan opportunity for early intervention to control,\
    \ pre-\nvent spread of infection, or change crop management \npractices before\
    \ the whole crop is infected or damaged. \nIdentifying crop areas affected by\
    \ disease could also \nlead to targeted application of chemicals. Such precision\
    \ \napproaches would result in the reduction of pesticide and \nherbicide usage,\
    \ with subsequent beneficial impact for \nthe environment, ecosystem services,\
    \ grower finances \nand the end consumer. Hence, there is a keen interest in \n\
    the agricultural and horticultural sector to replace this \nlargely manual process\
    \ with more automated, objec-\ntive, and sensitive approaches. Mahlein has discussed\
    \ \nthe literature on plant disease detection by imaging sen-\nsors. This includes\
    \ RGB, Multi spectral, Hyperspectral, \nthermal, Chlorophyll Fluorescence and\
    \ 3D sensors. One \nconclusion is that RGB and hyperspectral imaging are \npreferable\
    \ for identifying specific diseases [7].\nTo improve crop management and plant\
    \ health, sev-\neral avenues of research are focussing on the identifica-\ntion\
    \ of the onset of adverse stresses, ideally before visible \nsigns are present.\

    \ in a recent review by \nSingh et  al. [8] which examines machine learning for\
    \ \nstress phenotyping, exploring literature on high through-\nput phenotyping\
    \ for stress identification, classification, \nquantification and prediction using\
    \ different sensors.\nImage analysis as a research field represents a host of\
    \ \ncomputational techniques which are able to extract infor-\nmation from digital\
    \ images. From a practical point of \nview, this means automatic processing of\
    \ carefully cap-\ntured images to produce a dataset of desired measure-\nments\
    \ from the images. The images themselves can come \nfrom a variety of sources,\
    \ from colour digital cameras or \nsmartphones, to more specialist cameras designed\
    \ to cap-\nture a variety of different information in the images. One \nsuch technological\
    \ advance here is hyperspectral imag-\ning, where cameras capture more than the\
    \ usual three \nbands of coloured light found in traditional digital imag-\ning.\
    \ This review will specifically focus on the subsequent \nanalysis approach known\
    \ as hyperspectral image analy-\nsis. This approach has recently become financially\
    \ acces-\nsible to a wide variety of users, due to falling technology \ncosts.\
    \ Analysis approaches are being developed which \nare enabling the Hyperspectral\
    \ imaging technologies to \nbe utilised for wider ranging applications. Hyperspectral\
    \ \nimaging uses high-fidelity colour reflectance information \nover a large range\
    \ of the light spectrum (beyond that of \nhuman vision), and thus has potential\
    \ for identifying sub-\ntle changes in plant growth and development.\nIn this\
    \ review, we provide an overview of hyperspec-\ntral imaging, and how it can be\
    \ utilised in laboratory and \nfield applications for the categorisation and recognition\
    \ \nof early stages of plant foliar disease and stress. Starting \nwith the background\
    \ theory and an overview of Hyper-\nspectral imaging technology, we then consider\
    \ some \nareas of application of the approach to plant and crop sci-\nences. Finally,\
    \ we discuss some practical concerns with \nthese approaches; an important aspect,\
    \ as such cameras \nare not yet typically provided as a turnkey solution for \n\
    crop monitoring, so care must be taken to collect satis-\nfactory data and provide\
    \ meaningful analysis and inter-\npretation before deployment of these technologies\
    \ can be \nimplemented in a commercial setting.\nColour digital imaging\nIn order\
    \ to understand the hyperspectral technology \nitself, it will be helpful to first\
    \ consider what a stand-\nard, non-hyperspectral colour digital image comprises.\
    \ \nWavelengths of light correspond to colour, with blue light \nhaving a central\
    \ wavelength of approximately 475  nm, \ngreen light 520  nm, and red light 650 \
    \ nm. A colour \nimage represents a composition of three broad wave-\nlength bands,\
    \ red, green and blue. Our eyes contain three \ntypes of cones, sensitive to blue,\
    \ green and red parts of \nthe spectrum, the cones each have a colour range and\
    \ \nthey are stimulated either strongly or weakly depending \non the light wavelengths\
    \ emitted. Combining the infor-\nmation from the three different kinds of cones\
    \ we recre-\nate a colour image in our brain. A digital image tries to \nemulate\
    \ the sensitivity of the cones, and a pixel stores the \nintegrated intensity\
    \ of either the blue, green, or red part \nof the light spectrum, dependant on\
    \ the filter type placed \nin front of the pixel.\nThe range of light captured\
    \ in a hyperspectral system \ncan also vary. The colour visible to the human eye\
    \ is a \nsmall range on the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging \nfrom 400 to 700 nm\
    \ (Fig. 1). The section of the spectrum \nthat is typically used for hyperspectral\
    \ imaging of plants \nranges from ultraviolet (UV) (starting at ~ 250 nm) up to\
    \ \nshort-wave infrared (SWIR, ~ 2500 nm). Cameras usually \ncapture a certain\
    \ sub-range, such as the visible and near \ninfrared range (VIS–NIR, 400–1300 \
    \ nm) or the SWIR \n(1300–2500  nm) or UV (250–400  nm) with the ranges \nbeing\
    \ combined in some sensors to increase the coverage \nof the spectrum.\nA colour\
    \ image, then, is an example of a 3-band multi-\nspectral image, where each band\
    \ records one of the three \ncolours, red, green and blue. It is common to have\
    \ more \nbands in a true multispectral image, perhaps sampling \nlight in the\
    \ infrared region of the spectrum too—that \nis, light with a wavelength over\
    \ 700  nm. Hyperspectral \nimages on the other hand typically contain hundreds\
    \ of \ncontiguous narrow wavelength bands over a spectral \nrange. The approach\
    \ produces a dense, information-rich \ncolour dataset, with enough spatial resolution\
    \ to have \nmany hundreds of data points (pixels) per leaf.\nFor plants and vegetation\
    \ the most useful wavelength \nranges to analyse are the visible range combined\
    \ with \nnear infrared range. This wavelength range can capture \nchanges in the\
    \ leaf pigmentation (400–700  nm) and \nmesophyll cell structure (700–1300 nm)\
    \ however to see \nchanges in the water content of a plant, extended ranges \n\
    are needed (1300–2500 nm) [9]. Severe dehydration, for \nexample, can affect the\
    \ leaf mesophyll structure which \nrelates to changes in the near infrared reflectance;\
    \ how-\never, minor drought stress does not usually have enough \nof an effect\
    \ to be detected [10].\nHyperspectral imaging technology\nThere are various hardware\
    \ approaches behind hyper-\nspectral imaging spectrometers, which means there\
    \ are \ndifferent ways that the image is captured. Examples of \noperation include\
    \ push broom, filter wheel, liquid crystal \ntunable filters amongst others [11].\
    \ In one example using \npush broom, the incoming light passes through a convex\
    \ \ngrating (or a prism) which separates the light into narrow \nwavelengths.\
    \ This separation is then recorded on a light \nPage 3 of 12\nLowe et al. Plant\
    \ Methods  (2017) 13:80 \nsensitive chip (similar to a standard digital camera).\
    \ A \npush broom device, has three components; the camera, a \nspectrometer and\
    \ a lens. This system simultaneously cap-\ntures a single spatial line of the\
    \ image, and the whole col-\nour spectrum range. Then the camera or object is\
    \ moved \nand the next line is captured (the broom is ‘pushed’ for-\nwards, hence\
    \ the name), effectively making the camera a \nline scanner, with the final image\
    \ being built up after the \nfull scan is complete. An alternative to push broom\
    \ is a \nsnapshot approach, where the entire image is captured \nat once. To date,\
    \ push broom technology has seen the \nmost use, but recent advances in snapshot\
    \ technology are \nincreasing the uptake and possibilities related to pheno-\n\
    typing and analysis.\nIn the rest of this review, we consider applications of\
    \ \nthe hyperspectral imaging technology and analysis, and \nhave categorised\
    \ the review into the following four sec-\ntions: (1) existing vegetation and\
    \ disease indices; (2) \napplications for the detection and classification of\
    \ healthy \nand diseased plants with disease classification; (3) quan-\ntifying\
    \ severity of disease; and (4) early stage detection of \nstress symptoms.\nWithin\
    \ these sections, we will consider both labora-\ntory-based imaging approaches,\
    \ and field-based remote \nsensing. As well as the obvious biological differences,\
    \ it \nis worth considering the impact of these environments \non the hyperspectral\
    \ image data itself. Laboratory-\nbased imaging occurs in a controlled environment\
    \ which \nincludes artificial light. Outdoor remote sensing data \nis often dependant\
    \ on ambient illumination, although \nthere are examples of systems using controlled\
    \ lighting \nfor outdoor hyperspectral imaging [12]. Using natural \nillumination,\
    \ namely the sun, means recognising that \nthere are atmospheric effects such\
    \ as the absorption and \nscattering of light. Other environmental factors that\
    \ can \ncontribute to a change in the spectral signatures are the \ninteraction\
    \ between cloud shadows and the object’s sur-\nface, time of day, specular reflections\
    \ and the presence \nof other objects that can reflect secondary illumination\
    \ \nonto the area of interest. As many of these effects are \ntime dependant,\
    \ successful use of a calibration reference \nmeans updating the referencing whenever\
    \ ambient illu-\nmination changes—this could be minute to minute in a \nnatural\
    \ illumination scenario. With controlled lighting \nthere are still problems;\
    \ light intensity challenges exist: \nthe inverse square law states that illumination\
    \ drops off \ninversely according to distance from the light source [13]. \nThis\
    \ means that uneven illumination can occur and the \ntype of light source chosen\
    \ needs careful consideration; \nit should not have high intensity peaks throughout\
    \ the \nspectrum or across the image plane.\nAnother potential difference between\
    \ laboratory and \nfield imaging is resolution. For aerial remote sensing data,\
    \ \nthe spatial resolution is typically in the range of meters \nper pixel, which\
    \ means the pixels will usually contain \nsignatures from more than one material\
    \ [14, 15]. A first \nstep in analysing this data is to consider this multi-mate-\n\
    rial problem, whereby pixels must be considered to con-\ntain mixed materials\
    \ (called ‘mixed pixels’) [16, 17], and \na spectral unmixing process must be\
    \ applied. In other \nwords, a single pixel may contain plant and soil, and algo-\n\
    rithms must be used to determine the appropriate mix. \nFig. 1 Electromagnetic\
    \ spectrum with the lower bar displaying visible and infra-red light\nPage 4 of\
    \ 12\nLowe et al. Plant Methods  (2017) 13:80 \nIn the laboratory, images can\
    \ typically be taken within \ncentimetres of the plant, and there may be many\
    \ pixels \nrepresenting even a single leaf or region of disease. In \nthese cases,\
    \ unmixing is generally not necessary.\nFurther consideration of these location-based\
    \ chal-\nlenges will be fully explored later in this review, but \nbefore we continue\
    \ let us consider why we wish to cap-\nture such hyperspectral information in\
    \ the first place.\nApplications for the detection and classification \nof healthy\
    \ and diseased plants\nIn this section, we will discuss a variety of techniques\
    \ \nused specifically for the detection of biotic stress in \nplants. Classification\
    \ techniques, that is, techniques that \nseparate the data into healthy and diseased\
    \ categories \nfor example, can be divided into two types: those that \nfocus\
    \ on a number of key wavelengths in the spectrum \nand those that use the entire\
    \ spectrum response. Further-\nmore, disease classification is discussed with\
    \ regards to \nthe identification of multiple diseases and detection of a \nspecific\
    \ disease.\nExisting vegetation and disease indices\nBefore hyperspectral imaging\
    \ devices were readily avail-\nable, researchers wishing to quantify effects based\
    \ on \ncolour information have used multispectral imaging, or \nhyperspectral,\
    \ point-source devices (such as spectroradi-\nometers which do not produce a spatial\
    \ image) to acquire \ncolour data. Hyperspectral devices do not in general \n\
    provide a point-and-click measurement. Instead, much \nonus is on the user to\
    \ develop the capture process. Once \nacquired, the resulting large numerical\
    \ datasets must be \nanalysed in order to provide useful information. A sen-\n\
    sible and simple way into such large datasets is to con-\nsider only a small number\
    \ of positions in the wavelength \nrange, looking at changes across conditions\
    \ at predeter-\nmined key points in the spectrum. Using this approach, \nwe can\
    \ also counter the effects of relative light changes by \nconsidering ratios of\
    \ data values. This involves the com-\nbination of two or more wavelengths, commonly\
    \ known \nas ‘indices’.\nTo interpret the data, a number of such indices have\
    \ \nbeen developed, through either pre-considered biologi-\ncal reasoning (e.g.\
    \ knowing that a particular wavelength \nrelates to properties in a particular\
    \ cell structure), or \ndue to limitations in the particular wavelengths avail-\n\
    able from the capture equipment (e.g. indices which are \nderived from satellite\
    \ multispectral remote sensing data \nmay only have had a limited number of wavelengths\
    \ avail-\nable). When applied to plant material, these indices are \nknown as\
    \ ‘vegetation indices’. Many different vegetation \nindices exist and each uses\
    \ a different set of wavelength \nmeasurements for describing physiological attributes\
    \ \nof vegetation, looking at either general properties of the \nplant, or at\
    \ specific parameters of its growth.\nOne of the most popular and widespread metrics\
    \ is the \nnormalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), which \nis used for\
    \ measuring the general health status of crops \n[18, 19]. It is calculated via\
    \ a simple ratio of near-IR and \nvisible light (see Table 1). NDVI has been used\
    \ for many \ndifferent purposes, for example, to detect stress caused \nby the\
    \ Sunn pest/cereal pest, Eurygaster integriceps Put. \n(Hemiptera: Scutelleridae),\
    \ in wheat [20]. Most of the \nindices are very specific and only work well with\
    \ the \ndatasets that they were designed for [21]. There are dis-\nease-centric\
    \ studies focused on creating disease indices \nfor detecting and quantifying\
    \ specific diseases [22], for \nexample, one study used leaf rust disease severity\
    \ index \n(LRDSI) with a 87–91% accuracy in detecting the leaf \nrust (Puccinia\
    \ triticina) in Wheat [23], however, to our \nknowledge, it has not been widely\
    \ tested. \nAnother commonly-used approach is to detect changes \nin the sudden\
    \ increase in reflectance at the red/near-\ninfrared border. This ‘red edge’ position\
    \ is a narrow sec-\ntion in the electromagnetic spectrum (690–740  nm) \nwhere\
    \ the visible spectrum ends and the near infrared \nstarts (Fig.  2). This section\
    \ has a large change in spec-\ntral response (derivative),for green plant material,\
    \ since \nchlorophyll strongly absorbs wavelengths up to around \n700  nm, and\
    \ hence the material has low reflectance in \nthis range, but it is strongly reflecting\
    \ the infrared (from \nabout 720 nm). Cho [24] describes a number of different\
    \ \nalgorithms that extract or detect the red edge. A disease \nindex based on\
    \ the red edge position has been used to \ndetect powdery mildew in wheat (Blumeria\
    \ graminis f. \nsp. Tritici), however it was not as accurate as Partial Least\
    \ \nSquares Regression (PLSR), a technique that uses a statis-\ntical approach\
    \ [25]. We will consider some of these statis-\ntical approaches further in this\
    \ review.\nClassification using a subset of selected wavelengths\nIn this section\
    \ we consider classification approaches that \nrely on sub sampling at particular\
    \ wavelengths from the \nfull spectrum. One difference with true multispectral\
    \ \ndata is that specific wavelengths can be manually or auto-\nmatically chosen\
    \ from anywhere in the captured range, \nwhere as multispectral data is limited\
    \ by the technology.\nAnalysis from “Background” section typically used \nindices\
    \ to calculate representative values using dis-\ncrete wavelengths at various\
    \ positions in the spectrum. \nOne such study involving a wheat field experiment\
    \ \nused normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) \nresponse to eliminate\
    \ everything except the leaves from \nthe dataset, followed by a statistical approach\
    \ called an \nANCOVA (which measures statistical covariance) to \nidentify selected\
    \ wavelength bands, and then quadratic \nPage 5 of 12\nLowe et al. Plant Methods\
    \  (2017) 13:80 \ndiscriminant analysis (QDA) to classify the spectra \nbetween\
    \ healthy and diseased leaves (yellow rust) [26]. \nThis is representative of\
    \ a typical workflow in hyperspec-\ntral analysis: isolate (or segment) the parts\
    \ of the image \nof interest, then use a mathematical technique to identify \n\
    regions of the spectra likely to have predictive power, and \nfinally use those\
    \ spatial and spectral regions to learn a \nclassification approach. Using QDA,\
    \ the overall accuracy \nreached 92% with 4 wavebands [26].\nAn example of multi\
    \ layer perceptrons (MLP) is \ndescribed in Moshou [27], who aimed to detect yellow\
    \ \nrust in field-grown wheat using a spectrograph with the \nrange 460–900 nm\
    \ and a 20 nm spectral resolution. The \nspectrograph captured the images in the\
    \ field using a \nhandheld system. Then four significant wavelengths were \nselected.\
    \ The first two wavelengths were selected using \n‘variable selection’ which involved\
    \ comparing the wave-\nlengths using stepwise discriminant analysis and using\
    \ \nthe F-test. The second pair of wavelengths uses the NDVI \nwavelengths. The\
    \ neural network used by Moshou is a \nsimple architecture with four inputs, one\
    \ hidden layer \nconsisting of ten neurons and two outputs (healthy and \ndiseased).\
    \ The architecture is determined by the number \nof inputs, a selected amount\
    \ of hidden neurons and the \namount of outputs required. Trial and error can\
    \ be used \nto determine a suitable architecture. Moshou tried differ-\nent quantities\
    \ of neurons and selected the most efficient. \nThe classification accuracy reached\
    \ using this approach \nwas 98.9% for the healthy plants and 99.4% for the dis-\n\
    eased plants.\nThe MLP approach uses a simple architecture con-\nsisting of an\
    \ input, hidden layer(s) and the output. In \nmachine learning a new, more sophisticated\
    \ approach \ncalled deep learning is becoming popular. Deep learn-\ning refers\
    \ to artificial neural networks with a structure \nthat contains a lot of layers,\

    \ the \ndata and by doing this, more complex information can be \nobtained in\
    \ later layers, and image features are automati-\ncally determined by the network.\

    use neuron activation networks as their analogous model, \nCNNs are based on retinal\
    \ fields in the vision system. \nWhatever the approach, deep learning takes longer\
    \ to \ntrain and the architecture is more complex, however, \nwith the added complexity,\
    \ very impressive classification \nand recognition rates are achievable.\nDeep\
    \ learning has been applied to the problem of plant \ndisease detection. Mohanty\
    \ [28] used CNN’s to detect \n26 diseases over 14 crop species. A dataset consisting\
    \ \nof 54,306 colour images were used, 80% for training and \n20% for testing\
    \ on AlexNet and GoogLeNet (two popular \nversions of pretrained CNN’s). The accuracy\
    \ was 97.82% \nfor AlexNet and 98.36% for GoogLeNet using colour \nimages with\
    \ training from scratch (for transfer learning \nthe values are higher, 99.27\
    \ and 99.34% respectively). \nThey selected individual leaves with a homogenous\
    \ back-\nground. If the network is tested on images under different \nconditions\
    \ from the trained images the accuracy is 31.4% \n[28]. Sladojevic also used CNN’s\
    \ to detect 13 diseases \nacross various crop plants, including Apple (powdery\
    \ \nmildew, rust), pear (leaf spot), grapevine (wilt, mites, \npowdery mildew,\
    \ downey mildew) using 30,000 images \nwith an accuracy of 96.3% using CaffeNet\
    \ [29].\nThere are currently very few complete studies apply-\ning deep learning\
    \ to hyperspectral data, though this is \nan active research area. There are several\
    \ challenges that \nneed to be addressed in order to use hyperspectral data \n\
    for deep learning. The size of the hyperspectral data \nincluding the amount of\
    \ wavelengths would require a lot \nof processing time and power it would ideally\
    \ require a \ngraphics processing unit. The amount of hyperspec-\ntral wavelengths\
    \ would most likely include noise from \nspecific wavelengths. Also there needs\
    \ to be a sufficient \namount of data for the training/testing process along \n\
    with labelled data. There is also the possibility that the \nerror will be higher\
    \ than alternative approaches.\nOther non-deep learning approaches include Yuan\
    \ [30], \nusing Fishers Linear Discriminant Analysis with remote \nsensing data\
    \ to detect yellow rust and powdery mildew \nfor a wheat crop with an overall\
    \ accuracy of 93% with \nselected wavelength ranges (531, 570–654, 685–717 nm)\
    \ \nthat are significant for detecting differences between \npowdery mildew and\
    \ yellow rust diseases in these spec-\ntral reflectance ranges, resulting from\
    \ an independent t \ntest.\nSometimes data analysis approaches are combined \n\
    with simple image processing steps in order to add fea-\nture discrimination.\
    \ A family of image processing tech-\nniques called morphological operators can\
    \ be used to \nclean up binary (black and white) images. One such \ntechnique\
    \ is called erosion, whereby the foreground of \nan object is shrunk by turning\
    \ boundary pixels into back-\nground pixels. The opposite technique is called\
    \ ‘dilation’ \nand has the effect of enlarging the foreground object’s \nboundary.\
    \ They can be used together to fill in holes, or \nremove speckle noise (depending\
    \ on the order used) in \nbinary labelled data. One approach using this method\
    \ is \na study on cucumber leaf data, in this example, this tech-\nnique has been\
    \ used to analyse a different type of mildew; \ndowny mildew (Pseudoperonospora\
    \ cubensis). first prin-\nciple component analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce\
    \ the \nsize of the data and a binary image is produced, and then \nerosion and\
    \ dilation are used in a second step to enhance \nthe disease features. The accuracy\
    \ is 90% however only 20 \nsamples were used (10 healthy and 10 infected) [31].\
    \ This \nmethod is unlikely to work as well on other hyperspectral \nimages to\
    \ detect diseases unless the leaf data is similar \nand even then the results\
    \ are uncertain.\nHyperspectral imaging can also be combined with \nmicroscopy\
    \ to capture images at a higher resolution. \nBarley with different genotypes\
    \ has been studied at the \nmicroscopic level to see if spectral differences could\
    \ be \nidentified between the genotypes. Barley leaves were also \nanalysed from\
    \ both healthy and diseased plants, which \nhad been inoculated with Powdery Mildew\
    \ (B. graminis). \nResults showed there was a difference over time between \n\
    the healthy and inoculated leaves, except for those vari-\neties containing the\
    \ mildew locus o (mlo) gene, which \nprovides plant resistance to B. graminis.\
    \ In this study, \nthe spectral range was reduced to 420–830  nm due to \nthe\
    \ noise, then normalised and smoothed with Savitzky-\nGolay filter, and then SiVM\
    \ is used to find the extreme \nspectra followed by Dirichlet aggregation regression\
    \ for \nthe leaf trace [32].\nClassification using full spectrum data\nClassification\
    \ approaches aim to divide the data into a \nnumber of distinct classes. They\
    \ originate from a fam-\nily of statistical or machine learning techniques. One\
    \ \nsuch approach is quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), \nwhich classifies\
    \ by using a covariance matrix, which com-\npares classes. The QDA method was\
    \ used in a study with \nAvocado plants, to examine the fungal disease Laurel\
    \ wilt \n(Raffaelea lauricola), using plants located both in the \nfield and glasshouse.\
    \ The QDA classification accuracy \nwas 94% [33]. It is possible of course to\
    \ use alternative \nmethods at each stage of the analysis pipeline. For exam-\n\
    ple, rather than use QDA, a decision tree approach (a \nmachine learning technique)\
    \ has been used and reached \n95% accuracy [33]. Choosing the correct approach\
    \ for the \ndata, as well as ensuring sufficient dataset size and qual-\nity,\
    \ is key. Such machine learning approaches represent \nan increasingly-common\
    \ set of classification and predic-\ntion algorithms. Machine learning approaches\
    \ train algo-\nrithms using a training dataset, with the aim of analysing \nand\
    \ predicting results from new, unseen data. Multilayer \nPage 7 of 12\nLowe et\
    \ al. Plant Methods  (2017) 13:80 \nperceptron’s (MLP) are an example of such\
    \ a technique. \nMLP’s are simple networks (called artificial neural net-\nworks)\
    \ that maps input data to an output. This process \nis based on biological understanding\
    \ of neuron activation \nnetworks where messages are fired between neurons. The\
    \ \ninput node connects to the output and it is updated using \nan activation\
    \ function and weights that can be optimised \nto produce the correct output (using\
    \ training data). This \nalgorithm requires prior knowledge (training data) there-\n\
    fore if the ‘disease spectra’ is unknown then this tech-\nnique will be unsuitable.\n\
    A third classification approach is to look at the spec-\ntral signatures by using\
    \ derivatives; this is when the \nunderlying pattern or change in data is analysed.\
    \ Second \norder (and above) derivatives are usually insensitive to \nchanges\
    \ in the illumination [15]; however they are sen-\nsitive to noise which hyperspectral\
    \ data typically suffers \nfrom, therefore ‘smoothing’ needs to be applied before\
    \ \nusing derivatives. Smoothing is a process that reduces \nthe difference between\
    \ individual pixel intensities and \nneighbouring pixels using forms of averaging\
    \ to create a \nsmoother signal. Two smoothing examples are Savitsky-\nGolay and\
    \ Gaussian filtering. Savitszky-Golay proposed \na method for smoothing noisy\
    \ data by fitting local poly-\nnomials to a sub set of the input data then evaluating\
    \ the \npolynomial at a single point to smooth the signal [34]. \nGaussian filtering\
    \ reduces noise by averaging the spec-\ntral data with a focus on the central\
    \ information using a \nGaussian-weighted kernel.\nHuang [35] tries to detect\
    \ Sclerotinia rot disease in Cel-\nery crops by using partial least squares regression\
    \ (PLSR) \nwith derivatives of first and second order. Partial least \nsquares\
    \ regression selects a small set of components. This \ntechnique is useful when\
    \ the predictors are collinear/\nhighly correlated, and it will reduce the risk\
    \ of overfit-\nting the data. The classification accuracy for Partial least \n\
    squares regression with the raw spectra is 88.92%, PLSR \nwith Savitzky-Golay\
    \ first derivative is 88.18% and PLRS \nwith second order derivative is 86.38%.\
    \ The accuracies \nare similar, with the second order derivative perform-\ning\
    \ slightly worse. Yuan [36] uses PLSR on Fisher’s linear \ndiscriminant analysis\
    \ (FLDA) to detect pest and disease \nin wheat. It produced a 60% accuracy for\
    \ aphid damage \nand a 92% accuracy for Yellow rust disease. In another \nstudy,\
    \ Zhang [37] used FLDA to detect powdery mildew \nin wheat (using a heavily damaged\
    \ leaf) with over 90% \naccuracy.\nDisease identification\nAs well as detecting\
    \ the presence of disease, another ave-\nnue of research is to distinguish between\
    \ different dis-\neases to identify specific pathogens. One such approach \nis\
    \ spectral information divergence classification. This \nmethod compares the divergence\
    \ between the observed \nspectra and a reference spectra (a library of spectra,\
    \ or \naverage spectra of interest from the data), where the \nsmaller the divergence\
    \ value then the more similar the \nspectra are, and if they are larger than a\
    \ set threshold \nthen they are not classified as the reference spectra [3]. \n\
    Spectral information divergence was used to detect can-\nker legions on citrus\
    \ fruit (grapefruits) where the spec-\ntral range of the data was 450–930 nm with\
    \ 92 bands and \n5.2 nm spectral resolution. Before analysing the data, a \npre-processing\
    \ step is applied by combining neighbour-\ning pixels to reduce the size by half.\
    \ Cankerous grape-\nfruits were compared with normal grapefruit and also \nwith\
    \ grapefruit showing other disease or damage symp-\ntoms including: greasy spot,\
    \ insect damage, melanose, \nscab and wind scar; this method resulted in 95.2%\
    \ clas-\nsification accuracy [38].\nQuantifying severity of disease\nAlong with\
    \ detecting and classifying disease, we may \nwish to record the effective amount\
    \ of disease, or its \nseverity. This approach does run into some particular \n\
    challenges. The amount of leaf damage and coverage \nfrom the disease can affect\
    \ the accuracy of the leaves \nbeing classified as healthy or diseased. Extreme\
    \ disease \ndamage can affect the appearance of leaves so detrimen-\ntally that\
    \ they may not be counted as plant material at all. \nStill, there are a number\
    \ of methods for estimating sever-\nity, and we present a selection of approaches\
    \ below.\nSpectral angle mapper (SAM) approaches match the \npixel spectra to\
    \ reference spectra to classify the pix-\nels by calculating the angle between\
    \ the spectra which \nare treated as n-dimensional vectors in space [2]. This\
    \ \ntechnique has been widely used with moderate success \nto classify hyperspectral\
    \ data, including plant diseases. \nYuhas studied the severity of Fusarium head\
    \ blight dis-\nease for wheat before harvesting. The hyperspectral data \nwas\
    \ in the range 400–1000 nm with a spectral resolution \nof 2.5 nm. SAM was used\
    \ to detect the amount of disease \nwith a classification accuracy of 87%. Two\
    \ experiments \nwith wheat plants were carried out, one in a glasshouse \nand\
    \ one in field. The plants were imaged over their devel-\nopmental stages from\
    \ inoculated to established infection. \nYuhas determined that just after infection,\
    \ the healthy \nand infected plants were not distinguishable because the \ninfection\
    \ had not yet established. However, when the \nhyperspectral data were examined\
    \ during the ripening \nstage, the wheat pigment composition changes, and the\
    \ \nhealthy plants then appear as diseased plants [39].\nMahlein [40] uses the\
    \ same technique to analyse sugar \nbeet diseases specifically Cerospora leaf\
    \ spot, pow-\ndery mildew and leaf rust. The range is 400–1000  nm \nwith 2.8 \
    \ nm spectral resolution and 0.19  mm spatial \nPage 8 of 12\nLowe et al. Plant\
    \ Methods  (2017) 13:80 \nresolution. The plants were analysed over a time period\
    \ \n(> 20 days) to monitor the different stages of each dis-\nease, and the leaves\
    \ were classified as healthy or dis-\neased. Cerospora leaf spot classification\
    \ accuracy varied \ndepending on the severity of the disease (89.01–98.90%), \n\
    powdery mildew accuracy varied between 90.18 and \n97.23%, and sugar beet rust\
    \ reached 61.70%, with no clas-\nsification before day 20 using SAM.\nRumpf et al.\
    \ [41] used the same dataset as Mahlein but \nwith different analysis approaches;\
    \ decision trees (DT), \nartificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector \n\
    machine (SVM). All approaches require prior knowledge, \nhowever once trained\
    \ have proven to be efficient. For \nexample, with Cerospora leaf spot the accuracy\
    \ for SVM \nis 97% (compared to DT 95% and ANN 96%); for Sugar \nbeet rust the\
    \ accuracy is 93% (DT 92%, ANN 95%); and \nfor Powdery mildew the accuracy is\
    \ 93% (DT 86%, ANN \n91%). Measuring the severity with leaf area coverage after\
    \ \nthe disease has covered 1–2% of the leaf the accuracy is \n62–68% and for\
    \ more than 10% leaf coverage the accu-\nracy is almost 100%. This demonstrates\
    \ that it is possi-\nble to use a variety of analysis methods on the same set\
    \ \nof hyperspectral data to elucidate different insights and \nachieve different\
    \ levels of accuracy—choice of technique \nis important. A list of common techniques\
    \ used to iden-\ntify specific diseases and the accuracy associated with \neach\
    \ is presented in Table 2.\nDetection of early stage stress symptoms\nThe ultimate\
    \ goal of such detection systems is to identify \nthe disease with a minimum of\

    Lowe et al. Plant Methods  (2017) 13:80 \nmethods, we can realistically hope to\
    \ identify stress \nsymptoms before a human observer.\nDrought can be a significant\
    \ problem for many crops \n[42], particularly as some plant species or varieties\
    \ do \nnot visibly indicate this stress for a period of time, and \nby this time,\
    \ the potential yield or quality of the crop may \nhave decreased because normal\
    \ plant developmental \nprocesses have been affected through the stress response.\
    \ \nThe definition of ‘drought’ can also vary from a little \nwater deprivation\
    \ to complete deprivation. Studies dis-\ncussed in this section have detected\
    \ the onset of drought \nbefore Vegetation Indices’ detected the drought and also\
    \ \ndays before visible signs appeared.\nOne technique in particular which has\
    \ become popu-\nlar for early detection of drought stress is simplex vol-\nume\
    \ maximisation (SiVM), which is a data clustering \ntechnique [43]. This technique\
    \ selects spectral signatures \nthat are samples of healthy and stressed plants,\
    \ and then \nclusters the data using these classes. When the signatures \nbecome\
    \ similar to a pre-learned sample signature then it \nis classified as such.\n\
    Romer [44] studied drought stress in a barley experi-\nment contained in a rainout\
    \ shelter and a corn experi-\nment grown in field. The technique used to detect\
    \ the \nstress was simplex volume maximisation, which is \nan unsupervised technique.\
    \ The spectrum range was \n400–900 nm, with 4 nm spectral resolution. During pre-\n\
    processing some wavelengths are removed due to noise \n(< 470 and > 750 nm). This\
    \ is a common occurrence with \nhyperspectral data due to insufficient light at\
    \ the end of \nthe spectrum range, and is especially common with lab-\nbased light\
    \ sources which may not generate much light in \nthese regions of the spectrum.\
    \ To reduce the size of the \ndata and to remove the background, a k-means cluster-\n\
    ing method was used to separate the data into a selected \nnumber of groups using\
    \ mean colour. SiVM is then com-\npared to four well known vegetation indices’—NDVI,\
    \ \nphotochemical reflectance index (PRI), red edge inflec-\ntion point (REIP)\
    \ and carotenoid reflectance index (CRI). \nFor the Barley data, reduced partial\
    \ water stress was \ndetected four days earlier with SiVM (day 9) than Vegeta-\n\
    tion Indices’ (day 13). For the plants with no water/com-\nplete drought conditions\
    \ the Vegetation Indices’ detected \nthe stress on day 8, one day faster than\
    \ SiVM, but they \nfailed to detect the stress for days 9 and 10; however \nSiVM\
    \ did reliably detect the stressed plants from day 9.\nBehmann also analysed drought\
    \ stress in barley using \nsupport vector machine (SVM). This algorithm is super-\n\
    vised and requires labelled training data, which in this \ncase is labelled as\
    \ drought or healthy. The data is pre-\nprocessed with k-means to reduce the size\
    \ of the data-\nset before analysis with SVM. The spectral range was \n430–890 \
    \ nm with a spectral resolution of 4  nm. Using \nthis approach, Behmann detected\
    \ drought stress on day \n6, with NDVI detecting a difference on day 16 [45].\n\
    Drought stress in wheat has been analysed by two com-\nbined techniques to try\
    \ and improve detection rates. \nMoshou [46] uses least squares support vector\
    \ machine \n(LSSVM) to try and detect drought stress. Wheat plants \nwere studied\
    \ in a glasshouse, and both spectral reflec-\ntance and fluorescence were analysed.\
    \ Fluorescence \ninvolves using high intensity light to excite a plant tis-\n\
    sue causing it to emit a different wavelength light, which \ncan be used to gain\
    \ additional biological insight. LSSVM \nneeded to be trained, and 846 data samples\
    \ were used for \nthis training, whilst 302 data samples were used for the \n\
    testing stage. For some techniques the size of the data-\nset and/or number of\
    \ wavelengths will determine the \ntime taken to analyse the data due to computation\
    \ time. \nTherefore, Moshou used six wavelengths—503, 545, 566, \n608, 860 and\
    \ 881 nm. The LSSVM attained 76.3% accu-\nracy for stress leaves and 86.6% accuracy\
    \ for healthy \nleaves. However, the study stated that by using a fusion \nLSSVM\
    \ model combining spectral and florescence fea-\ntures, the overall accuracy was\
    \ greater than 99%. Fluo-\nrescence is the measure of chlorophyll fluorescence\
    \ in the \nleaf to determine physiological changes.\nAccording to Kersting [47]\
    \ many of these techniques \nare difficult to use for non-machine learning or\
    \ data min-\ning experts because the hyperspectral data needs pre-\nprocessing\
    \ or adapting (i.e. finding the leaves or using \nselect wavelengths). In addition,\
    \ the other techniques \napart from [44] do not analyse lots of plants over several\
    \ \ndays. This is an important factor to consider for plant \nphenotyping when\
    \ there is a lot of data to analyse. Ker-\nsting claims to have the first Artificial\
    \ Intelligence tech-\nnique for drought stress prediction using hyperspectral\
    \ \ndata. A novel approach is developed which includes a \npredictive technique\
    \ for drought that does not adapt \nthe data or reduce the size. Kersting demonstrates\
    \ the \napproach in a Barley drought experiment with data col-\nlected over a\
    \ five-week period. The technique used \nis called Dirichlet aggregation regression\
    \ (DAR) and \nit is based on matrix factorisation. First Simplex Vol-\nume Maximisation\
    \ is used to find 50 spectral signatures \nfrom the data and classify them. Then,\
    \ latent Dirichlet \naggregation values are estimated before using a Gauss-\n\
    ian process over the values to find the drought levels \nper plant and per time\
    \ point. Finally, the process pre-\ndicts the drought-affected plants before there\
    \ are visible \nsigns. Based on a five-week barley experiment, predic-\ntion of\
    \ drought occurred 1.5  weeks before visible signs \nappeared. A comparison of\
    \ runtimes between SiVM and \nDAR was assessed and resulted in a runtime of 30 min\
    \ for \nparallelized SiVM, versus only several minutes using the \nDAR model.\
    \ This demonstrates that developing custom \nPage 10 of 12\nLowe et al. Plant\

    \ in size. If the \nwhole spectrum range is analysed then the process will \n\
    take considerably longer than selecting several wave-\nlengths to analyse. However,\
    \ there is a lot of informa-\ntion contained in the data, which could be valuable.\
    \ The \nresearcher must make decisions about how much spec-\ntral resolution to\
    \ use, and how much to discard. If your \ncamera collects 800 spectral bands,\
    \ you must ask your-\nself if you need all 800 or whether binning into 400 or\
    \ \n200 etc. bands is sufficient. This is analogous to using \nsomething like\
    \ JPEG compression for RGB images. This \ncompression creates smaller file sizes,\
    \ at the expense of \ndestroying image information permanently (particularly \n\
    colour information). Storing fewer spectral bands results \nin smaller file sizes,\
    \ and reduces the complexity of the \ndata analysis, at the expense of throwing\
    \ away potentially \nimportant colour properties. Polder et al. [48] explore the\
    \ \ncalibration and characterisation of spectrographs cap-\ntured using three\
    \ system set ups. The experiments look at \nthe different types of noise and signal-to-noise\
    \ ratio. The \nexperiments also determined that to an extent binning \ncan occur\
    \ without loss of information by calculating the \nresolution, the spectral range\
    \ and the amount of pixels.\nHyperspectral camera set‑up\nPrior to analysis, the\
    \ hyperspectral data needs to be cali-\nbrated to ensure the images produced are\
    \ adjusted due to \nthe colour of lighting present; the camera software may \n\
    have this option, but if it does not then the data can be \ncalibrated after it\
    \ is captured. The lighting is calibrated \nusing a known white balance target,\
    \ which is imaged \nby the camera system. This target will reflect a known \n\
    percentage of light over the spectrum, for example 99% \nacross the entire working\
    \ spectrum of the camera. Non-\nuniformity of illumination can be corrected for\
    \ by divid-\ning the observed data by the captured white balance \ndata [49].\
    \ Additionally, the system must be corrected for \nelectrical noise present from\
    \ the sensor in the absence of \nlight (called dark current). This is usually\
    \ carried out by \ntaking an image with the camera in the absence of any \nlight,\
    \ and using the resultant low-level noise readings to \nadjust future measures.\n\
    An important question is how often to carry out a \nwhite balance calibration.\
    \ In a lab setting, it may be \nappropriate to capture just one white balance\
    \ target per \nexperiment, assuming the lighting has reached an equi-\nlibrium\
    \ (i.e. the bulbs have fully warmed up). Outside the \nlab, however, lighting\
    \ is subject to much more variation. \nCloud cover, shadows and time of day can\
    \ dramatically \naffect the colour of the incoming light when outside and \nso\
    \ very regular white balance readings must be taken to \nensure accurate calibration.\
    \ Careful choice must also be \nmade about the time of day images are captured\
    \ on, and \nwhether to capture in overcast conditions versus direct \nsun (which\
    \ can cause problems with shadows and spec-\nular reflection—bright spots on the\
    \ plants reflecting the \nillumination source (i.e. the sun) directly). Evenness\
    \ of \nillumination should also be considered—does the sen-\nsor record a uniform\
    \ level of brightness across its spa-\ntial range? An effect called vignetting\
    \ can result in pixels \ntowards the edges of the lens appearing darker than those\
    \ \nin the centre.\nConclusions\nThere has been a significant increase in scientific\
    \ litera-\nture in recent years focusing on detecting stress in plants \nusing\
    \ hyperspectral image analysis. Plant disease detec-\ntion is a major activity\
    \ in the management of crop plants \nin both agriculture and horticulture. In\
    \ particular, detect-\ning early onset of stress and diseases would be beneficial\
    \ \nto farmers and growers as it would enable earlier inter-\nventions to help\
    \ mitigate against crop loss and reduced \ncrop quality. Hyperspectral imaging\
    \ is a non-invasive \nprocess where the plants are scanned to collect high-res-\n\
    olution data. The technology is becoming more popular \nsince the falling costs\
    \ of camera production have enabled \nresearchers and developers greater access\
    \ to this tech-\nnology. There are various techniques available to ana-\nlyse\
    \ the data to detect biotic and abiotic stress in plants, \nexamples of which\
    \ have been discussed in this review, \nwith a focus on the classification of\
    \ healthy and diseased \nplants, the severity of disease and early detection of\
    \ stress \nsymptoms.\nVegetation and disease indices are increasing in \nquantity\
    \ every year. Significant wavelengths combined \ntogether can indicate the health\
    \ or disease status occur-\nring within a specific species. Indices are valuable\
    \ for \ndetecting specific criteria for vegetation however; the \nindices are\
    \ selected with the datasets, species and con-\nditions favourable to the experiments\
    \ at that time. Some \nare more general in nature; NDVI, PRI and several other\
    \ \nVegetation Indices will work to find the general health \nof the plant. But\
    \ in general, it is harder to take an index \ndesigned for plant X and apply it\
    \ to a dataset for plant Y. \nThis is the motivation behind considering a larger\
    \ range \nof wavelengths over the spectrum, which has the poten-\ntial to yield\
    \ better results.\nPage 11 of 12\nLowe et al. Plant Methods  (2017) 13:80 \nAbbreviations\

    Water is an important agronomic input, which plays a vital role in the health
    and yield of the crop. Water deficiency results in abiotic stress, early detection
    of water stress help in recovering the health of the crop. Hyperspectral imaging
    (HSI) sensors acquire rich spectral information of the objects in hundreds of

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Ahmedabad, India SECTION I. INTRODUCTION
    Recently, the demand for food production is increasing with the rapid increase
    in the world’s population, hence there is a need for increasing the production
    in the agriculture sector [1]. The quantity and quality of crop production highly
    depend on the health of the crop, which is, in turn, depends on the soil nutrients,
    rainfall, etc. The decrease in rainfall in the last decade forcing the farmers
    to depend on groundwater to meet the irrigation requirements of the crop. Worldwide
    around 70% of the water is used for agriculture needs. The crop undergoes stress
    when it is not sufficiently irrigated, and it develops physiological changes under
    stress. The early detection of drought stress help in recovering the health of
    the crop. In plant phenotyping, agriculture scientists are working in developing
    new plant cultivars, which will be tolerant to stress conditions and produce high
    yields. But the challenge in phenotypic studies is the assessment of thousands
    of genetic lines under field conditions. The traditional methods used for stress
    identification and phenotypic studies are laborious, time-consuming, destructive,
    faulty, and not standardized. Different imaging techniques such as RGB, multispectral,
    HSI are effective in studying the behavior of crops under stress. However, the
    rich spectral information captured by HSI sensors in hundreds of narrow spectral
    bands is capable of identifying the change in canopy water content which is crucial
    in predicting irrigation requirements [2]. Due to the wide field of coverages,
    short revisiting periods, and high spatial resolutions, UAV-based imaging techniques
    are most suitable in precision agriculture [2]. Researchers found that Chickpea
    is more sensitive to drought, which significantly affects the health and yield
    [3]. Hence, we strongly feel that detection of water stress will help in finding
    the irrigation requirements, and hence useful to farmers and agriculture scientists.
    The authors in [4] used a CNN model to detect water-stressed areas in maize fields
    using UAV-based RGB images, but early detection is not possible with RGB images.
    In [5], authors developed two new vegetation indices (VI) for retrieving canopy
    water content in different crops. But, the VIs focus only on specific bands, are
    not capable of capturing changes in many bands caused due to drought stress, hence
    reducing the discrimination ability. In [6], authors used spectral similarity
    in specific bands with high discriminating information, to detect drought stress
    in maize plants using close range HSI. The authors in [7], used machine learning
    (ML) techniques like random forest algorithm, SVM, multi-layer perceptron (MLP),
    2D CNN for detecting water stress in potato plants using HS imagery. In [8], ML
    algorithms were integrated with full and derivative spectra for early detecting
    drought stress in Bromus inermis using close-range HSI. The bottleneck of traditional
    methods is the curse of dimensionality due to the high dimensionality of HSI data[9].
    Spectral-based dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, linear discriminant
    analysis, and independent component analysis, and pixel-based FE methods like
    neural networks, MLPs, SVM give unsatisfactory performance due to ignoring the
    spatial information [9], [10]. Fig. 1. Orthomosaic view of Chickpea experimental
    filed. Show All Recently, deep learning (DL) based techniques especially CNNs
    are widely used for analyzing remotely sensed HSI data. In DL, an end-to-end framework
    is developed, which takes the input HSI data, automatically does FE and classification,
    and outputs the results [10]. The 2D CNNs are not effective in classifying HSI
    data, since they extract only spatial discriminative features but not the spectral
    information [9]. 3D CNNs can extract the spectral-spatial features simultaneously
    from HSI data but with increased computational complexity. In [11], a hybrid (3D-2D)
    CNN model was proposed, in which the 3D convolutions learns joint spatial-spectral
    features and 2D convolutions learns more abstract spatial features from complex
    HSI data, and also it significantly reduces the computational complexity. Motivated
    by this, in this paper we use a 3D-2D CNN model to detect water stress in chickpea.
    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to present the water stress
    detection of chickpea with UAV-based hyperspectral images using a 3D-2D CNN model.
    SECTION II. EXPERIMENT AND DATA ACQUISITION For this study, the target crop is
    chickpea, and the experiment was conducted at Lysimetric facility [12] at the
    International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Hyderabad,
    India as shown in Fig. 1. The drought experiment consists of two water treatments,
    i. well-watered (WW), ii. water-stressed (WS). Each treatment consists of 26 genomes
    with 8 replications, a total of 208 lines per treatment. The chickpea plants were
    cultivated in plastic cylinders for precise water treatments. The cylinders were
    randomly distributed and closely placed to create real field conditions. For WW
    plants controlled irrigation was supplied throughout, whereas for WS plants the
    irrigation was withheld 30 days after sowing. The soil moisture measurements were
    taken by weighting the cylinders. To acquire data for this study, a Resonon’s
    Pika-L HSI camera mounted on a DJI matrice-600 Pro UAV was used as shown in Fig.
    2. The HSI camera acquires images in 400-1000 nm spectral range in 281 narrow
    bands, with a spectral resolution of 2.1 nm. The images were acquired by flying
    the UAV at 20 m altitude with 3.6 kmph speed, which gives around 0.7 cm pixel
    resolution. The flights were conducted around 11 am, which is a suitable time
    for acquiring HS reflectance. A 3m x 3m single-level gray calibration panel with
    36% reflectance was used for the reflectance calibration of HSI data. The collected
    HSI data cubes have 2000 x 900 spatial pixels. Post-flight, the radiometric and
    geometric calibrations of the data cubes were performed to get the geo-rectified
    images in absolute reflectance [13]. In Fig. 3, sample mean spectrum of the chickpea
    canopy is shown. Fig. 2. Setup of the UAV based HSI system. Show All Fig. 3. Sample
    mean spectrum of chickpea canopy. Show All SECTION III. 3D-2D CNN MODEL FRAMEWORK
    The architecture of the 3D-2D CNN (HybridSN) [11] model which is used for FE and
    classification of HSI data is shown in Fig. 4. Initially, PCA is applied along
    the spectral dimension of the HSI data cubes, to reduce the dimensionality by
    removing redundant information. The PCA reduced data cube is represented as X
    ∈ RMXNXB, where M, N, and B be the width, height, and the spectral dimension respectively.
    The data cube X is divided into small overlapping 3D patches, P ∈ RSXSXB, the
    labels of which are given by the labels of the corresponding center pixel. The
    patches consider spatial contextual information in a SXS neighborhood window around
    the center pixel. The CNN architecture consists of three 3D convolution layers,
    one 2D convolution layer, and three fully connected layers in the same order.
    It uses eight 3D kernels of size 3x3x7 in the first layer, sixteen 3D kernels
    of size 3x3x5 in the second layer, and 32 3D convolutions of size 3x3x3 in the
    third layer. On the reshaped output of the third layer, 64 2D convolution kernels
    of size 3×3×576 are applied. The 3D convolutions generate joint spectral-spatial
    features, and the 2D convolution generates more abstract spatial features. C =
    2 is used in the last dense layer, which is the number of water treatment classes.
    Fig. 4. 3D-2D CNN (HybridSN) model architecture [11]. Show All III-A. Data Sets
    Creation The normalized difference VI [14] was used to separate the background
    and mixed pixels from the canopy. The ground truth was created by manually labeling
    the pixels of the canopy corresponding to each water treatment. The available
    ground truth data was designated into 2 classes, ie. WW and WS. Two data sets
    were created i. by selecting 22 spectral bands which are directly water-sensitive
    (from 950 nm to 980 nm) and indirectly affected (530, 550, 570, 670, 675, 800
    nm) by drought stress [14], and ii. By considering the whole spectral bands of
    the HS images. The data samples were created by extracting 3D patches of dimension
    SxSxB from the HS images for both the data sets and the labels are given by the
    labels of the corresponding center pixels. Window size of S = 25 and principal
    components B=30 were used as in [11], whereas, for selected bands data set, B
    = 22 spectral bands were directly used. Out of 8 replications of both WW and WS
    treatments, 5 replications were used to create training data (5x26x2 = 260 lines),
    and 3 replications were used to create test data (3x26x2 = 156 lines). SECTION
    IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this study, the chickpea canopy of different genomics
    is classified as WW and WS, which is a binary classification problem. The weights
    were randomly initialized and the network was trained using back-propagation algorithm
    with the Adam optimizer by using the cross-entropy loss. The network was trained
    for 50 epochs using mini-batches of size 128. Simulation experiments were conducted
    on Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4108 CPU workstation with the GTX 1080 GPU and 64 GB
    RAM. An optimal learning rate of 0.001 and weight decay of 1e−04 were chosen based
    on the classification outcomes. The HybridSN model was trained and tested on the
    selected bands and whole spectral bands data sets separately. The train set consists
    of 760 samples per class, and in the test set 950 samples per class. The accuracy
    and loss convergence of the model for 50 epochs during training on whole spectral
    bands data set are shown in Fig. 5. The water stress detection accuracy was evaluated
    using the Overall accuracy (OA), Precision, Recall, and F1-score as the performance
    metrics. Also, an SVM and a 2D+1D CNN [10] model were used to identify water stress,
    and the performances are compared with the HybridSN model. Table I. Water stress
    classification performance. Fig. 5. (left) Train accuracy (right) Train loss convergence
    with epochs for HybridSN. Show All As shown in Table 1, the classification accuracy
    of SVM is less on both the data sets in detecting water stress, as SVM considers
    only the spectral features but ignores the spatial features. The performance of
    the 2D+1D CNN model is better because it considers both spectral as well as spatial
    features in the neighborhood window. However, the 3D-2D CNN resulted in the highest
    classification performance (95.44%), since the 3D convolution layers learn joint
    spectral-spatial features, and the 2D convolution layer extracts more abstract
    spatial features. The performance of HybridSN in classifying water stress on whole
    spectral bands data (95.44%) is better compared to that of the selected bands
    data (88.07%). This can be due to, the selected water-sensitive bands may miss
    out some of the bands, which are directly or indirectly affected by the water
    stress. On the other hand, in the case of the whole spectral bands data set, the
    information in all spectral bands is taken into account by considering the first
    30 principal components. The 3D-2D CNN model could classify water-stressed chickpea
    (26 genotypes) canopy from that of well-watered with 95.44% accuracy, 0.957 precision,
    and 0.952 F1-score on the unseen test data, which indicates the potential of HSI
    and CNNs in efficiently detecting water stress in crops. In Fig. 6 the water stress
    classification map on an HS image generated using the trained HybridSN model is
    shown. There are few misclassifications, which may be due to the varied behavior
    of chickpea genomics under water stress. Fig. 6. (left) Ground truth map, (right)
    classification map of Chickpea; Red: WW, Green: WS. Show All SECTION V. CONCLUSION
    In this paper, the water stress detection in chickpea canopy of different genomics
    was studied using UAV-based hyperspectral imaging. We obtained classification
    accuracy of 95.44% in discriminating well-watered and water-stressed canopy using
    a 3D-2D CNN model on acquired canopy HS images. The results indicate the potential
    of HSI in successfully detecting water stress in chickpea. This study will be
    useful in finding the irrigation requirements of crops and will be helpful to
    farmers and agriculture scientists. The current work complements our ongoing efforts
    in developing standard operating procedures (SOP) for the use of UAV-based HSI
    in plant phenotyping in a standardized way. Authors Figures References Citations

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Sundsvall, Sweden SECTION I. Introduction
    In recent years, the demand for food production in agriculture sector has been
    increasing with the rapid increase in the world’s population [1]. Due to a decrease
    in rainfall in the last decade, the farmers are forced to depend on groundwater
    to meet the irrigation requirements of the crop. Over the last decade, the speed
    of climatic changes has taken humanity by surprise. The agricultural scientists
    are working intensively to generate climate-smart crop varieties resilient to
    future climate scenarios like increased drought and heat periods. The major bottleneck
    in crop improvement is the assessment of thousands of genotypes under field conditions
    called plant phenotyping and mostly done visually to date. The traditional phenotyping
    methodologies (i.e., manual observations or laboratory assessments) are costlier,
    time-consuming, labor-intensive, destructive, and are frequently not standardized.
    Another drawback of these methods is that one requires the capacity to associate
    biological understanding with the monitored data, which is often missing. Many
    sensors have been developed to automate this process, but the current tools only
    deliver partly the traits required by agriculture scientists and are pretty expensive.
    UAV-based remote sensing is emerging quickly to accelerate crop phenotyping and
    has proven the potential to revolutionize agriculture [2], [3]. Till now, UAVs
    have been exploited in a variety of applications related to crop management by
    capturing high spatial and temporal resolution images by integrating mostly RGB
    cameras and partly multispectral cameras for yield and its attributing traits
    [3], [4]. However, phenotyping for complex traits of abiotic stress adaptation
    (drought and heat), like early detection of water stress can be explored more
    precisely through HSI sensors. HSI sensors acquire rich spectral information in
    the 400 nm to 2500 nm range, which is capable of identifying the changes in canopy
    water content which is crucial in predicting irrigation requirements that can
    have successful application in agriculture [5], [6]. Motivated by this, we used
    UAV-based hyperspectral imaging technology to detect water stress in the pearl
    millet crop. In [7], the authors observed that leaf reflectance in the visible
    and near-infrared spectrum is highly correlated to the leaf equivalent water thickness
    changes, and used hyperspec-tral (HS) regression indices for estimating the canopy
    water content. The canopy water status in maize [8], and different crop varieties
    [5] was studied using HS vegetation indices (VIs). [9] studied the use of various
    narrow-band VIs for detecting the combined effects of water and nitrogen stress
    in field-grown tomato crops. NIR water absorption features at 970 nm, 1200 nm,
    and the derivative spectra were used in [10] for canopy water content retrieval
    [10]. Near-range HSI was used in [6] to identify drought stress in maize plants
    by utilizing spectral similarity in the bands with high discriminating information.
    Airborne HSI was used in [11] to early identify water stress in corn at the farm
    level with three irrigation levels. Machine learning (ML) algorithms combined
    with complete and derivative spectra obtained from close-range HSI were employed
    in [12] for early drought stress detection in Bromus inermis. UAV-based RGB imaging
    and a CNN model were used in [4] to detect water-stressed areas in maize fields;
    however, early detection is not viable with RGB images. Different ML approaches
    such as random forest (RF), SVM, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and 2D CNN along
    with HSI were used in [13] for water stress diagnosis in potato plants. In [14],
    UAV-based HSI and CNNs were used to classify water stress in chickpea using the
    complete spectrum in the 400-1000 nm range. Most of the studies mentioned above
    used VIs for canopy water status analysis in different crops; however, the VIs,
    which focus only on specific bands, cannot capture changes in other bands caused
    due to drought stress, hence reducing the discrimination ability. Also, using
    the complete spectrum is computationally complex due to the high dimensionality
    of HSI data and requires more labeled samples [15]. Analyzing the selected water
    stress-sensitive bands instead of using the whole spectrum improves stress detection
    accuracy by avoiding irrelevant bands that may be susceptible to other factors
    (such as nutrients and diseases), and reduces the computational complexity and
    requirement for more labeled data. Six feature selection (FS) methods were used
    in [16] to reduce the dimensionality of HS data for classifying salt stress in
    different wheat genotypes. In [17], ensemble of different FS methods were used
    for HS band selection in grape leaves for nitrogen status detection. HS sensing
    and ML-based FS techniques were used in [18] for identifying optimal wavelengths
    to discriminate between the healthy and diseased peanut crop. In this study, we
    used different ML-based FS techniques for identifying the most effective wavelengths
    sensitive to canopy water stress, and the RF and SVM classifiers on the selected
    wavelengths for water stress classification in pearl millet using the HSI data
    captured from the UAV platform. Our study is the first attempt to present water-stress
    sensitive band selection and stress detection in pearl millet using UAV-based
    HS sensing to the best of our knowledge. The key contributions of this paper are:
    i) selecting the top-ranked wavebands sensitive to canopy water stress with different
    FS methods, ii) Early identification of canopy water stress, and iii) Different
    water stress levels classification in pearl millet. SECTION II. Experiment and
    Data Acquisition For this study, pearl millet is the target crop, and the water
    stress experiment was conducted from Feb to April 2021 at the Lysimetric facility
    [19] of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT),
    Hyderabad, India. The drought experiment consisted of two water treatments, i.
    well-watered (WW), ii. water-stressed (WS), shown in Fig. 1. Each treatment consisted
    of 350 genomic varieties, where WW treatment had four replications, and WS treatment
    had five replications, a total of 3150 genotypes. The plants were grown in plastic
    cylinders for precise water treatments and measurements. In each replication,
    the genotype placement was random, and the cylinders were closely placed to create
    real field conditions. For WW treatment, sufficient irrigation was given at regular
    intervals throughout the experiment, i.e., from sowing until harvesting. For WS
    treatment, the irrigation was withheld from the 30th day after sowing, and progressive
    water stress was observed. The soil moisture level measurements were taken by
    weighting the cylinders at regular intervals to observe the plants’ water utilization
    profiles. Fig. 1: Orthomosaic view of pearl millet drought stress experiment (well-watered
    (WW) and water-stressed (WS) plots). Show All The UAV-based HSI sensor system
    setup that was used for acquiring hyperspectral imaging data is shown in Fig.
    2, which consists of a Resonon’s Pika-L HSI sensor mounted on a DJI matrice-600
    Pro UAV. The HSI sensor is a push-broom scanner with 900 spatial channels and
    281 spectral channels in the 400-1000 nm range with 2.1 nm spectral resolution.
    The HS images of pearl millet were acquired on two dates: 25th March 2021 (12
    days after the irrigation withheld: Water stress level 1 (WS1)) and 31st March
    2021 (18 days after the irrigation withheld: Water stress level 2 (WS2)) for observing
    progressive water stress. For data collection, between 11 am and 1 pm was chosen,
    which is the suitable time for acquiring HS reflectance data. The images of the
    pearl millet canopy were acquired by flying the UAV at 25 m altitude with 4.0
    kmph speed, which gives around 0.9 cm pixel-level resolution. A 3m x 3m single-level
    homogeneous gray calibration panel with 36% reflectance (bordered black in Fig.
    1) was used for the reflectance calibration of HSI data cubes. SECTION III. HSI
    Data Analysis A. Data Analysis Pipeline The HSI data analysis pipeline for water
    stress classification is shown in Fig. 3. The HSI data collected during the flight
    is in raw data cubes consisting of unwanted components such as solar illumination,
    instrument response along with canopy reflectance. The radiance conversion and
    reflectance calibration were done to get absolute reflectance data of the canopy.
    Then the geometric calibrations of the data cubes were performed to obtain the
    geo-rectified images, which can now map to the locations in the field, after which
    we can select a region of interest [20]. Post these corrections, the spectral
    signatures in the HSI data cubes were smoothed using Savitzky-Golay filter [21]
    with a third-order polynomial and a window size of 13. The mean spectrum of the
    pearl millet canopy with different stress levels after Savitzky-Golay smoothing
    is shown in Fig. 4. After this step, the data labeling and data set creation was
    done, which is explained in Section III-B. Now comes the band selection step with
    different ML-based FS methods for selecting the top-ranked effective wavelengths
    sensitive to canopy water stress as explained in Section III-C. The top-ranked
    ten bands selected by the best performing FS method in the previous step were
    used to classify canopy water stress in the pearl millet using ML-based classifiers
    (SVM or RF). Fig. 2: Setup of the UAV-based HSI system. Show All Fig. 3: Data
    analysis pipeline for water stress classification. Show All B. Data Sets Creation
    Each of the collected HS data cubes has 2000 x 900 spatial pixels and 281 spectral
    channels (i.e., 2000 x 900 x 281). The canopy HSI data was designated into three
    classes, ie. Well-Watered (WW), water stress level 1 (WS1: acquired on 12th day
    after irrigation withheld), and water stress level 2 (WS2: acquired on 18th day
    after irrigation withheld). The normalized difference VI and transformed chlorophyll
    absorption reflectance index [22] were used to separate the background and mixed
    pixels from the canopy. The ground truth was created by manually labeling the
    canopy pixels corresponding to each of the water treatments. Two replications
    of each treatment/class were used to create training data (2x350 = 700 genotypes
    per class), and one replication was used to create test data (350 genotypes per
    class). Around 1840 samples per class for the train set and 1010 samples per class
    for the test set were created. The data set consists a total of 8550 samples,
    of which the train and test set splits are approximately 65% and 35%, respectively.

    Show All C. Hyperspectral Band Selection and Classification HSI sensors provide
    rich spectral information in hundreds of narrow wavebands, which increases the
    information content, but high dimensional HSI data analysis is complex and challenging.
    Feature extraction and feature selection methods are widely applied to HSI data
    for dimensionality reduction by removing spectral redundancy [15]. The feature
    extraction methods transform the original high dimensional HSI data into a new
    low dimensional feature space, which changes the physical meaning of the original
    data. Whereas, Feature selection, well known as band selection (BS), reduces the
    dimensionality by selecting a subset of the most influential wavelengths for a
    specific task such as classification or anomaly detection [15]. BS methods preserve
    the physical meaning of the selected spectral bands keeping the original information
    as it is. Instead of using the whole spectral data, analysis on the selected top-ranked
    water stress-sensitive wavebands will improve the accuracy in stress detection,
    and also reduce the computational complexity and requirement for more labeled
    data. Also, using selected wavelengths will eliminate the possibility of using
    bands that are not water stress-sensitive but may be susceptible to other factors
    such as nutrients, diseases, etc. In this study for salient water-sensitive band
    selection, five ML-based FS methods from the scikit-learn library were used [23],
    which include a univariate FS method (SelectKBest using the Chi-square test),
    two FS methods using SelectFrom-Model (SFM), and two recursive feature elimination
    (RFE) methods. Both SFM and RFE require an external estimator to assign weights
    to the features; in this study, SVM with linear kernel and RF are the external
    estimators. RFE selects a desirable number of features by recursively removing
    less relevant features by considering smaller and smaller sets of features. The
    FS methods are compared with the classification accuracy of the SVM classifier
    with the linear kernel (hereafter called SVM for simplicity) on the top-ranked
    ten features selected by each method [18]. The band subset selected by the best
    performing FS method (with the highest classification accuracy) was used for further
    analysis, i.e., to classify canopy water stress in the pearl millet HSI data.
    On the selected band subset, SVM and RF classifiers are used to identify early
    water stress, and to classify different water stress levels in the canopy HSI
    data. SVM uses separating hyperplanes to maximize the margins between each class
    [24], whereas the RF employs ensemble-learning by combining multiple decision-tree-based
    classifiers [25]. For each of these classifiers, default hyperpa-rameters were
    used in this study. The usage of SVM and RF classifiers at different stages of
    the analysis is summarized in the Fig. 5. Fig. 5: Usage of classifiers at different
    stages of the analysis. Show All TABLE I: Canopy water-stress classification results
    on WS1-WS2 data with whole spectral bands. SECTION IV. Results and Discussion
    This study used HSI data of WS1 and WS2 classes to select top-ranked water-stress
    sensitive bands using different ML-based FS methods. The reason for using this
    is two folds: i) WS1 and WS2 are the data acquired of the same plots (WS plots)
    at different stress levels, which will be more appropriate for comparison. ii)
    the water-stressed plots canopy on the 18th day after irrigation withheld (WS2)
    will have more water stress that leads to more changes in canopy reflectance.
    The changes in canopy reflectance can be more accurately observed in the WS-sensitive
    wavebands. Further, using these selected water-stress sensitive bands will be
    efficient in classifying/early detecting canopy water stress in pearl millet.
    As explained in III-B, approximately 65% samples were used for training the models
    and 35% samples for testing. The classification accuracy was evaluated using the
    overall accuracy (OA), Precision, Recall, and F1-score as the performance metrics.
    The water stress classification accuracies on WS1-WS2 data with whole spectral
    bands using SVM with linear kernel and RF classifiers are shown in Table I. The
    performance of SVM and RF is almost the same on the whole spectral bands; however,
    SVM performed slightly better (95.59%). For this reason, the classification accuracy
    of SVM was used to compare different FS methods in selecting the best band subset
    sensitive to canopy water stress. TABLE II: Water-stress sensitive wavelengths
    selected by different FS methods on WS1-WS2 data. TABLE III: Water stress classification
    accuracies using SVM on selected bands by different FS methods. The top-ranked
    ten bands sensitive to water stress in pearl millet canopy selected with different
    ML-based FS methods are shown in Table II. From Table II, it is clear that the
    FS methods give a different subset of wavelengths depending on the type FS method
    and classification model used for assigning scores to the features. The wavelengths
    selected by the Chi-square test are limited to a narrow spectral region (763-783
    nm). Interestingly, SFM and RFE using the RF estimator identified similar wavelengths
    in four narrow waveband regions (688-692 nm, 765-769 nm, 774-882 nm, 870 nm) with
    somewhat different rankings. Several wavebands were repeatedly selected as top
    features by two or more FS methods around 692 nm, 714-716 nm, 763-769 nm, 774-882
    nm, 870 nm, and 949 nm regions. The bands around 765-769 nm, 776 nm, and 780 nm
    would be most influential to canopy water stress in pearl millet as at least three
    FS methods selected them. Using an ensemble of multiple FS methods will be recommended
    for optimal band selection of HSI data as the subset of wavelengths selected by
    different FS methods are different. TABLE IV: Different water stress levels classification
    accuracies (OA) using SVM on the selected bands by RFE-SVM. The water stress classification
    accuracies on WS1-WS2 data with the selected top-ranked band subsets by five FS
    methods using the SVM classifier are shown in Table III. It can be observed that
    the RFE FS method outperformed the other methods and achieved almost equal accuracies
    using the selected wavebands (95.38%) to that of using the full bands (95.59%)
    with the SVM classifier. The classification accuracy of the SVM classifier on
    the top 10 features selected by the RFE-SVM is the highest (95.38%) in classifying
    canopy water stress in pearl millet than using the band subsets selected by other
    FS methods. So RFE-SVM is the best performing FS method; we have used this band
    subset in further analysis, i.e., early water stress identification (WS1 canopy
    data), and also in classifying different water stress levels in the pearl millet
    canopy. Table IV shows the canopy water stress classification accuracies (OA)
    on different water stress classes (WW, WS1, WS2) using SVM and RF classifiers
    on the selected top-ranked bands with the RFE-SVM. Overall, the performance of
    SVM is better than that of the RF classifier with the selected bands. It can be
    observed that the canopy early water stress detection accuracy, i.e., classifying
    WS1 canopy from WW canopy, is 80.76%, which is less. This can be due to at the
    early stages of stress imposition, the changes in canopy reflectance of WS1 canopy
    would be less w.r.t that of WW canopy, as the plants try to use existing soil
    moisture content in the cylinders. The classification accuracy using both RF and
    SVM classifiers with the selected bands on WS1-WS2 data is the highest, i.e.,
    96.15% and 95.38% respectively, in classifying two stress levels in pearl millet
    canopy. Using the selected bands, the SVM could classify the canopy of three water
    stress classes (WW, WS1, WS2) with 77.04% accuracy. However, the SVM could classify
    WW-WS2 canopy data with moderate accuracy (89.95%) using the selected bands. This
    work will help identify early water stress in the pearl millet crop using only
    a few water-stress sensitive bands, enabling the agriculturalists to take measures
    well ahead before the stress causes damage to the crop. Also, the different water
    stress levels classification will help classify the field crops with the extent
    of stress so that precise irrigation can be supplied, saving water and time. SECTION
    V. Conclusion In this study, UAV-based hyperspectral sensing in the 400-1000 nm
    range was used to identify water stress in the pearl millet crop. Different ML-based
    feature selection methods were used to identify the top-ranked ten wavelengths
    sensitive to canopy water stress. Wavelengths around 692, 714-716, 763-769, 774-882,
    870, and 949 nm were repeatedly selected by at least two FS methods. The RFE-SVM
    method resulted in the best bands subset, on which the SVM and RF classifiers
    were used for early water stress detection and different stress levels classification
    in the pearl millet canopy. Using the SVM classifier with linear kernel on the
    selected wavebands, we could classify two water stress levels with 95.38% and
    early identify water stress with 80.76% accuracy in the pearl millet crop. This
    study will be helpful in the agriculture sector to find the irrigation requirements
    of crops and accelerate the phenotyping studies. Our future work will use an ensemble
    of different band selection methods to select optimal water-stress sensitive bands
    that can more accurately identify water stress in the crops. Authors Figures References

    and content Abstract The remote detection of water stress in a citrus orchard
    was investigated using leaf-level measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence and
    Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) data, seasonal time-series of crown temperature
    and PRI, and high-resolution airborne imagery. The work was conducted in an orchard
    where a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) experiment generated a gradient in
    water stress levels. Stomatal conductance (Gs) and water potential (Ψ) were measured
    over the season on each treatment block. The airborne data consisted on thermal
    and hyperspectral imagery acquired at the time of maximum stress differences among
    treatments, prior to the re-watering phase, using a miniaturized thermal camera
    and a micro-hyperspectral imager on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The
    hyperspectral imagery was acquired at 40 cm resolution and 260 spectral bands
    in the 400-885 nm spectral range at 6.4 nm full width at half maximum (FWHM) spectral
    resolution and 1.85 nm sampling interval, enabling the identification of pure
    crowns for extracting radiance and reflectance hyperspectral spectra from each
    tree. The FluorMOD model was used to investigate the retrieval of chlorophyll
    fluorescence by applying the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) principle using three
    spectral bands (FLD3), which demonstrated that fluorescence retrieval was feasible
    with the configuration of the UAV micro-hyperspectral instrument flown over the
    orchard. Results demonstrated the link between seasonal PRI and crown temperature
    acquired from instrumented trees and field measurements of stomatal conductance
    and water potential. The sensitivity of PRI and Tc–Ta time-series to water stress
    levels demonstrated a time delay of PRI vs Tc–Ta during the recovery phase after
    re-watering started. At the time of the maximum stress difference among treatment
    blocks, the airborne imagery acquired from the UAV platform demonstrated that
    the crown temperature yielded the best coefficient of determination for Gs (r2
    = 0.78; p < 0.05) and Ψ (r2 = 0.34; p < 0.001). Among the narrow-band indices
    calculated, the PRI515 index (reference band = 515 nm) obtained better results
    than PRI570, with r2 = 0.59 (p < 0.01) for Gs, and r2 = 0.38 (p < 0.001) for Ψ.
    The BGI1 index calculated from the blue (R400) and green (R550) bands resulted
    on the highest significance levels (p < 0.001) for both Gs (r2 = 0.62) and Ψ (r2
    = 0.49). Out of the structural indices assessed, RDVI, MTVI1 and TVI showed greater
    sensitivity for Gs (r2 = 0.6; p < 0.01) and Ψ (p < 0.001) than NDVI. Chlorophyll
    fluorescence calculated from the micro-hyperspectral imagery with the FLD3 method
    tracked stress levels, obtaining r2 = 0.67 (p < 0.05) with stomatal conductance,
    and r2 = 0.66 (p < 0.001) with water potential. The work presented in this manuscript
    demonstrates the feasibility of thermal, narrow-band indices and fluorescence
    retrievals obtained from a micro-hyperspectral imager and a light-weight thermal
    camera on board small UAV platforms for stress detection in a heterogeneous tree
    canopy where very high resolution is required. Highlights ► Water stress was investigated
    using a micro-hyperspectral imager on board an UAV. ► A link between PRI and crown
    temperature was demonstrated over the entire season. ► Seasonal variation of PRI
    and Tc-Ta demonstrated a time delay of PRI during recovery. ► Best indicators
    of stress were crown Tc, F (FLD method) and the BGI1 index. ► It demonstrates
    the F retrieval using micro-hyperspectral imagers on board UAVs. Previous article

    fluorescenceUAVHigh resolutionThermal 1. Introduction Water deficits occur in
    plants when evaporative demand exceeds the supply of water in the soil (Slatyer,
    1967). It has long been found that short-term water deficits may affect growth
    processes (Hsiao et al., 1976), and therefore early detection of water stress
    is important. Water stress also induces stomatal closure, which reduces the transpiration
    rate, thus decreasing evaporative cooling and increasing leaf temperature. The
    increase in leaf and canopy temperatures was first suggested in the 1960s as a
    method of tracking water stress using thermal infrared thermometers (Fuchs and
    Tanner, 1966, Idso et al., 1978, Idso et al., 1981, Jackson, 1982, Jackson, Idso,
    Reginato and Ehrler, 1977, Jackson, Reginato and Idso, 1977, Jackson et al., 1981,
    Tanner, 1963). More recently, Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2006, Sepulcre-Cantó et al.,
    2007 demonstrated that high-resolution airborne thermal imagers flown over orchard
    crops detected small canopy temperature differences linked to water stress levels.
    Later, Berni et al. (2009a) generated maps of tree canopy conductance (Gc) in
    orchards by applying a model based on canopy temperature estimated from high resolution
    airborne imagery, using as inputs net radiation and aerodynamic resistance as
    a function of wind speed and canopy structure. Nevertheless, monitoring of plant
    water status is critical not only for early detection of stress, but also to enable
    the application of deficit irrigation (DI) techniques (Fereres and Soriano, 2007)
    with the degree of precision needed. Generally, when DI methods are correctly
    applied in many fruit tree species, yield and fruit size are not affected (Girona,
    2002), while some quality parameters are increased and water is saved (Crisosto
    et al., 1994, Fereres and Soriano, 2007, Girona et al., 2003, Mills et al., 1994).
    Even though canopy temperature is considered reliable as a proxy for plant water
    status monitoring (Jackson, 1982), there are physiological and remote sensing
    operational issues that support the development of new water-stress sensitive
    indices based on the visible and near infrared spectral regions (Suárez et al.,
    2009, Suárez et al., 2010). On the physiology side, in some crop plants the diurnal
    patterns of stomatal conductance are such that the relationships between canopy
    temperature and stress levels are not clear-cut. This is the case of citrus trees
    in semi-arid areas, where high vapor pressure deficits induce a continuous decline
    in leaf conductance from the early morning hours, even when trees are well supplied
    with water (Fereres et al., 1979, Hall et al., 1975, Villalobos et al., 2008).
    The level of stomatal conductance thus interacts with the evaporative demand and
    internal water status of the tree to determine tree canopy temperature. On the
    operational side, monitoring of large agricultural fields of tree and vineyard
    crops, generally planted in grids and therefore affected by soil background and
    shadows, requires high spatial resolution and short revisit periods (Berni et
    al., 2009b). The satellite thermal imagery currently available is limited to Landsat
    TM and ASTER sensors, yielding 120 m and 90 m, respectively. In such cases, monitoring
    of water stress is potentially suitable for regional scales only when canopy heterogeneity
    is accounted for (Moran et al., 1994). Nevertheless, modeling methods conducted
    with DART 3D simulation for orchards demonstrated the large effects due to soil
    and shadow components on the aggregated thermal pixel as a function of planting
    grid and soil temperature variations (Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2009), making it
    difficult to monitor stress levels even for the extreme conditions in discontinuous
    orchards. Two pre-visual indicators of water stress proposed in the literature
    are the Physiological Reflectance Index (PRI) (Gamon et al., 1992), an index sensitive
    to the epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and to photosynthetic
    efficiency, serving as a proxy for water stress detection (Peguero-Pina et al.,
    2008, Suárez et al., 2009, Suárez et al., 2010, Suarez et al., 2008, Thenot et
    al., 2002), and the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence emission (Flexas et
    al., 2000, Flexas et al., 2002, Flexas et al., 1999, Moya et al., 2004) due to
    the link demonstrated between steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence and stomatal
    conductance. Although PRI was initially proposed as an indicator of the de-epoxidation
    state of the xanthophyll pigments and related to photosynthesis, recent studies
    demonstrate the sensitivity of this index for vegetation stress detection (Peguero-Pina
    et al., 2008, Suárez et al., 2009, Suárez et al., 2010, Suarez et al., 2008, Thenot
    et al., 2002). Therefore, PRI could be used for water stress detection as an alternative
    to thermal measurements, enabling the use of high spatial resolution capabilities
    that are more difficult in the thermal region. The other pre-visual water stress
    indicator is chlorophyll fluorescence, as several studies demonstrated its link
    with photosynthesis and other plant physiological processes (Krause and Weis,
    1984, Larcher, 1994, Lichtenthaler, 1992, Lichtenthaler and Rinderle, 1988, Papageorgiou,
    1975, Schreiber and Bilger, 1987, Schreiber et al., 1994). Steady-state chlorophyll
    fluorescence (Fs) has received less attention than other fluorescence measures,
    but its potential as a physiological indicator of stress using remote sensing
    methods has been recently emphasized (Soukupová et al., 2008), along with increasing
    scientific interest during the past five years. Nevertheless, retrieval of the
    fluorescence signal is very challenging since the contribution to the radiance
    signal is estimated to be about 2–3%. Several methods have been reported to extract
    the fluorescence signal at the leaf and canopy levels (Meroni et al., 2004, Meroni,
    Picchi, et al., 2008, Meroni et al., 2009, Meroni, Rossini, et al., 2008, Moya
    et al., 2004), which demonstrated the feasibility of fluorescence retrieval using
    the O2-A band feature. Additional experiments conducted at 0.065 nm FWHM resolution
    using ratios between the 757 nm (out) and 760 nm (in) bands (Pérez-Priego et al.,
    2005) showed good diurnal relationships between fluorescence and water stress
    levels at the canopy scale. Nevertheless, little work has been conducted for validation
    purposes at the airborne scale due to the lack of appropriate imagery at high
    spatial and spectral resolutions. Recent work (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009) applied
    the in-filling method to 1 nm FWHM multispectral imagery acquired over peach,
    orange and olive orchards for water and nutrient stress detection. A thorough
    review of fluorescence detection methods can be found in Meroni et al. (2009),
    where the methodologies for fluorescence retrieval as a function of the type of
    instrument and number of bands available are discussed. Along these research objectives,
    a recent study assessed the impact of spectral sensor configurations on the Fraunhofer
    Line Depth (FLD) retrieval accuracy (Damm et al., 2011). A modeling work was used
    to study the effects of the spectral sampling interval, spectral resolution, signal
    to noise ratio, and spectral shift on the accuracy of the Fs retrievals using
    three FLD methods available. Results indicated the superior performance of the
    FLD3 method, the critical impact of the signal to noise ratio of the instrument
    used, and the feasibility for F retrievals with sensor configurations of 5 nm
    spectral resolution and small sampling intervals. Although PRI, fluorescence and
    canopy temperature have been proposed for water stress detection, their use has
    not been assessed over an entire season. In addition, the sensitivity of both
    temperature and PRI measured at the tree crown level needs further study, including
    an assessment for a new index formulation for PRI using the 515 nm wavelength
    as a reference band (Hernández-Clemente et al., 2011). The research reported here
    used continuous leaf and crown measurements of temperature and PRI during a citrus
    experiment to assess the seasonal variations in water stress levels. In addition,
    a micro-hyperspectral imager and a thermal camera were installed on board an unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV), and the imagery used to extract pure crown temperature,
    radiance and reflectance spectra to estimate chlorophyll fluorescence, visible
    ratios and structural indices for water stress detection. The Vegetation Fluorescence
    Canopy Model (FluorMOD) (Miller et al., 2004), a linked leaf model FluorMODleaf
    (Pedrós et al., 2004, Pedrós et al., 2008), and a canopy model FluorSAIL (Verhoef,
    2004) were used to simulate canopy fluorescence and scattered radiance. Although
    the model requires further validation and refinement, FluorMOD was used as a tool
    for understanding the effects of the spectral bandwidth of the airborne sensor
    used to image the orchard for the retrieval of fluorescence through the FLD method.
    2. Materials and methods Field measurements were carried out during the 2010 irrigation
    season (from June through October) in a commercial citrus orchard, including leaf
    stomatal conductance (Gs), water potential (Ψ), and continuous point measurements
    of crown temperature and PRI. High resolution thermal and hyperspectral imagery
    was collected over the citrus orchard in September 2010 to assess the sensitivity
    of vegetation indices and canopy temperature for water stress detection. 2.1.
    Field experiments and airborne campaigns 2.1.1. Field data collection The study
    was carried out in 2010 in two 0.6-ha plots of orange and mandarin trees in a
    commercial orchard located near La Campana, Seville (Spain) (37.8°N, 5.4°W). The
    orange trees (Citrus sinensis L. cv. Powell) were planted in 1997 in a 7 m × 4
    m grid (358 trees/ha) in deep alluvial soil with a loam to sandy-loam texture.
    The mandarin (Citrus reticulata Blanco cv. Clemenvilla) orchard was planted in
    1997 in a 7 m × 3 m grid. The climate in the area is Mediterranean, characterized
    by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters, with an average annual rainfall and
    ETo (Penman–Monteith) of around 550 and 1300 mm, respectively. Four irrigation
    treatments were set up: i) farmer irrigation management (computed according to
    commercial practices); ii) 100% ET, where irrigation was scheduled to satisfy
    full (100%) ET requirements (estimated as crop evapotranspiration); iii) Regulated
    Deficit Irrigation (RDI1), with a deficit irrigation period (dates are shown in
    Table 1), where only 37% ET was applied; and iv) RDI2, similar to RDI1, but where
    the level of water application during the deficit irrigation period was 50% ET.
    Crop evapotranspiration was estimated as a crop coefficient (adapted to local
    conditions), and ETo was calculated from meteorological data provided by an automatic
    weather station located 10 km from the orchard. Each treatment was applied to
    individual plots of 12 trees and repeated four times. Table 1 lists the treatments,
    irrigation periods and depths, ground data collection and harvest and imagery
    acquisition dates for the orchard used in this study. Over the growing season,
    a Scholander pressure bomb (PWSC Model 3000, Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., CA,
    USA) was used to measure xylem water potential (Ψ) weekly or biweekly around noon
    on 4 selected trees per treatment. Stomatal conductance was measured on 12 trees
    using a leaf porometer (model SC-1, Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) at
    the time of the flights. On the same day, the number of water potential measurements
    was increased to a total of 40 monitored trees, representing a wide range of water
    stress conditions. Table 1. Summary of each study site, ground data collected,
    and imagery acquisition dates. The treatments under RDI had a withheld period
    (no irrigation) followed by a re-watering period until their stem water potential
    was equal to the control. Species Treatments Irrigation strategy Withheld period

    ET Ψ, Gs Ψ Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence measurements made under natural light
    conditions were conducted using the Pulse-Amplitude-Modulated Fluorometer PAM-2100
    (Heinz Walz GMBH, Effeltrich, Germany), measuring steady-state Fs fluorescence
    on 8 selected trees, 30 leaves/tree. Fluorescence measurements were conducted
    at three times over the course of the day from 9.00 h until 15:00 h local time
    in order to monitor the diurnal variation of Fs for well-watered and water-stressed
    trees. Leaf PRI measurements calculated as (R570 − R531) / (R531 + R570) (Suárez
    et al., 2009, Suárez et al., 2010, Suarez et al., 2008) were conducted on 4 mandarin
    trees (two trees under 100% ET irrigation treatment, and two RDI1 water-stressed
    trees), measuring each date 30 leaves/tree with a PlantPen instrument (Photon
    Systems Instruments, Brno, Czech Republic) for a total of 9 days from June until
    late September. Leaf PRI measurements were conducted between 11.00 h and 12.00
    h local time on each date. In addition to the single-date measurements conducted
    for water potential, stomatal conductance, steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence,
    and leaf PRI, a total of 8 trees were instrumented with IRR-P thermal sensors
    (22° half-angle FOV) (Apogee, UT, USA) and 4 canopy PRI sensors (25° FOV) (SKR
    1800, Skye Instruments, Powyd, UK), acquiring continuous thermal and PRI crown
    data (calculated as (R570 − R531) / (R570 + R531)) from May 2010 throughout the
    entire season in the mandarin and orange orchards. The multispectral Skye sensors
    were installed in tandem with the IRR-P thermal sensors, both targeting the same
    crown spots and acquiring at 530 and 570 nm bands with a 10 nm FWHM bandwidth.
    An additional PRI sensor was installed in the field for continuous measurement
    of downwelling irradiance using a cosine diffuser. The measurements were acquired
    at a rate of 1/s and were aggregated to store the mean value at 5-minute intervals
    in dataloggers installed in the field (model CR10X, Campbell Sci., UT, USA). Air
    temperature (Ta) data were measured continuously in the field with a Vaisala Weather
    Transmitter (model WXT510, Vaisala Oyj, Helsinki, Finland) installed in the study
    site 1 m above the trees. The single-band infrared temperature (IRT) sensors covered
    the 6.5-14 μm range, and were assessed both in the laboratory and under natural
    sun conditions to characterize the IRT response to diurnal temperature variation
    (Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2006), yielding errors within the accuracy limits of the
    instrument, ± 0.4 °C, over a 5 °C to 40 °C range. All upwelling and downwelling
    instruments were calibrated in the laboratory using a uniform calibration body
    (integrating sphere, CSTM-USS-2000C Uniform Source System, LabSphere, NH, USA)
    at two different levels of illumination. Additionally, a radiance calibration
    was conducted at noon twice on each of the four upwelling PRI sensors using three
    lambertian panels of 2% (black), 50% (gray) and 98% reflectance (white) (LabSphere,
    NH, USA). The aim was to ensure a proper radiance calibration over the season
    and to test the linearity of the instruments under natural light conditions. 2.1.2.
    Airborne campaigns An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform for remote sensing
    research was developed at the Laboratory for Research Methods in Quantitative
    Remote Sensing (QuantaLab, IAS-CSIC, Spain) to carry a payload with thermal and
    hyperspectral imaging sensors (Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Suarez and Fereres, 2009,
    Zarco-Tejada et al., 2008). The UAV consisted of a 5-m wingspan fixed-wing platform
    capable of carrying a 3 kg payload for 1.5 h endurance at 13.5 kg take-off weight
    (TOW) (Viewer, ELIMCO, Seville, Spain). The UAV was controlled by an autopilot
    for autonomous flight (AP04, UAV Navigation, Madrid, Spain) to follow a flight
    plan using waypoints. The autopilot consists of a dual CPU controlling an integrated
    Attitude Heading Reference System (AHRS) based on a L1 GPS board, 3-axis accelerometers,
    yaw rate gyros and a 3-axis magnetometer (Berni et al., 2009b). Communication
    with the ground was conducted through a radio link where position, attitude and
    status data were transmitted at 20 Hz frequency; this also acted as a communication
    link for the operation of remote sensing hyperspectral and thermal cameras on
    board the UAV. The hyperspectral imager installed on board the UAV was a micro-hyperspectral
    camera (Micro-Hyperspec VNIR model, Headwall Photonics, MA, USA) flown in the
    spectral mode of 260 bands at 1.85 nm/pixel at 12-bit radiometric resolution,
    yielding an FWHM of 3.2 nm with a 12-micron slit, and 6.4 nm with a 25-micron
    slit. Data acquisition and storage on board the UAV was set to 50 fps, and integration
    time was 18 ms. The current system operated by QuantaLab-IAS-CSIC (Spain) is capable
    of acquiring 320 bands in the 400-1000 nm region, although the campaign described
    here was flown with 260 bands in the 400–885 nm region due to storage and data
    rate limitations at the time of the campaign. The 8-mm optics focal length yielded
    an IFOV of 0.93 mrad, an angular FOV of 50°, obtaining a swath of 522 m at 53
    × 42 cm resolution, resampled to 40 cm for a flight conducted at 575 m AGL altitude
    and 75 km/h ground speed. The airborne campaign over the orchard consisted on
    flightlines acquired in the solar plane at 11.00 am local time on September 14th
    2010, acquiring both hyperspectral and thermal imagery. The hyperspectral imager
    was radiometrically calibrated using coefficients derived from measurements made
    with a calibrated uniform light source (integrating sphere, CSTM-USS-2000C Uniform
    Source System, LabSphere, NH, USA) at four different levels of illumination and
    six different integration times. Hyperspectral imagery was atmospherically corrected
    using the total incoming irradiance at 1 nm intervals simulated with the SMARTS
    model developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, US Department of
    Energy (Gueymard, 1995, Gueymard, 2001) using aerosol optical depth measured at
    550 nm with a Micro-Tops II sunphotometer (Solar LIGHT Co., Philadelphia, PA,
    USA) collected in the study areas at the time of the flights. SMARTS computes
    clear sky spectral irradiance, including direct beam, circumsolar, hemispherical
    diffuse, and total on a tilted or horizontal plane for specified atmospheric conditions.
    The algorithms were developed to match the output from the MODTRAN complex band
    models within 2%, but using aerosol optical depth as input. The spectral resolution
    is 0.5 nm for the 280–400 nm region, 1 nm for the 400–1750 nm, and 10 nm for 1750–4000
    nm spectral regions. This radiative transfer model has been previously used in
    other studies to perform the atmospheric correction of narrow-band multispectral
    imagery, such as in Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Suarez and Fereres, 2009, Suárez et al.,
    2010. The output irradiance at 0.5 and 1 nm spectral bandwidth from SMARTS has
    been used as a reference irradiance spectra for solar energy studies (Gueymard
    et al., 2002) and available at http://www.nrel.gov/ (Gueymard, 2005). An inertial
    measuring unit (IMU) installed on board the UAV synchronized with the hyperspectral
    imager was used to ortho-rectify the imagery using PARGE (ReSe Applications Schläpfer,
    Wil, Switzerland) (Fig. 1a). The orchard study site used for field data collection
    can be seen in Fig. 1b. The high resolution hyperspectral imagery acquired over
    the orchard enabled single tree identification for field validation purposes (Fig.
    1c), successfully separating pure crown from shaded and sunlit soil reflectance.
    Each single pure tree crown from the entire orchard was identified using automatic
    object-based crown-detection algorithms, enabling the extraction of average crown
    radiance (Fig. 2a) and reflectance (Fig. 2b) for the 260 spectral bands acquired
    over the entire orchard. Each extracted crown was labeled as a function of the
    water stress treatment block (Fig. 3a), and each single crown spectrum was used
    for the analysis conducted through crown-level vegetation index calculation (Fig.
    3c). Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size image

    Sixteen experimental irrigation blocks designed for well-watered (100%ET) and
    regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) schemes used for pure crown radiance and reflectance
    extraction (a) from the micro-hyperspectral imagery acquired at 40 cm resolution
    and 260 bands at 6 nm FWHM (c). The same experimental field was imaged using a
    high resolution thermal camera acquiring at 40 cm pixel size (b), enabling the
    extraction of pure tree crown temperature from each irrigation block (d). The
    two central trees of each irrigation treatment block (a total of 32 trees) plus
    8 additional selected trees (40 trees in total) were used for water potential
    measurements conducted on the date of the airborne flight over the orange study
    site, September 14, 2010. The data extracted from each single crown using the
    hyperspectral reflectance imagery were used to calculate indices related to: i)
    epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle (EPS); ii) chlorophyll a + b concentration;
    iii) blue/green/red ratio indices; iv) carotenoid concentration; and v) tree crown
    structure. The xanthophyll pigment indices were the Photochemical Reflectance
    Index (PRI) calculated with the 570 nm band as a reference (PRI570) (Gamon et
    al., 1992) and with the 515 nm band as a reference (PRI515) shown to minimize
    structural effects (Hernández-Clemente et al., 2011). The chlorophyll a + b indices
    consisted of the R750/R710 (ZM) (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2001), Vogelmann (VOG1 =
    R740/R720) (Vogelmann et al., 1993), and the family of indices based on the CARI
    index (TCARI = 3 * [(R700 − R670) − 0.2 * (R700 − R550) * (R700/R670)]) normalized
    by OSAVI ((1 + 0.16) * (R800 − R670) / (R800 + R670 + 0.16)) in the form suggested
    by Haboudane et al. (2002) (TCARI/OSAVI). The blue/green/red ratio indices consisted
    of the Greenness index G (R550/R670), blue/green indices (BGI1 = R400/R550; BGI2
    = R450/R550) (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2005) and blue/red indices (BRI1 = R400/R690;
    BRI2 = R450/R690), and the Lichtenthaler index (LIC3 = R440/R740) (Lichtenhaler
    et al., 1996). Other indices related to carotenoid concentration were calculated,
    including the R520/R500, R515/R570, and R515/R670 (see Meggio et al., 2010, Hernández-Clemente
    et al., 2011, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2005, for a full review of these indices).
    Structural indices were calculated to assess if changes in the tree crown structure
    due to water stress could be captured by NDVI (R800 − R670) / (R800 + R670) (Rouse
    et al., 1974), (Rougean and Breon, 1995), and other ratios such as the simple
    ratio SR (R800/R670) (Jordan, 1969), MSR ( ) (Chen, 1996), the OSAVI index, the
    triangular vegetation index TVI = 0.5 ∗ [120 ∗ (R750 − R550) − 200 ∗ (R670 − R550)]
    and the modified triangular index MTVI1 = 1.2 ∗ [1.2 ∗ (R800 − R550) − 2.5 ∗ (R670
    − R550)] (see Haboudane et al., 2004, for a complete review of structural indices
    developed for robust estimation of LAI in crops). Radiance spectra for each single
    tree (Fig. 4a), later used for fluorescence retrieval at each tree crown using
    the 760 nm O2-A in-filling method, were extracted (Fig. 4b) observing a total
    of 15 spectral bands within the O2-A feature. Radiance difference and ratio indices
    based on the in (L762 nm) and out bands (L747 nm; L780 nm), the integral of the
    oxygen absorption between bands 747–780 nm, the curvature index (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2000), and the FLD methods using two (FLD2) and three (FLD3) spectral
    bands were applied to the hyperspectral imagery to estimate the fluorescence signal.
    A full review of methods to estimate the fluorescence signal using FLD and different
    spectral fitting methods can be found in Meroni et al. (2010). Download : Download

    radiance spectra extracted from the 40 validation trees of the experiment at 40
    cm resolution (a) used for fluorescence quantification with the 760 nm O2-A FLD
    in-filling method. A total of 15 spectral bands at 6.4 nm FWHM within the O2-A
    feature were acquired (b). The study area was also imaged with a thermal camera
    to derive surface temperature for each single crown under study (Fig. 3b). The
    thermal camera used was the Miricle 307 (Thermoteknix Systems Ltd., Cambridge,
    UK) equipped with a 14.25 mm f1.3 lens, connected to a computer via USB 2.0 protocol.
    The image sensor was a Focal Plane Array (FPA) based on uncooled microbolometers
    with a resolution of 640x480 pixels and a spectral response in the range of 8-12
    μm, yielding a 25 μm pixel size. The camera delivered uncalibrated 14-bit digital
    raw images that were stored on board. Radiometric calibration was conducted in
    the laboratory using blackbodies under varying target and ambient temperatures
    to develop radiometric calibration algorithms. The sensor implemented an internal
    calibration for non-uniformity correction (NUC). Thermal images from the study
    area were acquired at 40 cm pixel resolution, enabling the retrieval of pure crown
    average temperature from each tree under study (Fig. 3d). Atmospheric correction
    methods were applied to the thermal imagery based on the MODTRAN radiative transfer
    model to obtain surface temperature. Local atmospheric conditions were determined
    by air temperature, relative humidity and barometric pressure measurements at
    the time of flight using a portable weather station (Model WXT510, Vaisala, Finland)
    and were used as input into MODTRAN. Atmospheric correction methods conducted
    with single-band thermal cameras were shown to provide successful estimation of
    vegetation surface temperature (Berni et al., 2009b). 2.2. Modeling the fluorescence
    retrieval with FluorMOD The standard retrieval of chlorophyll fluorescence through
    the in-filling method uses the canopy radiance (L) acquired from fluorescing (v)
    and non-fluorescing (n) targets in (i) and out (o) of the oxygen feature found
    at 760.5 nm, defined as Liv, Lin, Lov, Lon, respectively, to calculate the reflectance
    (R) and fluorescence (F) signals (Eqs. (1), (2)). (1) (2) This method was successfully
    tested at the leaf and canopy levels (Meroni et al., 2004, Meroni, Picchi, et
    al., 2008, Meroni, Rossini, et al., 2008, Moya et al., 2004) and also using subnanometer
    resolution at the canopy level for stress detection (Pérez-Priego et al., 2005).
    The application of this methodology at the image level (Maier et al., 2002, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2009) requires modeling approaches to understand the effects of the instrument
    spectral resolution and pixel size when aggregating fluorescing and non-fluorescing
    targets. The effects of the atmosphere are critical for the correct estimation
    of the absolute fluorescence signal. This is important because both the radiance
    extracted from pure tree crowns and the irradiance spectra are needed to calculate
    F, therefore being critical in multi-temporal or diurnal airborne campaigns under
    changing atmospheric conditions. In this study, the F retrieval for each tree
    crown was conducted under constant atmospheric conditions for all the monitored
    trees, playing the atmospheric effects a lower role. The feasibility for estimating
    fluorescence with the hyperspectral imagery acquired as part of this study was
    assessed using the linked leaf-canopy fluorescence model developed as part of
    the FluorMOD project (Miller et al., 2004). FluorMODleaf (Pedrós et al., 2004)
    is a leaf fluorescence and reflectance model linked to FluorSAIL (Verhoef, 2004),
    a canopy reflectance and fluorescence model that simulates the fluorescence signal
    at the canopy level (detailed information on the linked leaf-canopy models can
    be found in Zarco-Tejada et al., 2006). In particular, the FluorMOD model was
    used in this study to assess the fluorescence retrieval FLD3 in-filling method
    (bands in L762 nm; out L747 nm and L780 nm) as a function of the spectral bandwidth
    of the hyperspectral instrument flown over the study sites in this study (see
    Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009, for simulations conducted to assess index sensitivity
    for fluorescence retrieval). A thorough modeling study conducted for a wide range
    of sensor configurations and FLD methods can be reviewed in Damm et al. (2011),
    which assessed the feasibility for F estimation as a function of the spectral
    sampling interval, spectral resolution, signal to noise ratio, and the spectral
    shift of the instrument used. The inputs required to run the leaf and canopy model
    (Table 2) are the number of layers in PROSPECT (N); chlorophyll a + b content
    in μg/cm2 (Cab); water equivalent thickness in cm (Cw); dry matter content in
    μg (Cm); fluorescence quantum efficiency (Fi); leaf temperature in °C (T); species
    temperature dependence (S); and stoichiometry of PSII to PSI reaction centers
    (Sto). The canopy model requires the viewing zenith angle in degrees (Vza), relative
    azimuth angle in degrees (Raz), canopy leaf area index (LAI), hot spot parameter
    (h), and leaf inclination distribution function (LIDF). Table 2. FluorMOD model

    leaf reflectance and transmittance spectra, along with the simulated fluorescence
    radiance for each reflectance and transmittance signal. The canopy fluorescence
    radiance (F) at 1 nm resolution was then simulated for each set of inputs (Fig.
    5a), observing the canopy signal added to the canopy radiance as a function of
    the fluorescence amplitudes. The canopy radiance simulated at 1 nm resolution,
    which included the fluorescence effects (Fig. 5b), reproduced the peak depth at
    760 nm used for fluorescence retrieval through the in-filling method (Fig. 5c).
    The similar spectral shape encountered both in the FluorMOD canopy radiance simulation
    in the 400–885 nm region and in the airborne hyperspectral imagery (Fig. 6a) shows
    the effects on the depth at 760 nm as a function of bandwidth (1 nm for the FluorMOD

    canopy radiance spectra obtained with FluorMOD were spectrally resampled with
    a gaussian convolution to simulate the FWHM of the airborne hyperspectral imager.
    The 760 nm peak depth decreased as a function of bandwidth (Fig. 7), while still
    showing the feature as compared with the original 1 nm FWHM spectra. Such effects
    caused by the bandwidth were assessed by applying the FLD3 in-filling algorithm
    retrieval method to the FluorMOD simulated datasets. A comparison of the F retrieval
    as a function of the spectra bandwidth was conducted to assess if the 6.4 nm FWHM
    of the airborne hyperspectral imagery would enable retrieval of the fluorescence
    signal to allow the water stress detection sought in this study. The method to
    estimate the fluorescence signal from the FluorMOD simulated synthetic spectra
    consisted on the same FLD3 method applied to the airborne hyperspectral imagery,
    which used the in (L762 nm) and out bands (L747 nm; L780 nm) for the calculation.
    As previously indicated, the FLD3 method and others suitable depending on the
    spectral data available (number of bands and spectral bandwidth available) can

    with FluorMOD The synthetic spectra simulated from FluorMOD for varying fluorescence
    emissions (Fi), chlorophyll concentration (Cab) and leaf area index values (LAI)
    showed good agreement for R (Eq. 1) (r2 = 0.99; p < 0.001) and F (Eq. 2) (r2 =
    0.84; p < 0.001) when calculated with 1 nm and 6 nm FWHM spectral resolution.
    The close relationship between the F signal calculated at 1 and 6 nm bandwidth
    (r2 = 0.84; p < 0.001) demonstrated that the 6 nm spectra would still capture
    the input fluorescence emission. The absolute error obtained when comparing the
    F signal retrieved with the FLD3 in-filling method for both spectral resolutions
    against the fluorescence radiance signal simulated at 1 nm resolution (Fig. 8)
    yielded RMSE values of 4.58% (for the 1 nm FWHM spectra) and 12.16% (for the 6
    nm FWHM spectra). The error increment obtained for the F retrieval (RMSE from
    4.58% to 12.16%) as a function of the spectral resolution used, and the overall
    coefficient of determination obtained when using 6 nm FWHM spectra (r2 = 0.75)
    suggests the potential retrieval of the fluorescence signal with larger spectral
    bandwidths and small sampling intervals when using the FLD3 method. Download :

    obtained between the simulated FluorMOD fluorescence radiance and the fluorescence
    estimated (FLD3 method) from synthetic spectra at 1 nm (RMSE = 4.58%) and 6 nm
    FWHM (RMSE = 12.16%). RMSE values below 15% are found when using the spectral
    resolution (6.4 nm FWHM), sampling interval (1.85 nm) and signal to noise ratio
    (300:1 without binning) of the micro-hyperspectral imager used in this study.
    Further comparison between the estimated F signal through the FLD3 method and
    the FluorMOD inputs Fi, Cab and LAI showed agreement between F and Fi (r2 = 0.8;
    p < 0.001), and the lack of relationship between F and LAI (r2 = 0.01; p-value
    not significant), and between F and Cab (r2 = 0.05; p-value not significant).
    These results demonstrate that the F signal retrieval using the FLD3 method is
    not correlated with Cab and LAI. Moreover, it shows that a statistically significant
    relationship (p < 0.001) exists between fluorescence quantum efficiency and F
    estimation when conducted with 6 nm FWHM resolution spectra (12.16% RMSE). This
    is the spectral resolution of the airborne micro-hyperspectral imager used to
    fly over the sites in this study. 3.2. Experimental results 3.2.1. Leaf and crown
    measurement results The diurnal leaf measurements conducted with the PAM-2100
    fluorometer on attached leaves selected from well irrigated (100%ET) and deficit
    irrigation (RDI1) trees (Fig. 9a) showed lower steady-state fluorescence emission
    (Fs) for the water stressed trees during the experiment, as expected. The diurnal
    trend showed greater Fs differences between 100% ET and RDI1 in early morning
    than at noon. These results from citrus trees showing lower Fs values in RDI1
    vs 100% ET irrigation levels coincide with the ones obtained in similar experiments
    in other crops, such as in olive and peach orchards under stress (Pérez-Priego
    et al., 2005, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009). Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    with the PAM-2100 from trees under 100% ET (well-watered) and RDI (water-stressed)
    treatments (n = 30 per tree at each measuring time; error bars are the standard
    deviation); (b) mean leaf PRI measurements acquired from trees under 100% ET and
    RDI1 treatments over the course of the experiment, using the PlantPen instrument
    (n = 30 per tree at each measuring time; error bars are the standard deviation).
    PRI calculated as (R570 − R531) / (R570 + R530). The June–September time-series
    leaf PRI data (calculated as (R570 − R531) / (R531 + R570)) measured with the
    PlantPen instrument (Fig. 9b) show the seasonal trend for both 100% ET and RDI1
    trees. Maximum differences in leaf PRI were found in July and August, corresponding
    to the times of maximum water potential differences among treatments (− 0.98 and
    − 1.73 MPa for 100% ET and RDI1 trees, respectively). The leaf PRI time series
    data showed the stress and recovery periods at the beginning and end of the irrigation
    experiment, with higher leaf PRI values measured for RDI1 than for the 100%ET,
    as expected. The well irrigated 100% ET trees showed a decline in PRI values from
    June (PRI = 0.046) until mid-July (PRI = 0.028), even though the water potential
    measured on the same trees was nearly identical (Ψ = − 0.84 MPa in June, and Ψ
    = − 0.86 MPa in July). Nevertheless, leaf PRI values measured on stressed trees
    were always higher than PRI values measured on 100% ET trees, in agreement with
    the work conducted by Suarez et al. (2008, 2009, 2010) in citrus and olive orchards.
    The seasonal variation of leaf PRI measurements could be due to changes in the
    xanthophyll epoxidation state over the season, but also due to potential effects
    caused by chlorophyll a + b, carotenoid and anthocyanin concentration as a function
    of the water stress. The leaf-level results obtained for Fs and PRI measured on
    stressed and well-watered trees had the intention to demonstrate that the results
    later obtained at canopy level were not caused by structural effects driven by
    water stress, but related to the physiological condition measured at the leaf
    level. Results for the leaf PRI measurements obtained throughout the season are
    in agreement with canopy PRI, canopy Tc and the Tc–Ta data recorded with the Skye
    and Apogee sensors installed over 100% ET and RDI1 crowns (Fig. 10). The trends
    for PRI calculated as (R570 − R531) / (R570 + R531) and Tc–Ta measured at noon
    throughout the entire experiment demonstrate a similar seasonal pattern for both
    crown PRI and crown Tc–Ta on the RDI1 treatment (Fig. 10a). The time-series data
    indicate that both canopy PRI and Tc–Ta were coupled throughout the experiment,
    showing a maximum for both indicators at the time of the maximum stress (Ψ = −
    1.73 MPa; Tc–Ta = 5 K; PRI = − 0.05), starting a recovery at the beginning of
    August when both Tc–Ta and PRI decreased together until the re-watering phase
    in mid-September. Although the general pattern for both indicators seemed similar
    throughout the experiment (Fig. 10a), a delay is observed on the PRI trend as
    compared against Tc–Ta: during the re-watering phase the crown temperature reaches
    Tc–Ta = 0 while PRI still shows values that indicate stress levels (PRI = − 0.1).
    Therefore, the re-watering phase was first tracked by Tc–Ta, followed later by
    PRI. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that canopy temperature
    is linked to transpiration rates, and therefore is more short-term sensitive to
    water stress than PRI, which is linked to the epoxidation state of the xanthophyll
    cycle pigments. In addition to the indicated biochemical effects on leaf PRI,
    crown structural changes over the course of the season would also have a role
    on the canopy PRI trends observed during stress and on the re-watering phase.
    The seasonal trend observed in the continuous PRI data acquired for the March–November
    time frame corresponds as well with seasonal changes of irradiance, air temperature
    and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) levels. Download : Download high-res image (335KB)

    phase (Fig. 11) shows the behavior of canopy PRI and Tc–Ta acquired for two RDI1
    trees as compared against a 100% ET reference tree. The patterns found indicate
    that the canopy PRI values measured on RDI1 trees started to decline after re-watering
    began, intersecting the non-water stress baseline (100%ET) at mid November (Fig.
    11a). The agreement between Tc–Ta measured on reference (100%ET) and deficit RDI1
    trees (Fig. 11b) shows that the recovery after re-watering started was detected
    earlier than when using PRI as an indicator of water stress. By the end of October
    the Tc–Ta values for 100% ET and RDI1 were equal (Tc–Ta below 1 K). Download :

    PRI and Tc–Ta values for the stressed (RDI1) trees (data shown are mean values
    for 5-minute intervals acquired at a rate of 1/s). PRI calculated as (R570 − R531)
    / (R570 + R531). The general pattern for the Tc–Ta and PRI data acquired throughout
    the experiment varied when targeting well-watered trees (100%ET). In such case,
    the Tc–Ta and PRI range of variation acquired throughout the experiment on 100%
    ET trees was much narrower than the values measured on RDI trees due to the reduced
    stress levels and small variation of stress during the experiment on 100% ET trees
    (Tc–Ta below 2 K for the 100% ET trees as compared to Tc–Ta values up to 5 K on
    the stressed RDI1 trees) (Fig. 10b). Moreover, the Tc–Ta and PRI data acquired
    on well-watered trees showed values related to non-stress levels during the course
    of the experiment, with Tc–Ta below 2 K and PRI values close to PRI = − 0.15 at
    all times. This was due to the full ET irrigation doses applied which assured
    low water stress conditions throughout the experiment, as demonstrated by the
    water potential measurements conducted: mean Ψ = − 1.00 MPa; maximum Ψ = − 0.73
    MPa; minimum Ψ = − 1.27 MPa (while the variation of the RDI1 during the experiment
    ranged between Ψ = − 0.90 MPa and Ψ = − 2.18 MPa). The water potential data measured
    on 100% ET and RDI1 trees over the entire experiment were compared against crown
    temperature and PRI (Fig. 12) to assess the seasonal trends during stress and
    recovery phases. The mid-day Tc and PRI canopy values for the dates when water
    potential measurements were made show an agreement between Tc and canopy PRI (Fig.
    12a) and between water potential and PRI (Fig. 12b) for the RDI1 stressed trees.
    Therefore Figs. 12a and 12b show a similar trend for the remote sensing indicators
    (PRI, Tc) as compared with ground-measured water potential (Ψ). Nevertheless,
    Fig. 12b shows that the water potential decreases rapidly after re-watering (Ψ
    from − 1.7 MPa down to − 0.9 MPa in mid September) while canopy PRI decreased
    at lower rate over such re-watering phase. The data obtained on the well-watered
    trees (100%ET) showed a general lack of relationship between Tc and PRI (Fig.
    12c) and between water potential and canopy PRI (Fig. 12d), probably due to the
    lower gradient found on the water potential measurements conducted over the season
    on the well-watered trees. These figures showed that the seasonal crown PRI and
    Tc–Ta data tracked water potential levels during the experiment, yielding coefficients
    of determination for PRI vs Ψ of r2 = 0.45 (p < 0.001), and Tc–Ta vs Ψ of r2 =
    0.44 (p < 0.001). Download : Download high-res image (426KB) Download : Download

    − R531) / (R570 + R531). 3.2.2. Airborne hyperspectral and thermal imagery results
    The hyperspectral and thermal airborne flights were conducted on September 14,
    prior to the re-watering phase, and therefore at the time of the maximum stress
    differences among treatment blocks. Based on the leaf water potential measurements
    observed (Ψ ranging from − 0.5 to − 2 MPa), the hyperspectral and thermal imagery
    acquired should be able to detect the stress levels measured in the field at the
    time of the flights. The high spatial resolution obtained in both hyperspectral
    and thermal imagery (40 cm resolution in both cases) enabled the identification
    of pure crowns (Fig. 1, Fig. 3), enabling the comparison of tree-level water stress
    measurements and airborne-derived indices of stress. The pure-crown temperature
    data extracted from the thermal imagery, and the narrow-band indices calculated
    from the hyperspectral imagery based on xanthophyll pigment absorption, chlorophyll
    a + b, blue/green/red ratios, carotenoid content, and structural indices were
    compared against the stomatal conductance and water potential measured at the
    time of the flights (Table 3). The best relationship with Gs was found for crown
    temperature (r2 = 0.78; p < 0.05) (Fig. 13a). The reflectance indices calculated
    based on PRI formulations using R570 as the reference band (PRI570) (Gamon et
    al., 1992) and the new formulation by Hernández-Clemente et al. (2011) (band R515
    as reference to minimize structural canopy effects, PRI515) yielded better performance
    for PRI515 (r2 = 0.59; p < 0.01) than for PRI570 (p-value not significant) (Fig.
    13c for PRI515). This result confirms the findings by Hernández-Clemente et al.
    (2011) in forest canopies, which demonstrated the robustness of PRI515 to structural
    effects. Table 3. Coefficients of determination (r2) obtained through temperature,

    and F (FLD3) (e), and against water potential (Ψ, MPa) (b, d, f). The chlorophyll
    indices TCARI and TCARI/OSAVI showed sensitivity to stress levels (r2 = 0.52;
    p < 0.05 for TCARI), and the blue/green ratio BGI1 was highly significant (r2
    = 0.62; p < 0.001). The effects of water stress on the canopy structure were captured
    by structural indices such as RDVI (r2 = 061; p < 0.01), TVI (r2 = 0.64; p < 0.01)
    and MTVI (r2 = 0.66; p < 0.01). These results for the structural indices are consistent
    due to the expected effects of sustained water stress on crown density. The fluorescence
    retrieval conducted with the micro-hyperspectral imager showed that the best results
    were obtained for the FLD method using two and three bands (r2 = 0.67; p < 0.05
    for Gs) (Fig. 13e) as compared with radiance difference calculations and fluorescence
    integral methods. Radiance difference calculations L747 − L762 (r2 = 0.39; p-value
    not significant), L780 − L762 (r2 = 0.55; p-value not significant) and ((L747
    + L780) / 2)-L762 (r2 = 0.49; p-value not significant) demonstrated lower performance
    than FLD2 and FLD3 methods (r2 = 0.67; p < 0.05). The ratio L747/L762 and L780/L762
    were not related to the physiological measures Gs and Ψ (r2 = 0.05; r2 = 0, respectively;
    p-value not significant). The results obtained for the FLD2 and FLD3 methods were
    similar (r2 = 0.67 for both methods; p < 0.05), confirming the results presented
    in Damm et al. (2011) for instruments with short sampling intervals and FWHM around
    5 nm. The curvature index calculated using bands 675, 682 and 690 nm yielded lower
    relationships, but statistically significant, for Gs (r2 = 0.47; p < 0.05) and
    Ψ (r2 = 0.51; p < 0.001) than when using the FLD2 and FLD3 methods. The differences
    found in the coefficients of determination and the statistical significance between
    the remote sensing indicators of stress and Gs and Ψ (Table 3) are related to
    the stomatal regulation. The feedback of stomatal regulation on leaf water status
    has been observed in a number of cases, and results in the conservative behavior
    of water potential with increasing levels of water stress. In particular, this
    feedback mechanism between water potential and stomatal closure has been observed
    in deciduous trees (Fereres and Goldhamer, 1990) and in citrus (Fereres et al.,
    1979), and could affect the relationship between leaf water potential and other
    indicators of water stress. In particular, the relationships with water potential
    were highly significant for Tc (r2 = 0.34; p < 0.001) (Fig. 13b), PRI515 (r2 =
    0.38; p < 0.001) (Fig. 13d), while the BGI1 index (blue/green ratio) yielded the
    highest significance level (p < 0.001) for both Gs (r2 = 0.62) and Ψ (r2 = 0.49).
    The structural indices RDVI, MTVI1 and TVI, which obtained r2 = 0.6 (p < 0.01)
    for Gs, showed high significance with Ψ (p < 0.001). Nevertheless, NDVI showed
    no significance with Gs and weaker sensitivity to Ψ (r2 = 0.24; p < 0.01). Chlorophyll
    fluorescence FLD3 retrievals demonstrated successful sensitivity to water stress,
    obtaining high statistical significance for both Gs and Ψ (r2 = 0.66; p < 0.001)
    (Fig. 13f). The fluorescence retrievals obtained with the FLD3 method for the
    entire hyperspectral scene showed the spatial variability of the F signal from
    each single tree crown, and the differences detected between adjacent orchard
    fields (Fig. 14a). Within the experimental field, the fluorescence signal estimated
    from the two central trees of each treatment block was interpolated to generate
    a continuous fluorescence map of the experiment (Fig. 14b), enabling the visual
    comparison against the water potential map obtained from Ψ measurements conducted
    on each treatment (Fig. 14c). Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    the requirements for high spectral resolution instruments for the successful retrieval
    of chlorophyll fluorescence using subnanometer radiance data at the leaf (Meroni
    & Colombo, 2006) and canopy levels (Pérez-Priego et al., 2005). These studies
    demonstrated with experimental data that subnanometer spectral resolution spectrometers
    enabled the detection of steady-state fluorescence emission using the O2-A absorption
    line for stress detection purposes. The interest on the very high spectral resolution
    was later supported in studies by Meroni et al. (2009, 2010) where a review on
    FLD and spectral fitting methods for the fluorescence retrieval as a function
    of the instrument configuration was conducted. Further, interest in spectral fitting
    methods as an alternative to FLD for F estimation with subnanometer spectral resolution
    increased under FLEX, FLuorescence EXplorer (European Space Agency, 2008), submitted
    to the European Space Agency (ESA) Earth Explorer program as a candidate algorithm
    for the scientific satellite mission concept. Along these efforts focused on the
    very high spectral resolution data, Zarco-Tejada et al. (2009) demonstrated that
    imaging chlorophyll fluorescence retrieval was feasible using 1 nm spectral resolution
    imagery acquired with a multispectral camera at 150 m altitude, using the 760.5
    (in) and 757.5 nm (out) bands for the quantification of the solar-induced fluorescence
    at 15 cm pixel resolution. Other critical issues such as the assessment of the
    potential atmospheric effects were also investigated by Guanter et al. (2010).
    Although these studies confirm the feasibility for fluorescence detection using
    very high spectral resolution data (under 1 nm FWHM), the operational issues related
    to the calibration and signal to noise ratio of the required instrument when acquiring
    at such narrow bandwidths may have important implications on the retrieval accuracy,
    cost and sensor availability for imaging purposes. In fact, these studies demonstrated
    the feasibility for fluorescence retrieval using very high spectral resolution
    (below 1 nm FWHM), but no published work using modeling and experimental data
    demonstrated the need for subnanometer radiance for accurate quantification of
    the fluorescence emission. The first modeling study assessing such requirements
    was recently published by Damm et al. (2011). In a modeling study using FluorSAIL3,
    they evaluated the F retrieval accuracy in response to the most relevant sensor
    properties, including the spectral sampling interval, spectral resolution, signal
    to noise, and the spectral shift, along with different fluorescence retrieval
    methods. This relevant study demonstrated that the spectral resolution is important
    for the retrieval accuracy (up to 40% error was estimated as a function of the
    spectral resolution of the instrument), but the spectral sampling interval caused
    12% error, and the spectral shift a 7% error. But more important, Damm et al.
    (2011) demonstrated that iFLD and FLD3 methods were able to retrieve the fluorescence
    signal when using lower spectral resolution (5 nm FWHM) and higher spectral sampling
    intervals (below 2.5 nm) with instruments with a minimum of 300:1 signal to noise
    ratio. These modeling results estimated an RMSE = 14% when a sensor configuration
    of 5 nm spectral resolution and a small sampling interval was used, and therefore
    are in agreement with the findings of this manuscript obtained with a micro-hyperspectral
    imager with 260 bands at 6 nm FWHM, 1.85 nm sampling interval (a total of 13 bands
    inside the O2-A feature), and a signal to noise ratio of 300:1 without binning
    to target pure crowns affected by water stress. Furthermore, Damm et al. (2011)
    and this study demonstrate that subnanometer spectral resolution is not a requirement
    for F retrieval using the FLD3 method when high signal to noise ratio and short
    sampling intervals are used with bandwidths ranging 4–6 nm FWHM. The work described
    in this manuscript used physiological indicators measured in the field, such as
    stomatal conductance and water potential, to assess if the fluorescence retrievals
    were in accordance with the expected stress levels of the experiment. The FLD3
    method was conducted at the crown level, therefore removing the effects of shadows
    and soil, and estimating the fluorescence signal from pure vegetation pixels.
    Fluorescence emission quantities estimated in this manuscript were in agreement
    with other published work by Meroni et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009, Damm
    et al., 2011. Studies such this one conducted with very high spatial resolution
    hyperspectral imagery (below 1 m pixel size) are needed for better understanding
    of the fluorescence signal retrieved from pure and mixed vegetation pixels, as
    well as for validating the available methods for fluorescence estimation. The
    work conducted with high resolution airborne imagery to target pure vegetation
    pixels is a first step required for understanding the fluorescence signal retrieved
    from different species and canopy structures. This is critical for making progress
    on the fluorescence estimation conducted from medium resolution instruments over
    aggregated pixels which include mixed vegetation, soil and shadows. In addition,
    the lack of fluorescence simulation models valid for non-homogeneous canopies
    prevents the assessment of the retrieval accuracy for validation studies under
    important targets such as forestry areas and cash crops like vineyards and tree
    orchards. The development of a model appropriate for open canopies will serve
    the scientific community to evaluate if the fluorescence retrieval under varying
    viewing geometries, direct soil contributions and percentage cover is feasible,
    as well as to better understand the fluorescence retrieval from mixed pixels.
    Finally, seasonal and diurnal measurements conducted over instrument targets (trees,
    lysimeters, study sites) with dedicated point-sensors will advance the knowledge
    related to the seasonal patterns in physiological indices widely used, such as
    temperature and reflectance indices for physiological monitoring through photosynthetic
    pigment absorption such as chlorophyll content, xanthophylls, carotenoids and
    anthocyanins. The recent work conducted using unmanned aerial vehicles and micro-hyperspectral
    imagers for remote sensing research (Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Suarez and Fereres,
    2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2008) bring new possibilities for extensive validation
    and experimental studies to make critical progress on fluorescence retrieval methods
    using unprecedented submeter hyperspectral imagery. 5. Conclusions The work presented
    in this manuscript assessed thermal and multispectral domains for water stress
    detection in a citrus orchard. High resolution imagery acquired from a thermal
    camera and a micro-hyperspectral sensor on board an unmanned aerial vehicle enabled
    the identification of pure crowns, extracting the mean reflectance and temperature
    for individual trees where field measurements of stomatal conductance and water
    potential were measured. The experimental design comprised random blocks with
    full (100%ET), farmer irrigation method, and two deficit irrigation levels (RDI)
    offering a range of water stress levels. The time series acquired from regulated
    deficit treatments (RDI1) and well irrigated blocks (100%ET) treatment trees instrumented
    with thermal and PRI point sensors demonstrated that both Tc–Ta and PRI crown
    data were able to track the seasonal variation of stress and recovery at the end
    of the experiment. The time series data demonstrated a time delay in the sensitivity
    of PRI as compared to Tc–Ta variation. To ensure that PRI did not solely track
    crown structural variation over the course of the experiment, leaf-level PRI measurements
    were also acquired, demonstrating that leaf PRI data were also linked to water
    potential levels throughout the season. Nevertheless, leaf biochemical and canopy
    biophysical effects on PRI over the course of the season would also affect the
    PRI indices used to track water stress levels. The airborne flights conducted
    with a thermal camera and a micro-hyperspectral imager enabled water stress detection
    assessment by using crown temperature, narrow-band VIS–NIR formulations, and chlorophyll
    fluorescence. The simulation work conducted with the FluorMOD model for different
    spectral bandwidths demonstrated that the fluorescence signal retrieved through
    the FLD3 in-filling method was related to water potential and stomatal conductance
    measurements when 6 nm FWHM spectra was used. Among the different methods used
    to retrieve the fluorescence signal, including the radiance difference, the integral
    of the 760 nm peak, and the FLD2 and FLD3 methods, the sensitivity of fluorescence
    retrievals to water stress levels suggested that the FLD3 method using 747, 762
    and 780 nm bands was the best method with 6 nm FWHM and 1.85 nm sampling spectra.
    Among crown temperature, narrow-band indices, and fluorescence retrieval conducted
    from the airborne radiance spectra, the best indicators of water stress were crown
    temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence calculated with the FLD3 method, the PRI515
    index (reference band = 515 nm), which was more sensitive to water stress than
    PRI570 (reference band = 570 nm) as in Hernández-Clemente et al. (2011) in forest
    canopies. The BGI1 index calculated from the blue (R400) and green (R550) bands
    yielded the highest significance level (p < 0.001) for both Gs (r2 = 0.62) and
    Ψ (r2 = 0.49). Out of the structural indices assessed, RDVI, MTVI1 and TVI were
    related to Gs (p < 0.01), obtaining high significance with Ψ (p < 0.001), while
    NDVI showed no significance with Gs and a weak sensitivity to Ψ. Chlorophyll fluorescence
    calculated with the FLD3 method from the micro-hyperspectral imager demonstrated
    successful sensitivity to stress levels, yielding r2 = 0.67 (p < 0.05) with Gs,
    and r2 = 0.66 (p < 0.001) with water potential. The fluorescence estimations from
    the hyperspectral imagery were in agreement with ground measurements of fluorescence,
    which demonstrated lower values in water stressed trees. The work presented in
    this manuscript demonstrated the ability to track stress levels in a citrus crop
    using thermal and hyperspectral imagery acquired with an unmanned aerial vehicle,
    showing that crown temperature, the blue-green BGI1 index, and the chlorophyll
    fluorescence estimates were the best related to water stress. Results confirmed
    previous work that showed the link between PRI and Tc, and the superior performance
    of PRI515 vs PRI570. The use of lightweight micro-hyperspectral imagers and miniature
    thermal cameras on board UAV platforms will enable flexible and cost-effective
    data collection campaigns for precision agriculture and environmental applications
    in the near future. Acknowledgments Financial support from the Spanish Ministry

  explanation: '**Explanation:**


    This study uses unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data on plant water
    stress indicators such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and
    the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) with temperature indices such as the
    crop water stress index (CWSI). These data are used to estimate stomatal conductance
    and leaf water potential, which are useful physiological indicators of water stress.
    This information can be used to monitor crop health and predict irrigation requirements,
    leading to more efficient water management and improved agricultural productivity.


    The key points of the paper are as follows:


    * UAVs can be used to collect high-resolution data on plant water stress indicators,
    including NDVI, PRI, and temperature indices.

    * These data can be used to estimate stomatal conductance and leaf water potential,
    which are useful physiological indicators of water stress.

    * This information can be used to monitor crop health and predict irrigation requirements,
    leading to more efficient water management and improved agricultural productivity.'
  extract_1: UAVs can be used to collect high-resolution data on plant water stress
    indicators, including NDVI, PRI, and temperature indices.
  extract_2: Thermal imagery is also a common remote sensing technology used to assess
    water stress in plants, via thermal indices (calculated using artificial surfaces

    These indices have shown a great potential to determine field stress heterogeneity
    using unmanned aerial platforms.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Technological recent advances promote new
    reliable UAVs for precision agriculture. • UAVs can improve temporal and spatial
    sensing resolutions for water stress management. • Multi-spectral and thermal
    images from UAVs reflect water stress in several crop. • Easy and low-cost retrieving
    chlorophyll fluorescence from UAVs is an important challenge. Abstract Unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) present an exciting opportunity to monitor crop fields
    with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing capable of improving
    water stress management in agriculture. In this study, we reviewed the application
    of different types of UAVs using different remote sensors and compared their performance
    with ground-truth plant data. Several reflectance indices, such as NDVI, TCARI/OSAVI
    and PRInorm obtained from UAVs have shown positive correlations related to water
    stress indicators such as water potential (Ψ) and stomatal conductance (gs). Nevertheless,
    they have performed differently in diverse crops; thus, their uses and applications
    are also discussed in this study. Thermal imagery is also a common remote sensing
    technology used to assess water stress in plants, via thermal indices (calculated
    using artificial surfaces as references), estimates of the difference between
    canopy and air temperature, and even canopy conductance estimates derived from
    leaf energy balance models. These indices have shown a great potential to determine
    field stress heterogeneity using unmanned aerial platforms. It has also been proposed
    that chlorophyll fluorescence could be an even better indicator of plant photosynthesis
    and water use efficiency under water stress. Therefore, developing systems and
    methodologies to easily retrieve fluorescence from UAVs should be a priority for
    the near future. After a decade of work with UAVs, recently emerging technologies
    have developed more user-friendly aerial platforms, such as the multi-copters,
    which offer industry, science, and society new opportunities. Their use as high-throughput
    phenotyping platforms for real field conditions and also for water stress management
    increasing temporal and resolution scales could improve our capacity to determine
    important crop traits such as yield or stress tolerance for breeding purposes.

    stressPrecision agricultureMulticoptersThermography 1. Introduction In general
    terms, agriculture consumes most of the world''s water resources (70%) (Gilbert,
    2012). At the same time, other industries are also increasing their water consumption
    and thus competing with food production. Current climate change predictions indicate
    increases in the frequency and intensity of drought periods in Mediterranean and
    semi-arid areas (Stocker et al., 2013). Globally, it is important to note that
    45% of the world''s food supply is produced on irrigated lands covering only 18%
    of cultivated areas (Döll and Siebert, 2002). This means that irrigation management
    is of crucial importance to optimize water use. Moreover, the predicted global
    food demand for 2050 indicates that crop production must double (Tilman et al.,
    2011). Increased crop production was strongly encouraged after World War II, resulting
    in the “Green Revolution” of the 60s. Now, a claim for a “Blue Revolution” seems
    to be occurring, focusing on agriculture''s environmental impacts and especially
    on optimizing water management to obtain the desired idea of “more crop per drop”
    (Beer et al., 2009). Thus, water efficiency is becoming more and more important
    for society. For example, the European Parliament recently introduced the requirement
    to sustainably “produce more with less” in agreement with the new EU research
    program “Horizon 2020” (Geoghegan-Quin, 2013). In this sense, precision agriculture
    appears to be a multidisciplinary approach capable of responding to the previous
    objectives. The American National Research Council defined this type of agriculture
    as “a management strategy that uses information technology to bring data from
    multiple sources to bear on decisions associated with crop production.” In fact,
    it involves all of the techniques and methods available in the new ICT (Information
    and Communications Technology) era, which can be used to retrieve useful information
    for managing crops while accounting for landscape heterogeneity and variability
    within and between fields (Lelong et al., 2008, Anderson and Gaston, 2013). However,
    interdisciplinary approaches will not be so easily realized; multi-disciplinary
    teams (experimental and computational scientists) will be required to integrate
    diverse data from multiple plant levels. Thus, a plant systems biology view will
    have to be used to scale this data up to an agricultural level (Fernie, 2012).
    For instance, most of the measurements used to characterize plant status are developed
    at the leaf level, while the improvement of agricultural management requires an
    up-scaling of this information to the canopy/field level. The characterization
    of one single plant is a time consuming, costly process; to carry out these types
    of characterizations for complete agricultural fields would be even more so (Berni
    et al., 2009a, Berni et al., 2009b, González-Dugo et al., 2012). Traditional remote
    sensing approaches place remote sensors on towers over crop fields (thermal imagery,
    multi and hyper-spectral cameras, fluorometers, etc.) where the main limitation
    is the fixed position from which data is collected. Another traditional remote
    sensing technique is the use of aircrafts or satellites where the temporal and
    spatial resolution significantly limits their usefulness for agricultural assessments
    (it is important to consider the highly dynamic changes in vegetation in relation
    to the environment) (Moya et al., 2004, Louis et al., 2005, Berni et al., 2009a,
    Anderson and Gaston, 2013, Jones, 2014). In this context, UAVs (unmanned aerial
    vehicles) and remote sensing come into play as useful tools because they are able
    to fill this important gap, coupled with aerial imagery and adequate computational
    efforts. Some studies have also been developed using different ground manned vehicles
    equipped with remote sensors at affordable costs, but these also present constraints
    since transporting the equipment to the monitoring areas reduces the swath mapping
    capability, and in some cases, their use is only available during crop harvesting
    (Lelong et al., 2008). In recent years, the use of UAVs for civilian purposes
    has begun to increase thanks to technological advances, cost reductions and the
    size of sensors related to the Global Position System (GPS), pre-programmed flights,
    IMUs (inertial movement units) and auto-pilots. In this sense, UAV technology
    can fill the gap of knowledge between the leaf and the canopy by improving both
    the spatial and the temporal resolution of the most common current remote sensing
    systems. Thirty years ago, a fleet of airborne imagery thermal scanners was envisioned
    to map thermal stress for water management purposes (Jackson et al., 1977, Berni
    et al., 2009b); now it seems like we are finally achieving this idea thanks to
    the emergence of UAV technologies. This review considers the latest remote sensing
    experiences obtained from different types of UAVs applied to agriculture and their
    potential ability to assess plant water status at the crop-scale. Additionally,
    it highlights the different remote sensing indices obtained from UAV technology
    and their ability to estimate plant physiological parameters. Finally, the future
    perspectives and potentials of UAVs are addressed. 2. UAVs applied to precision
    agriculture UAVs have historically been used principally for military purposes.
    After World War II they began to be used as targets or weapon reconnaissance platforms.
    Recently, other civilian purposes, such as agricultural management, have created
    an increased interest in them. In Table 1 we compiled all of the agronomy studies
    that have been published up until now which employed UAVs and remote sensing technologies
    compared with plant-truth data measurements. Types of UAVs and flight characteristics
    are also briefly mentioned (Table 1). Previously, the pioneering works of Herwitz
    et al., 2002a, Herwitz et al., 2002b, Herwitz et al., 2004 described the usefulness
    of UAVs to detect irrigation and fertilization abnormalities and fruit maturation
    of crops in agricultural fields. These NASA-funded projects used UAVs like the
    solar-powered Pathfinder-Plus (with a wing span of 36.3 m and a weight of 318
    kg), with a flying capacity of several hours, equipped with visible and multi-spectral
    cameras to acquire images (0.5 and 1 m/pixel, respectively) of a coffee plantation
    in Hawaii at 6400 m altitude. Another example of large fixed wing UAVs is the
    RCATS/APV-3 (also developed by NASA), which has been used to study vineyards in
    California (Johnson et al., 2003) (Table 1). In the last decade, technological
    advances have led to the development of micro-UAVs (less than 5 kg) mostly due
    to the reduction in weight and size of the sensors, and considerable increases
    in precision, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs) and the auto-pilots using
    GPS (Global Positioning Systems) (Berni et al., 2009a, Turner et al., 2012). Table

    bacteria infected citrus trees. Mainly two types of UAVs have been employed for
    agricultural management: helicopters and fixed wing airplanes (Sugiura et al.,
    2005, Berni et al., 2009a, Berni et al., 2009b, Xiang and Tian, 2011, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013a) (Table 1). Both aerial platforms have
    several advantages and limitations. While unmanned helicopters have more complex
    flight systems, they offer lower flight altitudes and hover capacities (ability
    to maintain a stable position in flight) or low-speed flights. However, they are
    also able to cruise in any direction in the field and have no special requirements
    for take-off and landing, which could be critical in standard agricultural fields.
    Recently, it was published that the Pheno-copter UAV, a gas-based helicopter with
    a payload of 1.5 kg can fly for 30 min considerably improving the number of remote
    sensors able to equip at the same time and the length of the area studied (Chapman
    et al., 2014). The fixed-wing aircrafts offer more simple flight systems and longer
    durations, increasing their capacity to cover wider areas. However, their flight
    altitude is higher, thus reducing the image resolution. They are also not able
    to hover and require specific runways (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2013a). To meet the advanced requirements, in recent years a new aircraft
    platform appeared, the multi-copter (Table 1), whose flight characteristics are
    similar to the helicopters previously mentioned (Turner et al., 2012, Primicerio
    et al., 2012, Gago et al., 2013). Multi-copters were first designed as universal
    aerial platforms mainly dedicated to aerial film/photography with great stability
    and maneuverability and no take-off or landing runway requirements (Fig. 1A).
    However, compared to helicopters, these types of platforms have proved to be more
    user-friendly than the previous ones, allowing for an increase in the number of
    possible users as can be seen in the emergent market for professional and non-professional
    applications of the multi-copter (AR.Drone Parrot®, Mikrokopter®, MeCamAlwaysInnovating®,
    Amazon®). This could be an additional benefit because their prices are coming
    down and they could be operated by the farmers themselves to obtain data almost
    immediately, diagnose crop status, and then apply adapted water management as
    needed. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. (A) UAV-AirSci carbon fiber

    materials (such as carbon fiber, aluminum, glass fiber and kevlar) developed with
    couples of brushless motors running clockwise and counter-clockwise, respectively
    (4, 6 or 8 engines depending on the payload requirement). They are powered with
    lithium ion polymer batteries, and each motor can handle high amperes, for example
    ca. 20 A which promotes thrusts greater than 2200 g (Turner et al., 2011, Gago
    et al., 2013, García-Ruiz et al., 2013) (Fig. 1A). This power supports considerable
    payloads in these aircrafts (a six engine multi-copter can carry more than 1 kg),
    however, the flight time is, unfortunately, drastically reduced to 4–5 min, so
    multiple flights may be necessary to cover wider areas (Turner et al., 2012, Chapman
    et al., 2014). The type of UAV required will, thus, depend on the goal of the
    study or the end-product desired (Fig. 2, “Experimental design”). Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Workflow summary of the different components that must
    be considered for the use of UAVs in precision agriculture. This scheme is divided
    into 4 general tasks: experimental design (blue), data acquisition (green), data
    processing (red) and results/end products (yellow). (For interpretation of the
    references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
    of this article.) The different types of UAVs currently have several different
    advantages and limitations. Nevertheless, this technology could potentially revolutionize
    temporal and spatial agriculture and ecophysiology at a close range compared to
    the other more traditional methodologies (Anderson and Gaston, 2013), such as
    satellite imagery and manned flights (whose availability is limited by weather
    conditions, re-visit times and significant costs) (Turner et al., 2012). 3. Remote
    sensing of plant physiology from UAVs There is currently great interest in remote
    sensing technologies able to provide information about plant biophysical parameters
    and physiological status (Jones and Vaughan, 2010). However, the reliability of
    aerial remote sensing approaches must be assessed with plant-truth data (Fig.
    2, “Data acquisition”), e.g. with measurements related to plant growth and vigor
    (leaf area index (LAI), biomass, chlorophyll/carotene contents, plant water status
    (stomatal conductance (gs), and leaf water potential (Ψ)), (Lelong et al., 2008,
    Berni et al., 2009b, González-Dugo et al., 2012, González-Dugo et al., 2013, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012, Gago et al., 2013). Imagery remote sensing technologies are mainly
    based on particular leaves and canopies’ wavelength reflectances in the visible
    range of the spectrum (RGB, red, green and blue), non-visible as IR (Infra-red)
    and the emission of far-IR (thermal). Also, several recent efforts have been conducted
    regarding sensing the fluorescence of chlorophylls as a more dynamic proxy of
    the electron transport rate (ETR) and gross primary production than previous reflectance
    indices (Jones and Vaughan, 2010, Frankenberg et al., 2011, Araus and Cairns,
    2014, Guanter et al., 2014). Another field of increased interest is related to
    the phenotyping of varieties and cultivars with improved capabilities. A plant''s
    phenotype is the interaction between its genetic background and the environment.
    In the recent years, important efforts have been made to develop facilities, sensing
    technologies and methodologies to obtain high-throughput phenotyping platforms
    to help plant breeders analyze the final results of their work (Araus and Cairns,
    2014). Also, it is important to bear in mind that it could be difficult to extrapolate
    results obtained under growth chamber conditions to real field culture conditions
    (Araus and Cairns, 2014); thus, phenotyping at field conditions is highly desirable.
    Nevertheless, the environment is highly heterogeneous, which probably will complicate
    the interpretation of the results even using all the new emergent technologies
    and platforms. It is expected that, in the near future, field phenotyping paired
    with biotechnological advances will result in high throughput data collection
    and analysis of relevant biophysical plant traits at the crop scale (Deery et
    al., 2014, Araus and Cairns, 2014). 3.1. Indices based on leaf/canopy reflectance
    Leaf reflectance can be used as an indicator of plant function because the light
    reflected depends directly on a leaf''s pigment composition (e.g. chlorophylls
    and xanthophyll), which can indeed reflect plants’ physiological status (Jones
    and Vaughan, 2010). Typically, vegetation indices are derived from reflectance
    bands based on RGB (red, green, blue) and IR and other narrow-wavelengths of the
    spectra (Fig. 3). The remote monitoring of these specific reflectances are commonly
    measured using visible, multi-spectral and hyper-spectral cameras (Table 1) (Jones
    and Vaughan, 2010, Baluja et al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2013a, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013b). The most employed index is most likely
    the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI): where IR (infrared) is the
    reflectance in the near-infrared band (ca. 800 nm) and (R) in the red band (ca.
    680 nm), originally based on the satellite LandSat sensor bands for red and infrared.
    This index has commonly been used to detect plants and “greenness”, due to the
    elevated IR reflectance of chlorophylls, which are typically related to plant
    structural traits (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). Several studies have described
    the utility of UAVs equipped with multi-spectral cameras to examine the LAI through
    the NDVI index in herbaceous and woody crops such as wheat, corn and olive trees
    (Lelong et al., 2008, Berni et al., 2009a). Other indices have also recently been
    tested to obtain information related to plant physiological stress detection.
    Drought is still one of the most studied stress impulses since its potential implication
    for irrigation efficiency and scheduling is of utmost importance (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012 and references therein). In the last 4 years, several works have
    appeared, mainly driven by Dr. Zarco-Tejada''s research group, focused on checking
    the different VIs (vegetation indices) acquired from the UAVs, and then comparing
    them to field collected plant physiological measurements. The optimized index
    transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted
    vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) was proposed as a more sensitive VIs to chlorophyll
    content and insensitive to other factors that could affect canopy reflectance,
    such as the reflectance from the soil, solar zenith angle and the vigor of the
    plant (using the leaf area index (LAI) as proxy) (Haboudane et al., 2002). This
    composite index is a ratio between the TCARI, which is highly sensitive to chlorophyll
    concentrations, but still affected by noise from the soil background, mostly at
    low chlorophyll concentrations, (Haboudane et al., 2002): Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Leaf spectral reflectance plus thermal band of the electromagnetic
    spectrum for the different bands employed in the generation of the vegetation
    indices NDVI (6 and 3 and 4), TCARI/OSAVI (1, 4, 5 and 6), PRI (1 and 2) and PRInorm
    (1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) and thermal indices as CWSI or IG (7). Center and bandwidth
    wavelength of the bands can differ depending of the equipment employed. The OSAVI
    was designed to avoid soil reflectance without previous knowledge about the moisture
    status and physical soil properties (Haboudane et al., 2002): Several studies
    also showed the performance of a narrow band index named PRI (photochemical reflectance
    index, R550 − R531/R550 + R531) related to the energy dissipation through the
    epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments (Gamon et al., 1992). Recently,
    in vineyards Zarco-Tejada et al. (2013b) showed an improvement of the PRI index
    (photochemical reflectance index, R550 − R531/R550 + R531), the PRInorm, in relation
    to gs and Ψ for a daily course. The PRInorm = PRI/[RDVI·R700/R670], not only considers
    xanthophyll changes in concentration due to water stress (PRI), but also generates
    a normalization considering the chlorophyll content (thanks to the red edge index
    (R700/R670) that is sensitive to chlorophyll content) and canopy leaf area reduction
    (the RDVI, renormalized difference vegetation index, ) is sensitive to canopy
    structure) induced by stress (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013b). Table 1 shows the vegetation
    indices obtained from UAVs and compares them to plant-truth data collected at
    the plant level in the fields. NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI were clearly related to the
    stem water potential (Ψstem) (R2 = 0.68) and gs (R2 = 0.84) in vineyards cv. Tempranillo
    (Baluja et al., 2012). However, in Citrus orchards NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI were less
    correlated with gs (R2 = 0.32 and 0.45) and Ψ (R2 = 0.24 and 0.51) (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012). Indeed, “greenness” indices such as the NDVI are more related to
    plant vigor than the plant dynamic physiological status. This index might correlate
    well in crops where the biomass proportionally increases in parallel to photosynthesis,
    however, in other groups, such as the case of evergreen crop species, results
    were not so satisfactory (Peñuelas and Filella, 1998, Peng et al., 2011, Garbulsky
    et al., 2011, Marino et al., 2014). Other vegetation indices have also been tested
    (see Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012 for a complete description), showing higher correlations
    when narrow-band indices were associated with the xanthophyll cycle (PRI515) (R2
    = 0.59; p < 0.01 and 0.38; p < 0.001 for gs and Ψ, respectively). The blue/green
    index (R400/R550 bands) contrasted with both gs (R2 = 0.62; p < 0.001) and Ψ (R2
    = 0.49; p < 0.001, respectively). In grapevines, narrow-band reflectance indices
    such as the R515/R570 and the TCARI/OSAVI also showed correlation with xantophylls
    and the carotenoid content (R2 = 0.48; p < 0.01 and 0.51; p < 0.001, respectively)
    (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013a) (Table 1). This is most likely due to their photoprotective
    roles in thermal dissipation and their ROS (reactive oxygen species) neutralization
    under stress conditions (Evain et al., 2004, Garbulsky et al., 2011). The previous
    mentioned new index, the PRInorm, showed an improved capacity for water stress
    detection (correlated with leaf gs and Ψ) in comparison with other greenness and
    structural indices (commonly are more insensitive to dynamic changes in vegetation);
    PRInorm obtained correlations coefficients similar to those obtained indices with
    thermography (Table 1, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013b). Clearly, the interest in reflectance
    indices is to use them to scale-up to satellite imagery since the use of thermal
    imagery is constrained because of its poor resolution (100 m/pixel) which obtains
    mixed information from the plant and the background. 3.2. Indices based on leaf/canopy
    temperature Currently, one of the main assessments of plant stress via UAVs is
    naturally focused on plant water status, thus requiring the estimation of gs and
    Ψ at the leaf level since they are useful physiological water stress indicators
    (Medrano et al., 2002, González-Dugo et al., 2013). Thermal images are highly
    employed by UAVs to detect water stress in several crops, since drought promotes
    stomatal closure, reducing transpiration and evaporative cooling, while increasing
    leaf temperature. The development of miniature uncooled thermal sensors (with
    a spectral band range of 7–14 μm) has now been installed on small aircrafts to
    estimate crops’ surface temperature (Berni et al., 2009b, Gago et al., 2013).
    Thermal normalized indices (CWSI, IG and I3) were developed in the 70s and 80s
    to avoid the variability produced by environmental parameters affecting the relationship
    between stress and plant temperature (for detailed information Jones, 1999, Leinonen
    et al., 2006). As examples, the CWSI (crop water stress index) ranges from 0 to
    1 (values close to 1 are related to high levels of stress) (Idso et al., 1981),
    the IG directly increases with stomatal conductance and the I3 positively correlates
    with stomatal resistance (Jones, 1999, Leinonen et al., 2006), taking into account
    surface temperatures under wet and dry conditions as follows: (1) (2) (3) where
    Tcanopy is the surface temperature of the canopy and Twet and Tdry are reference
    surfaces that are completely wet or dry to simulate maximum and minimal leaf transpiration
    under the exposed environmental conditions. For more details about thermal indices,
    see Jones (1999) and Jones and Vaughan (2010). One of the main problems of thermal
    cameras is the reduced resolution provided by the microbolometer sensors (image
    resolution ranging from 320 × 240 to 640 × 480 pixels), increasing the problem
    of the “mixed-pixel value” where part of the temperature of the pixel comes from
    the background and not from the pure canopy, considerably reducing the quality
    of the data (Jones and Sirault, 2014). Another important consideration is the
    use of thermal cameras that integrate their own radiometric calibration system
    (Gago et al., 2013) or allow the radiometric calibration of the camera to be performed
    in the laboratory using blackbodies varying target and ambient temperature for
    the development of calibration algorithms (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). When meteorological
    data from the experimental site is available, gs can be estimated from aerial
    thermal images using the leaf energy balance (Monteith and Unsworth, 1990, Jones,
    1999). Alternative methodologies were published combining this model with dry
    and wet reference surfaces, highly useful to reduce the meteorological parameters
    required (Leinonen et al., 2006). The basic leaf energy balance equation (Eq.
    (4)) is: (4) where Tl and Ta are the canopy and air temperature (°C), rHR is the
    parallel resistance to heat and radiative transfer (s m−1), raw is the boundary
    layer resistance to water vapor (s m−1), rs is the stomatal resistance to water
    vapor (this resistance is assumed to be dominated mainly by stomata exchange),
    γ is the psychrometric constant (Pa K−1), Rni is the net isothermal radiation
    (Leinonen et al., 2006), p is the air density (kg m−3), cp is the air''s specific
    heat capacity (J kg−1 K−1), D is the vapor pressure deficit (Pa) and s is the
    slope of the curve of water vapor pressure related to the temperature (Pa C−1).
    Stomatal conductance, gs (gs = 1/rs), can be calculated by rearranging Eq. (5):
    (5) Combining leaf energy balance with thermal imagery to estimate the plant conductance
    (gc, canopy conductance considering the whole canopy instead of a leaf) can considerably
    improve crops water stress monitoring because it precisely defines plant water
    status (Flexas et al., 2002). This procedure avoids problems associated with thermal
    indices, such as the requirement of reference surfaces and normalization procedures
    necessary to calculate the vapor pressure deficit (VPD), which is site dependent
    and affects the CWSI estimation (Berni et al., 2009a). However, precise meteorological
    information is required (Leinonen et al., 2006) from different study sites. Several
    flight campaigns collected thermal indices of woody crops such as grapevines,
    olives, almonds, peaches, apricots, oranges and lemons in order to estimate plant
    physiological parameters (Berni et al., 2009a, Baluja et al., 2012, González-Dugo
    et al., 2012, González-Dugo et al., 2013, Gago et al., 2013) (Table 1). The CWSI
    showed a clear correlation with gs and Ψ for most of the studied crops, such as
    olives (R2 = 0.91 and 0.82; p < 0.001 respectively), grapevines (R2 = 0.86–0.68
    and 0.5), almonds (R2 = 0.67; p < 0.001 for Ψ), peaches and apricots (R2 = 0.92
    and 0.64; p < 0.001 for Ψ respectively). Meanwhile, no correlations were observed
    in orange and lemon orchards. In fact, only the difference between canopy temperature
    and air temperature (Tc − Ta) showed high correlations with Ψ in several woody
    crops, such as grapevines, almonds, peaches, lemons and apricots (R2 = 0.27–0.92)
    (González-Dugo et al., 2012, González-Dugo et al., 2013). Another study demonstrated
    that canopy conductance estimated using the leaf energy balance model (Jones,
    1999) in olive orchards, using the Tcanopy obtained from the UAV combined with
    other meteorological parameters obtained good correlation with leaf measured gs.
    Overall, UAVs applied to precision agriculture allow for the generation of spatially
    explicit crop-canopy map conductances (Berni et al., 2009a). 3.3. The challenge
    of measuring leaf chlorophyll fluorescence with UAVs Under determined conditions,
    NDVI and other vegetation indices reflect mostly the biomass and “greenness” of
    plants, even considering the fact that their sensitivity becomes weaker with increasing
    values of LAI beyond a threshold value (Carlson and Ripley, 1997). Other indices
    can track more dynamic traits and give us valuable information about the physiological
    status. Among these, the so-called photochemical reflectance index (PRI) reflects
    xanthophyll-dependent thermal dissipation of excess energy (Gamon et al., 1990,
    Evain et al., 2004). While this parameter can inform us on the efficiency of photosynthetic
    activity (Garbulsky et al., 2011), it is in fact an indirect proxy (actually,
    it reflects precisely the importance of the fraction of absorbed energy which
    is not used in photosynthesis, but rather dissipated). Therefore, some authors
    have proposed to re-name it back to its original descriptor, Physiological (not
    photochemical) reflectance index (Evain et al., 2004)). Instead, chlorophyll fluorescence
    has proven to be a more direct indicator of photosynthesis (Flexas et al., 2000,
    Moya et al., 2004). Since some types of UAVs can be highly maneuverable, they
    can fly extremely close to leaves, presenting one of the most exciting opportunities
    that has recently emerged in the remote sensing field, the measurement of leaf
    chlorophyll a fluorescence. First, this dynamic physiological phenomenon can be
    used to estimate several parameters that may serve as diagnostic tools to assess
    the light energy partitioning at the photosystem II level during water stress
    (Flexas et al., 2002). For instance, ETR can be linearly related to photosynthesis
    in C3 plants after a suitable calibration (considering photorespiration) (McAusland
    et al., 2013). A down-regulation of ETR caused by water stress can be remotely
    sensed using suitable instruments like laser-based fluorometers (Flexas et al.,
    2000, Moya et al., 2004). This occurs precisely when water stress intensifies
    to the extent that further stomatal closure results in decreased rather than increased
    water use efficiency (Flexas et al., 2002, Medrano et al., 2002). However, compared
    to optical reflectance studies, data using this methodology is still scarce (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012), probably because of a need for better
    engineering efforts to improve technological characteristics such as miniaturization
    of the sensors, battery capabilities, etc. Hence, an exciting challenge for the
    future will be the development of this technology coupled with thermal imagery,
    which could lead to measurements of water use efficiency (WUE) using images of
    field conditions. Recently, McAusland et al. (2013) developed a system combining
    fluorescence and thermal imagery to estimate WUE in Arabidopsis grown under controlled
    conditions. Perhaps a limitation to implement this technique for remote sensing
    studies on broader areas, like those achievable with UAVs, is the fact that the
    retrieval of most chlorophyll parameters requires a light-saturating photosystem
    II, for which an intense and focalized beam is necessary. Using laser sources
    to develop this beam may allow for an increase in the measuring distance, but
    at the expense of increasing danger. Therefore, there is a limit for the so-called
    active fluorosensing in terms of remote sensing. However, Flexas et al. (2002)
    showed that a simple fluorescence parameter, the steady state chl. fluorescence
    (Fs), which does not require saturating pulses for its measurement, strongly and
    consistently correlated with net CO2 assimilation and accurately tracked the water
    stress-induced declines of photosynthesis provided that some conditions were fixed
    (e.g. under saturating light). Field studies describing the retrieval of solar
    induced chlorophyll fluorescence from UAVs are now available, although they are
    very scarce and limited to few crops, using a micro-hyperspectral imager (Micro-Hyperspec
    VNIR model, Headwall Photonics, USA) and the 760 nm O2-A band in-filling method
    (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). Still, there is a lack
    of information on this topic, probably due to the scarcity and exclusivity of
    instruments and all the modeling required to fulfill this purpose. Combining this
    technology with thermal cameras for the estimation of canopy conductance could
    be an exciting challenge for phenotyping cultivars that are drought resistant
    and/or more efficient in their water use. On the other hand, solar induced chlorophyll
    fluorescence has recently been globally mapped using satellite-based sensors (Frankenberg
    et al., 2011, Joiner et al., 2013), demonstrating the usefulness of this approach
    to track changes in crop productivity (Guanter et al., 2014). However, the problem
    of satellite-based measurements is obviously their large pixel size, which makes
    them ineffective to monitor most types of field crops. Demonstration of their
    feasibility and their correspondence with ground-based estimates of photosynthesis
    and primary productivity strongly encourage the need to develop equivalent measuring
    systems mountable on UAVs. This would allow for adjustments to almost any requirement
    in terms of precision and pixel size, which would constitute an outstanding achievement
    and versatile tool for monitoring and managing crops under water limited conditions.
    4. UAVs aerial imagery UAVs greatest advantage is the reduced altitude of their
    flight compared to other aerial platforms, which greatly improves the image''s
    resolution. However, their disadvantage is that they require more flights to cover
    large areas due to their reduced flight time. As Turner et al. (2012) explained,
    a micro-UAV flying 50 m high with a camera under a standard configuration will
    acquire terrain images of 50 m × 40 m, thus, more than 150 images are needed to
    cover 2 ha. As for the multi-copters, to increase the area covered, several flights
    are required and their batteries must be changed. One of the main constraints
    of UAVs aerial imaging technology is the usual problem of the lack of the proper
    camera location information needed to correct aerial images. In addition, the
    manual management of a large number of images is very time consuming and data
    processing can be highly complex (Fig. 2, “Data processing”). To solve this bottleneck,
    several authors have used the structure from motion (SfM) combined with ground
    control points (GCPs) to generate precise digital terrain models (DTM) (Turner
    et al., 2012, Westoby et al., 2012, Fonstad et al., 2013). For instance, Turner
    et al. (2012) proposed an automated methodology to geometrically rectify and mosaic
    the large volume of images obtained from Antarctic moss beds using a multi-copter
    based on SfM geo-referencing with GCPs. This process generates arbitrary three
    dimensional point clouds that can be transformed into real world coordinates using
    the GCPs, which creates a digital terrain model DTM with accuracies of ca. 10–15
    cm. Recently, other authors suggested the use of SfM combined with GCPs mostly
    using low-cost or open-source software (Photosynth-SynthExport®, MeshLab®, JAG3D®)
    to produce digital elevation models with horizontal and vertical precision in
    centimetrical ranges which could almost compare to airborne LiDAR models, but
    with reduced economic, labor and expertise costs (Westoby et al., 2012, Fonstad
    et al., 2013). 5. Future perspectives and concluding remarks More efforts are
    required to make these technologies more user-friendly and available for all types
    of end-users, covering different interests for a precise crop assessment. Interestingly,
    the industry is reacting to the increased interest in this field, and sharing
    this vision of user friendly tools for all types of end-users in agriculture.
    For example, three clear examples of this new business trend could include DroneMapper
    Aerial Imagery Processing, GIS Services (http://www.dronemapper.com/), an on-line
    web service specialized in the generation of geo-referenced ortho-mosaics and
    DEMs from aerial images, and the PulsePod project (http://pulsepod.io), a low-cost,
    long-term hardware for real time environmental measurements to obtain in-field
    data to improve decision assessment that could be combined with UAVs information.
    Compared to conventional platforms (such as manned aircrafts and satellites),
    UAVs present several advantages: they fly at lower altitudes, increasing images’
    spatial resolution and they cost less, allowing for higher monitoring frequencies.
    Thus, UAVs can fill the gap between other more traditional remote sensing aerial
    platforms. These characteristics will most likely improve the capabilities of
    precision agriculture, in terms of crop''s development and biotic and abiotic
    stress management, converting them into an important tool for precision agriculture
    (Fig. 2, “Results/end products”). Remote sensing indices are currently being tested
    and improved to propose proxies that reflect crops’ physiological status under
    changing environmental conditions. These remote-sensing physiological estimations,
    coupled with UAVs flying capacity could allow for a more user-friendly tool for
    plant diagnostics. Indeed, as previously stated, they can be used to determine
    plant water status for several crop species. An exciting scientific-technical
    challenge will be to combine this technology with an approach that would allow
    us to estimate the chlorophyll a fluorescence as a proxy for WUE at the crop-scale.
    UAVs can also be used to identify or compare physiological parameters of several
    varieties or transgenic lines. Thus, UAVs capacity for phenotyping could identify
    promising events, which could later determine, through physiology and molecular
    techniques, improved breeds of crops to ensure future global food security (Araus
    and Cairns, 2014). Finally, UAVs equipped with remote sensors appear to be a very
    cost-efficient approach, taking into account the high performance of the sensors,
    data acquisition and their high flexibility (Lelong et al., 2008). Moreover, considerable
    cost reductions in UAVs multi-copter technology and remote sensing can be expected
    in the coming years thanks to the open source electronic community. UAVs are clearly
    highly useful and adapted tools for precision agriculture and water irrigation
    management (Turner et al., 2011, Gago et al., 2013). Increases in monitoring could
    allow for further crop management, perhaps, even in combination with ground sensors
    or smartphone Apps, not only for crop productivity, but also for crop quality.

  data_sources: multispectral imagery acquired over the orchards using a study site
    using a narrow-band multispectral camera; hyperspectral imagery was acquired from
    the Castro del Rio site on 23 June 2011 at 9:00 GMT using a hyperspectral imager
    concurrently with the thermal camera operated in 2009 and 2010. The flights were
    conducted with two different unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operated by the Spanish
    Laboratory for Research Methods in Quantitative Remote Sensing (Quantalab, IAS-CSIC,
    Spain); and thermal imagery obtained via narrow-band multispectral camera for
    fixed-wing platform at 5.8 kg takeoff weight (TOW); the hyperspectral imager had
    260 bands at 1.85 nm/pixel; the thermal camera installed on board the two UAVs
    operated in 2009 and 2010 at altitudes ranging between 150 m and 250 m AGL in
    2009 and 2010, and at 550 m AGL when flown together with the hyperspectral imager
    in 2011 in the morning (~ 9:00 GMT).
  explanation: Remote sensing can be used to detect, monitor and quantify a range
    of diseases in different crops. Comprehensive reviews on the application of remote
    sensing to the detection of plant diseases are available (e.g., Barton, 2012;
    Hatfield and Pinter, 1993; Jackson, 1986; Nilsson, 1995; Sankaran et al., 2010;
    West et al., 2003), most studies have focused on foliar pathogens in annual crops,
    where disease symptoms are mainly characterized by distinct color changes in the
    aerial parts of the plant. The technology also has shown potential for detecting
    root diseases in several crops (e.g., Raikes and Burpee, 1998; Reynolds et al.,
    2012; Wang et al., 2004). Canopy temperature has shown to be particularly useful
    to detect root impairment caused by soil-borne pathogens that lead to water stress
    symptoms, as mentioned above.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Early detection of Verticillium wilt (VW)
    was investigated with remote sensing • Leaf data and airborne imagery correlated
    with physiology status due to the disease • Crown temperature (Tc-Ta, CWSI) were
    effective in detecting VW at early stages • Hyperspectral indices B, BG1, BR1
    and fluorescence detected VW at early stages • Structural indices (NDVI) and pigment
    indices were good only to assess damage Abstract Verticillium wilt (VW) caused
    by the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb, is the most limiting disease
    in all traditional olive-growing regions worldwide. This pathogen colonizes the
    vascular system of plants, blocking water flow and eventually inducing water stress.
    The present study explored the use of high-resolution thermal imagery, chlorophyll
    fluorescence, structural and physiological indices (xanthophyll, chlorophyll a
    + b, carotenoids and blue/green/red B/G/R indices) calculated from multispectral
    and hyperspectral imagery as early indicators of water stress caused by VW infection
    and severity. The study was conducted in two olive orchards naturally infected
    with V. dahliae. Time series of airborne thermal, multispectral and hyperspectral
    imagery was acquired in three consecutive years and related to VW severity at
    the time of the flights. Concurrently to the airborne campaigns, field measurements
    conducted at leaf and tree-crown levels showed a significant increase in crown
    temperature (Tc) minus air temperature (Ta) and a decrease in leaf stomatal conductance
    (G) across VW severity levels, identifying VW-infected trees at early stages of
    the disease. Higher Tc − Ta and G values measured in the field were associated
    with higher VW severity levels. At leaf level, the reduction in G caused by VW
    infection was associated with a significant increase in the Photochemical Reflectance
    Index (PRI570) and a decrease in chlorophyll fluorescence (F). The airborne flights
    enabled the early detection of VW by using canopy-level image-derived airborne
    Tc − Ta, Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) calculated from the thermal imagery, blue/blue–green/blue–red
    ratios (B/BG/BR indices) and chlorophyll fluorescence, confirming the results
    obtained in the field. Airborne Tc − Ta showed rising values with a significant
    increase of ~ 2 K at low VW severity levels, and was significantly correlated
    with G (R2 = 0.76, P = 0.002) and PRI570 (R2 = 0.51, P = 0.032). Early stages
    of disease development could be differentiated based on a CWSI increase as VW
    developed, obtaining a strong correlation with G (R2 = 0.83, P < 0.001). Likewise,
    the canopy-level chlorophyll fluorescence dropped at high VW severity levels,
    showing a significant increase as disease progressed. These results indicate the
    potentials of an early detection of V. dahliae infection and discrimination of
    VW severity levels using remote sensing. Indicators based on crown temperature
    such as CWSI, and visible ratios B/BG/BR as well as fluorescence were effective
    in detecting VW at early stages of disease development. In affected trees, the
    structural indices PRI, chlorophyll and carotenoid indices, and the R/G ratio
    were good indicators to assess the damage caused by the disease. Previous article

    resolutionUAVPhysiological indicesVerticillium dahliae 1. Introduction Verticillium
    wilt (VW) of olive (Olea europea L.) trees, caused by the soil-borne fungus Verticillium
    dahliae Kleb., is the most limiting disease of this crop in all traditional olive-growing
    regions worldwide (Jiménez-Díaz et al., 2012, Tsror (Lahkim), 2011) and causes
    severe yield losses and tree mortality (Levin, Lavee, & Tsror, 2003). In Spain,
    the first reports of the disease, which was found to affect olive crops in the
    Guadalquivir valley, were documented in the early 1980s (Blanco-López, Jiménez-Díaz,
    & Caballero, 1984). However, in the last 15–20 years the disease has spread to
    affect newly established irrigated crops (Jiménez-Díaz et al., 2011, Sánchez-Hernández
    et al., 1998). Under field conditions, the first VW symptoms in irrigated olive
    trees growing in V. dahliae-infested orchards develop 18–24 months after plantation,
    depending on the density of pathogen propagules in the soil, the V. dahliae pathotype
    prevailing in the soil, the olive cultivar susceptibility and the environmental
    conditions (Levin et al., 2003, Navas-Cortés et al., 2008). In the Mediterranean
    region, over an annual cropping season, disease incidence and symptom severity
    typically increase from late autumn–early winter to spring and sharply decrease
    in summer, with no further development until the next autumn; this results in
    polyetic epidemics over several cropping seasons (Navas-Cortés et al., 2008).
    V. dahliae can be found in agricultural soils as resistant survival structures
    called ‘microsclerotia’ that are stimulated to germinate by root exudates (Schreiber
    & Green, 1963) and favorable soil environmental conditions, forming hyphae that
    penetrate into the plant roots and grow into their tissues until they reach the
    xylem vessels. The rapid upward spread of the pathogen in vascular tissues occurs
    primarily through conidia transported with the transpiration stream (Emechebe
    et al., 1975, Garber and Houston, 1966, Presley et al., 1966, Talboys, 1962).
    This enables the pathogen to spread throughout the aerial parts of its host within
    one growing season. The net effect of pathogen infection is a reduction in water
    flow that induces water stress and is thought to be mainly responsible for the
    vascular wilt syndrome caused by V. dahliae and other wilt pathogens (Ayres, 1978,
    DeVay, 1989, Van Alfen, 1989). Water stress in plants caused by either V. dahliae
    infection or drought-induced stomatal closure reduces the transpiration rate.
    In turn, this decreases evaporative cooling and increases leaf temperature. Early
    detection of water stress using remote sensing has been successfully achieved
    in the past using thermal infrared radiation (Idso et al., 1978, Idso et al.,
    1981, Jackson and Pinter, 1981, Jackson et al., 1977, Jackson et al., 1981). Thermal
    remote sensing of water stress has been fulfilled using spectrometers at ground
    level (Idso et al., 1981, Idso et al., 1978, Jackson et al., 1977, Jackson et
    al., 1981), thermal sensors at image level (Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Suárez and Fereres,
    2009, Cohen et al., 2005, Leinonen and Jones, 2004, Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2006,
    Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2007, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012) and satellite thermal
    imagery (Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2009). Working with hand-held infrared thermometers
    on herbaceous crops, Jackson and co-workers (Idso et al., 1978, Jackson et al.,
    1981) developed the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), which became a popular thermal-based
    stress indicator. The CWSI is based on the normalization of differences between
    canopy (Tc) and air temperature (Ta) with evaporative demand (by means of the
    vapor pressure deficit). Apart from the progress made in water-stress detection
    using the thermal region, the visible part of the spectrum has also been useful
    for early water stress detection. This involves using indices focused on bands
    located at specific wavelengths where photosynthetic pigments are affected by
    stress conditions. Two spectral indicators of water stress, spanning initial through
    severe disease symptoms, are widely used. One is the Photochemical Reflectance
    Index (PRI) (Gamon, Peñuelas, & Field, 1992). This index is sensitive to the epoxidation
    state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and to photosynthetic efficiency, serving
    as a proxy for water stress detection (Peguero-Pina et al., 2008, Suárez et al.,
    2009, Suárez et al., 2010, Suárez et al., 2008, Thenot et al., 2002). Another
    indicator of water stress is solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence emission (Flexas
    et al., 2000, Flexas et al., 1999, Flexas et al., 2002, Moya et al., 2004, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012), because of the strong correlation found
    between steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence and the reduced assimilation caused
    by water stress conditions. The PRI has been used to assess pre-visual water stress
    at leaf level (Thenot et al., 2002, Winkel et al., 2002), at canopy level (Dobrowsky
    et al., 2005, Evain et al., 2004, Peguero-Pina et al., 2008, Sun et al., 2008)
    and using airborne imaging spectroscopy (Suárez et al., 2009, Suárez et al., 2010,
    Suárez et al., 2008). Chlorophyll fluorescence is associated with photosynthesis
    and other physiological processes, as demonstrated consistently in laboratory
    studies (e.g., Krause and Weis, 1984, Papageorgiu, 1975). Over the last five years,
    scientific interest in steady-state chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs) obtained under
    natural outdoor conditions has increased due to its potential development using
    remote sensing methods (Soukupová et al., 2008). Although the contribution of
    fluorescence to the vegetation''s radiance signal is estimated to be 2–3%, methods
    have been developed to extract the signal (Meroni et al., November 17-19 2004,
    Meroni, Picchi, et al., 2008, Meroni, Rossini, et al., 2008, Meroni et al., 2009,
    Moya et al., 2004), proving the feasibility of the fluorescence retrieval using
    the O2-A absorption feature at 760 nm. Remote sensing has been used to detect,
    monitor and quantify a range of diseases in different crops. Comprehensive reviews
    on the application of remote sensing to the detection of plant diseases are available
    (e.g., Barton, 2012, Hatfield and Pinter, 1993, Jackson, 1986, Nilsson, 1995,
    Sankaran et al., 2010, West et al., 2003). Most studies have focused on foliar
    pathogens in annual crops, where disease symptoms are mainly characterized by
    distinct color changes in the aerial parts of the plant. However, this technology
    also has shown potential for detecting root diseases in several crops (e.g., Raikes
    and Burpee, 1998, Reynolds et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2004). Canopy temperature
    has shown to be particularly useful to detect root impairment caused by soil-borne
    pathogens that lead to water stress symptoms, as mentioned above. In fact, Pinter
    et al. (1979) found foliar temperatures 3–4 °C higher than those of healthy plants
    in sugar beet and cotton. Other examples of the use of leaf temperature for the
    detection of diseases caused by soil-borne pathogens include beans infected with
    Fusarium solani, Pythium ultimum or Rhizoctonia solani (Tu & Tan, 1985); soybeans
    affected by brown stem rot caused by Phialophora gregata (Mengistu, Tachibana,
    Epstein, Bidne, & Hatfield, 1987); the flag leaf temperature of cereals with root
    and vascular diseases, such as barley infected by Pyrenophora graminea and wheat
    infected with Cephalosporium gramineum (Nilsson, 1995); and wheat with moderate
    take-all symptoms caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Nilsson, 1991).
    Other approaches have included the use of multispectral and hyperspectral imagery,
    as well as airborne digital color or video imagery, to detect crop diseases. Multispectral
    imagery enabled the detection of head blight in winter wheat (Dammer, Möller,
    Rodemann, & Heppner, 2011), assessment of severity of soybean root rot (Wang et
    al., 2004) and to evaluate Rhizoctonia blight in creeping bentgrass (Raikes &
    Burpee, 1998). Hyperspectral canopy reflectance was used to quantify Rhizoctonia
    crown and root rot in sugar beet (Reynolds et al., 2012) and to detect the co-infection
    of sugar beet with this pathogen and the plant parasitic nematode Heterodera schachatii
    (Hillnhütter, Mahlein, Sikora, & Oerke, 2011) as well as Fusarium head blight
    in wheat (Bauriegel, Giebel, Geyer, Schmidt, & Herppich, 2011). Some research
    has been conducted on remote detection of diseases caused by V. dahliae. Nilsson
    (1995) reported that oilseed rape plants infected with V. dahliae exhibited leaf
    temperatures 5–8 °C higher than non-infected plants. Chen et al., 2008, Chen et
    al., 2011 reported the application of hyperspectral reflectance to identify cotton
    canopy affected by VW. They found that the spectral characteristics of infected
    plants changed gradually with the increase in the visible region with disease
    severity, while a reduction occurred in the near-infrared region. Yet, to our
    knowledge remote sensing physiological indices and fluorescence indicators have
    not been used to study olive tree diseases. The main objective of this research
    was to evaluate the use of high-resolution thermal imagery and physiological indices
    calculated from multispectral and hyperspectral imagery as indicators of VW infection
    and severity in olive orchards. Time series of airborne thermal, multispectral
    and hyperspectral imagery were acquired in three consecutive campaigns and related
    to VW severity at the time of the flight. The hypothesis is that thermal and hyperspectral
    indices acquired from the airborne imagery are sensitive to physiological changes
    induced by the infection and colonization by V. dahliae. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Study site description The experimental areas were located in Andalucia,
    in southern Spain, a region of Mediterranean climate characterized by warm and
    dry summers and cool and wet winters, with an average annual rainfall of over
    550 mm. Two study sites were selected in the Cordoba and Seville provinces, respectively,
    to account for differences in weather conditions, crop age and tree-crown size,
    olive cultivars with different reactions to VW and VW incidence and severity.
    The first study site was located in Castro del Rio (Cordoba province, Spain) (37°
    42′ 20″ N, 4° 30′ 45″ W) in a 7-ha commercial orchard planted in 2001 with the
    olive cultivar (cv.) Picual at a spacing of 6 × 4 m (Fig. 1a). Cv. Picual has
    been found to be highly susceptible to D and susceptible to ND V. dahliae, under
    controlled conditions in artificial inoculation tests (López-Escudero, del Rio,
    Caballero, & Blanco-López, 2004). The initial VW incidence (i.e., percentage of
    VW symptomatic trees) was estimated in 12%. The second study site was located
    in Utrera (Seville province, Spain) (37° 4′ 42″ N, 5° 50° 58″ W), in a 10-ha commercial
    orchard planted in 2006 with cv. Arbequina (Fig. 1b). Cv. Arbequina has been shown
    to be susceptible to D and moderately resistant to ND V. dahliae, under controlled
    conditions in artificial inoculation tests (López-Escudero et al., 2004). The
    olive trees were planted at a spacing of 6 × 3 m. The initial VW incidence was
    estimated in 30%. Both orchards were drip irrigated and managed using no-tillage
    practices; weed control was achieved with herbicide treatments between rows. Download

    Overview of the two study sites in southern Spain used in this study: (a) 7 ha
    commercial olive orchard in Castro del Rio (Cordoba province); and (b) 10-ha commercial
    olive orchard in Utrera (Seville province). 2.2. Verticillium wilt assessment
    Incidence and severity of VW symptoms were assessed in both plots in spring and
    summer of 2009, 2010 and 2011 in coincidence with airborne campaigns. Severity
    of the disease was assessed by visual observation of foliar symptoms in each individual
    tree and assessment on a 0 to 4 rating scale according to the percentage of foliage
    with disease symptoms, where: 0 = 0%, 0.2 and 0.5 = initial symptoms, 1 = 1 to
    33%, 2 = 34 to 66%, 3 = 67 to 100%, and 4 = dead plant. V. dahliae infection was
    confirmed in a sample from each experimental plot by isolating six stem fragments
    sampled from each of four young symptomatic branches per symptomatic tree as previously
    described (Navas-Cortés et al., 2008). Identification of V. dahliae isolates was
    based on the morphology of conidiophores and microsclerotia and confirmed by molecular
    typing through PCR assay using primers DB19/DB22/espdef01 (Mercado-Blanco, Rodríguez-Jurado,
    Parrilla-Araujo, & Jiménez-Díaz, 2003); this method yielded a polymorphic amplicon
    of 523 or 539 bp specific to V. dahliae. PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis
    were conducted as described previously (Mercado-Blanco et al., 2003). 2.3. Field
    measurements Leaf and near-canopy field measurements were conducted in the olive
    orchard located in Castro del Rio (Cordoba) during the summer of 2011 to take:
    a) diurnal measurements throughout the day to monitor the diurnal variation of
    crown temperature (Tc − Ta) and stomatal conductance (G) in trees covering a gradient
    in severity levels; and b) leaf and crown measurements at midday to monitor the
    variation along the VW severity levels of Tc − Ta, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence,
    leaf Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI570) (Gamon et al., 1992) and leaf stomatal
    conductance (G). Eight trees showing different VW severity levels were selected
    to record pure crown temperature (Tc) with the objective of monitoring its diurnal
    variation. These measurements were conducted from 7:00 to 17:00 GMT at 5-minute
    intervals in two dataloggers (model CR10X, Campbell Sci., Logan, UT, USA) with
    infrared temperature (IRT) sensors (22° half-angle FOV) (model IRR-P, Apogee,
    Logan, UT, USA) placed 1 m above trees. The single-band infrared temperature (IRT)
    sensors covered the 6.5–14 μm range and were evaluated both in the laboratory
    and in field conditions to characterize the IRT response to diurnal temperature
    variation (Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2006). The results yielded errors within the
    accuracy limits of the instrument (± 0.4 °C) over a 5° to 40 °C range. The instruments
    were calibrated in the laboratory using a uniform calibration body (integrating
    sphere, CSTM-USS-2000C Uniform Source System, LabSphere, NH, USA) at two different
    levels of illumination. This procedure has been reported to be successful in other
    studies focused on monitoring crown temperature as an indicator of water stress
    (Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Suárez and Fereres, 2009, Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2006, Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012). Air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity (RH) were measured above
    the canopy with a portable weather station (Model WXT510, Vaisala, Finland) placed
    1 m above the canopy (approx. 6 m above the ground). In each of the eight monitored
    trees, leaf stomatal conductance was measured from 7:00 to 17:00 GMT at 2-hour
    intervals with a leaf porometer (model SC-1, Decagon Devices, Washington, DC,
    USA) to monitor the diurnal variation of crown stomatal conductance for the different
    VW severity levels. A total of five illuminated leaves per tree were measured
    at each time interval. In addition to the diurnal measurements conducted for temperature
    and stomatal conductance, 25 trees covering a gradient in severity levels from
    asymptomatic to severely affected trees were chosen to monitor the variation of
    Tc − Ta, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf PRI570 and leaf G between 10:00 and
    13:00 GMT on 27 and 28 July 2011. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence measurements taken
    under natural sunlight conditions were conducted using the PAM-2100 Pulse-Amplitude
    Modulated Fluorometer (Heinz Walz GMBH, Effeltrich, Germany). This device measured
    steady-state Fs and Fm'' fluorescence parameters in 25 illuminated leaves per
    tree. Leaf PRI570 measurements calculated as (R570 − R531) / (R570 + R531) (Suárez
    et al., 2009, Suárez et al., 2010, Suárez et al., 2008, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012)
    were taken in 25 illuminated leaves per tree with a PlantPen instrument custom
    designed to measure the R531 and R570 bands (Photon System Instrument, Brno, Czech
    Republic). Leaf G was measured in five illuminated leaves per tree with the leaf
    porometer previously used. 2.4. Airborne campaigns and remote sensing indices
    Imagery in the three years of experiments was acquired from both study sites using
    narrow-band multispectral, hyperspectral and thermal cameras. The multispectral
    and thermal cameras were used in airborne campaigns conducted twice per crop season
    in spring (April/May) and summer (July) of 2009 and 2010. In addition, the thermal
    camera was flown twice in June 2011. The multispectral and thermal imagery was
    always acquired at similar sun angles at 10:30 and 12:00 GMT respectively to minimize
    differences due to sun angle effects between airborne campaigns. Hyperspectral
    and thermal images were acquired from the Castro del Rio site on 23 June 2011
    at 9:00 GMT using a hyperspectral imager concurrently with the thermal camera
    operated in 2009 and 2010. The flights were conducted with two different unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) operated by the Spanish Laboratory for Research Methods
    in Quantitative Remote Sensing (Quantalab, IAS-CSIC, Spain) (Berni, Zarco-Tejada,
    Suárez and Fereres, 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2008, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012).
    The UAV used for the multispectral and thermal acquisition had a 2-m wingspan
    for a fixed-wing platform at 5.8 kg take-off weight (TOW) (mX-SIGHT, UAV Services
    and Systems, Germany) capable of 1-hour endurance. Hyperspectral images were acquired
    with a larger UAV with a 5-m wingspan for a fixed-wing platform having 13.5 kg
    take-off weight (TOW) (Viewer, ELIMCO, Seville, Spain) capable of 3-hour endurance.
    This larger platform was required when operating the hyperspectral imager due
    to the heavier payload. Both UAV platforms were controlled by an autopilot system
    (AP04, UAV Navigation, Madrid, Spain) that provided autonomous navigation based
    on coordinates programmed during the mission planning. The multispectral sensor
    consisted of a 6-band multispectral camera (MCA-6, Tetracam, Inc., California,
    USA) flying at 250 m above ground level (AGL). The camera was equipped with six
    independent image sensors and optics with 25-mm diameter filters of 10-nm full
    width at half-maximum (FWHM) bandwidth (Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Suárez and Fereres,
    2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009). Image resolution was 2592 × 1944 pixels with
    10-bit radiometric resolution and an optical focal length of 8.4 mm, yielding
    an angular field of view (FOV) of 38.04° × 28.53° and a spatial resolution of
    20 cm at 250 m altitude (Fig. 2a). The band sets used in each study site included
    centered wavelengths at 450, 490, 530, 570, 670 and 800 nm. Download : Download

    imager (Micro-Hyperspec VNIR model, Headwall Photonics, MA, USA) was flown in
    2011 at Castro del Río site in the spectral mode with 260 bands at 1.85 nm/pixel
    at 12-bit radiometric resolution. It yielded a 3.2-nm FWHM with a 12-micron slit
    and a 6.4-nm FWHM with a 25-micron slit. Data acquisition and storage on board
    the UAV was set to 50 fps with 18-ms integration time. The 8-mm optical focal
    length yielded an IFOV of 0.93 mrad and an angular FOV of 49.82°, obtaining a
    swath of 522 m at 53 × 42 cm resolution, resampled to 40 cm (Fig. 3a) for a flight
    conducted at 550 m AGL altitude and 75 km/h ground speed (Zarco-Tejada et al.,

    enabled the separation of pure olive crowns from shaded and sunlit soil reflectance,
    observing the effects of pixel aggregation (c). Yellow square (a) shown in detail
    in (b). The multispectral and hyperspectral images were radiometrically calibrated
    with a uniform light source system (integrating sphere, CSTM-USS-2000C Uniform
    Source System, LabSphere, NH, USA) at four different levels of illumination and
    six different integration times. Atmospheric correction was performed with the
    SMARTS simulation model developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory,
    US Department of Energy (Gueymard, 1995, Gueymard, 2001). This was done using
    aerosol optical depth measured at 550 nm with a Micro-Tops II sunphotometer (Solar
    LIGHT Co., Philadelphia, PA, USA). This radiative transfer model has been used
    in previous studies to perform the atmospheric correction of both narrow-band
    multispectral and hyperspectral imagery (Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Sepulcre-Cantó,
    Fereres and Villalobos, 2009, Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Suárez and Fereres, 2009, Suárez
    et al., 2010, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). A miniaturized inertial measurement
    unit (IMU) installed on board the UAV and synchronized with the hyperspectral
    imager acquired altitude data at 100 Hz frequency. The imagery was later orthorectified
    using PARGE software (ReSe Applications Schläpfer, Wil, Switzerland) (Fig. 3a).
    The mean radiance and reflectance spectra calculated for the six spectral bands
    obtained by the multispectral camera and the 260 spectral bands acquired by the
    hyperspectral imager were then used to calculate several spectral indices related
    to: i) tree crown structure; ii) epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle; iii)
    chlorophyll a + b concentration; iv) blue/green/red ratio indices; v) carotenoid
    concentration; vi) chlorophyll fluorescence and vii) spectral disease indices

    (1981) The chlorophyll fluorescence retrieval method used was based on the FLD
    principle (Plascyk, 1975) using three bands as in Maier et al. (2003) (see Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2012 for fluorescence quantification in a citrus crop using this same
    hyperspectral imager). Previous results demonstrated the feasibility of retrieving
    the chlorophyll fluorescence signal using this hyperspectral imager (Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2013, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). For this reason, the FLD principle could
    be applied to the hyperspectral imagery to estimate the fluorescence signal, using
    a total of three bands required for the FLD3 method, where the band inside the
    O2-A feature (the “in” wavelength indicates the radiance at L763 nm) and the radiances
    (L750 nm; L780 nm) determined at two wavelengths outside and on either side of
    the O2-A feature, referred to as the “out” bands. The thermal camera (MIRICLE
    307, Thermoteknix Systems Ltd, Cambridge, UK) installed on board the two UAVs
    operated in this study was flown over the experimental sites at altitudes ranging
    between 150 m and 250 m AGL in 2009 and 2010, and at 550 m AGL when flown together
    with the hyperspectral imager in 2011 in the morning (~ 9:00 GMT). This camera
    had a 14.25 mm f1.3 lens connected to a computer via a USB 2.0 protocol. The image
    sensor was a Focal Plane Array (FPA) based on uncooled microbolometers with a
    spectral range of 8–12 μm, yielding a 25 μm pixel size. The camera delivered raw
    images with a 640 × 480 pixel resolution and 14-bit at-sensor uncalibrated radiance.
    The camera was radiometrically calibrated in the laboratory using blackbodies
    at varying target and ambient temperatures to develop radiometric calibration
    algorithms along with an internal calibration for non-uniformity correction (NUC).
    Thermal images were acquired at 20 cm pixel resolution, enabling the retrieval
    of “pure crown” average temperature from each tree studied (Fig. 4a). Local atmospheric
    conditions were determined by air temperature, relative humidity and barometric
    pressure at the time of flight using a portable weather station (Model WXT510,
    Vaisala, Finland). Download : Download high-res image (979KB) Download : Download

    province) obtained with the thermal camera on board the UAV platform at 20-cm
    resolution, enabling pure olive crown identification (b). Automatic object-based
    crown detection applied to the thermal imagery to identify pure olive crowns (c).
    Yellow square (a) shown in detail in (b; c). The high-resolution imagery acquired
    over the orchards enabled single tree identification for field validation purposes
    (Fig. 4b), successfully separating pure crown from soil pixels (Fig. 3c). Each
    single pure tree crown in the entire orchard was identified using automatic object-based
    crown detection algorithms (Figs. 2b;3b;4c). The algorithms applied to the thermal,
    multispectral and hyperspectral imagery enabled calculation of mean temperature
    and multispectral and hyperspectral reflectance at pure-crown level for the entire
    scenes acquired with the unmanned vehicles. The Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)
    was calculated for each single tree crown using the high-resolution airborne thermal
    imagery acquired as described in Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Sepulcre-Cantó, Fereres,
    and Villalobos (2009), with the inputs detailed in Table 2. Table 2. Inputs used
    to calculate the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) from high resolution airborne

    The Dunnett''s two-tailed test was used to determine significant differences between
    asymptomatic trees and each of the disease severity levels at P < 0.05. 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Verticillium wilt symptom development VW symptoms developed
    extensively in both study sites from early autumn to early winter, reaching their
    maximum expression during the spring. In the Utrera study site, characterized
    by 3-year-old cv. Arbequina olive trees, the symptoms consisted mainly of an extensive
    early drop of infected leaves that were still green; in most cases, this caused
    a complete defoliation and necrosis of affected branches. In the more established
    Castro del Rio study site, characterized by 10-yr old cv. Picual olive trees,
    affected plants mainly exhibited a quick dieback of olive twigs and branches where
    leaves turned light brown, rolled back toward the abaxial side and dried up, but
    typically remained attached to the symptomatic shoots. In both experimental sites,
    if the first VW symptoms developed in the spring, the trees underwent flower mummification
    and necrosis of both inflorescences and leaves of affected shoots, which usually
    fell. The type of VW symptoms and temporal dynamics of VW epidemics observed in
    both study sites were similar to those described in olive orchards affected by
    VW in southern Spain (Navas-Cortés et al., 2008). In May 2009, 13.7 and 32.2%
    of trees were affected by VW in the Castro del Rio and Utrera study sites, respectively
    (Fig. 5a,c), with a mean disease severity in symptomatic trees of 1.26 and 1.19
    (0–4 rating scale), respectively. These figures were determined from 41.4% that
    showed initial disease severity (DS) symptoms (0 > DS ≤ 0.5), 37.5% had low disease
    severity symptoms (0.5 > DS ≤ 1.5), 12.7% had moderate disease severity symptoms
    (1.5 > DS ≤ 2.5) and 8.4% of symptomatic trees had severe (DS ≥ 3) disease symptoms
    at Castro del Rio. At Utrera, 32.7, 43.0, 17.7 and 6.6% of trees showed these
    same severity levels, respectively (Fig. 5). During the spring of 2009, the disease
    progressed in both study sites to reach a global incidence of 15.9 and 39.3% in
    summer at Castro del Rio and Utrera, respectively (Fig. 5b,d); however, a similar
    frequency of trees remained in the three severity classes indicated above. In
    the 2010 season, overall disease incidence increased to 17.3 and 44.7% at Castro
    del Rio and Utrera, respectively (Fig. 5b,d), but mean disease severity decreased
    to 1.10 and 1.05 in both sites, respectively. However, minor differences were
    observed between both sites and the two assessment dates regarding the frequency
    of affected trees in the three severity classes. The overall frequency of trees
    at Castro del Rio in the four severity classes ranged from initial (47.3–53.9%),
    to low (35.6–31.4%), moderate (7.8–1.1%) and severe (9.3–1.6%) disease symptoms

    Utrera (Seville province) (c,d) study sites assessed in May and July of 2009 (a,c)
    and 2010 (b,d). VW severity was assessed by visual inspection of each individual
    tree using a 0–4 rating scale according to percentage of foliage with disease
    symptoms, where: 0 = 0%, IS = initial symptoms, 1 = 1 to 33%, 2 = 34 to 66%, 3
    = 67 to 100% and 4 = dead plant. Severity of disease symptoms was grouped in asymptomatic
    (DS = 0), initial (0.2 ≤ DS ≤ 0.5), low (1 ≤ DS ≤ 1.5), moderate (2 ≤ DS ≤ 2.5)
    and severe (3 ≤ DS ≤ 4) disease symptoms. 3.2. Field measurement results Diurnal
    crown measurements were conducted with the IRT sensors on trees selected to represent
    asymptomatic trees and those showing initial, low, moderate and severe disease
    symptoms. Results revealed that midday (i.e., 10:00 to 14:00 GMT) was the best
    time period to maximize differences in Tc − Ta values. In fact, Tc − Ta values
    at midday increased with the rise in disease severity level (Fig. 6), showing
    up to 7 K temperature differences between asymptomatic trees (DS = 0) and severely
    affected trees (DS ≥ 3). Moreover, Tc − Ta values were able to discriminate asymptomatic
    trees from those affected at early stages of disease development (DS ≤ 1.5), which
    showed Tc − Ta values from 1 to 2.5 K higher. These results showing lower Tc −
    Ta values in asymptomatic than in symptomatic diseased olive trees are in agreement
    with other studies. Thus, Nilsson (1995) reported higher leaf temperatures in
    oil seed plants infected with V. dahliae. The leaf stomatal conductance (G) data
    measured on the same trees consistently showed a decrease in stomatal conductance
    values as crown temperature and disease severity levels increased (Fig. 7). These
    results are in agreement with Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Suárez, and Fereres (2009)
    and Sepulcre-Cantó et al. (2006), who assessed the relationship between stomatal
    conductance and water stress levels due to deficit irrigation practices in olive
    trees using thermal sensors and a leaf porometer. A greater difference in stomatal
    conductance between healthy asymptomatic trees and VW-affected trees was recorded
    in the morning, with G differences up to 900 mmol/m2/s between trees with extreme
    DS values (i.e., DS = 0 vs. DS ≥ 3). These differences decreased to a maximum
    of 700 mmol/m2/s at midday and declined to 500 mmol/m2/s after sunset. In addition,
    our results showed that stomatal conductance was able to discriminate between
    healthy trees and those at early stages of disease development, which had G values
    at least 300–500 mmol/m2/s lower than those of healthy trees. Download : Download

    time) in the Castro del Rio site (Córdoba province) in the summer of 2011. Data
    on crown temperature (Tc − Ta), leaf stomatal conductance (G), leaf PRI570 and
    fluorescence (Fs) acquired between 10:00 and 13:00 GMT in July 2011 were analyzed
    in trees with different VW severity levels (Fig. 8). Crown temperature data (Tc
    − Ta) measured at midday with IRT sensors in VW affected trees was significantly
    (P < 0.05) higher than that measured in asymptomatic trees, being highest for
    trees affected by severe VW symptoms (Fig. 8a). By contrast, stomatal conductance
    G showed a negative trend as VW severity increased, showing significant (P < 0.05)
    changes from asymptomatic trees at those showing moderate and severe symptoms
    (DS ≥ 2) (Fig. 8b). Moreover, PRI570 was lowest (P < 0.05) in asymptomatic trees,
    and increased steadily with the increase in VW severity (Fig. 8c). These results
    are consistent with that obtained by Suárez et al. (2008, 2009) in water-stressed
    trees. Leaf chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of Fs (Fig. 8d) showed a downward
    trend as VW severity level increased as previously found for trees under water
    stress (Pérez-Priego et al., 2005, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et

    indicate significant differences from the asymptomatic plants according to Dunnett''s

    conducted for temperature, stomatal conductance, fluorescence and the PRI570 in
    healthy and VW symptomatic trees showed that Tc − Ta and PRI570 were sensitive
    to V. dahliae infection and subsequent fungal colonization of affected trees and
    not simply influenced by structural effects driven by water stress. However, leaf
    G showed significantly lower values than asymptomatic trees in those affected
    by moderate or severe VW symptoms, while no significant differences in leaf Fs
    existed due to V. dahliae infection (Fig. 8). 3.3. Airborne hyperspectral, multispectral
    and thermal imagery results 3.3.1. Tree crown temperature (Tc − Ta) and CWSI Crown
    temperature (Tc − Ta) extracted from the airborne thermal imagery in the summer
    of 2011 was compared against leaf stomatal conductance (G) and leaf PRI570 data
    measured in 25 trees affected by VW (Fig. 9). Crown temperature (Tc − Ta) was
    significantly and linearly correlated with both the decrease of leaf G (R2 = 0.76,
    P = 0.002; Fig. 9a) and the increase of PRI570 (R2 = 0.51, P = 0.032; Fig. 9b).
    Furthermore, leaf G showed an inverse linear correlation to the leaf PRI570 (R2
    = 0.52, P = 0.028; Fig. 9c). Crown temperature (Tc − Ta) tended to increase as
    VW severity level increased (Fig. 10). VW affected trees showed up to 2 K higher
    Tc − Ta than that measured in healthy asymptomatic trees and were consistent in
    all measurements taken in April and July in both study sites. Indeed, symptomatic
    trees showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher Tc − Ta values than asymptomatic
    trees at any disease severity level at Castro del Rio, or at low or higher disease
    severity at Utrera. These results showed similar trends as those presented in
    Fig. 8a, with significant (P < 0.05) increases in Tc − Ta at leaf and canopy levels.

    Mean measurements of crown temperature (Tc − Ta) for every Verticillium wilt severity
    level. Tc − Ta was calculated from thermal imagery obtained in summer of two consecutive
    years (2009 and 2010) for the two study sites, Castro del Rio (Córdoba province)
    (a, c) and Utrera (Seville province) (b, d). Analysis of variance was conducted
    and asterisks indicate significant differences from the asymptomatic plants according
    to Dunnett''s two-tailed test at P < 0.05. Error bars indicate standard errors.
    As expected, the CWSI estimated from the high-resolution airborne thermal imagery
    acquired on 2 June 2011 in the Castro del Rio site showed significantly (P < 0.05)
    lower values for asymptomatic trees, with an upward trend as VW severity level
    increased (Fig. 11a). CWSI derived from the thermal imagery on 15 June 2011 decreased
    linearly and significantly as a function of G obtained on 27 and 28 July 2011
    (R2 = 0.83; P < 0.001) (Fig. 11b). These results indicate that the CWSI obtained
    from high spatial resolution thermal imagery can be used to detect the lower transpiration
    rates induced by V. dahliae infection, as could be expected according to previous
    results (Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Sepulcre-Cantó, Fereres, & Villalobos, 2009) showing
    the usefulness of the CWSI as a water stress indicator. CWSI values estimated
    on the two different assessment dates in June 2011 were significantly (P < 0.05)
    lower for healthy trees than for those affected by the disease. At early stages
    of disease development (DS ≤ 1.5), CWSI ranged from 0.21 to 0.35 on 2 June 2011,
    and from 0.36 to 0.48 on 15 June 2011. At more advanced stages of VW development
    for trees affected by moderate or severe symptoms, CWSI values tended to increase,
    ranging from 0.35 to 0.76 on 2 June 2011 and from 0.48 to 0.71 on 15 June 2011.

    (G) and the CWSI in trees with different VW severity levels. Leaf stomatal conductance
    measurements were obtained between 10:00 and 13:00 GMT on 27 and 28 July 2011
    and the CWSI was calculated from the thermal imagery obtained at 11:00 GMT on
    15 June 2011 in the Castro del Rio study site. Error bars indicate standard errors.
    3.3.2. Structural indices The effects of VW on the canopy structure were captured
    by structural indices such as the NDVI (Fig. 12a), RDVI, OSAVI, TVI, MTVI, SR
    and MSR, that showed higher values for asymptomatic trees except for TVI and MTVI
    which showed an increase at early stages of disease development. Thus, moderate
    and severe VW wilt symptoms induced significantly (P < 0.05) lower values of NDVI,
    OSAVI, SR and MSR indices than those estimated in asymptomatic trees (Table 3).
    Furthermore, TVI and MTVI showed an increase (P < 0.05) in trees showing initial
    symptoms (Table 3). These results demonstrate the consistency of structural indices
    as VW damage indicator due to the expected effects on crown density at moderate
    or advanced stages of disease development. Download : Download high-res image

    symptoms. 3.3.3. Physiological indices The revised xanthophyll indices were calculated
    based on PRI formulations using R570 as the reference band (PRI570) (Fig. 12b)
    and the new formulation using band R515 as a reference to minimize structural
    canopy effects, PRI515 (Fig. 12c). These indices showed an upward trend as VW
    severity level increased. The PRI515 index was more sensitive to VW than PRI570,
    and showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower values when trees were affected by moderate
    or severe symptoms (Table 3). This result confirms those obtained by Hernández-Clemente
    et al. (2011) in forest canopies and those of Stagakis, González-Dugo, Cid, Guillén-Climent,
    and Zarco-Tejada (2012) in orange and mandarin orchards, which demonstrated the
    robustness of the PRI515 to structural effects. Both, airborne-derived (Table
    3) and leaf-level PRI570 (Fig. 8c) showed similar positive trend with disease
    severity, however only at leaf-level resulted in significant differences between
    healthy and VW affected trees. The chlorophyll indices TCARI (Fig. 12d) and TCARI/OSAVI
    showed an upward trend at early stages of the disease, reaching a maximum of 0.058
    and 0.103 units at the low disease severity level, respectively, compared to 0.004
    (TCARI) and 0.007 (TCARI/OSARI) observed for healthy trees. These results could
    indicate a decrease in chlorophyll a + b content (Ca + b) at early stages of V.
    dahliae infection (reducing stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate). At
    advanced stages of the disease, the TCARI and TCARI/OSAVI inverted their trends
    due to the sharp leaf area index (LAI) drop associated with VW severity, showing
    significantly (P < 0.05) lower values at severe disease symptoms with 0.022 and
    0.025 value drops between moderate and severely affected trees, respectively.
    The chlorophyll red edge index, VOG1, GM1, GM2, PSSRa and PSSRb showed significantly
    (P < 0.05) lower values on moderately and severely affected trees compared with
    values estimated on asymptomatic trees. The mCAI reached a significantly (P <
    0.05) higher value at trees showing initial symptoms but steadily decreased in
    trees affected by moderate and severe symptoms. The Greenness, red index and the
    blue/green ratio BG2 were not able to detect V. dahliae infection, since no significant
    (P > 0.05) changes were detectable when compared with healthy trees (Table 3).
    Interestingly, the blue index (Fig. 12e) could discriminate between healthy trees
    and those affected at any of the disease severity levels that reached significantly
    lower values (P < 0.05). Similarly, the blue/green ratio BG1 presented a significant
    (P < 0.05) decrease at early stages of disease development, but increased slightly
    at advanced stages, probably due to structural changes occurring in trees severely
    damaged by the pathogen. The blue/red ratios BR1 and BR2 showed downward trends
    with the increase in disease severity that resulted in significantly lower values
    at the initial, low and moderate symptom severity in BR1 (Fig. 12f) and low, moderate
    and severe in BR2. The LIC3 index showed a slightly decrease at early stages of
    the disease, followed by a significant (P < 0.05) increase on severely affected
    trees. The indices SIPI and PSSRc were inversely correlated with disease severity,
    showing significantly (P < 0.05) lower values at moderate and severe stages of
    disease development. The R520/R500, R515/R570, and R515/R670 ratios were not useful
    for the detection of VW as no significant differences were detected between asymptomatic
    and VW affected trees. The chlorophyll fluorescence signal estimated from the
    hyperspectral imagery with the FLD method showed a significant (P < 0.05) increase
    at initial and low stages of disease symptom severity (2.677 W·m− 2 μm− 1·sr−
    1), slightly decreasing to 2.019 W·m− 2·μm− 1·sr− 1 at the severe VW severity
    level (Fig. 12g). This result may indicate that the photosynthetic apparatus of
    the plant remains undamaged being able to dissipate the excess of energy by fluorescence
    that could not be maintained when the reduction in photosynthesis occurred at
    severely stressed plants, causing a decrease in the chlorophyll fluorescence rate.
    These results are in agreement with the studies conducted by Pérez-Priego et al.
    (2005) and Zarco-Tejada et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012 in citrus and
    olive orchards under water stress conditions. Comparable results were obtained
    in airborne (Table 3) and leaf-derived chlorophyll fluorescence (Fig. 8d) that
    in both cases reached lower values in trees affected by moderate or severe symptoms.
    However, a significant (P < 0.05) increase in fluorescence occurred in trees at
    the early stage of disease development only at canopy level (Table 3). Finally,
    the health index (HI) developed to discriminate between healthy and diseased sugar
    beet leaves affected by different foliar pathogens showed in this study lower
    values (P < 0.05) as the VW disease severity level increases to low, moderate
    or severe symptoms, respectively (Table 3; Fig. 12h). 4. Conclusions The present
    study assessed remote sensing methods for early detection of Verticillium wilt
    in two olive orchards of different agronomic characteristics. It applied techniques
    based on the detection of the effects of V. dahliae infection and colonization
    on water flow that eventually cause water stress effects, assessed with thermal,
    multispectral and hyperspectral domains. It demonstrated that canopy temperature
    and physiological hyperspectral indices (i.e., PRI and chlorophyll fluorescence)
    are related with physiological stress caused by VW. Moreover, structural indices
    (i.e., NDVI) were more related to structural damage caused by VW. Field measurements
    showed large differences in temperature (Tc − Ta) and stomatal conductance (G)
    across VW severity levels, with higher Tc − Ta and lower G as severity level increased.
    This allowed identifying trees at the early stages of disease development. At
    leaf level, the reduction in transpiration and G caused by VW infection was associated
    with a significant (P < 0.05) increase in the PRI570 and a decrease in fluorescence.
    The flights conducted with thermal, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras enabled
    VW detection by using crown temperature (Tc − Ta; CWSI), assessing structural
    indices (NDVI, RDVI, OSAVI, TVI, MTVI, SR, MSR), the PRI515 index, chlorophyll
    indices (red edge, VOG1, GM1, GM2, PSSRa, PSSRb, mCAI, TCARI, TCARI/OSAVI), R/G/B
    indices (B, BG1, BR1, BR2, LIC3), carotenoid (SIPI and PSSRc), fluorescence, and
    the healthy index (HI). This study proved the potentials for the early detection
    of V. dahliae infection and discrimination among VW severity levels in olive crops
    using thermal, multispectral and hyperspectral imagery acquired with an unmanned
    aerial vehicle. Crown temperature, CWSI, B, BG1, BR1 and FLD3 were identified
    as the best indicators to detect VW at early stages of disease development, while
    NDVI, PRI515, HI, and chlorophyll and carotenoid indices proved to be good indicators
    to detect the presence of moderate to severe damage. Acknowledgments Financial

  explanation: 'The study aims to explore the use of advanced sensing technologies,
    such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, for non-invasive and accurate
    detection of stress symptoms in plants, particularly in the context of integrated
    end-to-end automated systems for precision agriculture. The review focuses on
    the application of these sensing techniques in detecting disease and nutrient
    stress in various crops, highlighting the potential of these technologies to improve
    agricultural productivity and sustainability. The key findings of the study are
    summarized below:


    - Hyperspectral imaging has emerged as a promising tool for non-invasive plant
    stress detection due to its ability to capture detailed spectral information across
    a wide range of wavelengths. This technology has shown promising results in detecting
    various diseases and nutrient deficiencies in crops, enabling early and targeted
    interventions.


    - Thermal sensing, which measures temperature variations in plants, can also provide
    valuable insights into plant stress. By capturing subtle changes in temperature
    patterns, thermal sensing can detect water stress, nutrient deficiencies, and
    even early stages of disease development.


    - Integrating these advanced sensing technologies into end-to-end automated systems
    for precision agriculture holds significant potential for enhancing crop management
    practices. By combining data from multiple sensors and leveraging machine learning
    algorithms, these systems can provide real-time monitoring of plant health, enabling
    farmers to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.


    Overall, the study underscores the importance of integrating advanced sensing
    technologies into precision agriculture systems to improve crop management practices,
    reduce environmental impacts, and enhance agricultural productivity.'

    \ Learning\n2.1. Machine Learning Terminology and Deﬁnitions\nTypically, ML methodologies\
    \ involves a learning process with the objective to learn from\n“experience” (training\
    \ data) to perform a task. Data in ML consists of a set of examples. Usually,\n\
    an individual example is described by a set of attributes, also known as features\
    \ or variables. A feature\ncan be nominal (enumeration), binary (i.e., 0 or 1),\
    \ ordinal (e.g., A+ or B−), or numeric (integer, real\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n\
    4 of 29\nnumber, etc.). The performance of the ML model in a speciﬁc task is measured\
    \ by a performance\nmetric that is improved with experience over time. To calculate\
    \ the performance of ML models and\nalgorithms, various statistical and mathematical\
    \ models are used. After the end of the learning process,\nthe trained model can\
    \ be used to classify, predict, or cluster new examples (testing data) using the\n\
    experience obtained during the training process. Figure 1 shows a typical ML approach.\n\

    \ \nFigure 1. A typical machine learning approach. \nML tasks are typically classified into different broad categories depending on the learning type \n\
    (supervised/unsupervised), \nlearning \nmodels \n(classification, \nregression, \n\
    clustering, \nand \ndimensionality reduction), or the learning models employed to implement the selected task. \n\
    2.2. Tasks of Learning \nML tasks are classified into two main categories, that is, supervised and unsupervised learning, \n\
    depending on the learning signal of the learning system. In supervised learning, data are presented \n\
    with example inputs and the corresponding outputs, and the objective is to construct a general rule \n\
    that maps inputs to outputs. In some cases, inputs can be only partially available with some of the \n\
    target  outputs  missing  or  given  only  as  feedback  to  the  actions  in \
    \ a  dynamic  environment \n(reinforcement learning). In the supervised setting, the acquired expertise (trained model) is used to \n\
    predict the missing outputs (labels) for the test data. In unsupervised learning, however, there is no \n\
    distinction between training and test sets with data being unlabeled. The learner processes input data \n\
    with the goal of discovering hidden patterns. \n2.3. Analysis of Learning \nDimensionality reduction (DR) is an analysis that is executed in both families of supervised and \n\
    unsupervised  learning  types,  with  the  aim  of  providing  a  more  compact, \
    \ lower‐dimensional \nrepresentation of a dataset to preserve as much information as possible from the original data. It is \n\
    usually performed prior to applying a classification or regression model in order to avoid the effects \n\
    of dimensionality. Some of the most common DR algorithms are the following: (i) principal component \n\
    analysis [22], (ii) partial least squares regression [23], and (iii) linear discriminant analysis [24]. \n\
    2.4. Learning Models \nThe presentation of the learning models in ML is limited to the ones that have been implemented \n\
    in works presented in this review. \n2.4.1. Regression \nRegression constitutes a supervised learning model, which aims to provide the prediction of an \n\
    output variable according to the input variables, which are known. Most known algorithms include \n\
    linear regression and logistic regression [25], as well as stepwise regression [26]. Also, more complex \n\
    regression  algorithms  have  been  developed,  such  as  ordinary  least  squares \
    \ regression  [27], \nmultivariate  adaptive  regression  splines  [28],  multiple \

    Figure 1. A typical machine learning approach.\nML tasks are typically classiﬁed\
    \ into different broad categories depending on the learning type\n(supervised/unsupervised),\
    \ learning models (classiﬁcation, regression, clustering, and dimensionality\n\
    reduction), or the learning models employed to implement the selected task.\n\
    2.2. Tasks of Learning\nML tasks are classiﬁed into two main categories, that\
    \ is, supervised and unsupervised learning,\ndepending on the learning signal\
    \ of the learning system. In supervised learning, data are presented\nwith example\
    \ inputs and the corresponding outputs, and the objective is to construct a general\
    \ rule that\nmaps inputs to outputs. In some cases, inputs can be only partially\
    \ available with some of the target\noutputs missing or given only as feedback\
    \ to the actions in a dynamic environment (reinforcement\nlearning). In the supervised\
    \ setting, the acquired expertise (trained model) is used to predict the\nmissing\
    \ outputs (labels) for the test data. In unsupervised learning, however, there\
    \ is no distinction\nbetween training and test sets with data being unlabeled.\
    \ The learner processes input data with the\ngoal of discovering hidden patterns.\n\
    2.3. Analysis of Learning\nDimensionality reduction (DR) is an analysis that is\
    \ executed in both families of supervised\nand unsupervised learning types, with\
    \ the aim of providing a more compact, lower-dimensional\nrepresentation of a\
    \ dataset to preserve as much information as possible from the original data.\
    \ It is\nusually performed prior to applying a classiﬁcation or regression model\
    \ in order to avoid the effects of\ndimensionality. Some of the most common DR\
    \ algorithms are the following: (i) principal component\nanalysis [22], (ii) partial\
    \ least squares regression [23], and (iii) linear discriminant analysis [24].\n\
    2.4. Learning Models\nThe presentation of the learning models in ML is limited\
    \ to the ones that have been implemented\nin works presented in this review.\n\
    2.4.1. Regression\nRegression constitutes a supervised learning model, which aims\
    \ to provide the prediction of an\noutput variable according to the input variables,\
    \ which are known. Most known algorithms include\nlinear regression and logistic\
    \ regression [25], as well as stepwise regression [26]. Also, more complex\nregression\
    \ algorithms have been developed, such as ordinary least squares regression [27],\
    \ multivariate\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n5 of 29\nadaptive regression splines [28],\
    \ multiple linear regression, cubist [29], and locally estimated scatterplot\n\
    smoothing [30].\n2.4.2. Clustering\nClustering [31] is a typical application of\
    \ unsupervised learning model, typically used to\nﬁnd natural groupings of data\
    \ (clusters). Well established clustering techniques are the k-means\ntechnique\
    \ [32], the hierarchical technique [33], and the expectation maximisation technique\
    \ [34].\n2.4.3. Bayesian Models\nBayesian models (BM) are a family of probabilistic\
    \ graphical models in which the analysis is\nundertaken within the context of\
    \ Bayesian inference. This type of model belongs to the supervised\nlearning category\
    \ and can be employed for solving either classiﬁcation or regression problems.\n\
    Naive bayes [35], gaussian naive bayes, multinomial naive bayes, bayesian network\
    \ [36], mixture\nof gaussians [37], and bayesian belief network [38] are some\
    \ of the most prominent algorithms in\nthe literature.\n2.4.4. Instance Based\
    \ Models\nInstance based models (IBM) are memory-based models that learn by comparing\
    \ new examples\nwith instances in the training database. They construct hypotheses\
    \ directly from the data available,\nwhile they do not maintain a set of abstractions,\
    \ and generate classiﬁcation or regression predictions\nusing only speciﬁc instances.\
    \ The disadvantage of these models is that their complexity grows with\ndata.\
    \ The most common learning algorithms in this category are the k-nearest neighbor\
    \ [39], locally\nweighted learning [40], and learning vector quantization [41].\n\
    2.4.5. Decision Trees\nDecision trees (DT) are classiﬁcation or regression models\
    \ formulated in a tree-like\narchitecture [42]. With DT, the dataset is progressively\
    \ organized in smaller homogeneous subsets\n(sub-populations), while at the same\
    \ time, an associated tree graph is generated. Each internal node\nof the tree\
    \ structure represents a different pairwise comparison on a selected feature,\
    \ whereas each\nbranch represents the outcome of this comparison. Leaf nodes represent\
    \ the ﬁnal decision or prediction\ntaken after following the path from root to\
    \ leaf (expressed as a classiﬁcation rule). The most common\nlearning algorithms\
    \ in this category are the classiﬁcation and regression trees [43], the chi-square\n\
    automatic interaction detector [44], and the iterative dichotomiser [45].\n2.4.6.\
    \ Artiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are divided into\
    \ two categories; “Traditional ANNs” and\n“Deep ANNs”.\nANNs are inspired by the\
    \ human brain functionality, emulating complex functions such as\npattern generation,\
    \ cognition, learning, and decision making [46]. The human brain consists of billions\n\
    of neurons that inter-communicate and process any information provided. Similarly,\
    \ an ANN as a\nsimpliﬁed model of the structure of the biological neural network,\
    \ consists of interconnected processing\nunits organized in a speciﬁc topology.\
    \ A number of nodes are arranged in multiple layers including\nthe following:\n\
    1.\nAn input layer where the data is fed into the system,\n2.\nOne or more hidden\
    \ layers where the learning takes place, and\n3.\nAn output layer where the decision/prediction\
    \ is given.\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n6 of 29\nANNs are supervised models that\
    \ are typically used for regression and classiﬁcation problems.\nThe learning\
    \ algorithms commonly used in ANNs include the radial basis function networks\
    \ [47],\nperceptron algorithms [48], back-propagation [49], and resilient back-propagation\
    \ [50]. Also, a large\nnumber of ANN-based learning algorithms have been reported,\
    \ such as counter propagation\nalgorithms [51], adaptive-neuro fuzzy inference\
    \ systems [52], autoencoder, XY-Fusion, and supervised\nKohonen networks [53],\
    \ as well as Hopﬁeld networks [54], multilayer perceptron [55], self-organising\n\
    maps [56], extreme learning machines [57], generalized regression neural network\
    \ [58], ensemble neural\nnetworks or ensemble averaging, and self-adaptive evolutionary\
    \ extreme learning machines [59].\nDeep ANNs are most widely referred to as deep\
    \ learning (DL) or deep neural networks\n(DNNs) [60]. They are a relatively new\
    \ area of ML research allowing computational models that\nare composed of multiple\
    \ processing layers to learn complex data representations using multiple\nlevels\
    \ of abstraction. One of the main advantages of DL is that in some cases, the\
    \ step of feature\nextraction is performed by the model itself. DL models have\
    \ dramatically improved the state-of-the-art\nin many different sectors and industries,\
    \ including agriculture. DNN’s are simply an ANN with\nmultiple hidden layers\
    \ between the input and output layers and can be either supervised, partially\n\
    supervised, or even unsupervised. A common DL model is the convolutional neural\
    \ network (CNN),\nwhere feature maps are extracted by performing convolutions\
    \ in the image domain. A comprehensive\nintroduction on CNNs is given in the literature\
    \ [61]. Other typical DL architectures include deep\nBoltzmann machine, deep belief\
    \ network [62], and auto-encoders [63].\n2.4.7. Support Vector Machines\nSupport\
    \ vector machines (SVMs) were ﬁrst introduced in the work of [64] on the foundation\
    \ of\nstatistical learning theory. SVM is intrinsically a binary classiﬁer that\
    \ constructs a linear separating\nhyperplane to classify data instances. The classiﬁcation\
    \ capabilities of traditional SVMs can be\nsubstantially enhanced through transformation\
    \ of the original feature space into a feature space of\na higher dimension by\
    \ using the “kernel trick”. SVMs have been used for classiﬁcation, regression,\n\
    and clustering. Based on global optimization, SVMs deal with overﬁtting problems,\
    \ which appear\nin high-dimensional spaces, making them appealing in various applications\
    \ [65,66]. Most used SVM\nalgorithms include the support vector regression [67],\
    \ least squares support vector machine [68],\nand successive projection algorithm-support\
    \ vector machine [69].\n2.4.8. Ensemble Learning\nEnsemble learning (EL) models\
    \ aim at improving the predictive performance of a given statistical\nlearning\
    \ or model ﬁtting technique by constructing a linear combination of simpler base\
    \ learner.\nConsidering that each trained ensemble represents a single hypothesis,\
    \ these multiple-classiﬁer systems\nenable hybridization of hypotheses not induced\
    \ by the same base learner, thus yielding better results in\nthe case of signiﬁcant\
    \ diversity among the single models. Decision trees have been typically used as\
    \ the\nbase learner in EL models, for example, random forest [70], whereas a large\
    \ number of boosting and\nbagging implementations have been also proposed, for\
    \ example, boosting technique [71], adaboost [72],\nand bootstrap aggregating\
    \ or bagging algorithm [73].\n3. Review\nThe reviewed articles have been, on a\
    \ ﬁrst level, classiﬁed in four generic categories; namely, crop\nmanagement,\
    \ livestock management, water management, and soil management. The applications\
    \ of\nML in the crop section were divided into sub-categories including yield\
    \ prediction, disease detection,\nweed detection crop quality, and species recognition.\
    \ The applications of ML in the livestock section\nwere divided into two sub-categories;\
    \ animal welfare and livestock production.\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n7 of 29\n\
    The search engines implemented were Scopus, ScienceDirect and PubMed. The selected\
    \ articles\nregard works presented solely in journal papers. Climate prediction,\
    \ although very important for\nagricultural production, has not been included\
    \ in the presented review, considering the fact that ML\napplications for climate\
    \ prediction is a complete area by itself. Finally, all articles presented here\
    \ regard\nthe period from 2004 up to the present.\n3.1. Crop Management\n3.1.1.\
    \ Yield Prediction\nYield prediction, one of the most signiﬁcant topics in precision\
    \ agriculture, is of high importance\nfor yield mapping, yield estimation, matching\
    \ of crop supply with demand, and crop management to\nincrease productivity. Examples\
    \ of ML applications include in those in the works of [74]; an efﬁcient,\nlow-cost,\
    \ and non-destructive method that automatically counted coffee fruits on a branch.\
    \ The method\ncalculates the coffee fruits in three categories: harvestable, not\
    \ harvestable, and fruits with disregarded\nmaturation stage. In addition, the\
    \ method estimated the weight and the maturation percentage of the\ncoffee fruits.\
    \ The aim of this work was to provide information to coffee growers to optimise\
    \ economic\nbeneﬁts and plan their agricultural work. Another study that used\
    \ for yield prediction is that by\nthe authors of [75], in which they developed\
    \ a machine vision system for automating shaking and\ncatching cherries during\
    \ harvest. The system segments and detects occluded cherry branches with\nfull\
    \ foliage even when these are inconspicuous. The main aim of the system was to\
    \ reduce labor\nrequirements in manual harvesting and handling operations. In\
    \ another study [76], authors developed\nan early yield mapping system for the\
    \ identiﬁcation of immature green citrus in a citrus grove under\noutdoor conditions.\
    \ As all other relative studies, the aim of the study was to provide growers with\n\
    yield-speciﬁc information to assist them to optimise their grove in terms of proﬁt\
    \ and increased yield.\nIn another study [77], the authors developed a model for\
    \ the estimation of grassland biomass (kg dry\nmatter/ha/day) based on ANNs and\
    \ multitemporal remote sensing data. Another study dedicated\nto yield prediction,\
    \ and speciﬁcally to wheat yield prediction, was presented in another study [78].\n\
    The developed method used satellite imagery and received crop growth characteristics\
    \ fused with\nsoil data for a more accurate prediction. The authors of [79] presented\
    \ a method for the detection of\ntomatoes based on EM and remotely sensed red\
    \ green blue (RGB) images, which were captured by an\nunmanned aerial vehicle\
    \ (UAV). Also, in the work of [80], authors developed a method for the rice\n\
    development stage prediction based on SVM and basic geographic information obtained\
    \ from weather\nstations in China. Finally, a generalized method for agricultural\
    \ yield predictions, was presented in\nanother study [81]. The method is based\
    \ on an ENN application on long-period generated agronomical\ndata (1997–2014).\
    \ The study regards regional predictions (speciﬁcally in in Taiwan) focused on\
    \ the\nsupporting farmers to avoid imbalances in market supply and demand caused\
    \ or hastened by harvest\ncrop quality.\nTable 5 summarizes the above papers for\

    \ Detection\nDisease detection and yield prediction are the sub-categories with\
    \ the higher number of articles\npresented in this review. One of the most signiﬁcant\
    \ concerns in agriculture is pest and disease\ncontrol in open-air (arable farming)\
    \ and greenhouse conditions. The most widely used practice\nin pest and disease\
    \ control is to uniformly spray pesticides over the cropping area. This practice,\n\
    although effective, has a high ﬁnancial and signiﬁcant environmental cost. Environmental\
    \ impacts\ncan be residues in crop products, side effects on ground water contamination,\
    \ impacts on local\nwildlife and eco-systems, and so on. ML is an integrated part\
    \ of precision agriculture management,\nwhere agro-chemicals input is targeted\
    \ in terms of time and place. In the literature [82], a tool\nis presented for\
    \ the detection and discrimination of healthy Silybum marianum plants and those\n\
    infected by smut fungus Microbotyum silybum during vegetative growth. In the work\
    \ of [83], authors\ndeveloped a new method based on image processing procedure\
    \ for the classiﬁcation of parasites\nand the automatic detection of thrips in\
    \ strawberry greenhouse environment, for real-time control.\nThe authos of [84]\
    \ presented a method for detection and screening of Bakanae disease in rice seedlings.\n\
    More speciﬁcally, the aim of the study was the accurate detection of pathogen\
    \ Fusarium fujikuroi for\ntwo rice cultivars. The automated detection of infected\
    \ plants increased grain yield and was less\ntime-consuming compared with naked\
    \ eye examination.\nWheat is one of the most economically signiﬁcant crops worldwide.\
    \ The last ﬁve studies presented\nin this sub-category are dedicated to the detection\
    \ and discrimination between diseased and healthy\nwheat crops. The authors of\
    \ [85] developed a new system for the detection of nitrogen stressed,\nand yellow\
    \ rust infected and healthy winter wheat canopies based on hierarchical self-organizing\n\
    classiﬁer and hyperspectral reﬂectance imaging data. The study aimed at the accurate\
    \ detection of these\ncategories for a more effective usage of fungicides and\
    \ fertilizers according to the plant’s needs. In the\nnext case study [86], the\
    \ development of a system was presented that automatically discriminated\nbetween\
    \ water stressed Septoria tritici infected and healthy winter wheat canopies.\
    \ The approach used\nan least squares (LS)-SVM classiﬁer with optical multisensor\
    \ fusion. The authors of [87] presented a\nmethod to detect either yellow rust\
    \ infected or healthy wheat, based on ANN models and spectral\nreﬂectance features.\
    \ The accurate detection of either infected or healthy plants enables the precise\n\
    targeting of pesticides in the ﬁeld. In the work of [88], a real time remote sensing\
    \ system is presented\nfor the detection of yellow rust infected and healthy wheat.\
    \ The system is based on a self-organising\nmap (SOM) neural network and data\
    \ fusion of hyper-spectral reﬂection and multi-spectral ﬂuorescence\nimaging.\
    \ The goal of the study was the accurate detection, before it can visibly detected,\
    \ of yellow\nrust infected winter wheat cultivar “Madrigal”. Finally, the authors\
    \ of [89] presented a method for\nthe simultaneous identiﬁcation and discrimination\
    \ of yellow rust infected, and nitrogen stressed and\nhealthy wheat plants of\
    \ cultivar “Madrigal”. The approach is based on an SOM neural network and\nhyperspectral\
    \ reﬂectance imaging. The aim of the study was the accurate discrimination between\n\
    the plant stress, which is caused by disease and nutrient deﬁciency stress under\
    \ ﬁeld conditions.\nFinally, the author of [90] presented a CNN-based method for\
    \ the disease detection diagnosis based\non simple leaves images with sufﬁcient\
    \ accuracy to classify between healthy and diseased leaves in\nvarious plants.\n\

    Weed detection and management is another signiﬁcant problem in agriculture. Many\
    \ producers\nindicate weeds as the most important threat to crop production. The\
    \ accurate detection of weeds is\nof high importance to sustainable agriculture,\
    \ because weeds are difﬁcult to detect and discriminate\nfrom crops. Again, ML\
    \ algorithms in conjunction with sensors can lead to accurate detection and\n\
    discrimination of weeds with low cost and with no environmental issues and side\
    \ effects. ML for\nweed detection can enable the development of tools and robots\
    \ to destroy weeds, which minimise\nthe need for herbicides. Two studies on ML\
    \ applications for weed detection issues in agriculture\nhave been presented.\
    \ In the ﬁrst study [91], authors presented a new method based on counter\npropagation\
    \ (CP)-ANN and multispectral images captured by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)\
    \ for\nthe identiﬁcation of Silybum marianum, a weed that is hard to eradicate\
    \ and causes major loss on\ncrop yield. In the second study [92], the authors\
    \ developed a new method based on ML techniques\nand hyperspectral imaging, for\
    \ crop and weed species recognition. More speciﬁcally, the authors\ncreated an\
    \ active learning system for the recognition of Maize (Zea mayas), as crop plant\
    \ species\nand Ranunculus repens, Cirsium arvense, Sinapis arvensis, Stellaria\
    \ media, Tarraxacum ofﬁcinale,\nPoa annua, Polygonum persicaria, Urtica dioica,\
    \ Oxalis europaea, and Medicago lupulina as weed\nspecies. The main goal was the\
    \ accurate recognition and discrimination of these species for economic\nand environmental\
    \ purposes. In another study [93], the authors developed a weed detection method\n\
    based on SVN in grassland cropping.\nTable 7 summarizes the above papers for the\

    \ crop category is studies developed for the identiﬁcation\nof features connected\
    \ with the crop quality. The accurate detection and classiﬁcation of crop quality\n\
    characteristics can increase product price and reduce waste. In the ﬁrst study\
    \ [94], the authors presented\nand developed a new method for the detection and\
    \ classiﬁcation of botanical and non-botanical\nforeign matter embedded inside\
    \ cotton lint during harvesting. The aim of the study was quality\nimprovement\
    \ while the minimising ﬁber damage. Another study [95] regards pears production\
    \ and,\nmore speciﬁcally, a method was presented for the identiﬁcation and differentiation\
    \ of Korla fragrant\npears into deciduous-calyx or persistent-calyx categories.\
    \ The approach applied ML methods with\nhyperspectral reﬂectance imaging. The\
    \ ﬁnal study for this sub-category was by the authors of [96],\nin which a method\
    \ was presented for the prediction and classiﬁcation of the geographical origin\
    \ for\nSensors 2018, 18, 2674\n14 of 29\nrice samples. The method was based on\
    \ ML techniques applied on chemical components of samples.\nMore speciﬁcally,\
    \ the main goal was the classiﬁcation of the geographical origin of rice, for\
    \ two\ndifferent climate regions in Brazil; Goias and Rio Grande do Sul. The results\
    \ showed that Cd, Rb, Mg,\nand K are the four most relevant chemical components\
    \ for the classiﬁcation of samples.\nTable 8 summarizes the above presented articles.\n\

    \ The main goal is the automatic\nidentiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of plant species\
    \ in order to avoid the use of human experts, as well as\nto reduce the classiﬁcation\
    \ time. A method for the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of three legume\nspecies,\
    \ namely, white beans, red beans, and soybean, via leaf vein patterns has been\
    \ presented in [97].\nVein morphology carries accurate information about the properties\
    \ of the leaf. It is an ideal tool for\nplant identiﬁcation in comparison with\
    \ color and shape.\nTable 9 summarizes the above study for the case of species\

    \ consists of two sub-categories, namely, animal welfare and livestock\nproduction.\
    \ Animal welfare deals with the health and wellbeing of animals, with the main\
    \ application\nof ML in monitoring animal behaviour for the early detection of\
    \ diseases. On the other hand, livestock\nproduction deals with issues in the\
    \ production system, where the main scope of ML applications is the\naccurate\
    \ estimation of economic balances for the producers based on production line monitoring.\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 2674\n15 of 29\n3.2.1. Animal Welfare\nSeveral articles are\
    \ reported to belong to the animal welfare sub-category. In the ﬁrst article [98],\n\
    a method is presented for the classiﬁcation of cattle behaviour based on ML models\
    \ using data collected\nby collar sensors with magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers.\
    \ The aim of the study was the\nprediction of events such as the oestrus and the\
    \ recognition of dietary changes on cattle. In the second\narticle [99], a system\
    \ was presented for the automatic identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of chewing\n\
    patterns in calves. The authors created a system based on ML applying data from\
    \ chewing signals of\ndietary supplements, such as hay and ryegrass, combined\
    \ with behaviour data, such as rumination\nand idleness. Data was collected by\
    \ optical FBG sensors. In another study [100], an automated\nmonitoring system\
    \ based on ML was presented for animal behavior tracking, including tracking of\n\
    animal movements by depth video cameras, for monitoring various activities of\
    \ the animal (standing,\nmoving, feeding, and drinking).\nTable 10 summarizes\
    \ the features of the above presented articles.\n3.2.2. Livestock Production\n\
    The sub-category of livestock production regards studies developed for the accurate\
    \ prediction\nand estimation of farming parameters to optimize the economic efﬁciency\
    \ of the production system.\nThis sub-category consists of the presentation of\
    \ four articles, three with cattle production and one for\nhens’ eggs production.\
    \ In the work of [101], a method for the prediction of the rumen fermentation\n\
    pattern from milk fatty acids was presented. The main aim of the study was to\
    \ achieve the most\naccurate prediction of rumen fermentations, which play a signiﬁcant\
    \ role for the evaluation of diets for\nmilk production. In addition, this work\
    \ showed that milk fatty acids have ideal features to predict\nthe molar proportions\
    \ of volatile fatty acids in the rumen. The next study [102] was related to hen\n\
    production. Speciﬁcally, a method based on SVM model was presented for the early\
    \ detection and\nwarning of problems in the commercial production of eggs. Based\
    \ on SVM methods [103], a method for\nthe accurate estimation of bovine weight\
    \ trajectories over time was presented. The accurate estimation\nof cattle weights\
    \ is very important for breeders. The last article of the section [104] deals\
    \ with the\ndevelopment of a function for the prediction of carcass weight for\
    \ beef cattle of the Asturiana de los\nValles breed based on SVR models and zoometric\
    \ measurements features. The results show that the\npresented method can predict\
    \ carcass weights 150 days prior to the slaughter day. The authors of [105]\n\
    presented a method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied in digital\
    \ images for\npig face recognition. The main aim of the research was the identiﬁcation\
    \ of animals without the need\nfor radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) tags,\
    \ which involve a distressing activity for the animal, are\nlimited in their range,\
    \ and are a time-consuming method.\nTable 11 summarizes the features of the above\
    \ presented works.\n3.3. Water Management\nWater management in agricultural production\

    18 of 29\nThis section consists of four studies that were mostly developed for\
    \ the estimation of daily, weekly,\nor monthly evapotranspiration. The accurate\
    \ estimation of evapotranspiration is a complex process\nand is of a high importance\
    \ for resource management in crop production, as well as for the design\nand the\
    \ operation management of irrigation systems. In another study [106], the authors\
    \ developed a\ncomputational method for the estimation of monthly mean evapotranspiration\
    \ for arid and semi-arid\nregions. It used monthly mean climatic data of 44 meteorological\
    \ stations for the period 1951–2010.\nIn another study dedicated to ML applications\
    \ on agricultural water management [107], two scenarios\nwere presented for the\
    \ estimation of the daily evapotranspiration from temperature data collected\n\
    from six meteorological stations of a region during the long period (i.e., 1961–2014).\
    \ Finally, in another\nstudy [108], authors developed a method based on ELM model\
    \ fed with temperature data for the\nweekly estimation of evapotranspiration for\
    \ two meteorological weather stations. The purpose was\nthe accurate estimation\
    \ of weekly evapotranspiration in arid regions of India based on limited data\n\
    scenario for crop water management.\nDaily dew point temperature, on the other\
    \ hand, is a signiﬁcant element for the identiﬁcation of\nexpected weather phenomena,\
    \ as well as for the estimation of evapotranspiration and evaporation.\nIn another\
    \ article [109], a model is presented for the prediction of daily dew point temperature,\
    \ based\non ML. The weather data were collected from two different weather stations.\n\
    Table 12 summarizes the above papers for the case of the water management sub-category.\n\
    3.4. Soil Management\nThe ﬁnal category of this review concerns ML application\
    \ on prediction-identiﬁcation of\nagricultural soil properties, such as the estimation\
    \ of soil drying, condition, temperature, and moisture\ncontent. Soil is a heterogeneous\
    \ natural resource, with complex processes and mechanisms that are\ndifﬁcult to\
    \ understand. Soil properties allow researchers to understand the dynamics of\
    \ ecosystems\nand the impingement in agriculture. The accurate estimation of soil\
    \ conditions can lead to improved\nsoil management. Soil temperature alone plays\
    \ a signiﬁcant role for the accurate analysis of the\nclimate change effects of\
    \ a region and eco-environmental conditions. It is a signiﬁcant meteorological\n\
    parameter controlling the interactive processes between ground and atmosphere.\
    \ In addition, soil\nmoisture has an important role for crop yield variability.\
    \ However, soil measurements are generally\ntime-consuming and expensive, so a\
    \ low cost and reliable solution for the accurate estimation of soil\ncan be achieved\
    \ with the usage of computational analysis based on ML techniques. The ﬁrst study\
    \ for\nthis last sub-category is the work of [110]. More speciﬁcally, this study\
    \ presented a method for the\nevaluation of soil drying for agricultural planning.\
    \ The method accurately evaluates the soil drying,\nwith evapotranspiration and\
    \ precipitation data, in a region located in Urbana, IL of the United States.\n\
    The goal of this method was the provision of remote agricultural management decisions.\
    \ The second\nstudy [111] was developed for the prediction of soil condition.\
    \ In particular, the study presented the\ncomparison of four regression models\
    \ for the prediction of soil organic carbon (OC), moisture content\n(MC), and\
    \ total nitrogen (TN). More speciﬁcally, the authors used a visible-near infrared\
    \ (VIS-NIR)\nspectrophotometer to collect soil spectra from 140 unprocessed and\
    \ wet samples of the top layer of\nLuvisol soil types. The samples were collected\
    \ from an arable ﬁeld in Premslin, Germany in August\n2013, after the harvest\
    \ of wheat crops. They concluded that the accurate prediction of soil properties\n\
    can optimize soil management. In a third study [112], the authors developed a\
    \ new method based on a\nself adaptive evolutionary-extreme learning machine (SaE-ELM)\
    \ model and daily weather data for\nthe estimation of daily soil temperature at\
    \ six different depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 cm in two\ndifferent in climate\
    \ conditions regions of Iran; Bandar Abbas and Kerman. The aim was the accurate\n\

    \ that ML models have been applied in multiple\napplications for crop management\
    \ (61%); mostly yield prediction (20%) and disease detection (22%).\nThis trend\
    \ in the applications distribution reﬂects the data intense applications within\
    \ crop and\nhigh use of images (spectral, hyperspectral, NIR, etc.). Data analysis,\
    \ as a mature scientiﬁc ﬁeld,\nprovides the ground for the development of numerous\
    \ applications related to crop management\nbecause, in most cases, ML-based predictions\
    \ can be extracted without the need for fusion of data from\nother resources.\
    \ In contrast, when data recordings are involved, occasionally at the level of\
    \ big data,\nthe implementations of ML are less in number, mainly because of the\
    \ increased efforts required for\nthe data analysis task and not for the ML models\
    \ per se. This fact partially explains the almost equal\ndistribution of ML applications\
    \ in livestock management (19%), water management (10%), and soil\nmanagement\
    \ (10%). It is also evident from the analysis that most of the studies used ANN\
    \ and SVM\nML models. More speciﬁcally, ANNs were used mostly for implementations\
    \ in crop, water, and soil\nmanagement, while SVMs were used mostly for livestock\
    \ management.\nBy applying machine learning to sensor data, farm management systems\
    \ are evolving into real\nartiﬁcial intelligence systems, providing richer recommendations\
    \ and insights for the subsequent\ndecisions and actions with the ultimate scope\
    \ of production improvement. For this scope, in the future,\nit is expected that\
    \ the usage of ML models will be even more widespread, allowing for the possibility\n\
    of integrated and applicable tools. At the moment, all of the approaches regard\
    \ individual approaches\nand solutions and are not adequately connected with the\
    \ decision-making process, as seen in other\napplication domains. This integration\
    \ of automated data recording, data analysis, ML implementation,\nand decision-making\
    \ or support will provide practical tolls that come in line with the so-called\n\
    knowledge-based agriculture for increasing production levels and bio-products\

    - The key findings of the study are summarized below:- Hyperspectral imaging has
      emerged as a promising tool for non-invasive plant stress detection due to its
      ability to capture detailed spectral information across a wide range of wavelengths.
    - This technology has shown promising results in detecting various diseases and
      nutrient deficiencies in crops, enabling early and targeted interventions.
    - Thermal sensing, which measures temperature variations in plants, can also provide

    Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Many applications require a timely acquisition
    of high spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing data. This is often not
    achievable since spaceborne remote sensing instruments face a tradeoff between
    spatial and spectral resolution, while airborne sensors mounted on a manned aircraft
    are too expensive to acquire a high temporal resolution. This gap between information
    needs and data availability inspires research on using Remotely Piloted Aircraft
    Systems (RPAS) to capture the desired high spectral and spatial information, furthermore
    providing temporal flexibility. Present hyperspectral imagers on board lightweight
    RPAS are still rare, due to the operational complexity, sensor weight, and instability.
    This paper looks into the use of a hyperspectral-hyperspatial fusion technique
    for an improved biophysical parameter retrieval and physiological assessment in
    agricultural crops. First, a biophysical parameter extraction study is performed
    on a simulated citrus orchard. Subsequently, the unmixing-based fusion is applied
    on a real test case in commercial citrus orchards with discontinuous canopies,
    in which a more efficient and accurate estimation of water stress is achieved
    by fusing thermal hyperspatial and hyperspectral (APEX) imagery. Narrowband reflectance
    indices that have proven their effectiveness as previsual indicators of water
    stress, such as the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), show a significant
    increase in tree water-stress detection when applied on the fused dataset compared
    to the original hyperspectral APEX dataset (R 2 = 0.62, p <;0.001 vs. R 2 = 0.21,
    p > 0.1). Maximal R 2 values of 0.93 and 0.86 are obtained by a linear relationship
    between the vegetation index and the resp., water and chlorophyll, parameter content

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction For many precision farming applications,
    the continuous retrieval of spatial, spectral, and/or thermal variability within
    heterogeneous crops is of great importance. This detailed information is needed
    for identifying vegetation stress, which is one of the major factors influencing
    farming management decisions making. Since wilting and dying of plants only occur
    at extreme developed stress stages, a visual inspection of vegetation health status
    is most often not time-efficient to avoid yield losses. Numerous studies have
    focused on early, nondestructive stress detection for more efficient crop management
    practices. From these, we can conclude that the physiological responses to stress
    can be captured in reflectance signals and temperature profiles [1]–[3]. Methods
    regarding canopy temperature were mainly focused on the effects of water stress
    on stomatal closure and thermal energy dissipation pathways. In 1982, Idso [4]
    found out that a large difference between canopy temperature and ambient temperature
    (Tc–Ta) was associated with water stressed plants, whereas low difference values
    were associated with well-irrigated plots. Other studies mainly focused on reflectance
    patterns. Vegetation indices (VIs) provide a very simple yet elegant method for
    extracting the green plant quantity signal from complex canopy spectra. Often
    computed as differences, ratios, or linear combinations of reflected light in
    visible and NIR wavebands [5]–[8], VIs exploit the basic differences between soil
    and plant spectra. Broad waveband Vis, however, typically lacks diagnostic capability
    for identifying a particular type of stress or for determining why biomass is
    at a certain level. Narrower band, hyperspectral, indices such as the Photochemical
    Reflectance Index (PRI), Water Band Index (WBI), and Normalized Pigment Chlorophyll
    Ratio Index (NPCI) are examples of reflectance indices that are correlated with
    certain physiological plant responses and have promise for diagnosing water and
    nutrient stress [9]–[11]. Next to the high spectral and temporal resolution imagery
    needed to timely capture subtle differences in reflectance spectra caused by plant
    physiological responses, also high spatial resolution data are needed. Suarez
    et al. [12], e.g., indicated the importance of acquiring very high spatial resolution
    imagery ( Undefined control sequence \nbsp ) for assessing fruit quality and water
    stress in citrus and olive orchards. Stuckens et al. [13] came to a similar conclusion
    when exploring the number of spectrally mixed pixels (i.e., trees, weeds and/or
    soil all occur within a single image pixel) in simulated orchards. They concluded
    that pixel sizes should be smaller than 1 m in order to obtain a minimum of 50%
    pure pixels and smaller than 10 cm for 82% pure pixels. Followup studies demonstrated
    that these mixing effects of plants and background/litter, whether linear or nonlinear,
    play an important role in obstructing a detailed assessment of crop conditions
    in these heterogeneous architectures [14], [15]. Until recently, it was not feasible
    or affordable to capture high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution image
    datasets. For high temporal resolution imagery, one should refer to spaceborne
    data. However, due to physical limitations and data-transfer requirements the
    design and development of spaceborne remote sensors face a tradeoff between the
    spatial and spectral resolution [16]. The Hyperion sensor on board the EO-1 satellite
    currently offers the highest spectral resolution available from space. The spatial
    resolution of 30 m restricts, however, a proper use of the inherent potential
    of these data for detailed mapping purposes [17] and precision farming applications
    [18]. On the other hand, sensors such as Quickbird and WorldView-2 are able to
    offer very high spatial resolution imagery, but at the expense of their spectral
    resolution: panchromatic at submeter spatial resolution, and 4 (Quickbird) to
    8 (Worldview-2) broad spectral bands with approximately 2.5 m spatial resolution.
    With the launch of new high-resolution (HR) satellites such as Worldview-3 and
    planned hyperspectral missions like Enmap [19], [20], Prisma [21], and Hyspiri
    [22] much more data will become available to the user community. Still, the tradeoff
    in spectral and spatial resolution will remain and new advanced data and decision
    fusion approaches are needed to make optimal use of the future sensor ensembles.
    Full-range (400–2500 nm) hyperspectral airborne sensors such as Airborne Prism
    EXperiment (APEX), Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS), Airborne Visible/Infrared
    Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), and Hyperspectral Mapper (Hymap), also face this
    spectral–spatial resolution tradeoff [16]. These hyperspectral airborne sensors
    are limited to a spatial resolution of around 2 m, which for the above mentioned
    precision farming application might not be sufficient. Novel hyperspectral sensors,
    such as HYSPEX and FIRST, could be mounted on a manned aircraft which, when flying
    very low, might provide high spatial and spectral resolution data. However, due
    to the high operational cost of manned flight campaigns, the temporal resolution
    of this kind of data will be limited. Innovative developments in Remotely Piloted
    Aircraft Systems (RPAS) platforms and associated sensing technologies are nowadays
    expanding at an increasing rate, bringing image resolutions to unprecedented levels
    of detail, thereby opening exciting new application opportunities [23]. This is
    especially of huge interest to the precision farming community [24], which requires
    flexible and frequent data capturing. Although, mainly due to payload restrictions,
    full-range optical hyperspectral sensors (i.e., ranging from 350 to 2500 nm) are
    not yet suited to be operated in an operational manner on these lightweight RPAS
    platforms proposed for precision agriculture. Only few studies have successfully
    tested pushbroom hyperspectral VNIR sensors on a small, lightweight, fixed-wing
    RPAS [25]. In an attempt to overcome current spatial, spectral, temporal resolution
    tradeoffs in spectral sensor design, this study investigates the possibility of
    assembling a promising new data source through fusing very-high spatial and high
    spectral imagery based on unmixing techniques, as such enabling more detailed
    monitoring purposes. We thereby hypothesize that the combination of the high spatial
    resolution imagery captured by a sensor mounted on a RPAS and the more detailed
    spectral information available from airborne hyperspectral sensors, albeit at
    lower spatial resolution, can help to overcome the spatial–spectral data availability
    tradeoff. Reviews of data fusion methods can be found in [26] and [27]. An interesting
    unmixing-based fusion technique was previously proposed by Zurita-Milla et al.
    [28], who extended on the work of Zhukov et al. [29] and Filiberti [30]. In each
    of these studies, a multisensor, multiresolution fusion technique was applied
    to unmix low spatial resolution images using the information about their pixel
    composition from coregistered high spatial resolution images. Yet, none of these
    studies were performed on very high spatial (cm resolution) and hyperspectral
    datasets. Filiberti [30] merged a high-spatial-resolution panchromatic band with
    a low-spatial-resolution multispectral Landsat TM band with a 1:2 ground sample
    distance (GSD) ratio between the panchromatic (15 m) and the TM multispectral
    band (30 m). As such, he aimed at restoring the multispectral image using content
    from the higher resolution panchromatic image. Zurita-Milla et al. [28] showed
    that the unmixing-based data fusion approach can be used to successfully downscale
    MERIS FR information (300 m pixel size, 15 bands) to a Landsat-like spatial resolution
    (25 m pixel size, 6 bands) and as such obtain better MERIS land products. They
    successfully used the MERIS fused images to assess vegetation status by evaluating
    the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Modified Transformed Chlorophyll
    Index (MTCI), and the Modified Green Vegetation Index (MGVI). To address the needs
    for the early detection of vegetation stress, i.e., high detailed, hyperspectral,
    and frequent data, we investigated the added value of unmixing-based fusion of
    unmanned aerial systems and airborne hyperspectral imagery. A spatial unmixing
    fusion algorithm is, therefore, implemented and applied on simulated and experimental
    hyperspatial and hyperspectral citrus orchard image datasets. The simulated citrus
    orchard thereby serves as a preliminary validation tool for the fusion algorithm.
    For the in situ datasets, the fusion process is applied on the most detailed information
    available both spectrally and spatially. Hyperspatial (cm) images are gathered
    by a thermal sensor installed on a highly flexible RPAS, whereas the hyperspectral
    data are acquired by the APEX sensor. The hyperspectral and hyperspatial datasets
    are fused or spatially unmixed (SpU) in order to assess the performance of narrowband
    physiological indices for estimating water stress levels in citrus orchards at
    a 20-cm scale. SECTION II. Methods A. Drought Stress Assessment Stem water potential
    ( ψ_stem ) is known to be a reliable plant-based water status indicator for irrigation
    scheduling in fruit trees [31], [32]. However, its measurement is a cumbersome
    procedure and requires frequent trips to the field and a significant input of
    labor. Measurements of the stem water potential are, therefore, not useful to
    monitor drought stress in an operational way. For that reason, spectral VIs were
    preferred for estimating water stress from complex canopy spectra, since they
    provide a simple and efficient method to do so. The NDVI is probably the most
    studied and implemented vegetation index ever [33]. The NDVI makes use of the
    characteristic features of vegetative reflectance spectra, namely low reflectance
    in the red region of the spectrum due to chlorophyll absorption and high reflectance
    values in the near infrared domain due to scattering caused by internal leaf structure.
    The optimal information on the physiological status of a plant is, however, not
    necessarily related to those two regions. Moreover, the NDVI is often not a good
    indicator of stress as it is only accurate for Leaf Area Index (LAI) (defined
    as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area), biomass, and chlorophyll
    determination at relatively low factor levels, due to a saturation effect at higher
    levels of those factors [34], [35]. The theory that underpins this vegetation
    index is, however, promising. Standardized indices have the potential of estimating
    biophysical parameters in a manner more meaningful than simple ratio indices due
    to their inherent characteristic of reducing the effects of spectral variations
    caused by surface topography [36] and sun elevation for different parts of an
    image. In line with this assumption, the standardized difference of the simulated
    spectral reflectance values [of low-resolution hyperspectral (LR-HS), HR, high-resolution
    hyperspectral (HR-HS) images], and of the unmixing-based fused HR, hyperspectral
    image, referred to as SpU image was calculated for each possible combination of
    two different wavelengths for realistic ranges of chlorophyll and water content
    values (1) [37] SDVI= λ i − λ j λ i + λ j (1) View Source with λ i and λ j being
    the spectral reflectance at wavelength i and wavelength j , respectively, with
    i and j ranging from 400 to 2500 nm. Since the data in the validation experiment
    was simulated, the portions or fractions of soil and vegetation for each pixel
    were known as well. Multiplying these fractions with the leaf water and chlorophyll
    content values enabled the reconstruction of reference water and chlorophyll maps.
    Hitherto, two reference biophysical parameter maps and four spectral images (LR-HS,
    HR, HR-HS, and SpU) were available. A map representing the coefficients of determination
    ( R 2 ) of the linear relationship between each possible SDVI map and the reference
    water and chlorophyll maps was then calculated. This approach allowed the selection
    of an optimal SDVI to estimate water and chlorophyll content and in the meantime
    allowed to check how well the commonly used biophysical parameter related VIs
    perform on the 1) hyperspectral-low spatial (LR-HS), 2) hyperspatial–hyperspectral
    (HR-HS), and the 3) fused hyperspectral–hyperspatial (SpU) dataset. Since narrowband
    indices (Table I) closely related to the 1) epoxidation state of the xanthophylls
    cycle; 2) chlorophyll a+b concentration; 3) blue/green/red ratio indices; 4) carotenoid
    concentration; and 5) tree crown structure have been applied in a previous study
    to detect water stress in citrus orchards at the tree level [11], our focus was
    reoriented on these indices for the experimental study. Zarco-Tejada concluded
    from his study that the xanthophyll pigment related PRI calculated with the 570
    nm (PRI570) [38] as well as with 515 nm (PRI515) band as a reference [39], was
    significantly related to the stem water potential, and as such indirectly to the
    water status of the plant. Also in other studies, PRI has been used to assess
    previsual water stress at leaf level [40], [41], at canopy level [42]–[44] and
    using airborne imaging spectroscopy [45]. The PRI index [38], [46] is based on
    the short-term reversible xanthophyll pigment changes accompanying plant stress
    [9], [47]. These changes are linked to the dissipation of excess absorbed energy
    that cannot be processed through photosynthesis [10], [48]–[51]. At the leaf and
    canopy levels, the PRI has been extensively found adequate to estimate photosynthetic
    performance [52]. TABLE I Coefficients of Determination R 2 Obtained Through Narrowband
    Indices From APEX and SpU Imagery Against Stem Potential Also the Transformed
    Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (TCARI) showed sensitivity to stress levels,
    and the blue/green ratio BGI1 was highly significant. The effects of water stress
    on the canopy structure were successfully captured by structural indices such
    as NDVI, RDVI, SR, MSR, OSAVI, TVI, and MTVI. For the 14 trees under investigation
    in the three selected orchards of the study area, the correlation between all
    possible SDVIs, including the above-mentioned indices, and the stem water potential
    was calculated. The index pixel values of the fused image (28 cm) were averaged
    over each tree. A linear relationship was sought between the VIs, calculated from
    the fused and the original APEX datasets, and the in situ measured stem water
    potentials as well as between the thermal data and the stem water potentials.
    B. Fusion Method—SpU SpU is a fusion technique, which aims at combining the detailed
    information from two images over the same study area: one with low spatial and
    high spectral resolution (in our case a hyperspectral airborne image), and one
    with high spatial and low spectral resolution (in our case a thermal RPAS image)
    [28], [29]. In order to easily understand this fusion method, some theoretical
    background knowledge on spectral unmixing or spectral mixture analysis (SMA) is
    required. Therefore, we hereby shortly introduce this commonly used image analysis
    technique, which converts mixed pixel reflectance values into numerical subpixel
    fractions of a few ground components [53]. Although nonlinear mixing effects are
    well-acknowledged in vegetated areas [54], [55], [14], [96], [97], linear mixing
    models have proven to be adequate in the monitoring of vegetative systems [59],
    [60]. In the linear mixing model, mixed pixel signals (r) are modeled as a linear
    combination of pure spectral signatures of its constituent components (i.e., endmembers),
    weighted by their subpixel fractional cover [56] r=Mf+ε. (2) View Source In (2),
    M is a matrix in which each column corresponds to the spectral signal of a specific
    endmember. f is a column vector [f1,…,fm ] T denoting the cover fractions occupied
    by each of the m endmembers in the pixel. ε is the portion of the spectrum that
    cannot be modeled using these endmembers. A critical success factor of SMA is
    the selection of appropriate endmembers [57], [58]. The spectral signatures of
    the endmembers may be 1) derived from spectral libraries built from field or laboratory
    measurements, obtained using ground-based or portable spectroradiometers (e.g.,
    [59], [60]); 2) derived directly from the image data themselves (e.g., [61]–[63]);
    or 3) simulated using radiative transfer models (e.g., [64]–[66], Once the endmembers
    and their spectral signatures are known and if the number of endmembers is less
    than the number of spectral bands, the system of (1) is over-determined and may
    uniquely be inverted using techniques to solve for the fractions to solve for
    the fractions minimizing the error term ε in (2). Least squares regression analysis
    is one of the most commonly used optimization techniques [67]. SMA can be implemented
    without constraints (e.g., [68]), but physically meaningful abundance estimates
    are often obtained by constraining the coefficients in (2) to sum to unity and
    to be positive [69], [70]. The SpU fusion algorithm applied in this study differs
    from spectral unmixing as it tries to recover the spectra for endmember classes
    within a pixel, instead of the cover fractions of the different materials. The
    material fractions can be deduced from the high spatial, low spectral resolution
    RPAS image. Fig. 1 gives a visual representation of the spatial unmixing technique.
    Several steps are involved in the procedure starting with the classification of
    the high spatial resolution image in m classes (in casu, soil, and vegetation).
    Fraction maps F are subsequently created per predefined kernel k (in casu, five
    by five) of the hyperspectral pixels, by counting for each class the amount of
    HR pixels, which are present in the corresponding lower resolution pixel. Once
    the fraction maps F are calculated and given the hyperspectral reflectance values
    for the hyperspectral pixels R at a particular wavelength of interest, the spatial
    unmixing equation can be solved by least squares optimization, in order to find
    the reflectance value at that particular wavelength of the class endmembers M
    . The unmixing is thus solved for each low spatial resolution band independently.
    Therefore, a kernel size larger than or equal to the number of classes present
    in the neighborhood had to be chosen, because each hyperspectral pixel provides
    only one mixing equation [28]. Finally, each of the m classes present in the central
    pixel of the kernel is replaced by its corresponding unmixed signal. By repeating
    this operation for all the airborne hyperspectral pixels and bands, and for different
    combinations of m and k , a series of fused images is generated in which endmember
    variability is induced, which can be seen as a major benefit of this unmixing-based
    fusion method [69]. Fig. 1. Overview of the spatial unmixing technique. Show All
    Analogous to (2), the unmixing-based fusion method can be defined as follows:
    R i,k = M i,k,m ⋅ F k,m +ε. (3) View Source In (3), R i,k is a vector that contains
    the values of band i for all the hyperspectral pixels present in the neighborhood
    k . M i,k,m is the unknown vector containing spectral information of each of the
    classes present in k . F k,m is a matrix containing the cover fractions occupied
    by each of the m endmembers in each pixel in k . ε is the portion of the spectrum
    that cannot be modeled. This indirectly implies that the number of classes ( m
    ) and the size of the neighborhood ( k ) need to be optimized. m needs to be optimized
    based on the application demand and on the spectral variability of the scene.
    k also needs to be optimized because it has a great impact on the spectral quality
    of the fused image. The performance of the fusion method was first tested on a
    simulated dataset, which is further described in detail in Section III-A. A robust
    classification of the hyperspatial image was achieved by the linear discriminant
    analysis method with endmember selection as available in the open source ENVI/IDL
    code [71]. After a sensitivity analysis (results not shown), a kernel size of
    5×5 pixels was defined as optimal for spatial unmixing of these datasets. Changing
    the kernel size had a major impact on the endmember variability in the scene and
    played an important role in the reconstruction of the hyperspectral signatures.
    Next to the assessment of the index performances, the hyperspectral signatures
    reconstruction through unmixing-based fusion was evaluated as well. The root-mean-square
    error (RMSE) and relative-root-mean-square error (RRMSE) were calculated to compare
    the hyperspectral signals from the reference HR-HS image and the modeled signals
    from the SpU and LR-HS (upscaling with a factor 10) images. RMSE, defined (4),
    is a measure of the standard deviation, whereas RRMSE, defined in (5), is RMSE
    as a percentage of the mean observation. RMSE and RRMSE should be as small as
    possible, optimally zero RMSE RRMSE = ∑ i=1 n ( O i − P i ) 2 n − − − − − − −

    ⋅ 1 O ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ . (4) (5) View Source In (4) and (5), O i is the reference or observed
    value at wavelength i ; P i the predicted value at wavelength i ; n the total
    amount of measurements; and O ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ the average of the observations. After validating
    the fusion algorithm on a simulated dataset, the algorithm was applied on an experimental
    dataset, which is described in Section III-B. By fusing the information from the
    hyperspectral (APEX) and hyperspatial (thermal RPAS) datasets into an SpU, hyperspatial,
    hyperspectral resolution scene (SpU), we aimed at a more efficient assessment
    of the level of water stress in capital intensive citrus orchards. The thermal
    RPAS data were, therefore, classified in three physiological meaningful temperature
    classes. A kernel size of 5×5 was defined as most optimal. Combining different
    kinds of images requires a perfect coregistration. Fifteen ground control points
    (GCPs) were identified in both images for this purpose. SECTION III. Materials
    A. Simulated Data Experiment For this study, a ray-tracing experiment in a fully
    calibrated virtual 3-D representation of a citrus orchard was used. This 3-D radiative
    transfer model has been integrated in the web-based RAMI Online Model Checker
    (ROMC) service [72], and has previously been used as a reference tool for validation
    of image analysis techniques for precision farming (e.g., [18], [66], Based on
    detailed in situ calibration measurements, virtual 3-D replicas of orchard trees
    were built as triangular meshes using a tree geometry algorithm developed in Weber
    and Penn [73] (Fig. 2). Fig. 2. (Left) a virtual 3-D replica of an orchard tree,
    (right) a real orchard tree. Show All All reference data for calibration (and
    validation) were collected in a 9-year-old Valencia “Midknight” orange grove near
    Wellington, South Africa ( 33 ∘ 13 ′ 60 ′′ S ; 18 ∘ 15 ′ 60 ′′ E , altitude 100
    m). The orchard block had a row spacing of 4.5 m, a tree spacing of 2 m, and a
    row azimuth of 7.3 ∘ . For each tree, dendrometric (LAI, height, crown width,
    and diameter) and optical properties (leaf and canopy reflectance) were determined.
    Canopy and leaf reflectance spectra were collected using an ASD FR spectroradiometer
    (Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder, CO) ranging from 350 to 2500 nm with a
    spectral resolution of 3 nm in the VIS and NIR and 10 nm in the SWIR. The noise
    level for this instrument is provided by the manufacturer as Undefined control
    sequence \nbsp at 700 nm, Undefined control sequence \nbsp at 1400 nm, and Undefined
    control sequence \nbsp at 2100 nm. A 25 ∘ field of view (FOV) bare fiber optic
    was used. Within the orchard, 60 trees were selected that cover the range of structural
    and spectral variability encountered in the orchard. Leaf chlorophyll and water
    content were derived from the measured leaf spectra through inversion of the PROSPECT
    model [74]. These field measurements were used to calibrate 3-D replicas of the
    measured trees. In order to increase the observed variability in tree conditions,
    we further created for each of the 3-D trees three additional clones. While the
    overall tree architecture remained the same, we created 1) one clone with similar
    leaf spectra but with a LAI, which was 56% of the reference trees by randomly
    removing part of the leaves; 2) one clone with similar LAI and leaf water content
    but reduced leaf chlorophyll content (50% of the reference chlorophyll) (note
    that the new reflectance coefficients were recalculated with the PROSPECT model
    [75]); and 3) one clone with similar LAI and leaf chlorophyll but reduced water
    content (70% of reference). The new reflectance coefficients were recalculated
    with the PROSPECT model [75]. Thus, extra variability in the biophysical parameters
    and the spectral data were created to incorporate different types of stress. All
    3-D tree replicas were then randomly placed in the orchard. The physical and optical
    properties of the soil (sandy texture, gravimetric moisture content ranging between
    0% and 15%) were determined in the field and applied in the virtual model. Full
    details on the calibration procedure can be found in Stuckens et al. [75], whereas
    a more detailed description of the field campaign can be found in Somers et al.
    [76]. Three synthetic images of the virtual orchard were generated using a modified
    version of a physically based ray-tracer [77] (Fig. 3, The first image of Undefined
    control sequence \nbsp provided information in 216 spectral bands ranging from
    350 to 2500 nm with a spectral resolution of 10 nm and a spatial resolution of
    2 m (referred to as, low-resolution–hyperspectral or LR-HS, left panel of Fig.
    3). This is comparable to the resolutions obtained by airborne hyperspectral sensors,
    such as APEX and CASI. Fig. 3. RGB representation of the synthetic images of the
    virtual orchard (left: LR-HS—2 m, center: HR—0.2 m and right: HR-HS—0.2 m) generated
    using a modified version of a physically based ray-tracer. Show All The second
    scene, depicted in the center panel of Fig. 3, represents an image captured by
    a RGB sensor onboard a RPAS. The image of Undefined control sequence \nbsp with
    a spatial resolution of 0.2 m is further referred to as high resolution or HR)
    (Fig. 3, center panel). The third or reference image scene simulated a 216-band
    hyperspectral sensor ranging from 350 to 2500 nm with a spectral resolution of
    10 nm and a spatial resolution of 0.20 m (high resolution-hyperspectral or HR-HS).
    Such detailed imagery is currently not yet achievable on a recurrent basis (high
    temporal resolution) by satellite or airborne systems. The airborne hyperspectral
    cameras, such as Hyspex, can possibly be used in manned aircrafts to gather high
    spatial and spectral resolution data, but the temporal resolution will be limited
    due to financial constraints (manned aircrafts are expensive). Notwithstanding
    this, it serves as a perfect reference scene to test the efficiency of the unmixing-based
    data fusion of the first two image scenes. For each simulated image scene, detailed
    fraction maps (cf. Section II-B) were available. B. Real Data Experiment An additional
    experiment was conducted in a 310-ha drip irrigated commercial Citrus orchard
    near Picassent, in the province of Valencia (Spain, 39.38N, 0.475E, altitude 47
    m). In Citrus, an accurate and previsual detection of water stress is of utmost
    economic importance for farmers [78]. The orchard design was characterized by
    large (5–6 m) row spacing, with canopy ground cover below 65% even in the more
    vigorous orchards. Three test orchards were selected based on the large variation
    in plant water status of the measured trees. A total of 14 trees were used for
    assessment of midday stem water potential ( ψ s ) determined using a pressure
    chamber in leaves that were bagged at least 1 h prior to the measurements. Stem
    water potential was chosen as the true field determination of citrus trees water
    status due to its sensitivity to water deprivation [79]. The ψ s measurements
    of each tree were related with the individual tree canopy temperature (Tc) extracted
    from the airborne imagery. Within the selected trees, ψ s varied from −0.6 to
    Undefined control sequence \nbsp . According to a previous study by Ballester
    et al. [80], these values correspond to well watered and relatively severe tree
    water stress conditions, respectively. Airborne hyperspectral APEX imagery was
    acquired over the study area on September 8, 2011 around solar noon. The air temperature
    and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) at the time of the flight were 30.4 ∘ and 2.1
    kPa, respectively. The APEX sensor recorded the reflected light in 288 bands,
    ranging from 380 to 2500 nm with a spatial resolution of 2.7 m. The airborne measurements
    were accompanied with spectral field and lab measurements for calibration and
    validation of the airborne data. APEX geometric correction was accomplished based
    on the delivered metadata (i.e., IMU). Atmospheric correction was performed with
    the processing chain of VITO, based on the algorithms of ATCOR [81]. The geometric
    correction was performed by VITO’s own developed C++ module and is based on direct
    georeferencing. Input data from the sensor’s GPS/IMU, boresight correction data
    and the SRTM DEM were further used during the geometric correction process (Fig.
    4). Another set of aerial images was collected on August 23, 2011 at 10:00 GMT
    time with a thermal sensor installed on a RPAS, acquiring imagery at 20 cm resolution.
    A thermal camera (Miricle 307 K; Thermoteknix Systems Ltd, Cambridge, U.K.) was
    installed on a RPAS developed at the Laboratory for Research Methods in Quantitative
    Remote Sensing (Quantalab; IAS-CSIC, Córdoba, Spain), as described by Zarco-Tejada
    et al. [25]. The camera has a resolution of 640×480 pixels, is equipped with a
    14.25-mm f1.3 lens, and is connected to a computer via a USB 2.0 protocol. The
    spectral response was in the range Undefined control sequence \nbsp . The air
    temperature and VPD at the time of the flight were 31.6 ∘ and 1.9 kPa, respectively.
    The camera was calibrated in the laboratory to obtain radiance values, and then
    upwelling and down welling sky temperature was measured during the flight. In
    addition, indirect calibrations were conducted using surface temperature measurements
    to improve the calibration. The accuracy of this method was evaluated by Berni
    et al. [23], who have demonstrated an accuracy less than 1 K. The mosaicking process
    selects only the most nadir part of the overlapping images, limiting the viewing
    angle and thus avoiding directional effects and thermal hotspot. Each snapshot
    had a relative temperature scale, being the minimum value the coldest pixel and
    the maximum value the hottest pixel of the snapshot [23]. Based on the temperature
    differences between plant canopy and air temperature (Tc-Ta), all background and
    nonphotosynthetic trees were masked. This region of interest was subsequently
    overlaid on the APEX image to remove all redundant information from the APEX scene.
    This, however, also implied the removal of all warm, i.e., nontranspiring and/or
    dead trees. The hyperspectral APEX and hyperspatial, thermal images were resampled
    to 2.8 and 0.28 m, respectively. SECTION IV. Results and Discussion A. Simulated
    Dataset The unmixing-based fusion of the LR-HS and HR simulated image data resulted
    in an SpU image containing 216 bands at 20 cm resolution. The fused image product
    (SpU) now contains more detailed spectral and spatial information on the individual
    image elements or endmembers (e.g., orchard trees). This becomes clearer when
    looking into the results of the hyperspectral signature reconstruction evaluation
    study (Fig. 5). Fig. 4. Left: APEX region of interest with 288 spectral bands
    and 2.80 m spatial resolution, mid: RPAS region of interest with 1 thermal band
    and 0.28 m spatial resolution. Right top: 10× zoom of APEX orchard with 288 spectral

    plots calculated from the reference spectra and 1) the reconstructed SpU spectra
    and 2) the downscaled LR-HS spectra. Show All Fig. 6. The reference chlorophyll
    (left) and water map (right). Show All Overall, we observed a significant increase
    in signature modeling accuracy compared to the spectra of the LR image. The increased
    accuracy was specifically remarkable in the 350–800 nm and 1200–2500 nm domain,
    which is most probably due to the higher differences between soil and vegetation
    spectra in these spectral regions [76]. This highlights that the spectral mixing
    of vegetation and soil spectra, which remains the main bottleneck when using LR
    imagery in precision agriculture [13], [82], [18], can, to a large extent, be
    solved by SpU. By better modeling the spatial variability in crop spectra—i.e.,
    by removing the effects of undesired background effects—SpU opens new opportunities
    for the site-specific monitoring of the condition of crops (i.e., precision farming).
    In this light, we evaluated the added value of the proposed method in estimating
    the crop canopy water and chlorophyll content. Recall that for this simulated
    scene we reconstructed HR (0.2 m resolution) reference maps of the chlorophyll
    ( Chl ref ) and water ( C w REF ) content of the crop canopies (Fig. 6). For each
    simulated image, i.e., HR, LR-HS, and HR-HS, the coefficients of determination
    ( R 2 ) of the linear regression between all possible SDVIs and the water ( C
    wREF ) and chlorophyll ( Chl ref ) content maps are summarized in Fig. 7. Fig.
    7. R 2 values indicating the performances of each possible SDVI to estimate chlorophyll
    (top) and water content (bottom) of the LR-HS, SpU, and HR-HS simulated images.
    A lower threshold value is defined for each image to enlarge the color contrast.
    Show All As expected, the SDVI’s most closely related to chlorophyll and water
    content, were mainly identical throughout the three images. For the LR-HS ( Undefined
    control sequence \nbsp ) image a maximum R 2 of 0.35 and 0.30 were observed for
    water and chlorophyll, respectively. A significant increase in predictive power
    was found for the SpU image with maximal R 2 values up to 0.77 for water and 0.71
    for chlorophyll. The most appropriate water and chlorophyll related indices contain
    wavebands corresponding to the highest coefficient of absorption by water (SWIR)
    [83] and chlorophyll (620–700 nm) [84], respectively. It has to be mentioned that
    these spectral regions correspond to the regions with the highest gain in signature
    modeling accuracy by applying the unmixing-based fusion compared to the original
    LR-HS and HR images (Fig. 5). This noticeably stresses the potential of the proposed
    technique for better estimating plant stress related to changes in biochemical
    parameter contents, such as chlorophyll and water. From Fig. 7, it was revealed
    that the best SDVIs to estimate canopy water (6) and chlorophyll content (7) were,
    respectively λ 730 − λ 1510 λ 730 + λ 1510 λ 540 − λ 590 λ 540 + λ 590 . (6) (7)
    View Source The corresponding SDVI maps are shown in Figs. 8 and 9. For easy interpretation,
    and to allow a fair comparison, also the reference water ( C wREF ) and chlorophyll
    ( Chl ref ) maps are shown. Fig. 8. Index (5) maps representing water content
    extracted from the LR ( R 2 =0.34 ) (top left), SpU ( R 2 =0.77 ) (top right),
    HR-HS ( R 2 =0.93 ) (bottom left) images, and reference water content map (bottom
    right). Show All Fig. 9. Index (6) maps representing chlorophyll content extracted
    from the LR-HS ( R 2 =0.30 ) (top left), SpU ( R 2 =0.71 ) (top right), HR-HS
    ( R 2 =0.86 ) (bottom left) images, and reference chlorophyll content map (bottom
    right). Show All Coefficients of determination ( R 2 ) calculated for the linear
    regression between the reference ( C wREF and Chl ref ) maps and the most appropriate
    SDVI (6) and (7) maps, showed significant differences in prediction accuracy for
    SpU ( C w SpU : R 2 =0.77 and Chl SpU : R 2 =0.71 ), compared to the original
    LR image ( C w LR : R 2 =0.35 and Chl ref : R 2 =0.30 ). The highest possible
    linear relationship between the selected SDVI (6) and (7) maps and the biophysical
    parameter content maps ( C wREF and Chl ref ) is shown in the C w HR−HS (with
    R 2 =0.93 ) and the Chl HR−HS ( R 2 =0.86 ) maps. From these results, we can conclude
    that the spatial resolution of 2 m can be beneficial for large scale mapping and
    monitoring of the citrus orchard, e.g., for delineating management zones in the
    orchard. However, the resolution is too coarse to precisely manage the orchard
    system in which an optimization of yield with a restricted input of natural resources
    is endeavored. This corroborated previous findings of Stuckens et al. [75] who
    illustrated that image interpretation in citrus orchards was already seriously
    aggravated at pixel sizes as small as 0.1 m resolution. At this resolution about
    18% of the pixels were still mixed, while for Undefined control sequence \nbsp
    , no pure pixels were present anymore. In addition, Zarco-Tejada et al. [85] demonstrated
    serious effects of soil background admixture on the chlorophyll concentration
    estimates of olive trees using 1 m ROSIS imagery. The SpU methodology provides
    a means to combine: 1) the high spatial detail needed to reduce undesired background
    effects; and 2) the high spectral detail for detailed characterization of the
    plant state. The data fusion approach as such allows providing adequate information
    support for agricultural production and accurate and precise management of fruit
    orchards. B. Real Data Experiment Applying the spatial unmixing technique on the
    0.28-m thermal RPAS and the 2.8-m hyperspectral APEX datasets resulted in an SpU
    image providing 288 bands at 0.28 m spatial resolution (Fig. 10). Fig. 10. SpU
    image and detailed view. Show All A visual inspection of the APEX pixel spectra
    already revealed an intimate mixture of soils and crops. This could quantitatively
    be verified, in Table I, comparing the coefficients of determination extracted
    from the relationship between narrowband index values acquired from the APEX and
    SpU images, respectively, against the stem water potential values. Results are
    shown for 21 narrowband stress-related VIs, already previously described in a
    similar case study in citrus performed by Zarco-Tejada et al. [25]. Although similar
    trends were found for the indexes extracted from the APEX and SpU pixels, an overall
    better relationship (higher R 2 ) was found for SpU. Due to the presence or admixture
    of soil background and vegetation in the larger APEX pixels, all indices performed
    worse in estimating water stress in the LR-HS APEX image. This was particularly
    true for the PRI570 index [Table I and Fig. 11, significant relationships ( p<0.05
    ) are shown in bold] with R 2 =0.62 for the SpU image compared to R 2 =0.21 for
    the LR-HS APEX image. The added value of the hyperspatial resolution lies herein
    that VIs can be applied on pure vegetation pixels without the contribution of
    soil background and structural effects [15], [18]. Knowing that the stem water
    potential is a good and reliable estimator of plant water stress, it can be concluded
    from the relationship shown in Fig. 11 that detailed spatial information is vital
    in water stress detection studies. Fig. 11. Representation of the correlation
    between the coefficients of determination R 2 obtained through narrowband indices
    from APEX and SpU imagery against stem potential. Show All When we also show results
    for all other SDVI’s in Fig. 12, it becomes clear that an even better water stress
    detection becomes possible when also the reflectance patterns of the SWIR domain
    could be captured by the sensor. Numerous previous studies have proven that the
    spectral behavior of vegetation in the SWIR spectral domain is severely influenced
    and masked by water absorption. In this study, R 2 values up to 0.81 (compared
    to 0.62 for PRI570) were obtained through a linear relationship of SpU derived
    SDVIs based on 562 and 1650 nm against stem water potential. The reflectance absorptions
    in the 1650–1850-nm region are known to reflect not only the leaf water content,
    but also the contents of leaf cellulose and lignin, and are directly related to
    the plant growing status [86], [87]. Fig. 12. R 2 values of the linear relationship
    between the stem water potential of the 14 trees of interest and all possible
    SDVIs (left) calculated from APEX pixels (right) calculated from SpU pixels. Atmospheric
    water absorption bands were masked from the analysis. Show All This is a particularly
    interesting observation, since current technology does not yet allow to gather
    such a high spatial, high spectral imagery over the full spectral range with airborne
    sensors. Yet, by fusing hyperspatial and full range (including SWIR) hyperspectral
    images we can create a new data source which, as shown in Fig. 12, opens new and
    promising opportunities for detailed water stress mapping. From the previous studies
    [1], [88]–[95], we know that a good correlation should exist between thermal data
    and water stress or stem potentials, which was not found in our study, due to
    a miscalibration of the thermal sensor. Within one image, the relationship between
    stem potentials and thermal data were high ( R 2 =0.72 ), but not as high as the
    PRI calculated from the SpU and water potentials relationship ( R 2 =0.80 ) within
    this same image. The temperature differences caused by the sensor were masked
    in the fusion method due to its inherent characteristic to reconstruct hyperspectral
    endmember signatures based on the materials present in the pixels within the kernel.
    SECTION V. Conclusion The aim of this study was to apply an unmixing-based fusion
    technique on a hyperspectral airborne and hyperspatial RPAS dataset for a better
    assessment of biophysical parameters in agricultural areas. We first tested the
    unmixing-based fusion method on simulated datasets to evaluate the proposed method
    through standardized VIs and spectral signature reconstruction. Based on the high
    correlations between the SDVI performances calculated from the SpU image and those
    calculated from the reference images, and the high R 2 ; values of the SDVI biophysical
    parameter content relations compared to those of the low-resolution (LR) image,
    we concluded that the SpU method has potential for more detailed research in water
    and chlorophyll content estimation. Subsequently, the fusion method was applied
    on a real test case, in which hyperspectral APEX and hyperspatial thermal RPAS
    images were combined in order to better and more accurately detect water stress
    in commercial citrus orchards. Thereby, a better relationship was found between
    the stem water potential, and the PRI570 index, both known to be good and reliable
    water stress indicators, when calculated on the fused image compared to the one
    obtained from the original lower resolution image ( R 2 =0.62 vs. 0.21). Furthermore,
    VIs containing shortwave infrared spectral bands have appeared to make a sound
    contribution in terms of the strength of relationships between spectral reflectance
    and water stress levels. This fusion technique offers new opportunities to the
    user community in that higher spatial spectral dataset become available for their
    research or operations. The need for a perfect coregistration of the two input
    images (i.e., high spatial and high spectral) can be seen as the major drawback
    of this technique. Efforts have to be made in this processing step, which has
    a large impact on the resulting fused image if not carefully done. Ideally, the
    two sensors, of which one is focused on the spatial detail and the other focused
    on the spectral detail should be mounted on one chip, so that coregistration issues
    are minimized. This approach could be extended globally for the fusion of high
    spatial and high spectral resolution satellite imagery, enabling also a temporal
    hyperspectral, hyperspatial analysis. Ongoing research focuses on quantification
    of nonlinear mixing effects in orchards, and its influence on the accuracy of
    unmixing models. If proven to be important, the implementation of nonlinear mixing
    models will be necessary to further improve the performance of the proposed algorithm.

    Metrics Abstract: Over the past three decades, significant developments have been
    made in hyperspectral imaging due to which it has emerged as an effective tool
    in numerous civil, environmental, and military applications. Modern sensor technologies
    are capable of covering large surfaces of earth with exceptional spatial, spectral,
    and temporal resolutions. Due to these features, hyperspectral imaging has been
    effectively used in numerous remote sensing applications requiring estimation
    of physical parameters of many complex surfaces and identification of visually
    similar materials having fine spectral signatures. In the recent years, ground
    based hyperspectral imaging has gained immense interest in the research on electronic
    imaging for food inspection, forensic science, medical surgery and diagnosis,
    and military applications. This review focuses on the fundamentals of hyperspectral
    image analysis and its modern applications such as food quality and safety assessment,
    medical diagnosis and image guided surgery, forensic document examination, defense
    and homeland security, remote sensing applications such as precision agriculture
    and water resource management and material identification and mapping of artworks.
    Moreover, recent research on the use of hyperspectral imaging for examination
    of forgery detection in questioned documents, aided by deep learning, is also
    presented. This review can be a useful baseline for future research in hyperspectral
    image analysis. A hyperspectral image represented as a 3D cube with a point spectrum

    SECTION I. Introduction This human eye is only able to see in a limited part of
    electro-magnetic spectrum and can distinguish between objects based on their different
    spectral responses in that narrow spectral range [1]. However, multispectral imaging
    sensors have been developed that are able to acquire an image in infrared and
    visible segments of electromagnetic spectrum. This allows material identification
    on the basis of their unique spectral sig-nature in a wide spectral range. Multispectral
    imaging exploits the property that each material has its own unique spectral signatures.
    Spectrum of a single pixel in a multispectral image provides information about
    its constituents and surface of the material. Multispectral imaging technology
    is being used for environment and land observation remote sensing in satellite
    and airborne systems since late 1960s [2]. Multispectral imaging systems acquire
    data in a small number of spectral bands by using parallel sensor arrays. Most
    of the multispectral imaging systems use three to six spectral bands with large
    optical band intervals, ranging from visible to near infrared regions of electromagnetic
    spectrum for scene observation. However, such low number of spectral bands is
    the limiting factor for discrimination of various materials. Recent developments
    in hyperspectral sensing during the past two decades has made it possible to acquire
    several hundred spectral bands of observational scene in a single acquisition.
    The increased spectral resolution of these hyperspectral images allow for detailed
    examination of land surfaces and different materials present in the observational
    scene, which was previously not possible with low spectral resolution of multispectral
    imaging scanners. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) or imaging spectrometry [3] is a
    spectral sensing technique in which an object is photographed using several well
    defined optical bands in broad spectral range. It was originally implemented on
    satellite and airborne platforms for remote sensing applications but during last
    two decades, HSI has been applied to numerous applications including agricultural
    and water resources control [4], [5], military defense, art conservation and archeology
    [6], [7], medical diagnosis [8], [9], analyses of crime scene details [10], [11],
    document imaging [12], forensic medicine [13], food quality control [14], [15]
    and mineralogical mapping of earth surface [16]. This review details the fundamentals
    of hyperspectral imaging, discusses the common hyperspectral remote sensing terminologies
    and highlights the modern applications of hyperspectral imagery in the areas of
    food quality and safety assessment, medical diagnosis, precision agriculture,
    water resource management, forensic document examination, artwork authentication
    and defense and homeland security. SECTION II. Hyperspectral Imaging Hyperspectral
    images are characterized by their spatial as well as spectral resolution. The
    spatial resolution measures the geometric relationship of the image pixels to
    each other while the spectral resolution determines the variations within image
    pixels as a function of wavelength. A hyperspectral image has two spatial dimensions
    (Sx and Sy) and one spectral dimension ( S λ ). The hyperspectral data is represented
    in the form of a 3D hyperspectral data cube in Figure 1 using pseudo-colors in
    center. A point spectrum on the data cube at the spatial location (x,y) and an
    RGB image and a grayscale image rendered from the hyperspectral cube are also
    shown. Each slice of the cube along spectral dimension is called a band or channel.
    Table I shows the spatial and spectral resolution of the current airborne and
    space satellite imaging sensors. TABLE 1 Current Space Borne and Airborne Spectral
    Sensors Providing Data for Land Mapping FIGURE 1. (a) A hyperspectral image represented
    as a 3D cube. A point spectrum on the spectral cube is illustrated at the spatial
    location (x,y). (b) An RGB image and (c) a grayscale image rendered from the hyperspectral
    cube. Show All A. Spatial Resolution Spatial resolution can be defined as the
    smallest discernible detail in an image [17] which can be described as the measure
    of smallest object in an image that can be distinguished as a separate entity
    in the image. In practical situations clarity of the image is dictated by it spatial
    resolution, not the number of pixels in an image. Spatial characteristics of an
    image depend on the design of imaging sensor in terms of its field of view and
    its altitude [18]. A finite patch of the ground is captured by each detector in
    a remote imaging sensor. Spatial resolution is inversely proportional to the patch
    size. Smaller the size of the patch, higher the details that can be interpreted
    from the observed scene. B. Spectral Resolution Spectral resolution can be defined
    as the number of spectral bands and range of electromagnetic spectrum measured
    by the sensor. An imaging sensor might respond to a large frequency range but
    still have a low spectral resolution if it acquires a small number of spectral
    bands. On the contrary, if a sensor is sensitive to small frequency range but
    captures large number of spectral bands has high spectral resolution, due to its
    ability to distinguish between scene elements having close or similar spectral
    signatures [19]. Multispectral images have a low spectral resolution, thus unable
    to resolve finer spectral signatures present in the scene. HSI sensors acquire
    images in numerous contiguous and extremely narrow spectral bands in mid infrared,
    near infrared and visible segments of electromagnetic spectrum. This type of advance
    imaging system shows tremendous potential for material identification on the basis
    of their unique spectral signatures [2]. Spectrum of a single pixel in a hyperspectral
    image can give considerably more information about the surface of the material
    than a normal image. C. Temporal Resolution In hyperspectral remote sensing, the
    temporal resolution depends on the orbital characteristics of the imaging sensor.
    It is generally defined as the time needed by the sensor platform to revisit and
    obtain data from the exact same location [20]. Temporal resolution is said to
    be high if the revisiting frequency of the sensor platform for the exact same
    location is high and is said to be low if revisiting frequency is low. It is normally
    defined in days. D. Understanding Spectral Signatures Materials present on the
    surface of Earth absorb, transmit and reflect electromagnetic radiations from
    the sun in a unique way. Hyperspectral sensors allows us to measure all types
    of electromagnetic energy within a specified range as it interacts with materials,
    thus allowing us to observe the distinct features and changes on earth’s surface.
    Reflectance is the measure of electromagnetic energy bouncing back from a material’s
    surface. It is a ratio of reflected energy to incident energy as a function of
    wavelength [18]. Reflectance is 100% if all the light energy of specific wavelength
    striking the object is reflected back to the imaging sensor; on the other hand
    reflectance is 0% if the entire incident light of specific wavelength is absorbed
    by the object. In most practical cases reflectance values lie in the range [0,100].
    In a specified range of electromagnetic spectrum, the reflectance values of different
    materials present on the earth’s surface such as soil, forest, water and minerals
    can be plotted and compared. Such plots are labeled as spectral signatures or
    spectral response curves” [21]. Figure 2 demonstrates a general model of spectral
    signatures of different materials present on the earth’s surface. Remotely sensed
    images can be classified using these spectral signature plots, as each material
    present in an observed scene has its own unique spectral signature. The more the
    spectral resolution of an imaging sensor, the more classification information
    can be extracted from spectral signatures. Hyperspectral sensors have high spectral
    resolution than multispectral sensors and thus provide the ability to distinguish
    more subtle differences in a scene. Hyperspectral imagery has been utilized by
    geologists for mapping the land and water resources [16]. It is also utilized
    to map heavy metals and other hazardous wastes in historic and active mining areas.
    The spectral responses of green vegetation, dry bare soil, and clean water are
    compared graphically in Figure 3. It is observed that the reflectance curve for
    bare soil has fewer variations as compared to that of green vegetation. This is
    because of the fact that the factors that affect soil reflectance vary in a narrow
    range of electromagnetic spectrum. These factors include soil texture, presence
    of minerals such as iron, surface roughness and moisture content in soil [21].
    FIGURE 2. A generic scheme of HSI mapping of soil, vegetation and water. Show
    All FIGURE 3. Spectral response curves of soil, vegetation and water. Show All
    Spectral signatures of green vegetation have basins in the visible range of the
    spectrum that indicates the pigmentation in the tissues of the plant. Chlorophyll
    is the primary photosynthetic pigment in green vegetation [18], it absorbs strongly
    in red (670 nm) and blue (450 nm) regions called the chlorophyll absorption spectral
    bands. When a plant is under stress so that the chlorophyll growth is reduced,
    in such cases the amount of reflectance in red (670 nm) regions increases [18].
    The spectral response of water has distinctive characteristics of absorption of
    light in near infrared and beyond. Common factors affecting spectral response
    of water are the suspended sediments and increases in chlorophyll levels. In each
    case spectral response will be shifted accordingly showing the presence of suspended
    sediments or algae in water [22]. SECTION III. Modern Applications of Hyperspectral
    Imaging Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is increasingly being used for a wide variety
    of commercial, industrial and military applications. In this section, we focus
    on the applications of HSI to food quality and safety, image guided surgery and
    medical diagnosis, remote sensing such as precision agriculture and water resource
    management, forensic examination such as document forgery detection and artwork
    authentication and defense and homeland security. A. Food Quality and Safety Assessment
    Due to the growing need for high efficiency and low production costs of food products,
    the food industry is facing numerous challenges such as ensuring the quality and
    safety of food products while avoiding liability issues. Food quality and safety
    is assessed by the examination of various physical, chemical and biological attributes
    of food. The traditional methods based on visual inspection and chemical and biological
    inspection of food are destructive, time consuming and also environmentally unfriendly
    in some cases. Technological advancements in instrumentation engineering and computer
    technology enabled efficient and faster assessment of food. Computer vision and
    machine learning based methods using color image processing have been successfully
    applied for assessment of external attributes of food [23]–[28]. These methods
    are unable to examine the internal characteristics of food because they lack the
    ability to capture broad spectral information. Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy
    helped overcome this limitation of machine vision based methods due to close relationship
    between food components and NIR spectra [29], [30]. However, NIR spectroscopy
    could not help in examination of heterogeneous materials due to the lack of ability
    to capture spatial information [31], [32]. Hyperspectral imagery contains rich
    amount of spectral as well as spatial information which makes HSI based methods
    well suited for assessment of food quality and safety [37]. Hyperspectral image
    analysis has been used for identification of defects [35], [36] and detection
    of contaminations [33], [34] in food items. Valenzuela et al. [38] employed visual
    and infrared (VIR) hyperspectral imaging to examine the firmness and solid content
    of blueberries. Prediction accuracy of 87% and 79% was obtained for firmness and
    solid content respectively. Huang et al. [39] determined mealiness of apple using
    VIR hyperspectral imaging, achieving classification accuracy of 82.5%. Huang et
    al. [40] employed Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Gabor Filter to determine
    fat content between muscles in pork achieving a classification accuracy of 89%.
    HSI is also used to determine color distribution in salmon fillet [41]. Ivorra
    et al. [42] used NIR hyperspectral imaging to detect expired vacuum packed salmon,
    reaching a classification accuracy of 82.7%. In [43], Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA) and PLS-DA based classification model is presented for classification of
    oat and grout kernels in NIR hyperspectral images. The proposed method [43] achieved
    a high classification rate of almost 100% and thus, showed the efficacy of HSI
    as an industrial tool in food analysis. B. Medical Diagnosis Computed Tomography
    (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have been traditionally used for clinical
    analysis. Paty et al. [121] compared the potential of MRI and CT for detection
    of multiple sclerosis (MS) during the evaluation of over 200 patients. Hovels
    et al. [122] used both CT and MRI diagnosis of lymph node metastases in prostate
    cancer. MRI yielded better results in clinical diagnosis. Over the past decades,
    modern spectral imaging techniques have proved their significance in medical imaging
    by providing added potential to medical experts at higher speed and accuracy.
    The optical characteristics of tissues provide valuable diagnostic information.
    Hyperspectral image analysis is being widely used for medical diagnosis due to
    its ability to provide real time images of biomarker information and spectral
    information of tissues. Besides diagnosis, HSI systems are also used in image
    guided surgery. Kumar et al. [44] proposed a PCA and Fourier Transform Infrared
    (FTIR) Spectroscopy based imaging system for diagnosis of breast cancer. FTIR
    was applied on histopathological specimens of breast cancer with various histological
    grades and spectral changes near carcinoma were reported. The data was analyzed
    using PCA. Prominent features were found in the 5882~6250nm band which could be
    used for cancer identification. The reflectance spectra of tongue were non-invasively
    measured and analyzed by Liu et al. [45] for tumor detection. Dicker et al. [86]
    distinguished between malignant and benign dermal tissue in the spectral domain
    in the routine H&E stained samples. In their findings, the spectral signatures
    differences could be seen if the section thickness and staining time are controlled.
    A melanoma lesion and interstitial areas are shown in grayscale representation
    in Figure 4. FIGURE 4. A grayscale representation of a melanoma lesion showing
    the transmission Spectra in the nuclear and interstitial areas. Show All Mitra
    et al. [46] scanned the biliary structure using both fluorescence and reflectance
    imaging for classification of different tissues and identification of the biliary
    anatomy. Fluorescence imaging provided dynamic information about movement and
    flow in the surgical ROI whereas the hyperspectral image information helped in
    identification of the bileduct shown in Figure 5. The hyperspectral information
    also allowed for safe exclusion of contaminant fluorescence in tissues which is
    not included in the biliary anatomy. FIGURE 5. The structure of biliary tissue.
    (b) HSI based classification of the biliary tissue types. Show All In [46], the
    biliary structure of tissues was scanned using fluorescence and reflectance imaging
    for identification of gall bladder diseases. Spectral analysis and image processing
    techniques were employed for identification of biliary anatomy and classification
    of tissues. Dynamic information of motion in the surgical region was provided
    by fluorescence imaging while hyperspectral imagery allowed for safe exclusion
    of contaminated fluorescence from tissues and provided valuable information for
    the identification of the bileduct. Campbell et al. [47] have proposed the use
    of Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy (LPN) for diagnosis of renal cortical tumors.
    Olweny et al. [48] used Digital Light Processing (DLP) based HSI for computer
    assisted LPN to characterize renal oxygenation. The clinical study was performed
    in eighteen patients. The proposed system was able to successfully characterize
    dynamic changes in renal oxygenation during LPN. C. Precision Agriculture Many
    studies have indicated that the world’s crop production needs to be doubled by
    the end 2050 due to the rapidly growing population in the world [49]. However,
    various studies have shown that the crop yields are no longer increasing at a
    rate to fulfill the growing population needs [50], [51]. Recent studies have also
    indicated that increasing crop yields without using more land for cultivation,
    is the most effective way for ensuring food security [52], [53]. Global poverty
    and undernourishment can directly be reduced by increasing crop production; moreover
    most of the poor and undernourished population consists of farmers themselves
    [54]. Zhang et al. [124] reviewed the state of the art deep learning techniques
    for representative feature extraction and scene understanding in remote sensing
    hyperspectral images, Traditionally crop monitoring for disease, water stress,
    nutrients and insect attack was carried out by manual visual inspection from the
    ground. These methods were limited by the fact that the visual symptoms often
    appear at later stages of disease, thus making it difficult to restore plant health.
    Advancement in airborne and ground based HSI methods has made possible the evaluation
    of crop stresses, analyzing soil and vegetation characteristics in a cost effective
    manner, thus replacing the traditional scouting methods. Drought stress is an
    important factor affecting crop yields. Chances of a successful crop can be highly
    increased by timely detection of water related stresses. High water level stresses
    are noticeable in variations in photosynthetic pigments. These changes lead to
    yellowish tint in crops, due to the increase reflectance of red wavelength. Unlike
    human eye, HSI sensors can detect these changes at earlier stages. Colombo et
    al. [55] indicated that changes in leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT) were
    responsible for changes in leaf reflectance in the visible and infrared spectrum.
    They stated that hyperspectral regression indices calculated from HSI were powerful
    tools for estimation of water content at leaf as well as at landscape level. Rascher
    et al. [56] used a portable HSI system and photochemical reflectance index to
    estimate water stress in leaves of tropical tress and observed the temporal effects
    of dehydrations on tree leaves. Rossini et al. [57] found that HSI is useful in
    detecting drought stress at farm level with corn. They showed that irrigation
    deficits can be accurately mapped well before drought stress affected the canopy
    structure. Deficiencies in nutrients and soil contamination cause various symptoms
    that can be assessed by HSI. Schuerger et al. [58] used HSI to observe zinc deficiency
    and toxicity for identification of chlorophyll levels relating to stress symptoms.
    They indicated that traditional direct sampling methods are much more costly than
    HSI. Dunagan et al. [59] analyzed mercury levels in mustard plants and found that
    spectral signatures were notably related to the contaminant levels. Osborne et
    al. [60] showed that biomass, yield under stress, nitrogen and phosphorous concentrations
    can be estimated by using HSI. Mahlein et al. [61] studied different development
    stages of diseased sugar beet leaves using HSI. Figure 6 shows spectral signatures
    of healthy as well as diseased sugar beet leaves. This study also showed that
    HSI has a great potential for analyzing plant diseases. FIGURE 6. Spectral signatures
    comparison of healthy and diseased sugar beet leaves. Show All Analysis of soil
    characteristics can play a vital role in increasing crop yields. Ben-Dor et al.
    [62] al successfully mapped vital characteristics of soil in a field scale experiment
    including moisture, soil organic matter and soil sanity. Gomez et al. [63] estimated
    the organic carbon content in soil with accuracy. Growth monitoring of crops has
    made it possible to forecast production. Liu et al. [87] improved winter wheat
    yield prediction using new spectral parameters. The fine classification technology
    in agriculture has also matured greatly. Figure 7 shows the HSI based fine classification
    of vegetable growing regions. FIGURE 7. HSI based fine classification of vegetable
    growing regions. Show All D. Water Resource and Flood Management Water is one
    of the most important resources available on Earth as is vital for survival of
    humanity. For this reason, managing the water resource efficiently, analyzing
    and monitoring the quality of water has attracted a lot of attention from the
    researchers [64]–[69]. Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has found enormous
    applications in water resource management. Accurate estimates of water resource
    parameters are possible by analyzing spatial, spectral and temporal variations
    in water bodies. Xingtang et al. [88] systematically introduced their research
    on key technologies related to robust hyperspectral water resource monitoring
    system in China. This work was used by Li [89] to estimate the suspended matter
    concentrations of Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake using the CHRIS data as shown in
    Figure 8. The efficacy of flood detection and monitoring system is limited by
    their incapacity to get important information about water conditions from airborne
    and ground observatories in a timely manner. Recent improvements in remote sensing
    technology has improved the early flood warning system and vastly reduced the
    time of detection and reaction to flood events to a few hours [70]. US geological
    survey and NASA are incorporating space borne observations of rainfall resources,
    rivers and land topography into early warning systems with potential global applications
    [71]. Glaber and Reinartz [72] studied the optimal procedure for detection of
    flooded areas with remote sensing data. They investigated the erosive impact of
    floods, moisture content in flood plain areas, accumulation of sediments. Roux
    and Dartus [73] explored the flood hydrographs and estimated the river discharge
    from remotely sensed data. They optimized their model to minimize the error between
    system response and their proposed model to estimate the river discharge. Honkavaara
    et al. [128] presented various challenges regarding data processing faced by hyperspectral
    sensors in adverse meteorological conditions and proposed radiometric correction
    to minimize the effects of radiometric variations in varying illumination conditions.
    FIGURE 8. Distribution of the suspended matter concentration of Meiliang Bay of
    Taihu Lake. (a) LANDSAT TM image of Taihu Lake. (b) Estimation result using CHRIS
    data. Show All Hyperspectral remote sensing provides efficient and reliable information
    about water quality parameters which contain biochemical, hydro-physical and biological
    attributes [74]–[76]. HSI enable us to measure chlorophyll, turbidity and chemical
    oxygen demand and phosphorous in water resources. Chlorophyll content in water
    is extensively studied by hyperspectral remote sensing, which gives an estimate
    of algal level and hence water quality. Studies have been carried out for evaluation
    of ammonia changes for wetland [77], classifying different parameters of lakes
    [78], estuaries [79] and analyzing algal blooms [80]. Wetland mapping has played
    a significant role in order to enhance the quality of our ecosystem [81]. Hyperspectral
    imagery has helped in detailed understanding of vegetation characteristics of
    ecosystem. Extensive research studies have been carried out using remote sensing
    to explore the significance of acquiring timely data for monitoring and mapping
    aquatic vegetation [82], which is said to be an important aspect in ecosystem
    reconstruction and restoration. E. Forensic Document Examination Traditionally,
    forensic document experts and paleographers used chemical solution based methods
    to study the extrinsic and intrinsic components of the important historic documents
    [83]. This is due to the fact that the inks used on documents throughout the history
    were composed of diverse substances having distinct chemical and physical properties.
    All of these substances have their own unique way for reacting with different
    substrates depending upon the reaction environment. These chemical solution based
    methods helped in document analysis. But unfortunately these techniques were time
    consuming, sensitive to temperature changes and destructive in nature i.e. harms
    to the important documents were irreversible. To overcome such limitations, HSI
    has emerged as an effective non-destructive tool for improving readability [84],
    ink aging and forensic document analysis [13]. Hyperspectral document imaging
    works on the principle that each ink present in the document has its own unique
    spectral signature. Many mathematical tools that are being used in hyperspectral
    remote sensing can be used on hyperspectral document images for classification,
    improving legibility of extremely deteriorated text, ink aging and fraud detection.
    Moreover HSI is non-destructive, automated and environment insensitive tool for
    document examination. In hyperspectral document imaging, ink mismatch detection
    analysis provides important information to forensic document examiners to determine
    the authenticity of legal documents. Forgery, backdating and fraud can be detected
    using ink analysis of documents. HSI has been used for forensic document analysis
    in the past [106]–[108]. The HSI based techniques have had a significant impact
    on forgery detection as compared to the traditional techniques. Different inks
    were successfully classified after obliteration of the text in a document [106].
    Abbas et al. [85] proposed hyperspectral unmixing for discrimination between inks
    from different pens in a document. Recently, we have worked on a nondestructive
    automated forgery detection system, which was able to successfully discriminate
    between different visually similar inks taken from the publicly available UWA
    Writing Ink Hyperspectral Images (WIHSI) Database [85] with different number of
    inks and different mixing ratios (Combination A~H). Initially, we used Fuzzy C-Means
    Clustering (FCM) to differentiate two inks present in a multispectral document
    in different mixing ratios [129]. In our latest work, the state of the art deep
    learning technique, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been employed for classification
    of spectral responses of ink pixels for forgery detection in hyperspectral document
    images. Figure 9 shows the final segmentation results of our proposed technique.
    98% classification accuracy was achieved which shows the high potential of HSI
    and deep learning in document forgery detection. FIGURE 9. Comparisons of ground
    truth images of documents with mixed inks and our final segmentation results.
    Show All F. Artwork Authentication The global art market is increasing rapidly
    over the past decades [90]. A 7% year on year increase in total sales of art and
    antiques was recorded in 2013 [91]. Most of these high value dealings were made
    using non-scientific expertise in art. Forensic testing was not used to assure
    authenticity of the traded object. However, only a limited number of artwork evaluations
    can be carried out by an experienced specialist. Foolproof evaluations can be
    carried out if supported by non-destructive scientific tests [92], [93]. Fourier
    Transform Infrared (FTIR), X-ray fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy have been
    used previously for artwork authentication [94], [95]. HSI is proposed as a novel
    and non-destructive artwork examination method in the recent literature. HSI limits
    the number of invasive tests needed and provides more information from a sample.
    Several methods employing pigment analysis provided by HSI and classification
    techniques have been proposed in the recent literature [7], [96]–[100] for conservation
    and restoration of artworks such as paintings. These methods allow for identification
    of restored regions in paintings and distinguish them from the important regions
    in the original painting. Hyperspectral images captured in the infrared range
    also revealed useful features of painters such as preparatory drawings [101].
    Two forged paintings and the results of IR hyperspectral imaging and SVM classification
    proposed in [105] are illustrated in Figure 10. The broad spectral information
    provided by HSI combined with signal processing also allows for identification
    of the underlying material in artworks. Materials which are clearly visible in
    a specific band and obscured in the other bands are reflective within the same
    band and thus easily detectable by the HSI system [102]. The appropriate bands
    in the HSI data of historic texts and manuscripts allow for identification of
    inks and pigments for dating of manuscripts [103] and recovery of erased and overwritten
    scripts [104]. FIGURE 10. Two paintings with forgery. (a) Grid canvas and color
    coded pigments. (b-c) Forged Paintings with classification results. Show All G.
    Defence and Homeland Security The usage of HSI has quickly spread to various civilian
    applications and more recently to sectors of defense and homeland security [109].
    HSI is generally used as a counter-countermeasure for detection and recognition
    of camouflaged targets in military applications. HSI can easily detect strategic
    deployments in unpopulated areas such as forests, desserts and mountains, where
    targets such as military vehicles and mines are distinct from the background even
    if camouflaged. Anomaly detection methods [110]–[112] that use spectral information
    to differentiate between targets and background without any prior knowledge have
    gained significant popularity over the past few years. Yuen and Bishop [110] proposed
    an HSI based anomaly detection algorithms “MUF2”, which uses a multiple approach
    fusion methodology. Experiments were performed on images with crops, vegetation
    and bare soil from the Barrax dataset. An image from the Barrax dataset and the
    results of target detection using MUF2 algorithm are shown in Figure 11. An extremely
    high detection rate of 100% was achieved at a false alarm rate of 2× 10 −4 . Remote
    detection of small targets such as mines is a very challenging task. MUF2 algorithm
    [110] was also tested for detection of camouflaged land mines as shown in Figure
    12. Due to the very small area of the target in the images and noise in the dataset,
    60% detection accuracy was achieved at a false alarm rate of 3× 10 −3 . Suganthi
    and Korah [113] proposed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based technique for
    landmine detection and segmentation in infrared images. Letalick et al. [114]
    tested the possibility and feasibility of using multiple optical sensors and concluded
    that HSI has high potential in detection and recognition of semi-hidden, hidden
    and camouflaged landmines if prior knowledge of the spectral signature of the
    target. However, limited detection rate is achieved when landmines are completely
    hidden or camouflaged with vegetation. FIGURE 11. (a) A scene with crops and vegetation
    from Barrax HSI dataset, (b) Target detection using HSI based MUF2 anomaly detection
    algorithm. Show All FIGURE 12. Land mine detection using HSI based MUF2 algorithm.
    Show All Zhao et al. [123] proposed a sparse learning technique for hyperspectral
    anomaly detection, in which they employed dictionary based transformation of background
    features and iterative reweighting to exaggerate the differences between anomalies
    and background. Du et al. [125] proposed a hybrid sparsity and statistics anomaly
    detector to overcome the limitations of sparsity models in hyperspectral images
    containing spectral variability with limited endmembers. Discriminative metric
    learning method [126] and local geometric structure features [127] have also been
    used for hyperspectral anomaly detection in the recent literature. Thomas et al.
    [115] conducted a research on detection of grid patterns of landmines to improve
    the efficacy of landmine detection in LWIR hyperspectral imagery. Anomalies are
    detected using Dual Window based Eigen Separation Transform (DWEST) and pattern
    parameters are extracted. A pattern projection image is formed using the extracted
    parameters followed by pattern based reduction of false alarm rate. Higher detection
    probability at lower false alarm rate was noted which shows that the use of spatial
    pattern parameters in anomaly detection improves land mine detection [115]. Gagnon
    et al. [116] used hyperspectral image analysis to detect buried targets using
    a LWIR airborne hyperspectral camera. The temperature of disturbed soil over the
    buried target was found to be higher than the temperature of undisturbed soil
    around the target area. Classification techniques such as SVM and linear unmixing
    are used to distinguish between the targets and naturally hot areas. In the 21st
    century, development of state-of-the-art technologies for counterterrorism is
    one of the fastest growing demands. One of the significant ideas proposed for
    counterterrorism is detecting improvised explosive devices (IED). It is a technical
    challenge to directly detect explosives packed in airtight and light manner. Contrary
    to the direct detection of IEDs, cognitive methods use effective computing to
    analyze the contextual and body language, behavior, gestures, facial expressions
    and activity to assess the intent of a person. Mental stress is one of the key
    indicators of threat which is a short term induced neurological imbalance caused
    by any situation which involves a possible threat or danger. During neurological
    stress, the sympathetic nervous system induces adrenaline hormones to the blood
    triggers increase in blood flow to muscles and dilation of pupil. These unavoidable
    physiological changes during stress are detected as an indication of stress level
    using HSI [25]. Assessment of hemoglobin oxygenation using spectroscopic tuning
    is proposed in [26] and [27]. Figure 13 shows the oxy-hemoglobin levels of a person
    at different levels of stress. FIGURE 13. Results of stress detection by HSI based

    Show All SECTION IV. Conclusion Among remote sensing technologies, the role of
    hyperspectral imagery in the geo-observation, identification and detection of
    materials and estimation of physical parameters cannot be stated enough. Due to
    this very reason there is increasing number of airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral
    platforms based applications being researched. Recent advancements in sensor technologies
    have encouraged researchers to use hyperspectral imagery in many modern applications.
    Many mathematical tools and algorithms are being researched such as data fusion,
    hyperspectral unmixing, hyperspectral classification, anomaly detection and fast
    computing for efficient utilization of hyperspectral data. These mathematical
    tools can be used on hyperspectral data across many different applications. In
    general, this review focuses on the vast extent to which hyperspectral imaging
    has been used to increase and maintain the crop yields, managing water resources,
    assessment of food quality and safety, diagnosing diseases, authentication of
    artworks, forensic examination of questioned documents, detection of military
    targets and counterterrorism. Promising results have been found in the proposed
    automatic forgery detection system based on HSI and deep learning. Future research
    is being carried out for further improvement as well. This review can be a useful
    baseline for future research in hyperspectral image analysis. Authors Figures

  explanation: Research aims to evaluate automated irrigation management systems that
    integrate Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning technologies, focusing
    on advanced sensing technologies such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing
    for non-invasive plant stress detection in the initial stages of an automated
    irrigation management pipeline. The work by García-Tejero et al. presents thermal
    sensing as a non-invasive and robust method to assess vine water status and irrigation
    scheduling in grapevine. They evaluated different thermal indices to analyze their
    performance under field conditions and the best time of measurement to capture
    meaningful thermal data. The study concludes that between 11:00 h and 14:00 h
    local time is the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically meaningful
    data to assess the vine's water status. They also demonstrate the potential of
    thermal sensing for remote sensing of water stress in grapevines and highlight
    the usefulness of ground-based thermal data to support validation of aerial-based
    data.

    • Thermal imaging is a feasible technique for remote monitoring of grapevine water
    status. • Thermal indices (CWSI, IG, ΔTleaf-air) but also TC offer robust information
    of grapevine water status. • The best moment to monitor the crop water status
    on the basis of thermal data occurs between 11 and 14 h. • The genotype has an
    apparently limited effect on performance thermal indices under mild drought stress.
    Abstract Canopy temperature (TC) can be a robust indicator of grapevine water
    status. However, the assessment of TC by thermography in field conditions requires
    optimization, especially under variable environmental conditions (daily and seasonal)
    just like it occurs in Mediterranean areas. Besides, simplicity and robustness
    should be the basis of a wider use of thermography in field conditions. Therefore
    the comparison of simpler and more complex approaches in terms of thermal indicators
    is wise to test. Our major aims were: i) to assess the performance of four common
    thermal indicators (canopy temperature − TC, Crop Water Stress Index − CWSI, index
    of relative stomatal conductance − IG, and the difference between TC and the surrounding
    air − ΔTcanopy-air) to support irrigation decisions ii) to optimize the timing
    of thermal measurements for different genotypes and iii) to obtain mathematical
    functions to estimate leaf gas exchange parameters on the basis of thermal data.
    The trial was conducted in the summer of 2013, in south Portugal. Two V. vinifera
    red varieties, Touriga Nacional and Aragonez (syn. Tempranillo) were tested. Vines
    were subjected to two irrigation regimes: i) sustained-deficit irrigation (based
    on the farm’s schedule − control) and ii) regulated-deficit irrigation (∼50% of
    the control). We found that measurements done between 11:00 and 17:00 h provide
    the most significant correlations between TC, CWSI and IG and leaf stomatal conductance
    and net photosynthesis for both genotypes. Different linear mathematical functions
    were obtained to estimate leaf gas exchange based on the best performing thermal
    indicators under field conditions. Our results emphasize the value of TC as a
    relevant explanatory variable of vine’s physiological status, in spite of being
    a simpler and non-normalized thermal indicator. The potential relevance of TC
    for grapevine modelling and phenotyping is also discussed. Previous article in

    is the major limiting natural resource for crop production in irrigated agriculture,
    especially in semi-arid areas of European Mediterranean countries (EEA, 2012,
    Costa et al., 2007, García-Tejero et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the area of intensive
    irrigated agriculture (e.g. viticulture), has been increasing in Southern European
    countries, namely in Portugal and Spain (Costa et al., 2016, ESYRCE, 2012). Studies
    on more precise irrigation in viticulture are needed to promote water savings
    under unfavourable environments and specific terroirs (Möller et al., 2007, Chaves
    et al., 2010, Costa et al., 2016). Previous literature has shown variations in
    the water use and leaf gas exchange traits between different grapevine genotypes
    subjected to drought or deficit irrigation (Costa et al., 2012, Tomás et al.,
    2014, Bota et al., 2016) and seasonal variations in the leaf water use efficiency
    due to changing environmental conditions and leaf aging are also reported (Escalona
    et al., 2003, Williams, 2012, Tramontini et al., 2014, Medrano et al., 2015, Bellvert
    et al., 2015). Punctual measurements are often used to monitor crop water status
    in field conditions. Among them, pre-dawn and stem water potential are reliable
    indicators of plant-water status and are used to support irrigation scheduling
    (Naor, 2000, Lampinen et al., 2001, Jones, 2004a, García-Tejero et al., 2011a).
    Moreover, in species with strict stomatal regulation such as grapevine (Chaves
    et al., 2010), stomatal conductance to water vapour (gs) can be a robust indicator
    of water stress (Chaves et al., 2010). Jones (2004a), for example, argued that
    gs would be a better indicator of plant response to soil water deficit than leaf
    water potential because reductions in gs may occur before any measurable change
    in plant water status. However, punctual measurements of gs cost time and labour,
    and require high number of replicates for a sound assessment, which makes such
    method less suitable for open field applications (Jones, 1999, Costa et al., 2010,
    Costa et al., 2013). In grapevine, different varieties may require different irrigation
    strategies due to differences in the regulation of leaf-gas exchange and plant
    water relations (Escalona et al., 2003, Chaves et al., 2010, Costa et al., 2012,
    Tomás et al., 2014, Bota et al., 2016). This can result in variable leaf/canopy
    temperature phenotype (Costa et al., 2012). As a consequence, more precise monitoring
    of grapevine water status on the basis of thermal data is required, especially
    when dealing with different genotypes in the same vineyard. Thermal imaging emerged
    as a non-invasive and robust technique to assess crop-water status and irrigation
    scheduling in grapevine but is still not widely used in modern orchards or vineyards
    (Jones and Leinonen, 2003, Grant et al., 2006, Grant et al., 2007, Jones and Grant,
    2016). Water stress induces stomatal closure, which limits transpiration and reduces
    evaporative cooling, resulting in higher leaf temperature (Tleaf) and/or canopy
    temperature (TC) (Jones, 1999, Jones, 2004b, Jones et al., 2009). Tleaf or TC
    can thus provide information to estimate stomatal conductance to water vapour
    and plant-water status (Jones, 2004b, Berni et al., 2009a, Berni et al., 2009b,
    Jones et al., 2009). However, the relationships between Tleaf or TC and leaf physiological
    parameters are not always straightforward, in particular under variable meteorology
    (Tair, amount/angle of incident radiation, wind speed, vapour pressure deficit)
    (Jones, 2004b, Jones et al., 2009). Simplicity and robustness should be the basis
    to promote the use of thermography in field conditions (Fuentes et al., 2014).
    Therefore, the comparison of simpler or more complex approaches in terms of thermal
    indicators is wise to test. In order to make thermal imaging a more robust tool
    for field applications, different thermal indices were developed to normalize
    absolute values of Tleaf or TC (Jones et al., 1997, Jones et al., 2002, Maes and
    Steppe, 2012). These thermal indices are based on the estimation of artificial
    temperature references (See Eqs. (2) and (3)). The reference Twet works as a proxy
    of the minimal Tleaf measured in plants under optimal watering conditions and
    maximum transpiration. The reference Tdry is a proxy of the maximum Tleaf/TC due
    to maximum stomatal closure under severe water stress. The crop-water stress index
    (CWSI) and the index of relative stomatal conductance (IG) or the difference between
    TC and Tair (ΔTcanopy-air) are the most often used and were successfully tested
    in different crops, including grapevine (Jones, 1999, Jones et al., 2002, Grant
    et al., 2007, Costa et al., 2012, Bellvert et al., 2014). However, these indices
    require previous testing and validation for ground based and airbone thermal sensing.
    Previous works tested different strategies to optimize thermography use in the
    field by developing robust protocols based on thermal indices (Jones et al., 2002,
    Jones et al., 2009, Grant et al., 2006, Möller et al., 2007, Zia et al., 2009,
    Baluja et al., 2012, Bellvert et al., 2014, Pou et al., 2014). However, some questions
    remain though. For instance, to find which is the most practical but still robust
    thermal index that can be a proxy of plant physiological traits (e.g. leaf gas-exchange
    behaviour), and secondly, how would the variety/genotype influence thermal indices
    performance and time of measurements? The aim of the present work was to evaluate
    the performance under field conditions of different thermal indicators (TC, CWSI,
    IG and ΔTcanopy-air) to assess the water status of two red V. vinifera varieties
    [Aragonez (syn. Tempranillo), and Touriga Nacional], based on the relationships
    between these indicators and leaf stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis.
    In parallel, we aim to obtain the most representative relationships between the
    four thermal indicators and eco-physiological parameters. 2. Material and methods
    2.1. Location, plant material and growing conditions The trial was conducted in
    the 2013 in a commercial vineyard (Herdade do Esporão), Reguengos de Monsaraz,
    southern Portugal (38° 23′ 55.00″ N, 7° 32′ 46.00″ W). Eleven year-old red grapevines
    [Vitis vinifera L. cvs. Aragonez (syn. Tempranillo) and Touriga Nacional] grafted
    onto 1103 Paulsen rootstock were studied. Vines were spaced 1.5 m within and 3
    m between rows, on N-S orientation. Vines were spur-pruned on a bilateral Royat
    Cordon system and trained in a vertical shoot-positioning system with a pair of
    movable wires. All vines were uniformly pruned with 15–16 nodes per vine. Soil
    texture is a sandy-loam to silty-clay-loam, with a pH of 7.0–7.6, a low content
    in organic matter (10.5 g kg−1) and high P2O5 and K2O values (110 and 173 mg kg−1,
    respectively). The two varieties were planted side by side in two adjacent plots
    with the same experimental design: randomized complete block, with four blocks
    and two irrigation treatments: Sustained Deficit Irrigation − SDI, irrigated with
    ∼30% of ETC, and a Regulated Deficit Irrigation (RDI, ∼15% of ETC). The elemental
    plot comprised three adjacent rows (two buffer rows and a central one for data
    collection). Measurements were done in two blocks, using two vines per block.
    Water was applied using a single pipe of drip emitter (1/m) with a flow rate of
    2.2 L h−1. Crop-water requirements were weekly calculated according to Allen et
    al. (1998), using the reference evapotranspiration values obtained from an automatic
    weather station located in the experimental orchard, and considering a crop coefficient
    (Kc) equal to 0.7. Irrigation water was applied 1–2 times per week, starting at
    berry touch (berries beginning to touch − stage 77 of the BBCHscale for grapes).
    The crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and rainfall accumulated during the irrigation
    period were 429 and 9.4 mm respectively. The SDI treatment received a total of
    111 mm (∼30% ETc during the irrigation period) in 16 irrigation events, and the
    RDI treatment (late deficit at the ripening period), received 53 mm (∼15% ETc
    during the irrigation period) in 8 irrigation events. 2.2. Measurements Climate
    data (Tair, relative humidity, wind speed and solar radiation) were hourly collected,
    using an automatic weather station (iMetos 1, Pessl Instruments GmbH, Werksweg,
    Austria), located in the vineyard and close to the experimental plot (about 900
    m). Vine water status was assessed along the trial by measuring leaf water potential
    at pre-dawn (Ψpd) with a Scholander pressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equipment
    Corp., Sta. Barbara, CA, USA). A total of 4 leaves per irrigation treatment and
    genotype were used. Canopy temperature (TC) and leaf gas-exchange traits were
    measured along the day (8:00 h, 11:00 h, 14:00 h, 17:00 h, and 20:00 h) and along
    the growing season: i) 20 June (Day of the year − DOY 171, majority of berries
    touching), ii) 17 July (DOY 198, beginning of ripening: berries begin to develop
    variety-specific colour), iii) 8 August (DOY 220, mid-ripening) and iv) 21 August
    (DOY 235, full ripening, and 1 and 2 weeks before the commercial harvest of Aragonez
    and Touriga Nacional respectively). TC was measured by thermal imaging. Measurements
    were made periodically along the day with a thermal camera (Flir SC660, Flir Systems,
    USA, 7–13 μm, 640 × 480 pixels), with an emissivity (ε) set at 0.96. Each pixel
    corresponds to an effective temperature reading (Jones, 2004b). The imager was
    placed perpendicularly to the canopy, at about 2 m from the sunlit side. One image
    was made per vine, using two plants per variety, treatment, and replication (n
    = 4). Background temperature was determined by measuring the temperature of a
    crumpled sheet of aluminium foil placed near the leaves of interest using ε =
    1 (Jones et al., 2002). Thermal images were analysed by using the ‘Flir QuickReport’
    software (Flir Systems, USA). TC was estimated on the basis of the average temperature
    of 2–3 selected sunlit regions of interest (ROI) in each image. This avoided selection
    of pixels of shaded spots and/or of stem woody material. A total of 4 thermal
    images were taken per variety and irrigation treatment at each time of observation.
    The absolute TC values were normalized by calculating the thermal indices CWSI,
    IG, and ΔTcanopy-air as follows (Jones, 2004b, Maes and Steppe, 2012): (1) ΔTcanopy-air
    = TC − Tair (2) (3) Where Tdry and Twet are reference temperature values for a
    leaf with fully closed stomata and for a fully transpiring leaf, respectively;
    TC is the canopy temperature and Tair the temperature of the surrounding air.
    On each monitored vine, two fully sunlight exposed mature leaves were selected
    to obtain reference values of Tdry and Twet. One leaf was covered on both sides
    with vaseline 20–30 min before images were taken, whereas the other leaf was sprayed
    with water 15–20 s prior to thermal image acquisition. Individual leaf gas-exchange
    measurements (stomatal conductance to water vapour – gs, and net CO2 assimilation
    – An) were made by using a portable infrared gas-exchange system (LI-6400; LiCor
    Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA), equipped with a 6 cm2 transparent leaf chamber,
    with an air-flow rate set at 500 μmol s−1. These measurements were taken in two
    fully expanded and sunlit leaves per tested plant, using a total of 4 plants per
    irrigation treatment and variety. 2.3. Statistical analysis For each measurement
    day, an exploratory and descriptive analysis was made of all physiological measurements
    (gs, An and TC) and a Levene’s test was applied to test the variance homogeneity
    for the studied variables. To determine the effects of the measurement time, irrigation
    treatment and cultivar a three way ANOVA was applied using the statistical software
    SPSS (SPSS Inc., 15.0 Statistical package; Chicago, IL, USA). To evaluate the
    relationships between variables, a linear correlation analysis between the thermal
    indicators (TC, ΔTcanopy-air, CWSI and IG) and the crop physiological variables
    (gs, An) was done for each time of observation (hour) and variety (n = 32). The
    obtained correlation coefficients were used to support the decision on the best
    time of day to carry out TC readings for both varieties as well ass to assess
    robustness of the above thermal indicators as proxies of physiological meaningful
    traits (gs and An). Using the pooled data corresponding to the time periods during
    which thermal measurements showed the highest linear correlation coefficients,
    (between 11:00 and 17:00 h), a regression analysis between TC, ΔTcanopy-air, CWSI
    and IG (independent variables) and leaf gas-exchange parameters (dependent variables)
    was performed. Finally, the obtained linear regressions for each genotype were
    compared (slope and intercept) using a covariance analysis at a confidence level
    of 95%. 3. Results 3.1. Climate conditions and vine water status Fig. 1 shows
    the diurnal variation of solar radiation, Tair, air relative humidity (RH), and
    air vapour-pressure deficit (VPD) for the four observation dates. The most stressful
    environmental conditions occurred between 14:00 and 17:00 h. Solar radiation was
    similar along the trial period except under the cloudy conditions of 21 August
    (235 DOY). However, this did not reduce Tair and the highest Tair values (up to
    35 °C) occurred between 12:00 to 17:00 h, reaching a peak of 39 °C at 15:00 h.
    Tair values were lowest in early season (20 June, 171 DOY), ranging from 16 °C
    at 8:00 h to 28 °C at 17:00 h. On 17 July (198 DOY) and 8 August (220 DOY) Tair
    values were similar, ranging from 22 to 35 °C, and from 20 to 33 °C, respectively.
    RH showed an inverse trend to Tair, with the lowest values occurring on 21 August,
    and the highest ones on 20 June. The RH measured on 17 July and 8 August was similar
    for both dates. Download : Download high-res image (364KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Diurnal and seasonal time course of the climatic conditions
    along the trial and for four different days of the year (DOY): DOY 171, 20 June,
    DOY 198, 17 July; DOY 220, 8 August and DOY 235, 21 August 2013. The highest VPD
    values occurred on 21 August (reaching values up to 4.0 kPa between 10:00 and
    18:00 h), almost 3-fold higher than the minimum values registered on 20 June.
    Thus, during the trial, three distinct atmospheric situations were experienced
    by the crop: i) no-stress (DOY 171, 20 June), with low Tair and low VPD; ii) severe
    stress (DOY 235, 21 August), with very high VPD and Tair; and iii) moderate to
    severe stress due to high Tair and VPD (DOY 198 and 220; 17 July and 8 August).
    Crop-water status during the experimental period was assessed by measuring leaf
    water potential at pre-dawn (Ψpd) at each monitoring date (Fig. 3). On DOY 171
    we found no differences in Ψpd between treatments evidencing the absence of water
    stress at the starting phase of the trial. In general, the Ψpd decreased along
    the season for all treatments (Fig. 3). Aragonez vines experienced a more pronounced
    decrease and had lower Ψpd than Touriga Nacional, especially under RDI conditions
    and under specific climatic conditions (DOY 198 and 235). The range of Ψpd values
    observed along the trial (−0.2 < Ψpd < −0.5 MPa) shows that the imposed degree
    of water stress was within the range of what is considered mild-to moderate water
    stress. 3.2. Canopy temperature and individual leaf gas exchange Table 1 shows
    the diurnal variation of TC and leaf-gas exchange parameters for each irrigation
    treatment and variety. On DOY 171 significant differences were found between Aragonez-SDI
    and remaining treatments. At 17:00 h TC values of Aragonez-SDI were about 3 °C
    lower than the remaining treatments (Table 1, Fig. 2A). On DOY 198, TC increased
    along the day with a maximum at 17:00 h being the highest TC observed for Touriga
    Nacional-RDI, (Table 1, Fig. 2B). At DOY 220, (Table 1, Fig. 2C), the maximum
    TC was detected only at 17:00 h but no significant differences existed between
    RDI and SDI vines (Table 2). Finally, at DOY 235, the highest TC occurred again
    in the afternoon (14:00 and 17:00 h) and also in RDI vines (Table 1, Fig. 2D).

    1) and the Aragonez-SDI had the highest gs in agreement with the lowest TC values
    (Table 1). At DOY 171, the highest values of gs were observed in the morning (8:00
    h and 11:00 h) for both varieties (Table 1). At DOY 198 the SDI treatment presented
    significantly higher gs and Aragonez vines showed the highest gs along the day
    (Table 1). On DOY 220, the variation pattern of gs was similar to the one observed
    on DOY 198, which can be explained by similar climate conditions. Plants of Aragonez-SDI
    had the highest gs while Touriga Nacional-RDI showed the lowest. At the end of
    the season (DOY 235), and under the most severe drought conditions (lowest Ψpd
    of the trial) (Fig. 3), SDI vines had larger gs than RDI on both varieties. Download

    varieties Touriga Nacional (TN) and Aragonez (syn Tempranillo) (AR) subjected
    to regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) or sustained deficit irrigation (SDI). Values
    are means ± SE (n = 4 leaves). Concerning leaf net photosynthesis (Table 1), the
    main differences were related to time of measurements (Table 2). The highest An
    was measured during the first measurements of the day (at 8:00 and 11:00 h) which
    paralleled the larger stomatal conductance. Irrigation strategy also influenced
    significantly the photosynthetic rates of vines, and at DOYs 198, 220 and 235
    we observed the highest rates of photosynthesis in SDI vines. In turn, most pronounced
    differences between irrigation treatments for the observed leaf gas exchange traits
    were found at 14:00 h (on DOY 198), and at 11:00, 14:00 and 17:00 h (on DOY 235).
    In fact, these two DOYs were characterized by the most stressful climatic conditions.
    Overall the highest variability in the studied parameters was associated with
    two major variables: first with the time of measurements (and related environmental
    conditions) and secondly the irrigation strategy adopted (Table 2). Despite punctual
    differences between varieties no clear distinct pattern for TC and for leaf gas
    exchange was found between Touriga Nacional and Aragonez. This can be related
    with the mild water stress conditions experienced by vines during the trial (−0.2
    < Ψpd < −0.5 MPa) (Fig. 3). 3.3. Relationships between thermal indicators and
    individual leaf gas-exchange In order to evaluate the relationships between thermal
    data and leaf gas-exchange traits (gs, An), a correlation analysis was performed
    separately for each time of measurement and variety (Table 3). While no significant
    (p < 0.05) correlations were found at beginning (8:00) and at the end of the day
    (20:00 h), we found significant correlations between thermal data and leaf gas-exchange
    parameters for the remaining hours. The correlation coefficients were negative
    for TC, ΔTcanopy-air and CWSI; and positive for IG (Table 3). The most robust
    relationships were found for the set of measurements taken at 11:00, 14:00 and
    17:00 h in both varieties, being the highest correlation coefficients found for
    the relationships between TC, CWSI and IG with An and gs. In turn, the index ΔTcanopy-air
    was found to be correlated significantly with gs at 11:00 h (only for Aragonez)
    and at 14:00 h (for both varieties) (Table 3). Table 3. Pearsońs correlation coefficients

    presented also significant determination coefficients which were higher for the

    (TC) (E and F) for the two studied genotypes (Aragonez syn. Tempranillo) (), and
    Touriga Nacional (▲). The linear regressions for CWSI and IG are based on the
    readings taken between 11:00 and 14:00 h whereas the regressions estimated for
    TC used readings carried out between 14:00 and 17:00 h. Grey points and discontinuous
    lines (Aragonez, syn. Tempranillo) and the black points and continuous lines (Touriga
    Nacional) correspond to the linear functions obtained for each cultivar. The general
    equation corresponds to the pooled data i.e. measurements done at 11:00 h and
    14:00 h; (n = 128) for the case of the CWSI and IG. Once selected the different
    relationships for each cultivar, we have compared the differences between the
    slopes and the intercept of the obtained regression lines by ANCOVA. Because we
    found no effect of the variety either on the slopes and the intercepts a single
    function was built with the pooled data for 11–14 h, from the two varieties (Fig.
    4). Regarding the regression analysis between TC and leaf gas exchange traits,
    a similar statistical procedure was used. The pooled data relative to the 14:00
    and 17:00 h time period was used for a linear regression analysis for each variety
    (Fig. 4). Significant determination coefficients were obtained for TC vs An in
    Touriga Nacional (r2 = 0.58) and Aragonez (r2 = 0.72) and for TC vs gs in Touriga
    Nacional (r2 = 0.48) and Aragonez (r2 = 0.60). In this case, the ANCOVA analysis
    showed a significant effect of the variety on the slopes and intercepts, and separated
    relationships were retained for each variety. 4. Discussion Previous literature
    showed that thermal imaging can be used to estimate grapevine water status under
    field conditions (Jones et al., 2002, Möller et al., 2007, Costa et al., 2012,
    Grant, 2012). Nevertheless, rigorous management of deficit irrigation under variable
    climate conditions requires identification of the most adequate and robust thermal
    indicators as well as the best time of the day to perform infrared imaging measurements.
    Our results show that the best moment to monitor vine’s water status of the two
    varieties occurs between 14 and 17 h. Indeed, this is the moment of the day when
    the most significant differences in terms of TC, the thermal indices and leaf
    physiological traits (gs and An) are verified between vines subjected to RDI and
    SDI regimes (Table 1). The fact that the highest Tair and air evaporative demand
    are verified between 11:00 h and 17:00 h (Fig. 1) can generate the largest differences
    in stomatal aperture as well as in leaf temperature. Moreover, more severe soil
    water deficit promotes TC differences between varieties and deficit irrigation
    treatments (Table 1, Fig. 3). Under less stressful climatic conditions (DOY 171),
    the differences in TC between irrigation treatments were only detected at 17:00
    h. An identical pattern was found for the remaining days, in which the largest
    temperature differences (1.5–3.5 °C) between irrigation treatments occurred when
    measurements were done at 11:00, 14:00 and 17:00 h. These results are in line
    with previous studies on grapevine subjected to deficit irrigation conditions
    and which report temperature differences of 2–8 °C between plants subjected to
    different water stress levels and irrigation regimes (Costa et al., 2012, Grant
    et al., 2007, Möller et al., 2007). Additionally, other authors have shown that
    that the best moment of the day to do robust and physiologically sound temperature
    readings was at midday (Pou et al., 2014, Zia et al., 2009, Fuentes et al., 2012,
    Bellvert et al., 2015). Our findings show a high correlation between the thermal
    variables and leaf gas exchange parameters namely at 11:00 h, 14:00 h and 17:00
    h (Table 3). The non-normalized thermal indicator TC, and the thermal indices
    CWSI and IG had the highest correlation coefficients with gs and An, whereas the
    index ΔTcanopy-air showed a significant determination coefficient only at 14:00
    h, which translates some limitations of this last thermal index. The apparent
    low robustness of the index ΔTcanopy-air relatively to the other thermal indicators
    may relate to differences between the real microclimate data and the data provided
    by the meteorological station located at about 900 m distance from the field trial.
    It is possible that the accuracy of this thermal index would increase if Tair
    values were gathered at the same time and closer to the canopy area imaged by
    the thermal camera. In this study we have shown that the four thermal indicators
    have advantages and disadvantages that must be accounted when using them for water-stress
    monitoring in field and support of irrigation strategies in the vineyard Regarding
    the simplicity and the time consuming aspects, the index ΔTcanopy-air would be
    recommendable because it is easy to calculate. Besides this thermal indicator
    was successfully used in ground and aerial thermal monitoring of woody crops such
    as olives (Berni et al., 2009a), citrus (García-Tejero et al., 2011b) almonds
    (García-Tejero et al., 2012, García-Tejero et al., 2015) and grapevine (Baluja
    et al., 2012). These authors have found significant correlations between ΔTcanopy-air
    and gs and leaf water potential, when measurements were done at midday. In turn,
    Suárez et al. (2008) showed for olive trees that the diurnal variation of ΔTcanopy-air
    correlated significantly with the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), a physiological
    reflectance index that indicates photosynthetic efficiency, attesting the physiological
    relevance of this “simple” index. In order to decide if ΔTcanopy-air can be considered
    as robust as the IG and CWSI, we should consider that both the CWSI and IG are
    based on TC readings and on artificial T references (Twet and Tdry), which were
    directly collected near the zone of interest of the canopy of the monitored vines.
    This fact could justify the weaker relationships between leaf gas exchange parameters
    and ΔTcanopy-air as compared to the relationships found for CWSI and IG. Nevertheless,
    determination of reference temperatures has also limitations that can limit robustness
    of the CWSI and IG, in particular under conditions of significant environmental
    variation and variable angle of observation in relation to the solar beam (Jones
    and Grant, 2016). An important aspect raised by our results is the possibility
    of using TC values as feasible indicator of vine’s water status and a basic parameter
    to have into account for water stress monitoring and irrigation management. This
    is corroborated by the Pearson’s correlation coefficients from the relationship
    between this indicator and gs or An. Indeed, significant relationships between
    TC and gs and An were obtained for both cultivars, using the data from measurements
    at 14:00 and 17:00 (Fig. 4) The simplicity of TC could favor its use as a preliminary
    stress indicator. However, TC is highly influenced by environmental conditions,
    and hence, it can have major limitations for remote sensing of crop water status
    especially under highly variable climate conditions (e.g. windy, slightly cloudy).
    On the contrary, CWSI and IG, which represent normalized values, may be more robust
    especially under more variable environmental conditions (e.g. radiation, wind,
    Tair) along the day or in case there are limitations in obtaining a precise Tair
    near vine canopies. A final question was to assess to what extent grapevine genotype
    would be influencing robustness of the used thermal indices and related information
    on vine’s water status as this is not a fully covered aspect by literature. Different
    varieties may present different physiological response to water stress, expressed
    via different gs and transpiration rate and, consequently, different evaporative
    cooling and TC (Costa et al., 2012, Bota et al., 2016). Such differences in leaf
    gas exchange and TC will be reflected in the relationships between the thermal
    indices and plant water status and leaf gas-exchange as described in previous
    literature (Costa et al., 2012; Bellvert et al., 2013, 2015). Since we have not
    observed a significant effect of the variety on the slopes and intercepts of the
    relationships between CWSI and IG indices and leaf gas exchange parameters, a
    single function can be used for the two genotypes. In fact, under mild water stress
    (predawn ranging between −0.2 and −0.5 MPa) the stomatal behaviour of the two
    varieties was similar, with no effect on the relationships between An or gs and
    TC (Table 1, Table 3) as well as on the thermal indices (Fig. 4). Although the
    linear regression models estimated in our study for Aragonez and Touriga are in
    line with previous findings for Mediterranean conditions (Table 4), literature
    also suggests some degree of variation between genotypes, the measuring conditions
    and the set up (Table 4). Table 4. Non exhaustive list of examples showing the

    to predict vine’s leaf gas exchange on the basis of TC, CWSI and IG show the potential
    of these thermal indicators for modelling approaches in grapevine, namely to predict
    vine water status, growth and carbon balance along the day/season which is increasingly
    relevant in the context of precision viticulture as well as in the context of
    modern crop phenotyping and breeding (Greer and Weedon, 2012, Tuberosa, 2012,
    Klodt et al., 2015, Jones and Grant, 2016). 5. Conclusions Modern irrigated viticulture
    in the Mediterranean demands solutions to optimize crop monitoring and to improve
    water savings. In addition, simpler to operate but still robust methodology approaches
    should be the basis of a wider use of thermography in viticulture, Our results
    show that thermal imaging is a feasible tool to monitor remotely grapevines water
    status. Nonetheless, the decision on the most adequate thermal index to use and
    the best time of the day to perform measurements must be defined and have in consideration
    the combined effects of the genotype and the environment . Our results suggest
    that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically meaningful thermal
    data to assess vine’s water status is between 11:00 h and 14:00 h (local time),
    independently of the variety. Regarding the robustness of the tested thermal indicators,
    our results suggest that CWSI and IG provide more meaningful information about
    the crop-water status than ΔTcanopy-air. Equally relevant from our findings is
    the fact that TC shows to be significantly correlated with gs and An, suggesting
    that it can be used as simpler parameter to support thermal remote sensing of
    water stress in grapevine. In spite of being a non-normalized thermal indicator,
    TC can work as an explanatory variable of vine’s eco-physiology with potential
    use for grapevine growth models. The usefulness of ground based TC data is also
    envisaged to support validation of aerial based data which is an increasingly
    important topic of thermal infrared remote sensing (Tang and Li, 2014). The absence
    of genotype effects on the relationships between CWSI and IG indices and gas exchange
    parameters allowed us to obtain a single function to monitor crop-water status
    independently of the variety. Nevertheless, the present results should be confirmed
    for more severe drought situations, where the effect of the genotype is expected
    to become more significant. Acknowledgements This research received funding from

    et al., 2018a; 2018b; Petrie et al., 2019). Ground-based platform brings an easy
    implementation to acquire canopy temperature from both sides of canopy for determining
    the stronger correlation between thermal indicators and crop physiological indices.

  key_findings: '- Thermal imaging is a feasible tool to remotely monitor grapevine
    water status.

    - Between 11:00 h and 14:00 h is the best time to obtain robust and physiologically
    meaningful thermal data to assess the vine''s water status.

    - CWSI and IG provide more meaningful information about the crop-water status
    than ΔTcanopy-air.

    - TC shows to be significantly correlated with gs and An, suggesting that it can
    be used as simpler parameter to support thermal remote sensing of water stress
    in grapevine.'
  limitations: 'The study focused on a single crop (grapevine) and may not be directly
    applicable to other plant species or different environmental conditions. The relationships
    between thermal indices and plant physiological parameters were derived from correlations
    and may not necessarily represent causal relationships. The study did not consider
    the potential effects of factors such as canopy architecture, soil conditions,
    and water source on the performance of thermal sensing.


    The workload associated with collecting ground-based thermal images manually can
    be demanding depending on the size of the area being monitored, and this may limit
    the scalability of the approach in larger commercial settings. Additionally, the
    accuracy of thermal imaging can be affected by environmental factors such as wind
    and sunlight, which may introduce some variability in the data.'
  main_objective: Thermal sensing is a feasible technique for remote monitoring of
    grapevine water status. However, the most adequate thermal index to use and the
    best time of the day to perform measurements must be carefully determined, with
    consideration of the combined effects of the genotype and the environment.

    phenotyping (HTP) has unlocked new prospects for non-destructive field-based phenotyping.
    Autonomous, semi-autonomous, or manual platforms equipped with single or multiple
    sensors collect spatial and temporal data, resulting in massive amounts of data
    for analysis and storage. The enormous volume, variety, and velocity of HTP data
    generated by such platforms make it a ‘big data’ problem. Big data generated by
    these near real-time platforms must be efficiently archived and retrieved for
    analysis. The analysis and interpretation of these large datasets is quite challenging.
    Sophisticated data collection, storage, and processing are becoming ubiquitous,
    and newer areas of application are emerging constantly. One such relatively new
    domain is plant stress analytics. ML algorithms are a very promising approach
    for faster, more efficient, and better data analytics. ML being inherently multidisciplinary
    draws inspiration and utilizes concepts from probability theory, statistics, decision
    theory, optimization, and visualization. Most current applications of ML tools
    in plant sciences have focused on using a limited set of ML tools (SVM, ANN).
    A good understanding of which, when, and how various ML tools can be applied will
    be very informative to the plant community to leverage these ML tools. Advances
    in automated and high-throughput imaging technologies have resulted in a deluge
    of high-resolution images and sensor data of plants. However, extracting patterns
    and features from this large corpus of data requires the use of machine learning
    (ML) tools to enable data assimilation and feature identification for stress phenotyping.
    Four stages of the decision cycle in plant stress phenotyping and plant breeding
    activities where different ML approaches can be deployed are (i) identification,
    (ii) classification, (iii) quantification, and (iv) prediction (ICQP). We provide
    here a comprehensive overview and user-friendly taxonomy of ML tools to enable
    the plant community to correctly and easily apply the appropriate ML tools and
    best-practice guidelines for various biotic and abiotic stress traits. Previous

    in Agriculture To meet the future demand of food, feed, fiber, and fuel, crop
    production must be doubled by 2050i Crop yields are limited inherently by plant
    stresses (biotic and abiotic), and plant breeders have protected yield from plant
    stress losses by incorporating resistance genes and developing more climatically-resilient
    cultivars. Plant breeders and researchers rely on plant phenotyping for accurate
    and precise trait collection and use of genetic tools to achieve their research
    goals. Plant phenotyping is defined as the application of methodologies and protocols
    to measure a specific trait, ranging from the cellular level to the whole plant
    or canopy level, related to plant structure and function [1]. Agriculture research
    programs phenotype large populations for several traits throughout the crop growth
    cycle. This challenge to phenotype multiple traits and large populations is exacerbated
    by the necessity of sampling multiple environments and growing replicated trials.
    Until recently, traditional methods of phenotyping have not kept pace with the
    available high-throughput genotyping tools. The bottleneck in phenotyping has
    driven intense efforts by the scientific community of agriculture researchers
    and engineers to adapt newer technologies in field phenotyping. A classic example
    is high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), which has unlocked new prospects for non-destructive
    field-based phenotyping in plants for a large number of traits including physiological,
    biotic (includes living factors such as fungi, bacteria, virus, insects, parasites,
    and weeds, etc.) and abiotic (includes non-living factors such as drought, flood,
    nutrient deficiency, and other environmental factors) stress traits 2, 3. Both
    ground and aerial HTP platforms, equipped with multiple sensors are being used
    in agriculture to measure multiple plant traits at varying growth stages rapidly,
    precisely, and accurately (Figure 1A, Key Figure). Examples of these HTP platforms
    include deployment in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) [4], triticale (× Triticosecale
    Wittmack L.) [5], and maize (Zea mays L.) [6]. Recent advances in sensors for
    imaging plants 7, 8, ranging from remote sensing including spectroradiometry [9],
    Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) [10], visible to far-infrared [11], hyperspectral
    12, 13, 14, 15, thermal 16, 17, fluorescence 16, 18, and 3D laser scanning [19]
    to trichromatic (RGB) [20] imaging in conjunction with advanced autonomous vehicles,
    have truly opened up the possibility of high-throughput stress phenotyping (HTSP).
    Autonomous platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [21] and ground robots
    [22] equipped with multiple sensors can take pictures in near real-time of the
    entire experimental plot several times per day, or over the entire season from
    germination to maturity, resulting in massive amounts of data for analysis and
    storage. Making sense of all these collected data can be done effectively using
    ML tools (see the supplemental information online). It is important to emphasize
    that for ML tools data can be collected from complex, integrated imaging platforms
    or from simple(r) methods such as crowd-sourced cell phone images. Download :

    and prediction (ICQP); (ii) to give an overview of general issues in ML to develop
    a strategy for wider application and adaptability in agriculture; (iii) to contribute
    to a technical framework for the application of ML in plant breeding to solve
    practical problems, especially plant stress phenotyping using digital imaging;
    and (iv) to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various ML algorithms
    in stress phenotyping with the aim of enabling further exploration of these tools
    for facilitating practical use in plant breeding. Phenotyping Data and ML The
    enormous volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of imaging and remote-sensing
    data generated by such real-time platforms represent a ‘big data’ problem. The
    data generated by these near real-time platforms must be efficiently archived
    and retrieved for analysis. Although the analysis and interpretation of such (image-based)
    big data are challenging, the ensuing possibilities that can impact on agricultural
    production make it a promising approach for HTP and HTSP. ML approaches present
    a scalable, modular strategy for data analysis, especially for the new application
    domain of ‘plant stress analytics’. Recent studies on HTSP using images obtained
    from UAV-based platforms to detect weeds in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) [23],
    maize [21], and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) [24] using ML algorithms have
    paved a new path for better stress management practices on spatial and temporal
    basis. ML is an inherently multidisciplinary approach to data analysis that draws
    inspiration, and borrows heavily, from probability theory, statistics, decision
    theory, visualization, and optimization. ML approaches are typically useful in
    situations where large amounts of data are available, relating inputs (e.g., image
    data) to output quantities of interest (e.g., stress phenotypes). One of the major
    advantages of using ML approaches for plant breeders, pathologists, physiologists,
    and biologists is the opportunity to search large datasets to discover patterns
    and govern discovery by simultaneously looking at a combination of factors instead
    of analyzing each feature (trait) individually. This was previously a major bottleneck
    because the high dimensionality of individual images (coupled with the huge number
    of such images) makes them extremely difficult to analyze through classical techniques.
    Another key challenge is that the underlying processes for linking the inputs
    to the outputs are too complex to model mathematically. This is particularly the
    case for plant stress phenotyping, where it is challenging to efficiently model
    the holistic effect of genetic, agronomic, economic, meteorological, and human
    factor inputs on stress and, ultimately, yield. ML methods have been applied with
    spectacular results to similar problems [25] previously presumed to be impossible
    to model. Examples include numerous success stories in various domains ranging
    from computer vision (e.g., face recognition), speech processing (e.g., Google
    voice, Apple''s Siri) and natural language processing (e.g., IBM Watson), consumer
    predictive analytics (e.g., Netflix movie recommender system) to bioinformatics
    (e.g., personalized genomics, drug design, and genome annotation) [26], cell biology
    [27], and disease tissue classification in medicine 28, 29. The success of ML
    tools is attributed to their ability to identify a hierarchy of features and generalized
    trends from available data. These tools have also proved particularly adept at
    integrating disparate and often redundant data to draw coherent (and often non-intuitive)
    patterns for identification and quantification. Finally, current progress in ML
    has resulted in scalable, robust, and flexible software tools (R packages, Matlab
    toolboxes, and software packages such as Theano, Caffe for archetypal ML algorithms)
    30, 31, 32, 33 that make the application of ML to disparate disciplines straightforward.
    The advances have percolated into agricultural research, where there has been
    an increasing research effort to apply ML approaches in diverse species, such
    as horticultural crops and forest tree species. This has been driven in part by
    the increased investment by commercial companies and the decreasing cost of imaging/sensor
    platforms. ML-Enabled HTSP In light of these developments, it is clear that ML-enabled
    HTSP will benefit plant breeders, physiologists, entomologists, pathologists,
    extension workers, and farmers by allowing screening of different stresses in
    an accurate, precise, and speedy manner (Table 1). This will also directly enable
    the acceleration of the gene discovery process as well as the introduction of
    novel selection protocols for complex quantitative traits such as biotic and abiotic
    stresses and yield. ML-enabled HTSP will also enhance our understanding of pathogen–plant
    interactions [34] as well as the interaction of plants with other stresses. Table

    stress [60] What is ML? ML refers to a group of computerized modeling approaches
    that can learn patterns from the data so as to make automatic decisions without
    programming explicit rules. The main idea of ML is to effectively utilize experiences
    or example scenarios to discover underlying structures, similarities, or dissimilarities
    present in data to explain or classify a new experience or an example scenario
    properly. A key ability of ML tools is their ability to generalize trends and/or
    patterns from available data. There are a large number of choices of ML tools.
    It is important for an application expert to make a judicious choice on a specific
    ML method to deploy for his/her specific problem. We advocate that the practitioner
    should (carefully) down-select from the plethora of ML choices based on the type
    and amount of available data and problem formulation. In the context of plant
    stress phenotyping, we identify four distinct classes of problem formulation:
    (i) identification/detection, (ii) classification, (iii) quantification/estimation,
    and (v) prediction (Figure 1B,C). Furthermore, preprocessing steps such as dimension
    reduction, clustering, and segmentation can also be crucial for successful decision-making.
    Structure of a ML Process Typically, a large fraction of the dataset, known as
    the ‘training dataset’, that represents the entire population is used for calibrating
    the model. The remaining dataset is used to test the calibrated model, and is
    termed the ‘testing dataset’. The next step after training is to validate the
    learnt model on a new set of data (from different or same population). Once the
    accuracy and precision of the model is high enough, it can be used on a routine
    basis to identify, classify, quantify and predict particular stress features.
    We discuss this process in greater detail next, particularly focusing on clarifying
    the choice of ML tools to use based on two different points of view, namely the
    learning process (how are features learnt) and the modeling objective (what is
    being learnt). The Learning Process – Supervised versus Unsupervised The first
    point of view concerns whether or not the ML model is provided with the labels
    to the data it uses for model training. Here, a label is a trait (such as diseased
    plant or type of crop plant) that is associated with an image. For example, suppose
    the objective of a ML model is to distinguish between maize, soybean [Glycine
    max (L.) Merr.], and sunflower plants after collecting a large number of images.
    If the model is trained with a set of such images where each is labeled as soybean,
    maize or sunflower, the learning process is termed ‘supervised’. Alternatively,
    if the training images are provided without any label, the learning process is
    ‘unsupervised’. Note that although some ML tools can be trained either in a supervised
    or an unsupervised manner, some can be trained in both ways. With the supervised
    learning process, a model essentially tries to learn a map between the input dataset
    and the corresponding output labels. For the given example, it means that a model
    trained in a supervised manner learns how to map all the soybean examples to the
    soybean label, and so on. Support vector machines (SVM) and regular artificial
    neural networks (ANN) are among the prominent examples of supervised schemes.
    By contrast, an unsupervised method does not have specific output labels associated
    with input images. It identifies structures or features present in the images,
    such as the presence of tassels in maize, or the presence of trifoliate leaves
    in soybean. In many cases, the features identified in the unsupervised process
    may not be meaningful to a human user. Various clustering, mixture models, and
    dimension-reduction techniques fall under this category. Often ML models can be
    developed by using partly labeled data. This training scheme is known as ‘semi-supervised’
    learning. The Modeling Objective – Generative versus Discriminative A second point
    of view for ML method categorization is the modeling objective: whether the model
    being trained is to distinguish between two different data patterns or to be able
    to learn and generate similar patterns synthetically. In the context of the previous
    example, a maize and soybean plant can be distinguished based on the presence
    or absence of tassels or pods. A model developed with only this difference would
    be termed a ‘discriminative model’. Naturally, many supervised methods such as
    SVM and ANN fall under this category. However, such a model does not learn other
    features of the objects. Thus, a discriminative model that distinguishes a soybean
    plant from a maize plant based on the presence of tassels fails to differentiate
    between an image of a maize plant and that of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]
    plant. Therefore, a discriminative model is typically built for a predetermined
    specific task. On the other hand, a model that captures the overall data pattern
    such that it is able to generate synthetic images is known as a ‘generative model’.
    It follows that a single generative model can be useful for many decision tasks
    at the same time. Mixture models, hidden Markov models, and Boltzmann machines
    are prominent examples of generative models. Given a large volume of data, discriminative
    models usually perform better than generative models, especially for classification
    tasks, such as distinguishing images of soybean plants from a maize plant. However,
    generative models can achieve slightly better performance compared to discriminative
    ones with low training data volume. In addition, generative models tend to be
    more robust to overfitting issues (i.e., a model learns training data too well
    and performs very poorly for unseen test data). Figure 1D schematically illustrates
    the categorization of several ML methods into classes of generative versus discriminative,
    and supervised versus unsupervised. Although it seems that supervised models are
    more likely to be discriminative in nature, and generative models should not need
    output labels for training, there are examples of unsupervised discriminative
    models and supervised generative models. For example, the widely popular K-means
    clustering technique usually follows an unsupervised training scheme. Even so,
    it is not possible to generate new data examples reliably using only the cluster
    centers and groupings. Most of the unsupervised generative techniques can be learned
    in a supervised manner when the target class information is incorporated as one
    of the data features. Apart from such variations (as shown in Figure 1D), many
    of the ML tools have minor variations based on particular aspects such as underlying
    model structure (e.g., linear vs nonlinear) and training algorithm. The Role of
    Preprocessing in ML-HTSP The crucial step for the successful deployment of ML
    methods is careful preprocessing of the image data. There are multiple examples
    where a careful choice of preprocessing of the collected image datasets has resulted
    in substantial improvements in ML performance. Preprocessing can vary from very
    simple operations including image cropping, contrast enhancement, and removal
    of background to significantly more complex operations such as clustering and
    dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis (PCA). However, the
    overarching principle of preprocessing the data is ‘concentration of information’.
    That is, the original datasets may contain a large quantity of unnecessary or
    conflicting information that can result in poor ML performance. By preprocessing,
    the signal-to-noise ratio (ratio of useful to useless information) is improved.
    This directly enhances the ability of the ML model to easily recognize useful
    patterns or trends and to separate the data into appropriate classes. Preprocessing
    is the stage where domain knowledge is crucial. The domain expert identifies features
    in the image that are relevant or important for training the model. For example,
    the removal of background (soil, dirt, and tags, etc.) from the foreground to
    identify the plant canopy is generally a crucial step. Following this, a variety
    of image processing tools can be used to convert these raw datasets into a more
    relevant dataset that contains the extracted features. Examples of preprocessing
    operations include: (i) segmentation of images; (ii) contrast enhancement to detect
    edges; (iii) thresholding images into binary data; (iv) converting one image format
    into other [RGB to greyscale; RGB to hue saturation value (HSV)]; (v) de-noising
    images using filters [band-pass, low-pass, fast Fourier transform (FFT)]; (vi)
    extracting features at different scales using image transforms (FFT, wavelet transforms,
    Haar transforms, Hough transforms, Radon transforms); (vii) pixel-based classification;
    (viii) clustering of images into classes; and (ix) dimensionality reduction of
    images. Several of the ML tools discussed here can in fact be applied to these
    preprocessing stages. There are several examples of the utility of such preprocessing
    steps. For early site-specific weed management (ESSWM) in wheat, a UAV-based platform
    was equipped with a visible-range camera to capture ultra-high resolution images.
    Otsu''s thresholding method was then used to differentiate wheat crop plants from
    weeds [23]. In sunflower, a quadrocopter equipped with RGB and multispectral sensors
    was used to detect weeds to optimize herbicide application. A pixel-based classification
    approach was used for weed identification. Similarly, image segmentation 21, 24,
    35 followed by automatic object-based image analysis (OBIA) was used in sunflower
    and maize to identify spatial and spectrally consistent objects. ML Approaches
    to ICQP Identification of Stress Identification methods involve detection of a
    specific stress amid other potential stresses in the field. Here, preprocessing
    of image data is crucial. This is especially important for applications involving
    high-throughput imaging, where plant stressors (such as weeds, nutrient, disease,
    and insects) must be automatically identified. In the past, ML methods such as
    SVM, neural networks (NNs), kernel methods, and instance-based approaches have
    been used to detect various stresses. The SVM method has been used successfully
    in a variety of scenarios for stress identification in plants. SVM Methods SVM
    methods have been applied to a variety of plants for disease and stress identification.
    They are deployed in the citrus industry to contain citrus greening (caused by
    phloem-limiting bacteria), also known as Huanglongbing (HLB). Early identification
    is crucial for effectively controlling the spread of HLB. ML was used for the
    identification and estimation of HLB based on fluorescence imaging spectroscopy
    data of leaf samples [36]. The images were preprocessed (segmented) and the extracted
    features were used as an input to SVM. In another example, two aerial imaging
    platforms were compared for the identification of HLB diseases in an infected
    citrus orchard. An aircraft sensing platform equipped to capture hyperspectral
    images and a UAV platform equipped with a multiband imaging camera were used,
    and images obtained from both platforms were segmented and piped to a SVM classifier.
    Results showed that a (non-linear) SVM with kernel worked better than (linear)
    SVM, LDA, and QDA [37]. Similarly, in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), early identification
    of three diseases, Cercospora leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew, was performed
    using SVM with a radial basis function as kernel [38]. The same idea was deployed
    in cotton to identify damage by green stink bug, bacterial angular blight, and
    Ascochyta blight using a SVM classifier [39], as well as in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
    L.) to identify viruses: tomato yellow leaf curl virus and tomato yellow leaf
    curl disease [40]. SVM (combined with a Gaussian process classifier) was used
    for the automatic identification of soil moisture stress using remote visible
    and thermal images in spinach canopies, where the efficacy of using a combination
    of methods was explored. In another study, visible and thermal imaging were combined
    with depth information to automatically identify powdery mildew of tomato plants
    at an early growth stage using a SVM classifier kernel [31]. Variants of the SVM
    method have also proven to be useful for identification. In rice (Oryza sativa
    L.], the hierarchical identification of nutrient deficiency symptoms using scanned
    images was carried out using support vector feature selection (SVFS). Hierarchical
    identification was able to detect the NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium)
    stress effectively with enhanced identification accuracy [41]. Artificial Neural
    Nets (ANN) and Variants Simple image processing, followed by ANN, was used for
    detecting and identifying three orchid seedling diseases: bacterial soft rot,
    bacterial brown spot, and Phytopthora black rot [42]. Discriminant Analysis Spectral
    reflectance data were recorded from healthy and HLB-infected citrus leaves, and
    various classifier methods (discriminative and supervised methods) were used to
    identify infected leaves using quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), linear discriminant
    analysis (LDA), and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and soft independent modeling of
    class analogy (SIMCA) [43]. In sugar beets, hyperspectral canopy reflectance was
    used to identify stress symptoms instigated by beet cyst nematode and Rhizoctonia
    crown and root rot [44]. Gaussian Mixture Models Preprocessing followed by the
    application of Gaussian mixture models has been used to identify both biotic and
    abiotic stresses [45]. Canopy images were taken in a stressed wheat field, at
    differential levels of irrigation (abiotic stress) and inoculated with wheat streak
    mosaic virus (biotic stress). K-means Clustering and Variants Water and nutrient
    stress at the crop canopy level have been studied using hyperspectral images that
    were analyzed using simplex volume maximization (SiVM), an unsupervised clustering
    approach. The SiVM algorithm was found to be adept at detecting drought stress
    using hyperspectral images four days before the appearance of symptoms visible
    to the human eye. The unsupervised nature of SiVM also provided useful new insights
    into the data 11, 25. Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering The automatic extraction
    of hyperspectral signatures using the Bayes factor algorithm with Dirichlet-aggregation
    regression (DAR) resulted in rapid, reliable, and data-driven approach for phenotyping
    plants for both biotic and abiotic stresses [11]. In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.),
    the DAR algorithm was used for the presymptomatic prediction of drought stress
    at an early stage using hyperspectral images [46]. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and
    Bayes Classifier Both supervised (Bayesian classifier) and unsupervised (SOM)
    ML approaches were used for segmenting diseased tomato plants. Diseased regions
    on the tomato canopy were identified using the preprocessed tomato images by a
    SOM model [20]. Classification of Stress Classification is an extension of identification;
    however, instead of identifying a particular stress amid different stresses, a
    classifier is used to classify stress into labeled classes on the basis of stress
    symptoms and signatures. Classification methods often include a preprocessing
    step, usually a segmentation step followed by the extraction of features that
    feed into some type of classifier. For instance, drought stress can be classified
    into: no stress, moderate stress, and heavy stress. Examples from various crops
    are presented below illustrating the use of classification algorithms in various
    stresses. ANN A combination of K-means clustering followed by ANN, using fused
    information from RGB and multispectral camera imaging, was used to develop a 3D
    model of leaves to differentiate the two sugar beet diseases, Cercospora beticola
    and Uromyces betae [47]. In another example, thermal and hyperspectral imaging
    were analyzed to identify and classify symptoms caused by three Alternaria species
    in the oilseed brassica. The majority of the available classifiers present in
    Weka (useful data-mining software in java) were tested, and eight classifiers
    were used to make comparisons. The back-propagation neural networks (BNNs) classification
    model displayed the highest prediction accuracy for classifying Alternaria species
    [48]. SVM A SVM-based method was used to classify healthy and unhealthy Arabidopsis
    plants on the basis of symptoms instigated by colonization of the human pathogen
    Salmonella Typhimurium [49]. The SVM model was comprehensively tested on 1200
    individual Arabidopsis plants with positive results [50]. In further work, classification
    error was reduced using SVMs compared to other ML methods such as decision trees
    and ANNs. The classification accuracy of three sugar beet diseases increased with
    increasing disease severity. This is especially true when hyperspectral reflectance-based
    vegetation indices were used with SVM for the automatic classification of disease
    severity of three sugar beet diseases (Cercospora leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery
    mildew). Another example of the usefulness of SVM was the identification and classification
    of stonefly larvae from images. Haar random forest feature extraction, in combination
    with SVM classifier, was able to differentiate and classify stonefly larvae from
    other insect species [51]. LDA, K-Means, and Coupled Methods ML methods were used
    to classify the presence of aflatoxins, which are toxic compounds produced by
    fungus Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus [52]. Fluorescence (UV illumination)
    and reflectance (halogen excitations) were used as input data in this case. Preprocessing
    was performed to extract features using Guyon''s SVM-RFE, classical Fisher discriminant
    power, and PCA. These extracted features were used as inputs to classifiers such
    as LDA (linear discriminant analysis) and MLP. Another paper classified the RGB
    images into ‘healthy’ and ‘injured’ classes of clover plants that were exposed
    to varying level of ozone. Various pixel-classifying methods were compared such
    as LDA, K-means clustering, FPM-T2 (fit to a pattern multivariate image analysis
    combined with T2 statistics), and FPM-RSS (FPM combined with residual sum of squares
    statistics) [53]. Quantification of Stress There are fewer reports describing
    the use of ML approaches to quantify stresses, and this provides tremendous opportunities
    for plant scientists and breeders. Quantification methods are an extension of
    classification methods where each class is quantified on the basis of stress severity.
    In case of plant diseases, disease severity [54] can be used to quantify various
    diseases. For example, rust severity in wheat can be quantified on a scale of
    0–100% [55]. Quantification algorithms are usually best preceded by a preprocessing
    stage to separate foreground from background, edge detection, and contrast enhancement.
    A good example of the benefit of preprocessing of images for quantification is
    illustrated in [56] where color mapping (converting from native RGB to other non-native
    formats such as HSV) followed by segmentation was used to quantify disease severity
    of PHYVV (pepper huasteco yellow vein virus) on chili pepper (Capsicum annuum
    L.) plants. Examples from various other crops are presented next. SVM Leaf miner
    pest causes major losses in vegetable and ornamental plants. SVM applied to near-infrared
    spectral reflectance using spectrophotometer and digital leaf images of tomato
    plants of damaged leaves was used to successfully quantify damage degree (DD)
    into five levels [57]. Automatic detection method was used to detect and quantify
    Verticillium wilt (VM) on a large scale in olive using hyperspectral sensor and
    thermal camera mounted on aircraft. The spatial distribution of VM was assessed
    at field level and severity classes (0–4 rating scale quantified into 0–100% severity
    level) predicted by LDA and non-linear SVM methods. Both ML methods showed good
    results in detecting and quantifying VM severity in olives (Olea europaea L.)
    [58]. Prediction of Stress The prediction of plant stress at an early stage before
    it is visible to the human eye has substantial implications for the timely and
    cost-effective control of stress. There are very few reported activities on using
    ML for the prediction of stresses, making this the next big frontier for research
    efforts. This has tremendous implications for prescription farming and precision
    agriculture. SVM In predicting rice blast disease, SVM was used for the development
    of a weather-based prediction model [59]. The performance of the SVM-based approach
    was compared to the ANN variants; back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and generalized
    regression neural network (GRNN), and also to conventional multiple regression.
    The SVM-based approach outpaced all the three methods in cross-location and cross-year
    models, indicating their role in early forecasting of plant diseases. Other examples
    include the prediction of drought-induced stress in barley using hyperspectral
    images using an SVM variant, ordinal classification approach [60]. In barley for
    the presymptomatic detection of water stress, DAR algorithm was used on images
    obtained using hyperspectral camera. The DAR algorithm was efficient in predicting
    stress before symptoms were visible to human eye [46]. Strategies for the Development
    of Efficient ML Applications in Plant Breeding ML methods can play an extensive
    role in breeding for stress tolerance and for rapid phenotyping. These approaches
    can be used in decision-making for parent selection to use in hybridization schemes,
    and in generation advancement and selection. An example of an application using
    ICQP is presented below. Identification Use HTP platform [UAV, unmanned ground
    vehicle (UGV)] for taking images of breeding plots in plant stress nurseries,
    and yield tests. Perform image processing and apply ML algorithms. ML identifies
    which stress is present in each breeding plot. Classification Use ML approaches
    to classify stress in each breeding plot. For instance, determine if a genotype
    is resistant or susceptible to a particular stress. This information can be directly
    used in a breeding decision scheme to select stress resistance genotypes. Quantification
    Use ML approaches to quantify the stress. For example, quantification may be on
    a 0–100% scale of expression, such as percent infection severity. Use the information
    generated by ML approach through quantification to make selections to identify
    stress-resistant genotypes for further testing or commercialization. Prediction
    Use ML approaches on prior disease and weather data to make early stage prediction
    on the expression of stresses for breeding and selection decisions. In addition
    to plant stresses, advances have been made in analyzing other traits using ML
    to predict yield 61, 62, 63, biomass 64, 65, root traits 66, 67, and adaptation
    traits [68]. Concluding Remarks and Outlook ML tools provide a very powerful framework
    to assimilate data, and the utility of these tools is especially important considering
    current progress in HTP approaches that easily generate terabytes of data. Appropriate
    choice and usage of ML tools is crucial for obtaining the maximum possible benefits
    of these sophisticated approaches. This review provides a comprehensive overview
    of ML alongside best practices of using these ML tools to enable stress phenotyping
    (Box 1, Box 2). Using advanced ML tools for plant stress phenotyping is a very
    new area, with the plant community focusing on a small number of ML methods (such
    as SVM and ANN). As part of this review, we have identified several future avenues
    for using ML techniques that show tremendous promise but remain currently unutilized
    by the phenotyping community (see Outstanding Questions). Furthermore, the concepts
    discussed here can be applied to data collected across the spectrum of complexity
    and sophistication (from manually captured camera imaging to automated high-throughput
    imaging systems), as well as scale (from individual plant to plot to field). Box
    1 Key Take-Away Points for Practitioners Identification (i) A large variety of
    ML methods have been successfully applied to the disease identification problem.
    This is an area where preprocessing of images will be very useful. (ii) There
    are two ways to frame a disease identification problem for ML based on the amount
    of data available. (a) When statistically significant nominal (healthy) and diseased
    datasets are available, it is best to use supervised discriminative models that
    are trained to distinguish between these classes. (b) In the absence of a statistically
    significant amount of data (or unbalanced data, see next point below), the best
    approach is to learn the nominal model of the un-diseased plant (which is feasible
    due to the availability of data of the healthy plant) using unsupervised methods.
    Then simple outlier detection can be deployed to identify off-nominal (or diseased)
    cases. (iii) We strongly encourage practitioners to refrain from training disease
    identification models using very small datasets. It is especially important to
    be vigilant against unbalanced data for training where one state (usually, the
    healthy state) has much more data instances than the other diseased states.  Classification
    (i) We encourage the practitioner to ensure the statistical significance of the
    available dataset. (ii) Preprocessing of data is crucial, as is using domain knowledge.
    (iii) Current trends are to always use supervised methods, which are mostly discriminative.
    (iv) Be vigilant against the overfitting problem. A best practice is to always
    ensure that regularization option is turned on in any ML method. (v) It is important
    to note that these methods can only distinguish between known/trained classes.
    They cannot be deployed to identify unknown/untrained symptoms (so-called extrapolatory
    mode). (vi) We encourage practitioners to extract and report detection confidence
    out of the classifier.  Quantification (i) There are very few reported applications
    of ML for stress quantification, and this provides tremendous opportunities for
    plant scientists and breeders. Most current work formulates the quantification
    problem as a classification problem with finer resolution. (ii) Our recommendation
    is that unsupervised generative models can be very successful for quantification.
    This can also work with smaller datasets. The basic idea is to learn the nominal
    (healthy state) model. The severity of the diseased state is quantified as the
    distance/offset from this nominal state. (iii) We strongly recommend practitioners
    to explore the use of Bayesian networks, deep neural nets, and latent Dirichlet
    allocation for this class of problems.  Prediction (i) Most prediction applications
    of ML are limited to early detection of disease onset. (ii) Current phenotyping
    approaches can be extended to obtain time-varying traits. Here, more sophisticated
    models can be used with great utility. Examples include HMM methods, dynamic Bayesian
    networks, and recurrent neural networks. Box 2 Precision Phenotyping Using ML
    Algorithms in Agriculture: Best Practices Advances in technology have made HTSP
    feasible. Appropriate ML tools can be used for all four stages (stress identification,
    classification, quantification, and prediction). High-throughput image-based phenotyping
    of plant stress-related traits to complement high-throughput sequencing will assist
    in finding new genes and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) using linkage mapping
    and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) together with training genome-wide
    selection models for various plant stress traits [74]. Specifically, the high-throughput
    phenotypic information on a particular stress can be used in association with
    genotypic information by means of QTL 75, 76, GWAS 77, 78, or expression studies
    to bridge the genotype–phenotype gap. Relating time-series phenotypic data with
    time-series gene expression may provide novel insights into cellular mechanisms.
    Time-series image data 79, 80 obtained in experiments using HTP platforms such
    as UAVs and autonomous rovers (ground robots), integrated into a viable ML pipeline,
    will allow the study of the time-dependent gene turn-on and turn-off mechanisms
    and provide insight into the molecular basis of disease resistance. HTP can also
    be used for phenotyping different fields for the same stress to understand the
    spatiotemporal difference in the expression of stress. The big advantage of ML
    algorithms is that plant scientists can use them proficiently in stress identification,
    classification, quantification, and prediction using tools packaged in the graphical
    user interface (GUI) without knowing the underlying mathematical and computational
    complexities. We advocate the following best practices for maximizing the effectiveness
    of ML tools: ML for Practitioners It is useful to identify which type of ML method
    is best suited by triaging the ML methods based on amount of data available as
    well as the type of data (labeled vs unlabeled). Figure 1C,D will be beneficial
    for this purpose. Discriminative methods work better for labeled and large datasets,
    while generative methods work better for smaller datasets (both labeled and unlabeled).
    It may be worthwhile for practitioners to explore the use of generative unsupervised
    models as a means to identify latent features from datasets. This is an area that
    is relatively unexplored, but holds great promise. Preprocessing is where domain
    knowledge can be leveraged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the data. For
    ML methods that are classified as discriminative and supervised, the use of preprocessing
    before deploying ML tools is essential to substantially improve ML performance.
    In cases where it is difficult to translate domain knowledge into feature crafting,
    unsupervised preprocessing methods should be explored. This may be particularly
    useful for high-dimensional data such as hyperspectral data. The outlook for ML
    tools in agriculture is very promising. A key ingredient for successful large-scale
    application of ML is the seamless integration of data analytics within the data
    collection and curation pipeline. Such a computational ecosystem (that links data
    collection, data storage, and curation with ML-based data analytics) will open
    up tremendous opportunities to accelerate breeding and to solve foundational problems
    in genomics and predictive phenomics. Promising examples of this vision include
    the Integrated Analysis Platform (IAP) [69] and the i-Plant nitiativeii A crucial
    catalyst for such advances will be to foster multidisciplinary research teams
    such that advances in engineering, plant sciences, and informatics can be leveraged
    in a rational way. This review will enable such teams by providing a common language
    of communication related to ML tools. Outstanding Questions Can causal ML models,
    deployed on time-series of images, identify visual precursors to enable early
    detection of stress response? ML methods lead to data-driven discovery of non-intuitive
    patterns. How can these hierarchical patterns be visualized and then physiologically
    interpreted by domain scientists? Advanced supervised ML methods tend to require
    labeling a large volume of training data. Can methodologies such as mechanical
    turking, crowd sourcing, and gamification be used to create a large corpus of
    community-labeled data? Future phenotyping efforts will be characterized by heterogeneous
    (visual/non-visual), multiscale (plant/plot/field), asynchronous data collected
    by a variety of sensors connected via the internet of things (IOT). How to develop
    best practices for a robust, scalable, and integrated ML pipeline that enables
    seamless assimilation? The ICQP paradigm comprehensively characterizes the spectrum
    of problems in plant stress phenotyping, thus enabling the design and deployment
    of appropriate ML tools. How can this paradigm be applied to other problems in
    plant biology, such as physiogenetic drivers of yield, and soil microbiome–plant
    root interaction studies? Acknowledgments This work was supported by Iowa State

  explanation: This paper explores the use of advanced sensing technologies, such
    as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, for non-invasive plant stress detection.
    It presents a novel approach to assess stress in plants using simplex volume maximisation
    (SiVM), an unsupervised classification method, on hyperspectral data.

    simplex volume maximisation (SiVM), to hyperspectral data. It is an unsupervised

    This provides the means to express how likely it is that one plant is suffering

    8 July 2012   Published: 28 August 2012 Abstract Early water stress recognition
    is of great relevance in precision plant breeding and production. Hyperspectral
    imaging sensors can be a valuable tool for early stress detection with high spatio-temporal
    resolution. They gather large, high dimensional data cubes posing a significant
    challenge to data analysis. Classical supervised learning algorithms often fail
    in applied plant sciences due to their need of labelled datasets, which are difficult
    to obtain. Therefore, new approaches for unsupervised learning of relevant patterns
    are needed. We apply for the first time a recent matrix factorisation technique,
    simplex volume maximisation (SiVM), to hyperspectral data. It is an unsupervised
    classification approach, optimised for fast computation of massive datasets. It
    allows calculation of how similar each spectrum is to observed typical spectra.
    This provides the means to express how likely it is that one plant is suffering
    from stress. The method was tested for drought stress, applied to potted barley
    plants in a controlled rain-out shelter experiment and to agricultural corn plots
    subjected to a two factorial field setup altering water and nutrient availability.
    Both experiments were conducted on the canopy level. SiVM was significantly better
    than using a combination of established vegetation indices. In the corn plots,
    SiVM clearly separated the different treatments, even though the effects on leaf
    and canopy traits were subtle. Additional keywords: canopy, imaging spectroscopy,
    matrix factorisation, non-invasive, pattern recognition, plant phenotyping, unsupervised
    learning, water stress.  References Aitichison J (1982) ‘The statistical analysis

    Get rights and content Abstract Indices derived from hyperspectral reflectance
    spectra have the potential to be used as indicators of environmental stress in
    crops. This study uses canopy-scale, ground-based measurements of hyperspectral
    reflectance to demonstrate the temporal patterns in corn development under imposed
    fertility (N rate) and environmental (water availability) stresses. In 1998, two
    large areas in a 30-ha corn (Zea mays, L.) field near Ottawa, Canada (45°18′N,
    75°44′W) were supplied with 99 and 17 kg N ha−1, while the balance of the field
    received the recommended rate of 155 kg N ha−1. Reflectance measurements were
    taken nine times using a portable spectroradiometer at georeferenced locations
    within these areas. Individual reflectance-based indices demonstrated the relative
    differences between application rates and identified both nitrogen and water stresses
    at various times in the growing season. No single index was able to describe the
    status of the corn crop throughout the season. Canonical discriminant analysis
    provided accurate classification of samples by N rate during early, mid, and late
    season conditions with overall success rates of 70%, 88%, and 93%, respectively.
    A shift in importance from green-based derivatives to red-based derivatives was
    noted from mid to late season and attributed to the natural reduction in green
    pigments as the crop entered senescence. Canopy-scale photochemical reflectance
    index (PRI) was shown to be correlated with canopy radiation use efficiency (RUE).
    Mid-season water stress affected the relationship. Multiple years of data are
    required to demonstrate robust relationships between hyperspectral indices and
    corn ecophysiological status because of the interaction between environmental
    and nutrient stresses. Identifying areas of fields sensitive to weather-induced
    stresses will allow better management of N application. Timing the collection
    of hyperspectral image data at early and late vegetative phase could enhance precision
    agriculture by allowing supplemental nutrient application, identifying stress
    patterns and aid in yield forecasting. Previous article in issue Next article

    Reflectance spectra have been studied intensively as a means to remotely detect
    the status of crops Hatfield & Pinter, 1993, Jackson, 1984. Hyperspectral sensors
    measure reflectance in a large number of narrow wavebands, generally with bandwidths
    of less than 10 nm. With these narrow bands, reflectance and absorption features
    related to specific crop physical and chemical characteristics can be detected.
    Research has indicated good relationships between biochemical composition, physical
    structure, water content, and plant ecophysiological status (e.g., Gamon et al.,
    1992, Peñuelas & Filella, 1998). Numerous indices have been developed, which attempt
    to detect conditions of stress within the crop. Such vegetation indices are usually
    normalized to minimize atmospheric interference by “calculating” ratios or linear
    combinations of two or more wavelengths within the visible and near-infrared (NIR).
    Gamon et al. (1992) introduced a photochemical reflectance index (PRI), which
    is associated with radiation use efficiency (RUE). Peñuelas, Filella, Biel, Serrano,
    and Savé (1993) and Peñuelas, Piñol, Ogaya, and Filella (1997) used the NIR water
    absorption band to develop a Water Band Index (WBI) as a measure of plant moisture
    status, and Demetriades-Shah, Steven, and Clark (1990) explored the use of the
    transition point between the red and NIR (termed the red edge) as an indicator
    of plant stress. Although much hyperspectral reflectance work to date has been
    done at the leaf scale, typically on excised leaves, in situ measurements made
    above the canopy are becoming more widely used, driven by the need to simulate
    the scales involved in airborne or satellite measurements (i.e., remotely sensed
    imagery at the canopy scale). This work is intimately connected to the growing
    body of research in precision agriculture where the ability to detect the ecophysiological
    status of crops and relate it to management practices at the field scale necessitates
    the use of remote sensing from airborne or satellite platforms. In this experiment,
    our intention was to use ground-based hyperspectral remote sensing and micrometeorological
    techniques to monitor different N application rates within field-grown corn. The
    idea was to simulate variable rate fertilization through different application
    rates and monitor crop growth within the resulting variability in N stress across
    large sections of the field. Results of this work were published in Pattey, Strachan,
    Boisvert, Desjardins, and McLaughlin (2001) who used crop water use efficiency
    measured in situ as an indicator of corn response to environmental stresses. Their
    results suggested that the corn growth in this study year was influenced significantly
    by water availability. Sections of the field receiving the optimum N application
    rate displayed greater signs of water stress during the vegetative phase when
    soil water decreased because of the faster rate of leaf expansion. The change
    in crop ecophysiological status was measured by a reduction in water use efficiency
    as compared to other portions of the field. This paper reports our attempts to
    detect the effects of environmental stress (those driven by weather conditions)
    and nitrogen stress (from application rates) on the same corn crop using hyperspectral
    reflectance indices available in the literature. We applied such indices to reflectance
    data collected using a portable spectroradiometer above the corn canopy from a
    distance where the sensor is detecting the top of the canopy. These results will
    serve as an exploration in support of subsequent work at the canopy level in conjunction
    with aircraft-based hyperspectral measurements at this field site. The objectives
    of the research presented in this paper were: 1. To use canopy-scale hyperspectral
    indices to detect both environmental and N stresses as they occurred throughout
    a growing season. 2. To determine if canopy-scale hyperspectral indices could
    be used to discriminate between N application rates at various times throughout
    the growing season. 2. The study area The experiment site is presented in detail
    in Pattey et al. (2001) and only a brief description is provided here. A corn
    crop (Pioneer 3893; 2700 CHU) was planted on a 30-ha ploughed field consisting
    of a drained clay loam soil (Dalhousie series) near Ottawa, Canada (45°18′N, 75°44′W)
    in May 1998. The field was divided into three regions as follows: a 2.6-ha area
    (175×150 m) received 17 kg N ha−1 as starter fertilization; a 3.7-ha area (half
    an octagon shape of about 250×170 m) received a rate of 99 kg N ha−1 or 64% of
    the recommended rate; the remainder of the field received the recommended rate
    of 155 kg N ha−1. These areas were termed 17N, 99N, and 155N, respectively. The
    experimental design simulated a typical range in application rates and provided
    an artificial control area. Within each application rate, and in a representative
    150×150 m section of 155N, an array of georeferenced points spaced every 50 m
    was established resulting in nine sampling locations in the 155N and 17N areas.
    Within the 99N area, there were 13 sample locations. 3. Materials and methods
    3.1. Plant sampling Measurements of plant biomass components (leaf, stalk, and
    grain mass and moisture content; plant height) and destructive leaf area index
    (LAI) were obtained by randomly harvesting 20 plants from each of the three N
    application areas on seven occasions during the season. LAI was measured by passing
    all leaves through an area meter (LI-3100, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) and multiplying
    the resulting total leaf area per plant by the average plant density of 6.67 plants
    m−2. Estimates of leaf chlorophyll content were obtained using a portable chlorophyll
    meter (SPAD-502, Minolta, Japan). SPAD readings were made in situ on the plants
    designated for harvesting, midway along the youngest fully expanded leaf. The
    relationship developed by Dwyer, Tollenaar, and Houwing (1991) for corn was used
    to convert SPAD readings to chlorophyll concentration per unit leaf area (mg m−2).
    These estimates were scaled to the canopy by multiplying by the appropriate measured
    LAI resulting in chlorophyll concentration per unit ground area (mg m−2). 3.2.
    Micrometeorological measurements Measurements of canopy exchange of CO2 were made
    over the 99N and 155N application rates using eddy covariance measuring systems
    as described in Pattey et al. (2001). Thirty-minute average CO2 fluxes were converted
    to net photosynthesis by subtracting out the CO2 contribution from the soil. Net
    photosynthesis was used with coincident measurements of 30-min average incident
    photosynthetic photon flux density (Qp) made in situ by a quantum sensor (model
    LI-190SA, LI-COR) to compute average canopy RUE (mol CO2 mol−1 Qp) between 10:00
    and 14:00 h Eastern Standard Time on days of hyperspectral reflectance measurements.
    3.3. Reflectance measurements A portable spectroradiometer (GER1500, GER, Millbrook,
    NY) measured radiance between 350 and 1050 nm in wavebands approximately 2 nm
    in width. At each georeferenced location within each area, 5–10 samples were obtained
    from a 2-m radius centred on the georeferenced point. Spectral reflectance was
    calculated as the ratio of measured radiance to radiance from a white standard
    (Spectralon, Labsphere, North Sutton, NH) taken under the same sky conditions
    and immediately preceding the plant radiance measurements. Reflectance measurements
    were obtained nine times between June 9 and September 17, 1998. Measurements were
    made as close to solar noon as possible on days with no overhead cloud cover to
    avoid the effects of solar angle and contributions from diffuse light Lord et
    al., 1988, Lord et al., 1985. Reflectance was averaged over the 5–10 samples collected
    at each location within each area. Initially, a fore-optic lens with a field of
    view (FOV) of 3° was used. Later, as the canopy grew, a longer fibre-optic lens
    (mounted on a metal pole) with a FOV of 23° was used. In each case, the optic
    was fixed in the nadir position viewing the upper portion of the canopy, which
    would be seen by an airborne sensor. The timing of reflectance measurements was
    dictated by the need to adhere to strict protocol regarding sky conditions. The
    plant sampling described above was completed within a few days of the reflectance
    measurements. Prior to crop emergence, reflectance measurements of the bare soil
    surface were made on a 100×100 m grid across the entire field. From these measurements,
    the slope and intercept of the relationship between reflectance in the NIR and
    red (termed the soil line by Baret, Jacquemoud, & Hanocq, 1993) were computed.
    Sporadic spikes in the reflectance spectra were removed using a simple procedure
    without changing any dominant features. Specifically, if the difference between
    the reflectance for waveband “i” (Ri) and that of waveband “i−2” (Ri−2) divided
    by Ri−2 was greater than the seven-band coefficient of variation centred at waveband
    “i,” then the reflectance value was replaced with the average reflectance of the
    surrounding wavebands (Ri−3 to Ri+3). Derivative spectra were computed as the
    slope of the smoothed reflectance spectra using a five-band window centred on
    waveband “i.” 3.4. Hyperspectral indices A number of indices have been developed
    to exploit the narrow waveband properties of hyperspectral reflectance spectra.
    We have highlighted five such indices which have been designed to detect different
    physical and chemical properties that can be related to stress. The Structure-Independent
    Pigment Index (SIPI; Peñuelas, Baret, & Filella, 1995) can be defined as where
    Rx represents the reflectance measurement at x nm. SIPI uses blue and red wavelengths
    to assess the proportion of total photosynthetic pigments to chlorophyll (i.e.,
    carotenoid–chlorophyll ratio). The NIR wavelength is used to account for the structural
    changes that may coincide with pigment changes. Increases in the relative concentration
    of carotenoids have been observed under stress conditions (Young & Britton, 1990).
    Peñuelas, Baret, et al. (1995) and Peñuelas, Gamon, Fredeen, Merino, and Field
    (1994) showed that the ratio of chlorophyll to carotenoids in plants also increased
    during senescence and decreased for healthy plants and therefore SIPI should increase
    in value with stress. The PRI exploits the fact that reflectance at 531 nm has
    been associated with nonradiative dissipation of photon energy via the xanthophyll
    cycle (Gamon et al., 1990). Under excessive light conditions, violaxathin is converted
    rapidly to zeaxanthin via antheraxanthin (Demmig-Adams & Adams, 1996). When light
    limits, this cycle is reversed. These changes result in a detectable reflectance
    signature near 531 nm. PRI was formulated as following Gamon et al. (1992), who
    reported that a reference wavelength of 570 nm may work well under conditions
    of water stress to avoid overlapping spectral features unrelated to the xanthophyll
    signature. PRI is advantageous because it offers a potential means to remotely
    detect RUE in leaves and (more controversially) in canopies Peñuelas et al., 1995,
    Peñuelas et al., 1994. As formulated, PRI decreases with increasing photosynthetic
    efficiency. The water absorption band between 930 and 980 nm can be compared with
    a reference wavelength (900 nm), which does not absorb water resulting in a WBI
    Peñuelas et al., 1993, Peñuelas et al., 1997 where values of WBI increase with
    plant water content. Further research has indicated that the position of the spectral
    water absorption trough is not static but rather shifts during stress conditions
    Peñuelas et al., 1993, Peñuelas et al., 1997, Shibayama et al., 1993 and in response
    to phenology. A floating-position WBI (fWBI) can be defined by the ratio of R900
    and the minima in reflectance between 930 and 980 nm where The normalized difference
    vegetation index (NDVI) is often used as a measure of canopy “greenness.” While
    popular because of its ability to monitor large-scale changes in vegetation, NDVI
    is sensitive to soil optical properties (Rondeaux, Steven, & Baret, 1996). Prior
    to canopy closure, reflectance contamination from the soil can be controlled by
    using various versions of the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI; Huete, 1988).
    The slope and intercept of the soil line can be used to compute the transformed
    SAVI (TSAVI; Baret & Guyot, 1991). Although TSAVI requires site-specific soil
    characteristics, the soil line information can be easily acquired remotely from
    a precropped field image. Here, we used the variation of a narrow-band TSAVI given
    by Rondeaux et al. (1996): where a and b are the slope and intercept of the soil
    line, respectively, as determined by ground-based reflectance spectra at the 100×100
    m grid previously mentioned. The red edge describes the position of the maximum
    slope of reflectance and defines the transition between the red and near infrared
    portions of the spectrum (Horler, Dockray, & Barber, 1983). Reflectance in the
    red is low because of chlorophyll absorption and is high in the NIR because of
    leaf scattering. Thus, the red edge combines two mechanisms by which plant stress
    may be indicated: variations in chlorophyll content, which are associated with
    nutrient levels, and structural changes, which may be associated with other stresses
    such as water availability. Stress has been shown to cause a shift in the red
    edge position to shorter wavelengths Curran et al., 1995, Filella & Peñuelas,
    1994, Hoque & Hutzler, 1992. Demetriades-Shah et al. (1990) suggested that derivatives
    of canopy reflectance may be used to eliminate the contribution from soil background
    reflectance, thus improving the possibility of isolating the ecophysiological
    state of the canopy. Additionally, we examined a number of indices based on the
    first and second derivatives of reflectance (see Table 1). Table 1. Indices used

    for separating out application rates and eventually to identify areas of the canopy
    that are under ecophysiological stress from various sources. It has been used
    successfully at both leaf (Peñuelas et al., 1994) and canopy (Filella, Serrano,
    Serra, & Peñuelas, 1995) levels. Three days were chosen to represent early (July
    7; Day 184), mid (July 23; Day 204), and late (August 27; Day 239) season conditions
    in the corn canopy. The wavelengths and spectral indices selected for further
    investigation were chosen because of their sensitivity to properties such as plant
    structure, water content, chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations, and ecophysiological
    status (Table 1). Canonical discriminant analysis was used with a stepwise procedure
    for variable selection for each day of analysis. Data screening resulted in unequal
    sample sizes between application rates for a given day. Probabilities for classification
    were derived from the sample size for all canonical discriminant analysis. 4.
    Results and discussion 4.1. Detection of environmental and N stresses Destructive
    LAI and SPAD readings indicated that, initially, plants in the 155N application
    rate had faster leaf expansion than their counterparts in the 99N and 17N application
    rate areas. This pattern changed mid-season, and thereafter, the 155N and 99N
    regions displayed similar leaf deployment (Fig. 1a). The 17N region showed lower
    chlorophyll content throughout the season compared with the 99N and 155N (Fig.
    1b and c). This was especially evident from Day 210 onwards when the SPAD readings
    for 17N were up to 20% less than the 99N and 155N. A clearly lower LAI in the
    17N appeared after this point. The short-term observed impact of reduced N was
    a delay in leaf expansion during the early stages (as seen in the 17N and 99N).

    application rate and weather on corn using micrometeorological and hyperspectral
    reflectance measurements (Fig. 4b, p. 92, Copyright (2001)), with permission from
    Elsevier Science. The impact of mid-season transient water stress can be demonstrated
    in the canopy chlorophyll content for each application rate. Up to 51 days after
    sowing (DAS), the canopy chlorophyll content increased with N application rate
    (Fig. 1c). Two weeks later (64 DAS), the chlorophyll content of the 155N is lower
    than that in the 99N area. The measurements at 64 DAS corresponded to a period
    of reduced rainfall within which the larger 155N canopy experienced water stress,
    which slowed leaf expansion relative to the 99N canopy. Eddy covariance measurements
    of canopy evapotranspiration and CO2 flux for the same experimental period indicated
    that the 99N had higher water use efficiency than the 155N during the water stress
    period (Pattey et al., 2001). By 85 DAS, the water stress period had ended and
    the higher N application rate allowed the 155N canopy chlorophyll content to rise
    to a comparable level to that of the 99N application rate. The net effect of the
    mid-season transient water stress is that a period of reduced expansion slowed
    the growth of the higher N corn and resulted in a yield for the 155N corn that
    was similar to that in the 99N area of the field (Pattey et al., 2001). SPAD readings,
    and, therefore, by extension, chlorophyll contents, were found to be best correlated
    with green reflectance at 556 nm (Fig. 2a). A significant relationship between
    SPAD and R556 nm was found across all N application rate areas (Fig. 2b). These
    findings would make the remote estimation of leaf chlorophyll contents at the
    field scale by aircraft possible, although multiple years of data are necessary
    to strengthen these relationships. LAI could be determined by a normalized vegetation
    index (Fig. 2c) enabling the scaling of chlorophyll to the canopy level in the
    absence of direct LAI measurements. This is especially relevant for the early
    vegetative phase for corn when early stress detection is important if remediation
    strategies are to occur. Other vegetation indices such as TSAVI may offer better
    discrimination between green biomass and soil, however, they also saturate at
    fairly low LAI values. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. (a) Correlation

    The time series of SIPI indicates only minimal differences between the N application
    rates (Fig. 3). An initial decrease in SIPI associated with chlorophyll production
    is followed by a generally static pattern, which increases again in late summer
    because of senescence. Late in the season, the 17N application rate showed the
    highest values for SIPI indicating a higher proportion of photosynthetic pigments
    to chlorophyll—an indication of stress (Young & Britton, 1990) or in this case,
    senescence. The corresponding reflectance measurement during the water stress
    period was Day 204 (July 23) where SIPI for the 155N is higher (more stress) than
    the 99N application rate. The 155N and 99N remain similar for the remainder of
    the season. Note that SIPI for the 17N remained higher throughout the summer growth
    season in response to reduced N availability and the induced lower chlorophyll
    content in the leaves of plants within this application rate. The relationship
    between SIPI and the carotenoid–chlorophyll ratio is highly nonlinear and SIPI
    has been shown to have a low sensitivity to changes in the carotenoid–chlorophyll
    ratio at low values of SIPI (Peñuelas, Baret, et al., 1995). SIPI has been shown
    to track the larger changes in phenology associated with initial growth and senescence
    and also been used to separate large differences in N application rates (Filella
    et al., 1995). The small magnitude of the differences between application rates
    indicated in Fig. 3 indicates that SIPI alone may not be of use in discriminating
    transient stress in vegetation or in consistently separating levels of N stress
    rates, especially from an airborne or satellite platform. Download : Download

    Error bars represent 95% CI. With the seasonal course of PRI, it was again difficult
    to discern trends except by the end of the season where 17N was indicating clearly
    more positive values of PRI than 99N and 155N—an indication of reduced photosynthetic
    efficiency and a function of senescence (Fig. 4). A general decline in the value
    of PRI was evident, attributable to the increasing photosynthetic efficiency related
    to canopy growth and development, until senescence where PRI increased rapidly.
    Values of PRI are typically small and therefore measured changes can be confounded
    by such effects as canopy structure and instrument error (Peñuelas & Filella,
    1998). RUE was plotted against PRI for six of the sample days representing periods
    with positive RUE. A negative linear relationship between RUE and PRI was found
    for each application rate (Fig. 5). Recall that in this formulation of PRI, increasing
    photosynthetic efficiency is indicated by decreasing values of PRI. The data points
    representing Day 204 fall in the peak growth period of the season where both CO2
    flux and incident Qp were at their highest levels. As mentioned previously, it
    is during this period that the canopy experienced water stress. These points are
    indicated by the circle on Fig. 5 and were not included in the regression fit.
    Water stress has been previously shown to cause the PRI–efficiency relationship
    to diverge (Gamon et al., 1992). There was more scatter (poorer fit) for the 99N
    than the 155N as would be expected; the reduction in N lead to increased spatial
    variability (Pattey et al., 2001). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4.

    correspond to Day 204 (July 23). Error bars represent 95% CI. Canopy-scale estimates
    of PRI provide a potentially powerful mechanism for assessing canopy photosynthesis
    remotely when used in conjunction with measurements of Qp. Nichol et al. (2000)
    examined the relationship between PRI and RUE for canopy-scale coniferous and
    deciduous boreal tree species using the AVIRIS sensor platform and concluded that
    canopy-scale estimates of RUE were feasible but required more study for application
    at larger scales. Peñuelas, Filella, et al. (1995) reported that the relationship
    between PRI and RUE was not constant across species at the leaf scale. In contrast,
    PRI has been shown to be related to photosynthetic RUE for upper canopy leaves
    across species and nutrient application rates (Gamon, Serrano, & Surfus, 1997).
    In this study, data for the peak radiation and growth period under non-environmentally
    stressed conditions were lacking making generalizations difficult. It is clear
    that several years of data for a given species need to be taken before a relationship
    can be established for field-based crops. Environmental influences during critical
    phases of development will cause the relationship between RUE and PRI to change.
    The influence of soil contribution to the spectra prior to significant biomass
    accumulation cannot be discounted also and is likely the cause of the inconsistent
    results from measurements early in the season. Peñuelas and Inoue (2000) used
    ground-based measurements at 45° to minimize the soil contribution and this technique
    should be explored further. The attractiveness of PRI remains with its ability
    to detect short-term variability in canopy photosynthetic efficiency beyond the
    point where NDVI has saturated (Gamon et al., 1992). Although much work has been
    done on diurnal cycles in PRI (e.g., Gamon et al., 1997), the detection threshold
    for events leading to changes in photosynthetic efficiency needs to be evaluated.
    The fixed-position WBI has been positively correlated with water content (Peñuelas
    et al., 1997) and, therefore, such indices may provide an indication of leaf water
    content (LWC) per unit ground area. Using the destructive harvest data collected
    between June 9 and August 27 and excluding samples collected during the water
    stress period, LWC, and vegetative (leaves and stalks) water content (VWC) were
    expressed as kilograms of water per unit ground area by multiplying by the appropriate
    LAI value for each date and application rate. Both VWC and LWC showed good correlation
    with fWBI and two independent relationships emerged (Fig. 6). VWC, which includes
    the stalk and leaves, had a larger slope when regressed against fWBI. In corn,
    the majority of the plant water is held in the stalk, a fact that has implications
    for the remote sensing of water content. Measured reflectance is primarily from
    the leaves with very little contribution from the vertically oriented stalk which
    presents little area in the nadir view. A linear relationship was found between
    LWC and VWC (LWC=0.20VWC+0.04; r2=.96; n=14). Each of these relationships was
    derived from data across N application rates and throughout phenological stage.
    It would require multiple years of data to test their robustness. Further, these
    relationships were based on averaged data that were close in time (within a couple
    of days), but certainly were not coincident. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 6. Relationship between VWC per unit ground area and LWC per unit ground
    area and the floating WBI. Both fixed and floating versions of WBI demonstrated
    a general increase in value towards peak growth and then a decline through senescence
    (e.g., fWBI in Fig. 7a). For the majority of the season, a gradient in fWBI existed
    with 155N having the largest values, and 17N having the smallest values. Again,
    the 155N canopy seemed to have been affected the most during the water stress
    period as indicated by the smaller fWBI value on Day 204. This change in fWBI
    is likely indicating a change in LWC per unit ground area caused by the transient
    water stress. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. (a) Time series of floating
    WBI by nitrogen application rate and (b) the position of the maximum water trough
    in the region 930–980 nm for 155N. Error bars represent 95% CI. The position of
    the water band minima (Fig. 7b) for the 155N was approximately 950 nm early in
    the season and then shifted to approximately 970 nm during active growth. The
    water band minima shifted towards the blue during the period of water stress as
    the trough shallows and migrates. The minima again blue-shifted at the end of
    the season in response to the drying during senescence. Although the cause of
    stress cannot be uniquely identified using the red edge, by combining information
    with other indices such as fWBI, a picture of the canopy status developed. On
    Day 204, a blue-shift in the 155N application rate could be seen (Fig. 8). N application
    rates could be spectrally separated using the red edge position in early August
    (Day 213) and in the absence of the mid-season water stress, the time series would
    indicate that the red edge position could be useful in separating areas of the
    field receiving different N application rates earlier in the season. If N stress
    is identified early enough, there is the potential for a variable rate application
    strategy to be employed in a split fertilizer management scheme. The red edge
    position could be useful in determining canopy chlorophyll levels (Fig. 8b) using
    LAI to scale the SPAD–chlorophyll relationship mentioned previously. The red edge–SPAD
    regression had a slightly lower standard error of the estimated SPAD readings
    than did the R550–SPAD regression depicted in Fig. 2 (2.4 and 2.7 SPAD units,
    respectively). This results in a difference in standard error between the two
    relationships of 5 mg·m−2 of canopy chlorophyll content at a LAI of 1.0. Download

    were taken on the precropped field following a 100×100 m grid after tillage and
    disking. The soil line was generated from reflectance values at 660 and 865 nm
    (Fig. 9). The resulting slope (1.062) and intercept (0.022) are similar to values
    reported by Rondeaux et al. (1996) for a range of clay and sandy textured soils
    and were used to compute TSAVI. The variation in TSAVI decreased as the fraction
    of canopy cover increased, however, the index saturated out after LAI=1.5 (canopy
    closure of 0.65)—a problem common to all such vegetation indices Carlson & Ripley,
    1997, Rondeaux et al., 1996. Discrimination between N application rates is difficult
    due to this early saturation after Day 184. For a corn canopy, our results showed
    that greenness indices could still be used for comparing leaf expansion during
    the rapid growth phase providing that two airborne images are collected at early
    and late vegetative stages. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. The red–NIR
    soil line for soil-adjusted structural indices. Canonical discriminant analysis
    was used to determine which combinations of hyperspectral reflectance indices
    could correctly classify samples by application rate. For July 3 (Day 184), PRI,
    fWBI, the reflectance of the chlorophyll well region (R680), and the ratio between
    red and blue wavelengths (C420) remained in the model (Table 2) and were able
    to correctly classify 70% of the samples by application rate (Table 3). LWC per
    unit ground area was important (fWBI), as was relative chlorophyll content. R680
    and C420 indicated a sensitivity to pigments. PRI added discriminatory power at
    this early canopy stage. The 17N and 99N application rates were better discriminated
    than was the 155N (65%, 84%, and 34% correctly categorized, respectively). The
    17N and 155N application rates were clearly separated suggesting that the maximum
    imposed N stress had a detectable effect early in the growing season. This is
    of interest in precision agriculture. On this date, the corn was at the sixth
    leaf stage (V6; Ritchie, Hanway, & Benson, 1993) and N could still be applied
    in accordance with plant''s needs. Under such a precision agriculture–variable
    rate application strategy, remotely sensed information would be combined with
    other characteristics of the field (topography, drainage patterns, etc.) in the
    management decision to determine the potential economic benefit to any N application.

    fWBI, R680, and PRI were retained by the stepwise procedure, as were TSAVI, and
    three indices based on spectral derivatives (ddG, GGND, and sumEdge; Table 2).
    Although, on an individual basis, TSAVI has saturated by this date, it may be
    detecting changes in LAI caused by the water stress and therefore provides added
    value to the composite classification. The sumEdge index has been well correlated
    with LAI through the effect of total biomass on the position of the red edge (Filella
    & Peñuelas, 1994). The second derivative in the green (ddG) has been shown to
    be positively correlated with leaf water potential (Peñuelas et al., 1994). ddG
    quite clearly indicated a reduction in value from the 155N and 99N application
    rates for Day 204 and then an increase for the remainder of the season (data not
    shown). This is likely the same water content signature (stressed/nonstressed)
    detected by the other indices. GGND has been shown to be negatively correlated
    with leaf epoxidation state (Peñuelas et al., 1994). The positive correlation
    between chlorophyll level and LWC per unit ground area is likely represented in
    GGND where the proportion of carotenoids to chlorophyll has increased in relation
    to falling LWC per unit ground area and reduced chlorophyll. The combination of
    indices stated above resulted in an overall 88% predictive success rate (Table
    3). The imposed nitrogen stress is well discriminated as there is perfect placement
    of the 17N samples into that category. Although each of the application rates
    is better discriminated on July 23 than on July 3, it is interesting to note that
    the water stress has caused some of the 155N signatures to be mistaken for 17N
    signatures. By August 27 (Day 239), senescence had begun in regions of the field.
    Water was not limiting, however, the canopy was drying due to the change in phenology.
    fWBI and TSAVI were again retained (Table 2). C420 was added and R680 was removed
    suggesting the reduced importance of the chlorophyll well region during senescence.
    The red edge position was added as were ddRE and EGND. The shift in importance
    from green-based derivatives to red-based derivatives may be a function of the
    increased senescence in the crop and a reduction in green pigments. The time series
    of the red edge position (Fig. 8) indicated that in the absence of water stress,
    this index might be a key discriminating variable. ddRE has been shown to be negatively
    correlated with leaf chlorophyll and positively correlated with leaf water potential
    (Peñuelas et al., 1994). EGND has been shown to be positively correlated with
    chlorophyll and nitrogen content at leaf levels (Peñuelas et al., 1994). The overall
    success rate for this period is 93% (Table 3). Note that no samples from the 99N
    or 155N application rates were mistaken for 17N and that no 17N samples were mistaken
    as 155N. Not surprisingly, the greatest misclassification occurs between the 155N
    and 99N application rates where maximum variability occurred. In each case, fixed
    and floating versions of the WBI were used in separate runs of the discriminant
    analysis. The floating WBI consistently provided superior results (in terms of
    classification success rate) to the fixed-position WBI. This is likely due to
    fWBI''s ability to better capture the depth of the water trough. The position
    of the maximum trough shifts with canopy development and with stress (e.g., Fig.
    7b). This feature may make better identification of water-stressed areas of the
    field possible. A floating WBI may also offer better sensitivity to the actual
    canopy water content. This should be explored further. 4.3. Timing of image acquisition
    Moran, Inoue, and Barnes (1997) gave an excellent synthesis of the opportunities
    and limitations for remote sensing in precision agriculture. They indicated that
    a major limitation was the inadequate repeat coverage available from commercial
    systems. Key periods need to be identified and monitored. An image in the early
    vegetative phase, when used in conjunction with soil fertility data, can provide
    information about nutrient-deficient areas of the field in time for remedial action
    to be taken. Under split application fertilizer management, a second application
    of fertilizer is typically applied around the sixth leaf stage (V6) for corn.
    This application is usually a single rate across the field based on presowing
    nutrient status and does not consider the current plant status. Under precision
    agriculture management, this application could be customized to meet the crop''s
    current needs based on the timely analysis of remotely sensed data. This would
    require a rapid turnaround, in the order of days, between acquisition and recommendation.
    More research is needed on the potential economic benefits of this approach. A
    second image taken either towards the end of the vegetative phase or in the reproductive
    phase can be used for yield forecasting and crop insurance applications. By combining
    the two images, information on the relative rates of leaf expansion across the
    field can be determined. The second image would not require as rapid a turnaround
    as crop growth has slowed and translocation of nutrients has begun. These images
    could be of further use to producers in determining any modifications to their
    field management practices for coming seasons. Early in the season, measures of
    either canopy greenness or red edge position would appear to be a simple means
    for estimating chlorophyll content. LAI can be derived from a biomass-sensitive
    vegetation index (such as NDVI) enabling scaling of the chlorophyll estimates
    to the canopy level. The nutrient status of areas of the field is in this way
    related to a measure of leaf elongation. This technique requires validation at
    the field scale with independent samples. Imagery later in the season can be used
    to identify portions of the field affected by environmental stress. In combination
    with field-specific information on soils and topography, the management practices
    within such areas can be adjusted in future years to maximize the efficiency of
    crop production. In our example, the producer would have had little choice but
    to accept the outcome of the combined stresses. If, however, remotely sensed data
    over several years could be used to identify water-sensitive areas of the field,
    a revised management strategy could be employed. A crop growth model could be
    used to track the growth dynamic under different weather scenarios and determine
    which part of the growth is related to weather limitations. In water-sensitive
    areas, less fertilizer would be applied. In good water years, productivity would
    be lower, but this is compensated for lower fertilizer costs in poor years and
    an overall benefit to both the producer and the environment in the longer term.
    5. Summary We have used indices derived from ground-based, canopy-scale hyperspectral
    reflectance data to demonstrate the temporal patterns in corn growth when exposed
    to imposed nitrogen (reduced application rate) and environmental (water availability)
    stresses. In the absence of other limiting factors, growth is a function of the
    availability of N and water. In field corn, there can be a complex interaction
    between these two stresses—each with its own temporal dynamic as highlighted in
    this study. The N stress was imposed by design, and, in the absence of environmental
    stresses, would slowly evolve into separable outcomes by N application rate in
    terms of leaf expansion, LAI, and yield over the course of the season. The evidence
    presented here suggests that a mid-season water stress of short duration overrode
    the effects of the slowly evolving N stress and caused the 155N to mimic the 99N,
    at least temporarily. Following the water stress period, the higher N allowed
    the 155N corn to at least perform at the same level as the 99N corn. In terms
    of remote sensing this complex dynamic, no single index was able to describe the
    status of the corn crop throughout the season. Rather, several hyperspectral reflectance
    signatures and indices were required to assess the evolution of the crop ecophysiology.
    Accurate identification of application rate membership was obtained using canonical
    discriminant analysis at three points in the season (early growth, stressed vegetative,
    senescence). This technique offers a means for reducing the voluminous information
    provided by hyperspectral data sets. A measured reduction in canopy-scale fWBI
    was associated with a period of reduced rainfall and a temporary stress condition
    in the canopy. fWBI was shown to be correlated with area-weighted water content
    for both leaf and vegetative components and provides the opportunity for remote
    detection of the LWC per unit ground area. We have shown that PRI was correlated
    with canopy-scale RUE for field corn but that the relationship could be influenced
    by transient environmental stress conditions. When taken at an appropriate scale
    and timing, hyperspectral reflectance can provide valuable information to the
    agricultural producer to identify stressed regions in order to implement remediation
    strategies or in forecasting yield months prior to harvest. Acknowledgements The

    Get rights and content Highlights • Advances in field phenotyping are needed to
    capitalize on developments in genetics. • We present developments in field phenotyping
    platforms for crop breeding. • Platforms need more focus on environmental monitoring
    and capturing field variability. • Improvements in data management and use will
    spread the adoption of field platforms. Constraints in field phenotyping capability
    limit our ability to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits, particularly
    those related to yield and stress tolerance (e.g., yield potential as well as
    increased drought, heat tolerance, and nutrient efficiency, etc.). The development
    of effective field-based high-throughput phenotyping platforms (HTPPs) remains
    a bottleneck for future breeding advances. However, progress in sensors, aeronautics,
    and high-performance computing are paving the way. Here, we review recent advances
    in field HTPPs, which should combine at an affordable cost, high capacity for
    data recording, scoring and processing, and non-invasive remote sensing methods,
    together with automated environmental data collection. Laboratory analyses of
    key plant parts may complement direct phenotyping under field conditions. Improvements
    in user-friendly data management together with a more powerful interpretation
    of results should increase the use of field HTPPs, therefore increasing the efficiency
    of crop genetic improvement to meet the needs of future generations. Previous

    sensingspatial variabilitystress tolerance Why is phenotyping so important in
    the breeding pipeline? Crop production must double by 2050 to meet the predicted
    production demands of the global population [1]. However, achieving this goal
    will be a significant challenge for plant breeders because crop yields would have
    to increase at a rate of 2.4% per year, yet the average rate of increase is only
    1.3%, with yields stagnating in up to 40% of land under cereal production 2, 3.
    Extensive breeding and agronomic efforts over the past 50 years have been responsible
    for tripling cereal yields [4]. Continuing advances in the techniques available
    to breeders offer the potential to increase the rate of genetic improvement [5].
    Attempts to exploit new molecular tools to their full potential (Figure 1), particularly
    the ability to dissect the genetics of quantitative traits such as yield and stress
    tolerance 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, are limited by our ability to phenotype. However, plant
    breeders and farmers have been making selections based on phenotypes long before
    the discovery of DNA and molecular markers. The development of improved varieties
    relies on the ability to identify the best genetic variation for advancement.
    Breeding is essentially a numbers game: the more crosses and environments used
    for selection, the greater the probability of identifying superior variation.
    Plant breeders want to be able to phenotype large numbers of lines rapidly and
    accurately identify the best progeny. To meet future needs there is a need to
    increase breeding efficiency. Advances in high-throughput genotyping have provided
    fast and inexpensive genomic information. Low cost, high-throughput genotyping
    has paved the way for the development of large mapping populations and diversity
    panels of thousands of recombinant inbred lines for phenotyping [11]. Although
    molecular breeding strategies, such as marker-assisted recurrent selection (MARS)
    and genomic selection, place greater focus on selections based on genotypic information,
    they still require phenotypic data [12]. In genomic selection, phenotypes are
    not used for selection but are used to train a prediction model [13]; whereas
    in MARS, a single phenotyping cycle is used to identify markers for subsequent
    selection through generations. Similarly, phenotyping is necessary to identify
    promising events in transgenic studies 14, 15. Given that molecular breeding populations
    can include up to 5000 lines, the ability to accurately characterize all lines
    simultaneously is challenging [11]. Advances in phenotyping are likely to be essential
    to capitalize on developments in conventional, molecular, and transgenic breeding
    and ensure genetic improvement of crops for future food security. Download : Download

    Redrawn from [20]. High-throughput phenotyping In recent years, there has been
    increased interest in high-throughput phenotyping platforms (HTPPs) 16, 17. Most
    HTPPs, both those run by the big transnational seed companies and the most advanced
    public plant research institutions around the world, such as the Australian Plant
    Phenomics Facility (http://www.plantphenomics.org.au/), the European Plant Phenotyping
    Network (http://www.plant-phenotyping-network.eu/eppn/structure), and the USDA
    (http://www.nifa.usda.gov/nea/plants/pdfs/whitepaper_finalUSDA.pdf), (http://www.wheatgenetics.org/downloads/Projects/HTP_ProjectNarrative_20130219.pdf)
    are fully automated facilities in greenhouses or growth chambers with robotics,
    precise environmental control, and remote sensing techniques to assess plant growth
    and performance. However, low-cost HTPP approaches are now starting to be developed
    [18]. In this review, we examine the need for high-throughput field phenotyping,
    the current technical developments, and the factors that limit its implementation,
    together with the future avenues that will pave the way for its wide adoption
    in practical breeding. Field phenotyping Although HTPPs enable detailed, non-invasive
    information to be captured throughout the plant life cycle in a carefully controlled
    environment, quantitative trait loci and candidate genes identified within controlled
    environments have generally not translated into gains in grain yield in the field
    19, 20, 21. Field conditions are notoriously heterogeneous and the inability to
    control environmental factors makes results difficult to interpret. However, results
    from controlled environments are far removed from the situation plants will experience
    in the field and, therefore, are difficult to extrapolate to the field. The problems
    associated with controlled environments are well established 6, 22, 23 (Figure
    2). For example, the volume of soil available to roots within a pot is considerably
    smaller than in the field, thereby reducing the amount of water and nutrients
    available to plants 24, 25, 26. The soil environment plays a crucial role in plant
    growth and development and is difficult to simulate under controlled conditions
    [27]. Drought stress phenotyping is particularly challenging because declining
    soil moisture content is associated with increased mechanical impedance in the
    field, which is an effect that is difficult to replicate within pots [28]. Moreover
    plants in the field do not growth isolate but configuring a canopy. Varietal improvement
    has heavily relied on multilocation screening within the target environment [29].
    Here, plants experience a range of stresses throughout their life cycle. In many
    cases, the environmental characteristics are not monitored and, hence, are poorly
    understood. This further complicates the ability to mimic the field environment
    under controlled conditions. Phenotyping under field environmental conditions
    remains a bottleneck for future breeding advances 7, 10, 19, 30, 31. Besides the
    above considerations, the choice of phenotyping under controlled conditions versus
    field environments largely depends on the purpose of phenotyping and the heritability
    of the trait, together with the logistical considerations of collecting the data
    [10]. For example, there are no feasible spatial or temporal options for testing
    high atmospheric CO2 in the field [32]. Download : Download full-size image Figure
    2. Continuum of environments for drought-resistance screening. The control over
    environmental factors decreases from the use of growth chambers to the target
    population environment (TPE), whereas the correlation of performance with the
    target commercial environments increases. Rainout shelters are designed to protect
    a selected area of land against receiving precipitation so that an experimentally
    controlled drought stress can be imposed on that area. Redrawn from [24]. Traits
    for phenotyping The most successful traits for evaluation integrate in time (throughout
    the crop cycle) and space (at the canopy level) the performance of the crop in
    terms of capturing resources (e.g., radiation, water, and nutrients) and how efficiently
    these resources are used 19, 33. Different methodological approaches have been
    proposed to evaluate these traits in the field (Figure 1). Using the criteria
    proposed in [20] they can be summarized into three categories: (i) proximal (remote)
    sensing and imaging, (ii) laboratory analyses of samples, and (iii) near-infrared
    reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis in the harvestable part of the crop.
    Besides the choice of the most appropriate traits, it is also crucial to determine
    the key time(s) for their evaluation. Measuring these traits at more or less frequent
    intervals during the crop cycle together with the measurements of the harvestable
    components would be unfeasible (or at least impractical) and may even be negative
    in terms of the impact of the trait for breeding. Proximal (remote) sensing: different
    categories of sensors Remote sensing phenotyping methods are non-destructive,
    non-invasive approaches 20, 34, 35 based mostly on the information provided by
    visible/near-infrared (VIS-NIR) radiation reflected (or transmitted) and far-infrared
    (thermal) radiation emitted by the crop 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. These methods
    are termed proximal in the sense that information is gathered ‘near’ the crop.
    Remote sensing techniques may be deployed in in situ screening for a wide range
    of breeding objectives, including yield potential, adaptation to abiotic (water
    stress, extreme temperatures, salinity) and biotic (susceptibility to pests and
    diseases) limiting conditions, and even quality traits. Many categories of traits
    may be measured under different environmental conditions using remote sensing
    approaches, ranging, for example, from green biomass through to photosynthetic
    transpirative gas exchange and on to quality traits or even to predict grain yield
    [39]. For example, the same authors [39] working with a set of 300 maize testcrosses
    grown under different water and temperature regimes reported that partial least
    square regression (PLSR) models from hyperspectral reflectance of maize explained
    up to 40% of the variation in grain yield in each trial, with a relative efficiency
    of selection of 0.88 and 0.68 using leaf and canopy reflectance, respectively.
    Moreover, strong agreement has been reported between remote sensing and imaging
    values of traits measured by HTPPs at the land and aerial levels, as well as through
    manual phenotyping approaches, with determination values ranging between 0.35
    and 0.82 in the case of cotton under different water regimes [42]. These results
    confirmed the ability of the phenotyping system to measure multiple traits rapidly
    and accurately. Concerning NIRS, it is already routinely used in breeding for
    a wide array of food and feed quality traits [43]. In fact, NIRS can be applied
    to drought or nutrient use efficiency screening, or other more general breeding/gene
    discovery objectives. The implementation in imaging formats of proximal sensing
    with VIS-NIR and far-infrared radiation has enabled the process of taking measurements
    to be upscaled: for example, from measuring a single plot to dissecting an entire
    trial composed of different plots, providing that the image has enough resolution
    (pixels). However, imaging speed is limited by post-processing, which may include
    image alignment, geometric and radiometric calibrations, atmospheric correction,
    automatic mosaicking, and algorithms for automatic image segmentation 44, 45.
    Proximal (remote) sensing and imaging techniques include different approaches.
    The approaches that are most implemented (feasible) for field phenotyping can
    be grouped into three different categories (see Box 1 for images): (i) VIS-NIR
    spectroradiometry (including multispectral and the even less developed hyperspectral
    imaging) [45], (ii) infrared thermometry and thermal imaging, and (iii) conventional
    digital photography (RGB color cameras). The first approach is undergoing rapid
    technical advances associated with the use of high-resolution full-range spectroradiometers
    that reach into the NIR region wavelengths around 2500 nm. This, together with
    the use of special adaptors with their own light source, enables such spectroradiometers
    to be used as field-portable NIRS devices, generating large amounts of data with
    a wide range of potential applications. Examples include the development of empirical
    models to assess specific photosynthetic characteristics related to radiation
    use efficiency [46], or to predict a complex trait such as grain yield [39], and
    the use of single spectroradiometrical indices to predict yield [41]. At the imaging
    level, hyperspectral sensors are being developed along similar lines, although
    it is not possible for them to carry their own light source (specifically for
    large-scale images), thus this may represent a limitation [44]. Nevertheless,
    hyperspectral imagery enables assessment of complex traits, such as canopy photosynthesis
    and fluorescence under natural sunlight conditions 45, 47. There are several software
    programs available to process information to extract phenotype data from images,
    including free options [10]. Box 1 Cameras for crop monitoring Different categories
    of imaging systems for remote sensing evaluation of vegetation are detailed below
    with examples of prototypes capable of being carried by UAPs of limited payload
    (Figure I). Download : Download full-size image Figure I. Examples of false-color
    images taken with different categories of cameras: (A) RGB/CIR, (B) multispectral,
    (C) hypespectral, and (D) thermal imaging. RGB/CIR cameras The combination of
    color infrared (CIR) and red, green, and blue light (called visible or RGB) imagery
    enables the estimation of green biomass (NDVI type of information). Miniaturization
    is advancing fast with cameras that weigh only 100 g and have spectral range bands
    in red, green, and NIR. Figure IA shows an image taken with a multispectral mono
    lens camera (ADC Lite) of three bands. Multispectral cameras Multispectral imagers
    are widely used for crop monitoring via remote sensing. They can acquire a limited
    number of spectral bands at once in the VIS-NIR regions. Besides vegetation indices
    for evaluating green biomass, multispectral imagers can be formulated to other
    different spectral indices targeting senescence evaluation, nutrient status, pigment
    degradation, photosynthetic efficiency, or water content [84]. Figure IB shows
    an image taken with a multispectral camera (miniMCA-6) of six lens. Hyperspectral
    visible and near-infrared imager The hyperspectral visible and near-infrared imager
    enables the acquisition of hundreds of images at once, covering the entire electromagnetic
    spectrum between the visible and the near-infrared regions in a continuous mode
    (wavelengths ranging from 400 to 900 nm). Other configurations cover the range
    from 1000 to 2500 nm. Therefore, it is possible to run empirical calibrations
    (like in a ‘NIRS mode’) against a wide and miscellaneous set of traits. Figure
    IC shows an image taken with a hyperspectral (Microhyperspec VNIR) camera. Long-wave
    infrared cameras or thermal imaging cameras Long-wave infrared cameras and thermal
    imaging cameras render infrared radiation in the range of μm as visible light.
    Potential use of thermal imaging in phenotyping includes predicting water stress
    in crops, disease, and pathogen detection in plants, evaluating the maturing of
    fruits and bruise detection in fruits and vegetables 50, 37, 85, 38. The low resolution
    of the imaging (current cameras are in the range of 640 × 500 pixels) may limit
    the use of such cameras from aerial platforms. Thermal images obtained from a
    UAP using this type of camera have a resolution in the range of 20–40 cm [41].
    Figure ID shows an image taken with a thermal (MIDAS) camera. For more information
    about imaging sensors, visit http://quantalab.ias.csic.es/pdf/. Conventional digital
    cameras (NDVI type work) Conventional digital cameras are low-cost instruments
    that enable, for example, plant cover (green biomass) or senescence to be estimated.
    Moreover, the software needed is usually freely available. A general limitation
    of spectroradiometrical approaches lies in the differences in plant architecture
    and developmental stage, together with the anisotropic characteristics of the
    leaf (mostly due to the leaf surface: roughness, trichomes, epicuticular waxes).
    These may negatively affect the estimation of traits (mostly of biochemical traits)
    by spectroradiometrical approaches [10]. The effect of leaf anisotropy is more
    evident in the remote sensing-based approaches that use reflected instead of transmitted
    radiation, which is the situation in the majority of systems. Moreover, care should
    be taken, for example, to standardize measures with plants at similar developmental
    stages and exhibiting a narrow range of variability in plant architecture, whereas
    sun elevation should also be taken into consideration because the majority of
    spectroradiometrical evaluations in the field use passive sensors. In the case
    of canopy temperature, variation in development and canopy architecture must be
    taken into account (e.g., plant height, soil covering, emerged spikes, leaf angle
    and size) when interpreting performance and selecting cooler breeding lines 48,
    49. This is in addition to the environmental variability (e.g., in light intensity,
    temperature, relative humidity, wind speed) and timing of measurements, which
    affects the accuracy of thermal measurements [50]. Digital photography is also
    a promising approach given the low cost of the sensor (i.e., a conventional camera)
    and access to free software for data processing that enables estimation of green
    biomass, soil cover, plant color 51, 52, or even agronomical components such as
    plant or inflorescence density. Moreover, alongside these approaches, other techniques
    are starting to be adopted for field phenotyping, such as the use of laser imaging
    detection and ranging (Lidar). This is an active remote sensing technique that
    uses Lidar sensors to directly measure the 3D distribution of plant canopies as
    well as subcanopy topography, thus providing high-resolution topographic maps
    and highly accurate estimates of vegetation height, cover, and canopy structure
    53, 54, 55. Furthermore, laser scanning and fluorescence enables evaluation of
    photosynthetic performance and has potential in areas such as plant pathology
    [56]. Field-based high-throughput phenotyping platforms By combining advances
    in remote sensing, aeronautics and high-performance, computing is paving the way
    for the development of field-based HTPPs. Recently, several platforms have been
    developed, ranging from ground-based to aerial systems (e.g., the Australian Plant
    Phenomics Facility, http://www.plantphenomics.org/hrppc/capabilities/technology).
    Ground-based HTPPs include modified vehicles equipped with a global positioning
    system (GPS) navigation device and sensors often referred to as ‘phenomobiles’.
    Different ‘phenomobiles’ have been developed within the past few years 20, 42,
    57, 58, 59, 60 (http://www.plant-phenotyping-network.eu/eppn/inra_diaphen). For
    example, in the case of cotton a system has been developed that carries four sets
    of sensors to measure canopy height, reflectance, and temperature simultaneously
    on four adjacent rows, enabling the collection of phenotypic data at a rate of
    0.84 ha h−1 [42]. The mounting of sensors (such as NIRS) on agricultural harvesters
    may also be included within the category of ‘phenomobiles’ 61, 62. Ground-based
    HTPPs enable data to be captured at the plot level and require little post-processing.
    However, this also limits the scale at which ground-based HTPPs can be used. Furthermore,
    simultaneous measurements of all plots within a trial are not possible with ground-based
    platforms.Aerial platforms are increasingly being considered as an alternative
    option to overcome limitations associated with ground-based HTPPs. Aerial HTPPs
    enable the rapid characterization of many plots within minutes. Initial aerial
    HTPPs used small airplanes (e.g., crop-dusting airplanes); however, this is costly
    and it is difficult to safely achieve the low speeds required for high-definition
    images at low altitude. The current generation of aerial HTPPs significantly varies
    in payload, initial costs, maintenance costs, and control. Recently developed
    alternatives include ‘phenotowers’ [63] and blimps [64]. However, this type of
    aerial HTPP has a maximum height of 50 m. Blimps are helium-filled balloons that
    can be held in a stationary position and have sensors mounted underneath. They
    can carry a heavy payload (several kilograms), enabling many sensors to be used
    concurrently; however, they require many people for control and considerable room
    for storage when inflated. Alternatives to blimps are unmanned aerial platforms
    (UAPs) such as polycopters (e.g., Ascending Technologies: http://www.asctec.de;
    MikroKopter: http://www.mikrokopter.de) and airplanes (see ‘Innovative agricultural
    technologies for sustainable intensification’ at the MAIZE Annual Report of the
    CGIAR Research Program: http://repository.cimmyt.org/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10883/3209/98018.pdf?sequence=1).
    Although the payload of UAPs is lower than blimps, they can generally carry up
    to 2 kg, enabling at least two sensors to be mounted for simultaneous image capture.
    UAPs enable greater flight control and autonomy and are becoming increasingly
    affordable. Unlike airplanes, polycopters can be maneuvered into a stationary
    position; however, advances in aeronautics and sensors now enable high-quality
    images to be obtained from unmanned airplanes. Furthermore, the autonomy and area
    covered by airplanes is larger and the risk of destruction by crashing lower than
    for polycopters. Most UAPs carry an RGB/CIR camera, together with a thermal-imaging
    sensor [and sometimes a conventional color (RGB) digital camera]. Replacing the
    RGB/CIR camera with a multispectral or hyperspectral imaging sensor increases
    the payload but opens up a huge range of new possibilities (Box 1). The software
    requirements for UAPs include programs to: (i) plan flight missions, (ii) gather
    the images, and (iii) extract the data for plots within the images. UAPs are controlled
    by an autopilot for autonomous flying; the ground control station and the UAP
    are radio linked, transmitting position, altitude, and status. The imager is operated
    from the ground station. Laboratory and NIRS analyses In addition to proximal
    sensing approaches, the analysis of plant samples, for example, the analysis of
    stable isotopes [65], may complement direct phenotyping under field conditions.
    When breeding for yield potential and adaption to abiotic stresses such as drought,
    carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) in dry matter is a promising tool that frequently
    exhibits high heritability and genetic correlation with yield 66, 67, 68, and
    has already been applied to breeding programs [69]. The use of grain Δ13C relies
    on a good understanding of tested populations and assumes no confounding of genotypic
    differences in phenology, anthesis biomass, pre-anthesis water use, and remobilization
    of stem carbohydrates 19, 66, 69. Whereas Δ13C is still an expensive tool for
    use in large-scale phenotyping, there are low cost surrogates (see next paragraph).
    In addition, if analyzed through the regular (mass spectrometry) technique, Δ13C
    can still be used on just the tails to complement HTPP approaches. Other traits
    that may be deployed as indicators of transpiration and, hence, of water use are
    the total minerals accumulated in transpiring organs [70]. NIRS is regularly deployed
    not only at the laboratory level but also in harvesting machinery to analyze grain
    characteristics. When used in harvesting machinery, this technique secures a broad
    distribution of measurements within plots and covers substantially larger amounts
    of plot material than analyses at the laboratory level using conventional sample-based
    methods 61, 62. In any case, the near-infrared spectrum captures physical and
    chemical characteristics of the samples, either of vegetative plant tissues or
    harvested seeds. By using calibration models, several traits can be determined
    on the basis of a single spectrum. Thus, NIRS is regularly used to analyze, for
    example, the protein, nitrogen, starch and oil content, grain texture, and grain
    weight of (intact) seeds 20, 61, 62, 71. However, the same spectrum may be used
    to develop prediction models for analyzing traits of potential interest for phenotyping
    for stress adaptation, such as Δ13C, mineral content, or the composition of other
    stable isotopes 34, 72, 73. Although the precision of these indirect estimations
    may be lower than those of direct analysis, the rapid, low-cost, and non-destructive
    nature of NIRS may justify its use, at least in the early generations of a breeding
    program, as a first screening approach when thousands of genotypes need to be
    evaluated. Although considerable advances have been made for evaluating the aerial
    parts of plants, roots are still hidden in terms of phenotyping, despite their
    importance in capturing resources for the crop. A broad overview of the different
    approaches proposed for root phenotyping under field conditions is set out in
    Box 2. Box 2 Phenotyping roots Roots are notoriously difficult to phenotype in
    the field 26, 86. Besides technical considerations, screening under field conditions
    is limited by significant soil environment–genotype interactions [87]. Traditional
    studies have focused on excavation techniques, from which root depth and root
    length density can be determined. Trenching is labor intensive and slow. Recently,
    the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO)
    implemented a high-throughput soil-sampling system to evaluate the maximum root
    depth and distribution [86]. This system uses a hydraulic push press: 2–5 min
    per core and 200 cores (200 cm long) per day. The system is being used to assess
    the impact of root architecture traits on water uptake. To that end, continuous
    logging of soil water content (gypsum blocks) and canopy temperature is combined
    with root architecture. Another approach that has been proposed for use in graminaceous
    crops and that is less intensive in terms of the resources deployed is ‘shovelomics’
    [88]. Values for root architectural traits are derived from the visual scoring
    of roots, which includes in the case of maize (Zea mays), numbers, angles, and
    branching patterns of crown and brace roots. Several non-invasive (i.e., indirect)
    techniques have been proposed. These include, for example, electrical capacitance
    [89]. At the level of root imaging, ground-penetrating radar has been explored,
    but resolution limitations mean that it is still likely to be restricted to trees
    and woody plants 86, 90. The use of electrical resistance tomography, even if
    still mostly at the container level [91], is perhaps more promising for mapping
    soil moisture and root biomass in herbaceous crops in the field [92]. Other techniques
    such as magnetic resonance imaging are still restricted to use at the container
    level [63]. Root biomass and performance can also be assessed (indirectly) through
    the evaluation of shoot proxy traits. This is the case for the natural abundances
    of stable oxygen and deuterium isotopes in shoot water [93]. The increasing availability
    of laser analyzers is making such determination faster and less expensive than
    conventional mass spectrometry. Canopy temperature has been used for remote sensing
    of wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines with deeper roots [94]. In the same way, Δ13C
    in dry matter may also be a valuable indicator of differences in access to water
    by mature root systems 95, 96s. Shoot biomass may also be considered as an indirect
    indicator of root biomass and performance 86, 96. However, problems of reliance
    on indirect measures of root growth may be encountered under field conditions
    60, 86. More than traits and tools: spatial variability and environmental monitoring
    Earlier HTPP initiatives have largely focused on phenotyping and little emphasis
    has been placed on environmental monitoring and reducing error variances. The
    phenotyping environment plays a vital role in the quality of phenotypic data generated
    through experiments and, consequently, in the efficiency of breeding. Field variation
    increases error variances, thereby masking important genetic variation for key
    traits and reducing repeatability, regardless of the cost and precision of a phenotyping
    platform [74]. Spatial variation can be caused by several factors, including the
    soil, which is inherently heterogeneous even in relatively uniform experimental
    sites. HTTPs allow a larger number of genotypes to be phenotyped, thereby increasing
    the likelihood of soil variability masking genetic effects. In general, as the
    land requirement of an experiment increases the harder it becomes to find an area
    with minimum soil heterogeneity. Information on field variability can be incorporated
    into field designs by avoiding areas of high spatial variation [75]. The basic
    concept is to create homogeneous blocks in which the ‘noise’ factors are held
    constant, whereas the factor of interest (‘signal’) is allowed to vary. Earlier
    measurements of field variation relied on direct (i.e., destructive soil sampling)
    and subsequent laboratory analysis. However, advances in proximal and remote sensing
    technologies enable high-resolution mapping of spatial variability [76] (Figure
    1). Proximal sensors include cone penetrometers, which can be used to measure
    soil mechanical impedance and depth. However, measurements are time consuming
    and, therefore, soil penetrometers are of limited use for obtaining the necessary
    detail required to create field maps over large areas [28]. Apparent soil electrical
    conductivity is closely related to clay, water, and ionic content and electromagnetic
    surveys can be used to determine field gradients in soil texture 30, 60. Crop
    performance provides the best indicator of field variability. Imaging techniques
    in parallel with wireless sensor networks and geographical information systems
    will allow a more precise mapping and monitoring of, for example, spatial variability
    [77]. For example, aerial HTPPs that enable fast non-destructive GPS-linked measurements
    of biomass using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can be used
    to measure field variability either on a single variety planted in the off-season
    to develop subsequent planting maps or within experiments to build up performance
    maps to guide planting of the next season. Compared with proximal sensors of field
    variability (Figure 1), aerial HTPPs allow the rapid characterization of experimental
    blocks (less than 30 min for 1 ha plus data processing). Environmental variability
    inconsistently affects phenotypic observation over both space and time and must
    be accounted for in any statistical models that are used to estimate parameters
    of interest [10]. Spatial modeling is a key requirement because of the size of
    the trials, the time taken to collate traits, and the use of high-throughput phenotyping
    approaches. In that context, multitrait mixed modeling looks promising for the
    analysis of traits collected by aerial remote sensing platforms where multiple
    traits derived from the same procedure may produce correlated errors [26]. Linear
    models have long been the mainstay of quantitative genetic experiments and are
    the most commonly applied statistical approach to understanding phenotypic variation.
    However, they have inherent limitations when measurements are not adequately replicated
    and not normally distributed. In this regard, alternatives such as the Bayesian
    inference may overcome the limitations imposed by a maximum-likelihood approach
    [10]. In HTPPs, the implementation of environmental characterization is essential
    to facilitate data interpretation, meta-data analysis, and, in the case of drought
    phenotyping, understanding patterns of water availability [74]. Weather data are
    frequently sourced from nearby weather stations at the end of experiments; however,
    soil moisture is often not measured [75]. The need for environmental data is particularly
    pertinent in drought screening where knowledge of soil moisture availability is
    necessary to ensure that the field environment and the type of drought imposed
    are representative of the target environment [56]. Real-time information on soil
    moisture can be used to facilitate irrigation decisions, which is becoming increasingly
    important with increased climatic variability in the off-season when managed drought
    phenotyping is often conducted. The development of wireless sensor networks to
    characterize both climatic and soil moisture conditions should enable real-time
    monitoring of environmental conditions (Figure 3). Download : Download full-size
    image Figure 3. Summary of the different components of the breeding process where
    high-throughput phenotyping is involved. These include evaluation of key traits
    at the right moment, assessment of spatial variability, environmental characterization,
    and further integration of all the information. A better understanding of the
    stresses prevailing under the target conditions is still needed [78]. Managed
    Environment Facilities are becoming more important as they permit selection under
    controlled stress [60]. Controlling environmental conditions increases the accuracy
    of performance measurements and the attribution of phenotypic effects to individual
    traits and the underlying genetic makeup [79]. Field phenotyping bottleneck HTPPs
    have benefitted in recent years from the rapid progress that has been made in
    the development of a wide array of technologies including novel sensors, image
    analysis and modeling, robotics, and remote control and data mining. Previously,
    time was the largest limitation to phenotyping, but HTPPs now allow plot-level
    measurements within seconds. However, the bottleneck that may slow down the full
    implementation of these platforms is the management of the huge amount of information
    generated 10, 50. Two of the main limiting factors that need to be improved are:
    data management and use of bioinformatics to mine the volumes of phenotypic data,
    and the way in which modeling is used to incorporate genotypic, phenotypic, environmental,
    and management data 48, 80. Advanced analysis tools are required beyond even the
    usual statistical tools [20]. We do not even have a physical concept of what some
    of the numbers obtained by HTPPs mean in terms of plant or crop performance [10].
    Much of the data are just mathematical transformations of numbers, but perhaps
    some linear combination of them will, for reasons we do not yet understand, have
    some correlation with important traits such as leaf angle and planting density
    [21]. However, in the case of information generated through hyperspectral sensors,
    the generation of a set of indices, even of a miscellaneous nature, does not enable
    full advantage to be taken of the hundreds of wavelengths measured. In this regard,
    the ‘NIRS approach’, although it represents construction of a purely empirical
    model, might use the most relevant information regardless of whether it has a
    clear physiological meaning or not [7]. Moreover, such an approach might share
    with genomic selection the possibility of training a model by adding new sets
    of data periodically. Pyramiding all levels of information (different categories
    of traits measured at different times, spatial variability, environmental information)
    in a coherent manner requires the setting down of a strong modeling foundation
    based on a wide but deep understanding of the ecophysiological and genetic factors
    determining crop performance. Above all, more user-friendly post-processing of
    the raw data generated is needed. Improved software tools to optimize automation
    and speed up robust data analysis should support such a trend [81]. Concluding
    remarks and future perspectives The capacity for undertaking precision phenotyping,
    particularly under repeatable and representative growing conditions in the field,
    is lagging far behind the capacity to generate genomic information. This is constraining
    breeding advances. Developments (e.g., sensors, platforms, and analytical capability)
    in HTPPs have enabled these measurements to be made in situ; however, the integration
    of data is lagging behind. Field phenotyping of the appropriate traits, using
    low cost, easy-to-handle tools, should become an integral and key component in
    the breeding pipeline. Using technological advances with regard to phenotyping
    instrumentation should also go hand-in-hand with methods to characterize and control
    field site variation (for improving repeatability), adopting appropriate experimental
    designs, selection of the right traits, and, finally, proper integration of heterogeneous
    datasets, analysis, and application, including prediction models 8, 19, 21, 82,
    83. Efficient integration of all the components of the system is needed to pave
    the way for the adoption of field HTPPs in the near future. This includes more
    user-friendly data management combined with data gathering and processing. Acknowledgments

    Get rights and content Precision agriculture dates back to the middle of the 1980''s.
    Remote sensing applications in precision agriculture began with sensors for soil
    organic matter, and have quickly diversified to include satellite, aerial, and
    hand held or tractor mounted sensors. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation
    initially focused on a few key visible or near infrared bands. Today, electromagnetic
    wavelengths in use range from the ultraviolet to microwave portions of the spectrum,
    enabling advanced applications such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), fluorescence
    spectroscopy, and thermal spectroscopy, along with more traditional applications
    in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum. Spectral bandwidth
    has decreased dramatically with the advent of hyperspectral remote sensing, allowing
    improved analysis of specific compounds, molecular interactions, crop stress,
    and crop biophysical or biochemical characteristics. A variety of spectral indices
    now exist for various precision agriculture applications, rather than a focus
    on only normalised difference vegetation indices. Spatial resolution of aerial
    and satellite remote sensing imagery has improved from 100''s of m to sub-metre
    accuracy, allowing evaluation of soil and crop properties at fine spatial resolution
    at the expense of increased data storage and processing requirements. Temporal
    frequency of remote sensing imagery has also improved dramatically. At present
    there is considerable interest in collecting remote sensing data at multiple times
    in order to conduct near real time soil, crop and pest management. Highlights
    ► Rapid advances in remote sensing for precision agriculture have occurred. ►
    Satellite imagery has improved in spatial resolution, return visit frequency and
    spectral resolution. ► Aerial hyperspectral imagery has revolutionized precision
    agriculture. ► Ground based sensors have been developed for on-the-go monitoring
    of crop and soil characteristics. ► The future challenge is to develop approaches
    that provide customized management for individual plants. Previous article in

    Precision agriculture is one of the top ten revolutions in agriculture (Crookston,
    2006), although it has only been practiced commercially since the 1990''s. Over
    one-third of US Midwestern farmers already practice some form of precision agriculture.
    Precision agriculture generally involves better management of farm inputs such
    as fertilisers, herbicides, seed, fuel (used during tillage, planting, spraying,
    etc.) by doing the right management practice at the right place and the right
    time. Whereas large farm fields under conventional management receive uniform
    applications of fertilisers, irrigation, seed, etc., with precision agriculture,
    these fields can be divided into management zones that each receives customised
    management inputs based on varying soil types, landscape position, and management
    history. Precision agriculture offers to improve crop productivity and farm profitability
    through improved management of farm inputs (Larson & Robert, 1991; Zhang, Wang,
    & Wang, 2002), leading to better environmental quality (Mulla, 1993; Mulla et
    al., 2002; Mulla, Perillo, & Cogger, 1996; Tian, 2002). Other benefits perceived
    by farmers include more precise hybrid selection, rental agreements that are better
    aligned with actual soil productivity, better matching of fertiliser applications
    to crop yield potential, lower chemical bills and fuel costs, and reduced compaction.
    Benefits to society include creation of high technology jobs (computer hardware,
    computer software, machinery guidance, soil and crop sensors, information management,
    decision support systems), and mitigation of environmental pollution arising from
    over-application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertiliser. Precision agriculture
    uses intensive data and information collection and processing in time and space
    to make more efficient use of farm inputs, leading to improved crop production
    and environmental quality (Harmon et al., 2005). Precision agriculture is beginning
    to emphasise spatial-temporal data analysis and management rather than spatial
    data analysis and management alone (Mamo, Malzer, Mulla, Huggins, & Strock, 2003;
    Miao, Mulla, Randall, Vetsch, & Vintila, 2009; Varvel, Wilhelm, Shanahan, & Schepers,
    2007). Crop yield and response to N fertiliser varies significantly across years
    in response to changes in climate (Bakhsh, Jaynes, Colvin, & Kanwar, 2000), just
    as it varies significantly across the landscape in response to variations in soil
    type and landscape features. Precision agriculture involves both data collection/analysis
    and information management, as well as technological advances in computer processing,
    field positioning, yield monitoring, remote sensing, and sensor design (Mulla
    & Schepers, 1997). More than 30% of the growth in US agribusiness (jobs, sales,
    exports, etc.) in the future is expected to come from further adoption of precision
    agriculture by farmers (Whipker & Akridge, 2006), including growth in demand for
    both information management services and technological advances such as global
    positioning system (GPS) autosteer guidance (e.g. Real Time Kinetic technology),
    variable rate irrigation, fertiliser and sprayer controllers, robotics, and real
    time decision making based on sensor networks and remote sensing. Adoption rates
    are also significant in Australia, Japan, Canada and Europe, specifically in Germany,
    Sweden, France, Spain, Denmark and the UK. Globally, there is little documented
    information about rates of adoption for precision agriculture in the developing
    world. Mondal and Basu (2009) state that countries such as Argentina, Brazil,
    China, India and Malaysia have begun to adopt precision agriculture. Precision
    agriculture is also widely used in the vineyards of Chile. The farms of the future
    are likely to be managed with much greater spatial and temporal resolution than
    they are with present approaches to precision agriculture. In Chilean vineyards,
    each grape vine receives an individually customised fertiliser prescription that
    varies with soil type, landscape position and hybrid. It is not unrealistic to
    expect that crops on modern US farms of the future will be managed plant-by-plant,
    a huge advance over farming by soil approaches of the past. This approach will
    require massive data collection and analysis on a scale not considered feasible
    today, involving stationary or mobile sensors that can measure characteristics
    of individual plants in real time. Sensors of the future could be based on satellites
    (Bausch & Khosla, 2010), airplanes (Goel et al., 2003; Haboudane, Miller, Pattey,
    Zarco-Tejada, & Strachan, 2004; Haboudane, Miller, Tremblay, Zarco-Tejada, & Dextraze,
    2002; Miao, Mulla, Randall, Vetsch, & Vintila, 2007), unmanned aerial vehicles
    (Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Suárez, & Fereres, 2009; Herwitz et al., 2004), tractors
    (Adamchuk, Hummel, Morgan, & Upadhyaya, 2004; Long, Engel, & Siemens, 2008), or
    attached to mobile robots (Astrand & Baerveldt, 2002) to record weed densities,
    crop height, leaf reflectance, moisture status and other properties important
    for decisions about fertilizer and pest management. These sensors must be robust,
    run on renewable energy sources, and be able to relay information using wireless
    networks (O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010; Wang, Zhang, & Wang, 2006) to computers
    that can perform data mining procedures and make complex management recommendations.
    These recommendations can be transmitted to computers and controllers in the field
    that are capable of varying the rates of irrigation, fertilisers, and herbicides
    at fine spatial resolution, if not plant-by-plant. 2. Remote sensing applications
    in agriculture Remote sensing applications in agriculture are based on the interaction
    of electromagnetic radiation with soil or plant material. Typically, remote sensing
    involves the measurement of reflected radiation, rather than transmitted or absorbed
    radiation. Remote sensing refers to non-contact measurements of radiation reflected
    or emitted from agricultural fields. The platforms for making these measurements
    include satellites, aircraft, tractors and hand-held sensors. Measurements made
    with tractors and hand-held sensors are also known as proximal sensing, especially
    if they do not involve measurements of reflected radiation. In addition to reflectance,
    transmittance and absorption, plant leaves can emit energy by fluorescence (Apostol
    et al., 2003) or thermal emission (Cohen, Alchanatis, Meron, Saranga, & Tsipris,
    2005). Thermal remote sensing for water stress in crops is based on emission of
    radiation in response to temperature of the leaf and canopy, which varies with
    air temperature and the rate of evapotranspiration. The amount of radiation reflected
    from plants is inversely related to radiation absorbed by plant pigments, and
    varies with the wavelength of incident radiation. Plant pigments such as chlorophyll
    absorb radiation strongly in the visible spectrum from 400 to 700 nm (Pinter et
    al., 2003), particularly at wavelengths such as 430 (blue or B) and 660 (red or
    R) nm for chlorophyll a and 450 (B) and 650 (R) nm for chlorophyll b. Other plant
    pigments such as anthocyanins and carotenoids are also important (Blackburn, 2007).
    In contrast, plant reflectance is high in the near infrared (NIR 700–1300 nm)
    region as a result of leaf density and canopy structure effects. This sharp contrast
    in reflectance behaviour between the red and NIR portions of the spectrum is the
    motivation for development of spectral indices that are based on ratios of reflectance
    values in the visible and NIR regions (Sripada, Heiniger, White, & Weisz, 2006).
    These spectral indices are often used to assess various attributes of plant canopies,
    such as leaf area index (LAI), biomass, chlorophyll content or N content. The
    amount of radiation reflected by bare soils is affected primarily by soil moisture
    and organic matter content, but also by clay minerals and calcium carbonate or
    iron oxides (Thomasson, Sui, Cox, & Al–Rajehy, 2001; Viscarra Rossel, Walvoort,
    McBratney, Janik, & Skjemstad, 2006). Each soil constituent has a specific spectral
    region where reflectance is strongest (Ben-Dor, 2010), and a specific spectral
    signature. Bare soil and crop canopies are often both present in a remotely sensed
    image, and the mixture of two spectral signatures often confounds the interpretation
    of reflectance data (Fig. 1). Spectral unmixing algorithms (Huete & Escadafal,
    1991), derivative spectra (Demetriades-Shah, Steven, & Clark, 1990) or spectral
    indices that adjust for soil effects (Haboudane et al., 2002, 2004) are often
    used to isolate information about plant characteristics when the reflectance is
    affected by both sources. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Reflectance
    signatures of dry or wet soil in comparison to reflectance signatures of a Russet
    Burbank potato canopy with low or high rates of N fertiliser application. Remote
    sensing applications in agriculture are typically classified according to the
    type of platform for the sensor, including satellite, aerial, and ground based
    platforms. These platforms and their associated imaging systems can be differentiated
    based on the altitude of the platform, the spatial resolution of the image, and
    the minimum return frequency for sequential imaging. Spatial resolution affects
    the area of the smallest pixel that can be identified. As spatial resolution improves,
    the area of the smallest pixel decreases, and the homogeneity of soil or crop
    characteristics within that pixel increases. Poor spatial resolution implies large
    pixels with increased heterogeneity in soil or plant characteristics. Return frequency
    is important for assessment of temporal patterns in soil or plant characteristics.
    The availability of remote sensing images from satellite and aerial platforms
    is often severely limited by cloud cover (Moran, Inoue, & Barnes, 1997), whereas
    ground based remote sensing is less affected by this limitation. Remote sensing
    applications in agriculture have focused on a wide range of endeavours (Adamchuk
    et al., 2004; Moran et al., 1997; Pinter et al., 2003). These include crop yield
    and biomass (Shanahan et al., 2001; Yang, Everitt, Bradford, & Escobar, 2000),
    crop nutrient and water stress (Bastiaanssen, Molden, & Makin, 2000; Clay, Kim,
    Chang, Clay, & Dalsted, 2006; Cohen et al., 2005; Moller et al., 2007; Tilling
    et al., 2007), infestations of weeds (Lamb & Brown, 2001; Thorp & Tian, 2004),
    insects and plant diseases (Seelan, Laguette, Casady, & Seielstad, 2003), and
    soil properties such as organic matter, moisture and clay content, and pH (Christy,
    2008), or salinity (Corwin & Lesch, 2003). 2.1. Soil sensing in precision agriculture
    Precision agriculture started during the mid 1980''s with two contrasting philosophies.
    The first was exemplified by the “farming by soil” school (Larson & Robert, 1991).
    This school promoted the use of soil sampling and customised management of farm
    inputs by soil mapping unit. The second was exemplified by the “Soil Sampling
    Management Zone” school (Mulla, 1991, 1993; Mulla & Bhatti, 1997; Mulla, Bhatti,
    Hammond, & Benson, 1992), which later became known as “site-specific crop management”.
    Management zones are relatively homogeneous sub-units of farm fields that can
    each be managed with a different, but uniform customised management practice.
    This school became very popular when field comparisons of uniform versus variable
    fertiliser applications showed that there was considerable variability at scales
    finer than soil mapping units (Mulla et al., 1992). Bhatti, Mulla, and Frazier
    (1991) were the first to demonstrate that Landsat remote sensing had significant
    capabilities for estimating spatial patterns in soil organic matter, soil phosphorus
    and crop yield potential for use in precision agriculture applications. A third
    approach to precision agriculture began to emerge in the early 1990''s (Hummel,
    Gaultney, & Sudduth, 1996), known as proximal soil sensing. This approach was
    based on continuous real-time sensing of spatial variations in soil properties
    using sensors mounted on tractors. The first application of this approach was
    for soil organic matter sensing (Shonk, Gaultney, Schulze, & Van Scoyoc, 1991)
    based on reflectance from multiple light emitting diode (LED) sensors emitting
    radiation at 660 nm. The sensor was very accurate if calibrated for individual
    soil catenas, but was affected by variations in soil moisture. Sudduth and Hummel
    (1993) developed a portable NIR sensor which could simultaneously be used to estimate
    soil organic matter content and soil moisture content. Other related technology
    was developed by Christy (2008), allowing simultaneous measurements of soil organic
    matter content, soil moisture, soil pH, soil carbon and soil phosphorus, potassium,
    and calcium. A major breakthrough in precision agriculture occurred when Carter,
    Rhoades, and Chesson (1993) introduced continuous real-time, non-contact proximal
    sensing of soil apparent electrical conductivity using non-invasive electromagnetic
    induction with the Geonics EM-38 (Geonics Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).
    Soil electrical conductivity measurements with the EM-38 have been used to map
    spatial patterns in soil salinity (Corwin & Lesch, 2003), soil clay content (Doolittle,
    Sudduth, Kitchen, & lndorante, 1994) and soil moisture content (Sudduth et al.,
    2005). These patterns are often used to define management zones. 2.2. Satellite
    remote sensing Satellites have been used for remote sensing imagery in agriculture
    (Table 1) since the early 1970''s (Bauer & Cipra, 1973; Doraiswamy, Moulin, Cook,
    & Stern, 2003; Jewel, 1989) when Landsat 1 (originally known as Earth Resources
    Technology Satellite 1) was launched in 1972. Multispectral Scanner System (MSS)
    sensors on Landsat 1 collected imagery in the green, red and two infrared bands
    at a spatial resolution of 80 m and a return frequency of 18 days. Landsat 1 was
    initially used by Bauer and Cipra (1973) to classify Midwestern US agricultural
    landscapes into maize or soybean fields with an overall accuracy of 83%. Landsat
    5 was launched in 1984 and collected Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery at a spatial
    resolution of 30 m in the blue, green, red, near infrared, and three infrared
    (including thermal) bands. France launched a comparable satellite (système pour
    l''observation de la terre (SPOT) 1) in 1986, which collected 20 m imagery with
    a return frequency of up to six days in the green, red and near infrared frequencies.
    Jewel (1989) used four images collected between February and September in East
    Anglia, UK to distinguish cereal crops, field crops, grassland and forest land
    with an accuracy of 88%. India launched the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS-1A) satellite
    in 1988, with coverage in the blue, green, red and NIR bands at a spatial resolution
    of 72 m. Panigrahy and Sharma (1997) used reflectance in the red and NIR bands
    collected on four dates between October and March to classify agricultural landscapes
    in India into rice or rice–potato cropping systems with 95% accuracy. Table 1.

    H These applications of remote sensing in conventional agriculture soon led to
    applications in precision agriculture. The first application of remote sensing
    in precision agriculture occurred when Bhatti et al. (1991) used Landsat imagery
    of bare soil to estimate spatial patterns in soil organic matter content, which
    were then used as auxiliary data along with ground based measurements to estimate
    spatial patterns in soil phosphorus and wheat grain yield (Mulla, 1997). The spatial
    resolution of Landsat, SPOT and IRS satellites is fairly coarse (20–30 m) for
    current applications in precision agriculture. Efforts were subsequently started
    to design satellite imaging systems that had the higher spatial resolution and
    quicker revisit cycles required for precision agriculture (Table 1). IKONOS was
    launched in 1999 by Satellite Imaging Corp, Magnolia, TX, USA in partnership with
    Lockheed Martin, Bethesda, MD, USA. IKONOS collected 4 m resolution imagery in
    the blue, green, red and near infrared bands at a return frequency of up to 5
    days. Seelan et al. (2003) used IKONOS images to identify N deficiencies in sugarbeet,
    fungicide performance efficiency in wheat and field sites that had inadequate
    artificial drainage in wheat. In 2001, DigitalGlobe, Longmont, CO, USA launched
    a satellite named QuickBird with capabilities similar to IKONOS. QuickBird had
    a revisit frequency of 1–3 days and collected imagery in the blue, green, red
    and near infrared at a spatial resolution of 0.6–2.4 m. Bausch and Khosla (2010)
    showed that QuickBird estimates of normalised green normalised difference vegetation
    index (NGNDVI) were strongly correlated with spatial patterns in nitrogen sufficiency
    in irrigated maize. García Torres, Peña-Barragán, López-Granados, Jurado-Expósito,
    and Fernández-Escobar (2008) showed that QuickBird images of olive orchards in
    Spain could be used to estimate areas of olive plantations, numbers of trees,
    and spatial patterns in projected area of tree canopies, and olive yields. These
    two satellites have steadily gained a substantial base of commercial subscribers
    interested in precision agriculture applications, in stark contrast to older satellite
    technology such as Landsat or SPOT. The next major breakthrough in satellite remote
    sensing for precision agriculture was the five-satellite constellation developed
    by the RapidEye, Brandenburg_an_der_Havel, Germany in 2008 (Table 1). RapidEye
    satellites provide daily coverage for any location on the globe, and collect data
    with a 6.5 m spatial resolution. RapidEye is the first satellite to provide imagery
    in the chlorophyll sensitive red-edge region of the spectrum (690–730 nm), along
    with the more traditional blue, green, red and near infrared reflectance. In 2008,
    GeoEye, Herndon, VA, USA launched a commercial satellite designed to provide services
    similar to RapidEye. The GeoEye 1 satellite has a return visit frequency of less
    than three days, and collects data at from 40 to 60 cm spatial resolution in the
    blue, green, red and near infrared bands. One of the main uses for GeoEye 1 imagery
    is providing Google Earth maps that are available through the Internet. This has
    revolutionised the ability to visualise land use patterns around the world. DigitalGlobe
    launched the WorldView 2 satellite in 2009, which collects imagery at 50 cm resolution
    with a 1 day revisit cycle. WorldView 2 is significantly more advanced than DigitalGlobe''s
    QuickBird satellite, as WorldView 2 collects imagery in the standard blue, green,
    red, and near infrared bands, as well as bands in the purple (450–480 nm), yellow,
    red-edge and a second near infrared frequency range. Several trends are apparent
    in satellite based remote sensing (Table 1). Firstly, the spatial resolution of
    imaging systems has improved from 80 m with Landsat to sub-metre resolution with
    GeoEye and WorldView. Secondly, the return visit frequency has improved from 18
    days with Landsat to 1 day with WorldView. Thirdly, the number of spectral bands
    available for analysis has improved from four bands (bandwidths greater than 60
    nm) with Landsat to eight or more bands (bandwidths greater than 40 nm) with WorldView.
    Hyperspectral imaging systems such as Hyperion on the National Aeronautics and
    Space Administration (NASA) earth observing 1 (EO 1) satellite provided even greater
    spectral resolution, with imaging from 400 to 2500 nm in 10 nm increments. As
    the spatial and spectral resolution of satellite imagery has improved, the suitability
    of using reflectance data from these platforms for precision agriculture applications
    has increased (Table 1). The most appropriate spatial and spectral resolution
    for precision agriculture applications depends on factors such as crop management
    objectives, capacity of farm equipment to vary farm inputs, and farm unit area.
    Estimation of spatial patterns in crop biomass or yield requires better spatial
    and spectral resolution (1–3 m) than variable rate application of fertiliser (5–10
    m). Accuracy of variable rate application of fertiliser is often limited by fertiliser
    spreader delay times (Chan, Schueller, Miller, Whitney, & Cornell, 2004). Variable
    rate spraying of herbicides for spot weed control requires better spatial and
    spectral resolution (0.5–1 m) than variable rate irrigation (5–10 m). Larger commercial
    farms can often afford to pay for remote sensing data with higher spatial and
    spectral resolution than smaller farms in developing countries. Satellite and/or
    aerial imagery is frequently used to estimate spatial patterns in crop biomass
    (Yang et al., 2000) and potential crop yield (Doraiswamy et al., 2003) using the
    Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI is calculated using reflectance
    ratios in the NIR and red portion of the spectrum (Rouse, Hass, Schell, & Deering,
    1973): (1) NDVI has several limitations, however, including potential interference
    from soil reflectance at low canopy densities and insensitivity to changes in
    leaf chlorophyll content in mature canopies with leaf area index values that exceed
    2 or 3 (Thenkabail, Smith, & De Pauw, 2000). The advent of crop combines equipped
    with yield monitors was a major advance in precision agriculture (Schueller &
    Bae, 1987; Stafford, Ambler, Lark, & Catt, 1996). Yield monitors provided fine
    scale resolution yield measurements across large spatial areas that could be used
    to improve the capacity of remote sensing to predict crop structural characteristics
    such as LAI, biomass, and yield. Many broadband spectral indices (Table 2) other
    than NDVI are available for use in precision agriculture (Miao et al., 2009; Sripada
    et al., 2006; Sripada, Schmidt, Dellinger, & Beegle, 2008). These indices reflect
    two historical trends in remote sensing for crop characteristics; namely, the
    prediction of ratios of reflectance in the red (R) and NIR bands versus ratios
    in the green (G) and NIR bands. The normalised red (NR) index focuses on the portion
    of the spectrum where chlorophyll strongly absorbs radiation. In contrast, the
    normalised green (NG) index focuses on the portion of the spectrum where pigments
    other than chlorophyll (carotenoids, anthocyanins, xanthophylls) absorb radiation.
    Similarly, there are two forms of the ratio vegetation index (RVI), one that consists
    of the ratio of NIR to R reflectance, the other green red vegetation index (GRVI)
    that consists of the ratio of NIR to G reflectance. Two forms of the NDVI exist,
    one that involves NIR and R reflectance, the other green normalized difference
    vegetation index (GNDVI) involves NIR and G reflectance. The difference vegetative
    index (DVI) was developed using the difference between reflectance in the NIR
    and R bands to compensate for effects of soil reflectance (Tucker, 1979). Sripada
    et al. (2006) found that economically optimum N rate in corn was better correlated
    with green difference vegetation index (GDVI) (NIR − G) than DVI (NIR − R), and
    these indices that compensated for soil effects performed better than NIR and
    R ratio indices such as NDVI and RVI that did not compensate for soil effects.
    A wide range of other indices have been developed to compensate for soil effects,
    including soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), green soil adjusted vegetation
    index (GSAVI), optimised soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), green optimised
    soil adjusted vegetation index (GOSAVI) and modified soil adjusted vegetation
    index (MSAVI). A comparison of NDVI and simple ratio (SR8) vegetation indices
    for an irrigated commercial Minnesota potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) farm is shown
    in Fig. 2. Spatial patterns in N stress are identified more accurately with the
    SR8 index than the NDVI index. Table 2. Multi-spectral broad-band vegetation indices

    when irradiance is relatively consistent across time. Only radar imagery collected
    using satellites or airplanes is unaffected by cloud cover. Other challenges include
    calibrating raw digital numbers to true surface reflectance, correcting imagery
    for atmospheric interferences and/or off-nadir view angles, and geo-rectifying
    pixels using GPS-based ground control locations. 2.3. Proximal remote sensing
    of crops for precision agriculture Given the limitations of satellite remote sensing
    for precision agriculture, there has been significant interest in proximal remote
    sensing techniques to assess crop growth and crop stress (Table 3). Proximal remote
    sensing involves sensors mounted on tractors, spreaders, sprayers or irrigation
    booms. Proximal sensing allows real time site specific management of fertiliser,
    pesticides or irrigation. The foundation for a transition from remote sensing
    to proximal sensing based assessment of crop status was established by Schepers,
    Francis, Vigil, and Below (1992), who used a Minolta soil plant analysis development
    (SPAD) meter to measure leaf greenness (chlorophyll) in maize crops at the silking
    stage under a range of applied N fertiliser rates. SPAD meter readings of leaf
    reflectance at 650 and 940 nm were found to be correlated with applied rate of
    N fertiliser as well as independent measurements of leaf N concentration. Schepers
    et al. (1992) suggested that proximal chlorophyll readings could be used to estimate
    N stress in maize by referencing the SPAD readings for stressed crops with the
    readings in a reference strip that received adequate rates of N fertiliser. Chlorophyll
    content of crop leaves is strongly affected by crop N status, but can also be
    affected to a lesser degree by other factors, such as crop variety and growth
    stage, pest infestations, water stress, and nutrient deficiencies other than N.

    Blackmer and Schepers (1995) introduced the concept of a nitrogen sufficiency
    index (NSI) to assess the degree of N stress in maize. The NSI was defined as
    the ratio of SPAD meter greenness readings for crops in a given field location
    relative to SPAD readings for the same crop in a well-fertilised reference strip
    with no N deficiencies. NSI values less than 0.95 were used to indicate areas
    with N stress that required additional N fertiliser. Varvel, Schepers, and Francis
    (1997) showed that SPAD meters and NSI values could be used for in-season correction
    of N deficiency in maize. Bausch and Duke (1996) showed that the SPAD meter could
    be replaced with a boom-mounted radiometer to estimate spatial patterns in NIR/G
    ratio and NSI across an irrigated maize field based on comparisons with a well-fertilised
    reference strip. They observed that this approach could detect N deficiencies
    in the V6 growth stage (Ritchie, Hanway, & Benson, 1993, p. 21), but results were
    confounded by interference with reflectance patterns from bare soil. Stone et
    al. (1996) measured spectral radiance in the red (671 nm) and NIR (780 nm) bands
    in wheat with a sensor mounted on a mobile lawn tractor. They used these data
    to estimate a spectral index known as the plant nitrogen spectral index (PNSI),
    which was the absolute value of the inverse of NDVI. Results showed that PNSI
    was strongly correlated with crop N uptake. Sensor readings were used to vary
    N fertiliser rates using an algorithm that increased exponentially with PNSI values
    (Solie, Raun, Whitney, Stone, & Ringer, 1996). This was the beginning of technology
    to variably apply N fertiliser “on-the-go” in response to proximal crop sensing,
    and was the basis for commercial development of the GreenSeeker NDVI active sensor
    marketed by NTech Industries, Ukiah, CA, USA in 2001. Raun et al. (2002) subsequently
    developed a seven step response index (RI)-based algorithm to estimate crop N
    fertiliser needs for maize and wheat based on in-season sensing of crop reflectance
    relative to check plots with no added fertiliser and reference plots with sufficient
    fertiliser. This algorithm accounted for both season-to-season temporal variability
    in crop growth using the concept of in-season estimated yield (INSEY) as well
    as within-field spatial variability in N supply. Algorithms for estimating potential
    crop yield and N uptake are available for many crops and locations around the
    world (Shanahan, Kitchen, Raun, & Schepers, 2008). The RI is estimated as the
    ratio of NDVI values in the crop relative to those in a reference strip with sufficient
    fertiliser. Link, Panitzki, and Reusch (2002) and Reusch, Link, and Lammel (2002)
    developed a tractor based passive sensor to determine crop N status based on NDVI.
    This was originally known as the Hydro-N sensor, but has since become known as
    the Yara-N sensor (Yara, Olso, Norway) (Table 3). A version of the Yara-N sensor
    is also available that uses active sensors (Link & Reusch, 2006), which reduces
    the errors caused by varying cloud cover, and allows the tractor operator to work
    at night. Holland, Schepers, Shanahan, and Horst (2004) developed an active crop
    sensor known as Crop Circle (Table 3). This sensor initially used reflectance
    in the green and NIR bands to estimate crop N deficiencies. The rationale behind
    using green rather than red reflectance with Crop Circle was that as crop LAI
    increases beyond 2.0, the green NDVI is more sensitive to changes in chlorophyll
    concentration and potential crop yield than NDVI (Gitelson, Kaufmann, & Merzlyak,
    1996; Shanahan et al., 2001; Sripada et al., 2006, 2008). This overcomes the limitation
    of using the GreenSeeker sensor at advanced crop growth stages. Solari, Shanahan,
    Ferguson, Schepers, and Gitelson (2008) used the Crop Circle sensor to show that
    N deficiencies could be better predicted using a green chlorophyll index defined
    as (NIR880/VIS590) − 1 in comparison with the green NDVI. Sripada et al. (2008)
    showed that the performance of spectral indices could be improved using ratios
    with the corresponding index values in reference strips receiving sufficient N
    fertiliser. Kitchen et al. (2010) and Scharf et al. (2011) showed that producers
    using the Crop Circle sensor could reduce N fertiliser applications by making
    in-season correction, while increasing crop yield and farm profitability. One
    limitation of the chlorophyll meter, GreenSeeker, Yara N and Crop Circle sensors,
    however, is that they cannot directly estimate the amount of N fertiliser needed
    to overcome crop N stress (Samborski, Tremblay, & Fallon, 2009). To overcome this,
    scientists have conducted comparisons of sensor readings with readings in reference
    strips receiving sufficient N fertiliser (Blackmer & Schepers, 1995; Kitchen et
    al., 2010; Raun et al., 2002; Sripada et al., 2008). They have used these data
    to develop N fertiliser response functions that relate sensor readings to the
    amount of N fertiliser needed to overcome crop N stress (Scharf et al., 2011).
    Even with this approach, reference strips with adequate fertiliser have to be
    strategically placed in representative soils and landscapes because yield response
    to N fertiliser exhibits significant spatial variability across production fields
    (Mamo et al., 2003). Also, reference strips have limitations for other crops like
    wheat (subject to lodging) and potato (subject to excessive vine growth at the
    expense of tuber growth). 2.4. Hyperspectral remote sensing in precision agriculture
    Hyperspectral remote sensing collects reflectance data over a wide spectral range
    at small spectral increments (typically 10 nm). It provides the ability to investigate
    spectral response of soils and vegetated surfaces in narrow spectral bands (10
    nm wide) across a wide spectral range. This is not possible with multispectral
    imaging that traditionally collects reflectance data in broadbands (greater than
    40 nm wide) centred in the B, G, R and NIR regions of the spectrum. When collected
    across large spatial extents at fine spatial resolution, hyperspectral imaging
    provides powerful insight into the spatial and spectral variability in reflectance
    for a bare or vegetated surface. This information is traditionally visualised
    using a three-dimensional hyperspectral data cube, with two spatial dimensions
    (x,y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength). An example of a hyperspectral data
    cube is shown in Fig. 3 for a commercial potato field in Minnesota, USA. The field
    shows significant spatial and spectral variability in reflectance. Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 3. Hyperspectral data cube for a commercial Russet
    Burbank potato field in Minnesota. The face of the cube is a red–green–blue image
    of the same area shown in Fig. 2. The first hyperspectral sensor was the airborne
    visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS), launched in 1987. This sensor
    provides continuous imagery from 380 to 2500 nm in bands that have a spectral
    resolution of 10 nm and a spatial resolution of 20 m. The satellite based Hyperion
    sensor, launched aboard EO-1 by NASA in 2000, has hyperspectral imaging capabilities
    similar to AVIRIS. Hyperspectral imagery collected by EO-1 Hyperion via the advanced
    land imager (ALI) sensor continues to be collected and is available for public
    use through the US Geological Survey, Center for Earth Resources Observation and
    Science (EROS). Datt, Jupp, McVicar, and Van Niel (2003) showed that ALI hyperspectral
    data could be used to more accurately predict spatial patterns in rice yield grown
    in Australia with derivative indices and red edge position in comparison with
    predictions based on NDVI. Miglani, Ray, Pandey, and Parihar (2008) showed that
    20 hyperspectral bands from ALI were necessary for agricultural remote sensing
    studies in the Meerut district of India. Wu, Wang, Niu, Gao, and Wu (2010) showed
    that vegetative indices based on red edge reflectance from hyperspectral ALI data
    could be used to accurately estimate canopy chlorophyll content and leaf area
    index for a broad range of agricultural crops in China. An aerial hyperspectral
    imaging system, the compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI), has also been
    widely used (Haboudane et al., 2002, 2004). There are also hand-held or boom-mounted
    hyperspectral and multispectral imaging systems, including the CropScan (CropScan
    Inc, Rochester, MN, USA) sensor. Hyperspectral imaging differs from multispectral
    imaging in the continuity, range and spectral resolution of bands. In theory,
    it offers the capability of sensing a wide variety of soil and crop characteristics
    simultaneously, including moisture status, organic matter, nutrients, chlorophyll,
    carotenoids, cellulose, leaf area index and crop biomass (Goel et al., 2003; Haboudane
    et al., 2002; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2005). Specific wavelengths are most sensitive
    to each type of soil or crop characteristic. A red band centred at 687 nm is sensitive
    to crop leaf area index and biomass, while a near infrared band centred at 970
    nm is sensitive to crop moisture status (Thenkabail, Lyon, & Huete, 2010). Further
    examples of linking specific soil and crop characteristics with reflectance are
    given for 33 hyperspectral bands by Thenkabail et al. (2010). In contrast, multispectral
    imaging is often limited to analysis of single broadband combinations such as
    NDVI, which become insensitive to chlorophyll and other plant characteristics
    at LAI values exceeding 3.0 (Thenkabail et al., 2000), and are strongly interfered
    with by bare soil reflectance at low LAI values. Thenkabail et al. (2000) showed
    that hyperspectral data can be used to construct three general categories of predictive
    spectral indices, including 1) optimal multiple narrow band reflectance indices
    (OMNBR), 2) narrow band NDVI, and 3) SAVI. Only two to four narrow bands were
    needed to describe plant characteristics with OMNBR. The greatest information
    about plant characteristics in OMNBR includes the longer red wavelengths (650–700
    nm), shorter green wavelengths (500–550 nm), red-edge (720 nm), and two NIR (900–940
    nm and 982 nm) spectral bands. The information in these bands is only available
    in narrow increments of 10–20 nm, and is easily obscured in broad multispectral
    bands that are available with older satellite imaging systems. The best combination
    of two narrow bands in NDVI-like indices was centred in the red (682 nm) and NIR
    (920 nm) wavelengths, but varied depending on the type of crop (corn, soybean,
    cotton or potato) as well as the plant characteristic of interest (LAI, biomass,
    etc.). Advanced statistical methods for chemometric analysis of reflectance spectra
    have been used to interpret hyperspectral remote sensing data, including partial
    least squares (Lindgren, Geladi, & Wold, 1994; Viscarra Rossel et al., 2006),
    principal components analysis (Geladi, 2003), and pattern classification and recognition
    techniques (Stuckens, Coppin, & Bauer, 2000), including object oriented (Frohn,
    Reif, Lane, & Autrey, 2009) and decision tree (Wright & Gallant, 2007) classification
    techniques. Partial least squares (PLS) regression is perhaps more powerful than
    principal components analysis (PCA) in that PLS (like PCA) not only identifies
    factors that describe spectral variance, but also eliminates spectral bands that
    contain redundant information (Alchanatis & Cohen, 2010). Jain, Ray, Singh, and
    Panigrahy (2007) explored hyperspectral remote sensing for identification of N
    stress in potatoes grown in India. They used three techniques to identify bands
    that were optimal for detection of N stress, namely; 1) lambda–lambda plots, 2)
    principal component analysis, and 3) discriminant analysis. Lambda–lambda plots
    involve calculating, for example, the coefficient of determination (r2) for leaf
    N content at all hyperspectral reflectance bands. A graph of r2 for all possible
    combinations of band 1 on the x-axis and band 2 on the y-axis results in a lambda–lambda
    plot. The lambda–lambda plot is useful for identifying which combinations of two
    bands contain redundant information about N stress. Spectral bands or narrow band
    indices should be selected with low r2 to eliminate redundancy and maximise information
    about crop characteristics (such as N stress). Principal component analysis was
    used by Jain et al. (2007) to identify which combinations of bands account for
    a majority of the variance in crop reflectance characteristics. This technique
    is used to eliminate hyperspectral bands that do not contain useful information
    about the crop characteristics of interest. Stepwise discriminant analysis uses
    a ratio of treatment sums of squares to total sums of squares to find spectral
    regions with distinctly different mean values of reflectance. A variety of narrow
    band hyperspectral indices (Table 4) are available for use in precision agriculture
    (Haboudane et al., 2002, 2004; Li et al., 2010; Miao et al., 2007, 2009). Many
    of these have the same form as broadband spectral indices (Table 1), but differ
    in that the reflectance bands for hyperspectral indices are narrow (10–20 nm wide)
    bands centred around a single specific wavelength. These indices variously respond
    to canopy or leaf scale effects of leaf area index, chlorophyll, specific pigments,
    or nitrogen stress. Simple ratios (SR) 1 through 7 and normalized difference indices
    (NDI) 1 through 3 typically respond to leaf level changes in chlorophyll. In contrast,
    NDVI responds to canopy scale changes in leaf area index and chlorophyll. GNDVI,
    modified chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (MCARI), transformed chlorophyll
    absorption in reflectance index (TCARI), MCARI2, OSAVI, and MSAVI respond to canopy
    scale changes in chlorophyll, with the latter two indices being designed to compensate
    for soil reflectance effects. PSSRa and PSSRb were designed specifically to respond
    to changes in chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, respectively. New hyperspectral
    indices are continuously being tested and developed (Li et al., 2010) using techniques
    involving lambda–lambda plots where reflectance signatures are compared for all
    possible combinations of two reflectance bands. Table 4. Hyperspectral narrow-band

    of hyperspectral remote sensing in precision agriculture have recently been reviewed
    by Yao et al. (2010). These applications include 1) bare soil imaging for management
    zone delineation, 2) weed mapping, 3) crop N stress detection, 4) crop yield mapping,
    and 5) pest and disease detection. Perhaps of greatest interest for precision
    agriculture is using hyperspectral remote sensing for variable rate, in-season
    management of nitrogen fertiliser based on spatial patterns in chlorophyll content.
    Wu, Han, Niu, and Dong (2010) used hyperspectral data from the Hyperion EO-1 satellite
    to study chlorophyll content in a variety of agricultural canopy types in China,
    including flax, chestnuts, corn, bamboo, potato, pine, saccharose and tea. Chlorophyll
    content of leaves were estimated using a variety of vegetation indices derived
    from red edge reflectance bands located at 705 and 750 nm. The MCARI/OSAVI705
    index performed better than all other vegetation indices evaluated, with an r2
    value of 0.71. Wu, Wang et al. (2010) estimated chlorophyll content of maize in
    China using Hyperion hyperspectral reflectance data. The Enhanced Vegetation Index
    (EVI) was more accurate (r2 = 0.81) at predicting maize chlorophyll contents than
    MSAVI or NDVI. 3. Knowledge gaps for remote sensing in precision agriculture Rapid
    advances in remote sensing for precision agriculture have occurred over the last
    twenty five years. Satellite imagery has improved in spatial resolution, return
    visit frequency and spectral resolution. Aerial hyperspectral imagery has revolutionised
    the ability to distinguish multiple crop characteristics, including nutrients,
    water, pests, diseases, weeds, biomass and canopy structure. Ground-based sensors
    have been developed for on-the-go monitoring of crop and soil characteristics
    such as N stress, water stress, soil organic matter and moisture content. Precision
    farming has progressed through many stages. It began with farming by soil and
    progressed to site-specific crop management based on grid sampling and management
    zones. More recently there has been increasing emphasis on real-time on-the-go
    monitoring with ground based sensors. The challenge for the future is to develop
    precision farming approaches that can provide customized management of farm inputs
    for individual plants. There is a significant potential in precision agriculture
    for combining archived remote sensing data with real-time data for improved agricultural
    management (Thenkabail, 2003). Historical archives of satellite remote sensing
    data are available at many locations for Landsat, SPOT, IRS, IKONOS, and QuickBird.
    These data typically include reflectance in the B, G, R and NIR bands, at spatial
    resolutions of from 0.6 to 30 m spatial resolution. Images at a fixed location
    could be analysed across multiple crop growth stages, seasons and years in order
    to identify relatively homogeneous sub-regions of fields that differ from one
    another in leaf area index, NDVI, and potential yield. Auxiliary data at these
    same sites, including crop yield maps, digital elevation models and soil series
    maps could be combined with historical remote sensing data to identify potential
    management zones where precision agricultural input operations can be implemented.
    Real time remote sensing with high spatial and spectral resolution satellites
    such as EO-1 Hyperion or the upcoming (2016) NASA Hyperspectral Infrared Imager
    (HyspIRI) satellite (or comparable data collected with aerial platforms) could
    then be used for real time precision agricultural decision making and to refine
    the location of management zones identified using historical imaging and auxiliary
    data. With this in mind, there are several needs for future research in precision
    farming. These include the following: • More emphasis is needed on chemometric
    or spectral decomposition/derivative methods of analysis since spatial and spectral
    resolution of hyperspectral sensing systems are now adequate for most precision
    agriculture applications • Sensors are needed for direct estimation of nutrient
    deficiencies without the use of reference strips • Spectral indices should continue
    to be developed that simultaneously allow assessment of multiple crop characteristics
    (e.g. LAI, biomass, etc.) and stresses (e.g. water and N; weeds and insects, etc.)
    • Historical archives of satellite remote sensing data at moderate to high spatial
    resolution and traditional spectral resolution should be integrated with real-time
    remote sensing data at high spatial and spectral resolution for improved decision
    making in precision agriculture. Acknowledgement Support by the USDA-BARD fund

    Abstract\nBetter understanding of plant root dynamics is essential to improve\
    \ resource use efficiency of agricultural systems and increase the resistance\n\
    of crop cultivars against environmental stresses. An experimental protocol is\
    \ presented for RGB and hyperspectral imaging of root systems.\nThe approach uses\
    \ rhizoboxes where plants grow in natural soil over a longer time to observe fully\
    \ developed root systems. Experimental\nsettings are exemplified for assessing\
    \ rhizobox plants under water stress and studying the role of roots. An RGB imaging\
    \ setup is described\nfor cheap and quick quantification of root development over\
    \ time. Hyperspectral imaging improves root segmentation from the soil background\n\
    compared to RGB color based thresholding. The particular strength of hyperspectral\
    \ imaging is the acquisition of chemometric information on\nthe root-soil system\
    \ for functional understanding. This is demonstrated with high resolution water\
    \ content mapping. Spectral imaging however\nis more complex in image acquisition,\
    \ processing and analysis compared to the RGB approach. A combination of both\
    \ methods can optimize a\ncomprehensive assessment of the root system. Application\
    \ examples integrating root and aboveground traits are given for the context of\
    \ plant\nphenotyping and plant physiological research. Further improvement of\
    \ root imaging can be obtained by optimizing RGB image quality with better\nillumination\
    \ using different light sources and by extension of image analysis methods to\
    \ infer on root zone properties from spectral data.\nVideo Link\nThe video component\

    Roots provide several essential functions for plants such as storage of assimilates,\
    \ anchorage of terrestrial plants in soil, and uptake and\ntransport of water\
    \ and nutrients1. From an evolutionary point of view, the formation of root axes\
    \ is considered a fundamental precondition for the\norigin of land plants2. In\
    \ spite of this important role, historically roots have occupied only a marginal\
    \ position in biological research. In more recent\ntimes, however, there is increasing\
    \ scientific interest in plant root systems as evidenced in Figure 1.\nJournal\

    \ in SCI journals over the last decades. Search result from Scopus\nusing keywords\
    \ \"plant\" and \"plant AND root\". Please click here to view a larger version\
    \ of this figure.\nTwo main reasons can be hypothesized to underlie the recent\
    \ advances in root research. First, terrestrial vegetation is exposed to more\
    \ frequent\nenvironmental stresses as a result of global change3. In the context\
    \ of agricultural crop production it is estimated that globally around 30% of\n\
    the agricultural area are limited by water and phosphorus4,5. Stress reduction\
    \ of crop yields are a main reason for significant yield gaps that are\nglobally\
    \ estimated at lower 50% of potential productivity for rainfed agro-ecosystems6.\
    \ Besides low resource availability, this is also related to\npoor resource use\
    \ efficiency, i.e. insufficient capacity of a plant to exploit available resources7.\
    \ This results in losses of mobile resources such\nas nitrate which can negatively\
    \ affect other ecosystems. The current global nitrogen use efficiency for example\
    \ is estimated at 47%8. Better\nresource use efficiency via improved management\
    \ methods and cultivars is therefore of high importance for both sustained growth\
    \ of agricultural\noutputs as well as for environmental sustainability. In this\
    \ context plant roots are considered to be a key target for improved crops and\
    \ cropping\nsystems9,10.\nA second important background for the recent interest\
    \ in plant roots is technological advance in measurement methods. Root methods\
    \ have\nlong been restricted by two key challenges: for measurement of roots from\
    \ plants growing in soil they had to be isolated for quantification,\nmostly by\
    \ washing11, thereby disturbing the architectural arrangement of root axes. In-situ\
    \ root observation using excavation methods, thereby\nconserving the natural location\
    \ of roots in soil, have been used for botanical description12. Still they are\
    \ very time-consuming and thus do not\nmeet the throughput requirements of comparative\
    \ structural-functional root system analysis. On the other hand high-throughput\
    \ methods for\nroot architecture measurement were mostly done on artificial media\
    \ and for seedling plants13 where the extrapolation to the natural growth\nenvironment\
    \ of plants is questionable14.\nThe recent boom of root research is tightly linked\
    \ to the advance in imaging methods15. Imaging approaches in root studies can\
    \ be roughly\ngrouped into three types. First there are high resolution 3D methods\
    \ such as CT and MRI16. These methods are most suitable to study\ninteraction\
    \ processes of plant roots with soil, such as drought induced xylem embolism17.\
    \ Typically they are applied to comparatively small\nsamples where they allow\
    \ detailed observations. A comparison of CT and MRI for differently sized pots\
    \ and fine root imaging is provided in18.\nSecond, there are high-throughput imaging\
    \ methods19,20. These methods are mostly based on common 2D RGB imaging of roots\
    \ growing\non artificial media (gel, germination paper) where high contrast allows\
    \ comparatively simple dissection between roots and background. They\nare appropriate\
    \ for high throughput comparison among seedling root traits of different crop\
    \ genotypes under standardized artificial growing\nconditions13. In between these\
    \ two approaches are rhizobox methods: they use 2D imaging of roots growing in\
    \ soil over longer time period and\nhave medium throughput21,22. A recent challenge\
    \ to (2D) root imaging is to capture also indicators of root functionality in\
    \ addition to description of\nstructure23.\nIn the present paper we present the\
    \ experimental protocols for imaging rhizobox grown root systems using (i) a cheap\
    \ and simple custom-made\nRGB imaging setup and (ii) a more complex NIR imaging\
    \ setup. Example results obtained from these two setups are shown and discussed\
    \ in the\ncontext of plant phenotyping and plant physiological research.\nJournal\

    \ experimental system uses rhizoboxes to grow plants for root imaging. First the\
    \ design of the boxes and the substrate used are\ndescribed, and then details\
    \ on the filling procedure are given.\n1.\nDesign of rhizoboxes\n1.\nCreate rhizoboxes\
    \ (Figure 2) with a back plate and side frames made of grey PVC with 15 mm strength.\
    \ Use a box size of 300 mm x\n1000 mm. For the front window, use 6 mm mineral\
    \ glass which is attached to the PVC frame by metal rails being screwed into the\
    \ side\nwalls.\n2.\nCreate three holes on the bottom frame to allow drainage of\
    \ excess water. These holes can be optionally closed by plastic screws.\n3.\n\
    Before filling, adapt the inner diameter of the rhizobox (between 10 mm and 30\
    \ mm) by inserting PC multiwall sheets. An inner space of\n10 mm is recommended\
    \ for most crops to reduce the weight (rhizobox weight without soil is 13.2 kg)\
    \ of the entire system.\n \nFigure 2: Rhizobox experimental system and its components.\n\
    \ \nLeft figure shows the dimensions of a rhizobox and right figure its single\
    \ components, being a grey PVC back plate with side frame, a front\nmineral glass,\
    \ multiwall sheets for variable inner diameter and metal angles to fix the front\
    \ glass to the back compartment. Please click here to\nview a larger version of\
    \ this figure.\n2.\nSubstrate\n1.\nFill the rhizoboxes with field soil (for this\
    \ experiment: silt loam top soil from a calcareous chernozem) sieved to 2 mm particle\
    \ size.\n2.\nOpen the rhizoboxes for filling the substrate into the inner compartment\
    \ (back plate with side frames) in horizontal position using pre-\nwetted substrate.\
    \ Fill horizontally to avoid layering and segregation between fine and coarse\
    \ particles which occurs when filling in\nvertical position by pouring the substrate\
    \ through the upper opening.\n3.\nPre-wet the substrate before filling. Depending\
    \ on the type of substrate (particularly on its silt and clay content), do not\
    \ exceed a water\ncontent of 0.12-0.18 cm3*cm-3 to avoid smearing and structure\
    \ degradation. Add the difference between pre-mixing and target water\ncontent\
    \ after filling the substrate into the rhizoboxes.\n \nNOTE: Filling with (oven-)dry\
    \ substrate and subsequent addition of the entire water is not recommended as\
    \ is can result in strong\nsettlement of the substrate and formation of large\
    \ cracks.\n3.\nStep by step filling example\nJournal of Visualized Experiments\n\

    \ the target water content. Here it is initially set at 80% plant available water\
    \ (PAW) where plants do not suffer from any water\nshortage.\n2.\nDetermine field\
    \ capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) of the substrate. Here obtain\
    \ FC using a PVC tube of equivalent\nheight (100 cm) as the rhizoboxes.\n1.\n\
    Close the tube at the bottom with a stubble having small drainage holes, add 1\
    \ cm of gravel to avoid closure of the holes from\nfiner substrate and fill the\
    \ substrate to the same bulk density as used for the rhizoboxes (1.3 g cm-3).\n\
    2.\nSaturate the tube with water until drainage occurs and leave it for two days\
    \ to equilibrate (the resulting water content is per\ndefinition equivalent to\
    \ field capacity), while covering the upper opening with cling-film to avoid evaporation.\
    \ The field capacity\nvalue achieved for the soil in this experiment was 0.357\
    \ cm3 cm-3.\n \nNOTE: Water content at PWP has to be known in advance from standard\
    \ soil physical methods (e.g. pressure plate\nmeasurements24) or from texture\
    \ based pedotranfer functions25. Here it is equal 0.12 cm3 cm-3 for the soil used.\n\
    3.\nWhen measuring FC by pressure plate extraction too, take the water content\
    \ at a matrix potential of h=-100 hPa and not h=-330\nhPa in order to correspond\
    \ to the rhizobox geometry (height of 100 cm = 100 hPa).\n4.\nCalculate the water\
    \ content (WC) at 80% PAW: WC (cm3 cm-3) = 0.80 (FC-PWP) + PWP. For the hydraulic\
    \ limits of the soil used\nhere this gives a volumetric water content at 80% PAW\
    \ of 0.31 cm3 cm-3.\n5.\nCalculate the water amount for a rhizobox volume of 2850\
    \ cm3 (30 cm width, 1 cm inner space, 95 cm in height, with top 5 cm\nkeeping\
    \ free of substrate for watering). This gives a water volume of 883.5 cm3 equal\
    \ 883.5 g for the density of water being 1.0 g\ncm-3 at 20 °C.\n3.\nDefine the\
    \ bulk density (db) to fill the rhizoboxes. Here, set at 1.3 g cm-3 corresponding\
    \ to values typically found in agricultural field\nsoils. The amount of dry substrate\
    \ required to fill a rhizobox volume of 2850 cm3 at this db equals 3705 g of dry\
    \ soil.\n4.\nPre-wet the dry soil to a gravimetric water content of 0.108 g g-1\
    \ (equal to a volumetric water content of 0.14 cm3 cm-3) by adding 400 g\nof water\
    \ for 3705 g of dry soil and mix it gently to obtain a homogeneous water distribution.\
    \ Manually disrupt larger aggregates to keep\nthe particle size ≤ 2 mm.\n5.\n\
    Fill the pre-wetted soil into the opened rhizoboxes and compact it gently using\
    \ a polystyrene sheet (30 x 10 x 1.5 cm) to cover the inner\nvolume of the box,\
    \ thereby resulting in a homogeneous db of 1.3 g cm-3.\n6.\nAdd the remaining\
    \ amount of water (483.2 g) to achieve the target water content of 0.31 cm3 cm-3\
    \ by spraying onto the surface with\na spray bottle. Ensure small drop size to\
    \ avoid surface structure degradation and homogeneous wetting. Keep the box on\
    \ a balance\nduring spraying to monitor the amount of water actually added to\
    \ substrate.\n7.\nLet the water redistribute for 10 minutes and then press the\
    \ glass onto the surface and fix it with the side metal rails. The average final\n\
    weight of rhizoboxes with wetted substrate was 17818 ± 68 g (13230 g rhizobox\
    \ weight + 3705 g dry soil + 883 g water).\n \nNOTE: The homogeneous water content\
    \ filled in the horizontal boxes will redistribute when the boxes are set in their\
    \ final position\naccording to the resulting potential gradient. This is a physical\
    \ process in all plant growth pots according to their geometry (height) and\n\
    experimenters should be conscious on their pot hydraulics26.\n2. Climate room\

    \ parameters according to plant/experimental needs. Here, use 14 hours light and\
    \ 10 hours dark for illumination. During\nplant establishment and before stress\
    \ treatments started, set the temperature to 20° C during day and 15° C during\
    \ night and keep relative\nhumidity at 50 ± 8%.\n3.\nPut the rhizoboxes at an\
    \ inclination of 45° using an adequate metal framework. This maximizes root growth\
    \ towards the glass surface due to\ngravitropism.\n4.\nCover the glass window\
    \ by a wooden plate to keep the root zone in dark and avoid algae growth due to\
    \ light penetrating through the glass\nsurface.\n3. Sugar beet example setup and\
    \ treatments\n1.\nPre-germinate sugar beet seeds on wet filter paper for three\
    \ days at 20 °C in an incubator until the radicle emerges. This ensures seeding\n\
    with viable plants.\n \nNOTE: Pre-germination is not required for plants with\
    \ high germination vigor, thereby avoiding the risk of damaging the radicle at\
    \ seeding.\nFor sugar beet seeds with a thick pericarp, however the risk of non-viable\
    \ seeds is high and pre-germination significantly accelerates the\nemergence of\
    \ the radicle compared to direct seeding into soil.\n2.\nDrill a small hole to\
    \ about 1.5 cm soil depth in the middle of the rhizobox with a screwdriver, position\
    \ one seed in it using tweezers with the\nradicle oriented downwards and next\
    \ to the glass window (this improves the initial visibility) and gently cover\
    \ it with soil.\n3.\nAdd a 0.5 cm layer of fine gravel (2-4 mm) on top of soil\
    \ to protect the soil aggregates from slaking during irrigation and reduce evaporation\n\
    losses. To facilitate emergence, keep the soil surface free of gravel where the\
    \ seed has been positioned.\n4.\nAdd 10 g of water to enhance establishment.\n\
    5.\nDuring establishment and early growth until experimental stress treatments\
    \ start, irrigate the rhizoboxes every 2-4 days to keep the initial\nmoisture\
    \ content of 80% PAW.\n1.\nDetermine the amount of irrigation water required by\
    \ weighing the rhizoboxes and adding water until achieving the initial weight\
    \ of each\nindividual box. For manual irrigation use a pipette to avoid surface\
    \ structure degradation during watering.\n6.\nArrange the rhizoboxes according\
    \ to the established design in the climate room. The protocol reported here is\
    \ based on an experiment with\nsix sugar beet cultivars in five replicates in\
    \ a completely randomized design (CRD).\nJournal of Visualized Experiments\nwww.jove.com\n\

    \ each time when taking them out of the metal holder for weighing and watering.\
    \ This avoids any effects of\nresidual (light) inhomogeneity inside the climate\
    \ room.\n7.\nDefine the time for onset of stress treatments and the type of stress.\
    \ The following settings (Figure 4) are used here.\n1.\nStart measurements at\
    \ BBCH 15 (five leaves unfolded) with roots covering around 75% of the rhizobox\
    \ depth and the canopy being\nsufficiently developed for measurements at the leaves.\
    \ Keep each stage for at least three days to ensure adaptation to the new settings\n\
    and make measurement.\n2.\nFor the non-stress observations keep the initial settings\
    \ with optimum soil moisture (80% PAW) and ambient conditions (20° C/15° C\ntemperature,\
    \ 50 ± 8% rH) giving a daytime vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of 1.28 ± 0.1 kPa\
    \ (cf. Figure 3 C).\n3.\nRaise the atmospheric demand to a daytime VPD of 2.45\
    \ ± 0.4 kPa by increasing the temperature to 27°C/20°C and decreasing rH to\n\
    35%, while keeping soil moisture at 80% PAW.\n4.\nSubsequently dry down the rhizoboxes\
    \ to 40% PAW equivalent to a water content of 0.215 cm3 cm-3 by withholding irrigation.\
    \ Reset the\ninitial ambient conditions with low atmospheric demand (VPD of 1.28\
    \ kPa).\n5.\nCombine stresses increasing the atmospheric demand to a VPD of 2.45\
    \ kPa and keep soil moisture at 40% PAW.\n4. Root imaging methods\n1.\nCombine\
    \ imaging methods to make use of their respective advantages and depending on\
    \ the information targeted.\n1.\nApply RGB imaging in the VIS range to track root\
    \ growth, architecture and morphology over time which implicitly requires frequent\n\
    measurement. Advantages of RGB imaging are (i) low costs, (ii) rapid image acquisition,\
    \ (iii) low requirements of hard-disk space\n(image size: 48 MB) and (iv) high\
    \ resolution (3648 x 5472 pixels).\n2.\nUse hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the\
    \ NIR range when chemometric features of root and soil are required. Advantages\
    \ are (i) spectral\nfeatures for segmentation between roots and soil background\
    \ and (ii) access to physico-chemical system properties (e.g. soil water\ncontent,\
    \ root age). Disadvantages are (i) higher scanning time (about 16 minutes per\
    \ rhizobox), (ii) large size of datasets (13.7 GB per\nrhizobox image) and (iii)\
    \ lower resolution of the NIR camera (320 x 256 Pixel), and (iv) higher complexity\
    \ of data analysis.\n2.\nRGB root imaging\n1.\nUse an imaging box (Figure 4) that\
    \ shields from ambient light and fixes the camera position consisting of a metal\
    \ frame with a width of\n1 m and a height of 1 m with side walls lined with pressboards.\
    \ At the front end, fix the camera at two positions at a distance of 80 cm\nfrom\
    \ the rhizobox.\n1.\nAttach a tapeline on the rhizobox frame with transparent\
    \ adhesive tape and position the rhizobox in the holder of the imaging\nbox.\n\
    2.\nIlluminate the rhizobox using four 24 W fluorescent light tubes attached at\
    \ a distance of 80 cm from the rhizobox. Also, mount\nfour 15 W UV tubes at 20\
    \ cm from the rhizobox as alternative illumination making use of root auto-fluorescence\
    \ in case of low\ncontrast between root and (bright colored) substrate background.\n\
    3.\nTake two images (top and bottom position) to cover the upper and the lower\
    \ half of a rhizobox with an overlap of about 3 cm.\n2.\nAcquire RGB images with\
    \ a digital single-lens reflex camera which is fixed by quick release plates on\
    \ the respective positions of the\nimaging box.\n1.\nApply the following settings\
    \ when using the fluorescent light tubes. Adapt these example settings for any\
    \ changes in dimensions\nand illumination as well as the camera model.\n1.\nTurn\
    \ off autofocus and stabilizer on the camera objective. Set camera to manual mode.\n\
    2.\nSet ISO speed to 500. Set shutter speed to 13. Set Aperture to 5.6.\n3.\n\
    Turn off the mirror lock. Set the white balance to Auto White Balance.\n2.\nUse\
    \ the following settings for illumination with UV tubes:\n1.\nTurn off autofocus\
    \ and stabilizer on the camera objective. Set camera in manual mode.\n2.\nSet\
    \ ISO speed to 1000. Set shutter speed to 13. Set Aperture to 5.6.\n3.\nTurn off\
    \ the mirror lock. Set the white balance to Fluorescence.\n3.\nMerge the RGB images\
    \ from top and bottom of the rhizobox into a single image a photo editor (e.g.,\
    \ Adobe Photoshop). Use the\ntapeline at the side frame of the rhizoboxes and\
    \ control overlapping objects (root and soil features).\n1.\nCopy the two separate\
    \ images, each with pixels size of 3648 x 5472, into a new file of size 3648 x\
    \ 10944 pixels and white\nbackground.\n2.\nReduce the layer opacity for one image\
    \ to 60% and align overlapping parts of the images (tapeline, objects). Thereafter\
    \ restore\nlayer opacity to 100%.\n3.\nBased on the ruler on the image add two\
    \ red lines of exactly 1 cm to the top of the image where no roots are present.\
    \ These\nlines are later used at image analysis to scale the image to correct\
    \ length dimensions.\n4.\nMerge all layers and remove parts of the image outside\
    \ the soil filled window with the cropping tool.\n5.\nSave the image as tiff-file\
    \ for further analysis.\n6.\nIn case of images with UV illumination, reduce colors\
    \ to greyscale before saving using the toolbar Adjustments-Black & White,\nand\
    \ selecting the predefined High Contrast Blue filter.\n4.\nFor segmentation between\
    \ roots and soil background as well as for quantification of root traits of interest\
    \ (e.g. length, surface,\ndiameter, branching) use any root analysis software\
    \ (see www.plant-image-analysis.org for available tools). Here WinRhizo is used.\n\
    1.\nOpen the rhizobox tiff-image the software.\n2.\nCalibrate the length scale\

    Hyperspectral root imaging\n1.\nHardware setup\n1.\nUse a hyperspectral root imaging\
    \ system (Figure 5) consisting of (i) a thermo-electrically cooled 14-bit monochrome\
    \ NIR camera\nwith a spectral range from 900 nm to 1700 nm, 320 by 256 pixels\
    \ and a frame rate of 100Hz and (ii) an imaging spectrograph\nwith a spectral\
    \ range 900 nm to 2500 nm and a spectral resolution of 3.6 nm. Arrange a halogen\
    \ line illumination source (four 50\nW halogen spots) in a 45°/-45° geometry.\
    \ Mount the imaging sensor on a two-axis positioning system. The scan window has\
    \ a\nsize of 240 x 1000 mm, i.e. 30 mm at each edge of the rhizobox are not covered\
    \ by the image.\n2.\nControl the system by a Matlab script for (i) white and dark\
    \ standard acquisition, (ii) setting of camera integration time, (iii)\nselecting\
    \ spatial (pixel size 0.1 mm; pixel size 1.0 mm) and spectral resolution (all\
    \ 222 spectral bands with a resolution of 3.6 nm;\nsmoothed spectrum with 54 bands\
    \ and a resolution of 14.8 nm), and (iv) defining the scan region on the rhizobox.\n\
    3.\nSave images as SIF-files. To avoid problems during saving of large files,\
    \ subdivide each scanned image stride (9 strides per\nrhizobox) into four segments\
    \ (three of 300 mm length, one of 100 mm length) and save separately with a unique\
    \ file name\nconsisting of stride number (1 to 9) and part (1 to 4) as well as\
    \ date and time (YYYY.MM.DD HH:MM:SS). An entire rhizobox\nscan requires a hard-disk\
    \ space of 13.7 GB.\nJournal of Visualized Experiments\nwww.jove.com\nCopyright\

    \ \nNOTE: Figure 6 shows the steps of image acquisition, segmentation and analysis.\n\
    1.\nImage acquisition comprises selection of camera setting for optimum image\
    \ quality and definition of scan parameters.\n1.\nDetermine the camera integration\
    \ times for the rhizobox scan and the white standard in the camera software.\n\
    1.\nOpen the imaging GUI and move the camera to a position of the rhizobox where\
    \ roots are present.\n2.\nAdjust the integration time of the camera targeting\
    \ a light object (i.e. root) in a way that approximately 85% of the full\ndynamic\
    \ range of the camera is used on the histogram displayed by the software. Repeat\
    \ for the white standard by\nmoving the camera positioning system to target the\
    \ white standard. Then close the camera software.\n2.\nOpen the Matlab Imaging\
    \ GUI and make all settings for the current rhizobox scan. For the data reported\
    \ here, use the\nfollowing settings:\n \nIntegration time white standard: 1000\n\
    \ \nIntegration time rhizobox: 4000\n \nSpectral resolution: Full resolution (i.e.\
    \ 222 narrow-range spectral bands)\n \nFull spatial resolution (pixel size of\
    \ 0.1 mm)\n1.\nAcquire the dark and white standards before each imaging run, e.g.\
    \ once a day. The dark standard represents\nthe camera noise, while the white\
    \ standard gives the maximum reflectivity. These data are required for image\n\
    normalization during pre-processing.\n2.\nDefine whether the entire rhizobox or\
    \ only part of it is scanned. For the present case entire rhizoboxes are imaged.\n\
    Then start the scan.\n2.\nProcess the image with a Matlab script. Operations performed\
    \ by the script are described.\n \nNOTE: Scripts are currently in an undocumented\
    \ version and can be obtained from the corresponding author. After\nproper documentation,\
    \ they will be available for download from the website of the corresponding author's\
    \ institution\n(www.dnw.boku.ac.at/pb/).\n1.\nCompose an entire image stride from\
    \ the rhizobox center (containing roots) merging the four parts of the stride.\n\
    \ \nNOTE: At this stage it is neither necessary nor recommended to use a spectral\
    \ image of an entire rhizobox (i.e. all 9\nstrides) as the file size will make\
    \ each calculation step in Matlab very time consuming and the information contained\
    \ in one\ncentral stride is sufficient for the first steps of image analysis.\n\
    2.\nNormalize the image using the acquired dark and white standards and taking\
    \ into account the different integration times of\nwhite standard and rhizobox\
    \ scans which are saved automatically during scanning in a file.\n3.\nOptionally\
    \ apply a smoothing filter to remove noise from the image. The script currently\
    \ offers 3x3 kernel median filtering\nand multiple scatter correction. For the\
    \ image evaluation presented here, no filters are applied.\n4.\nDisplay the image\
    \ at all recorded spectral bands to obtain a first insight and decide a wavelength\
    \ to be displaying for\nselecting regions of interest (cf. image segmentation).\n\
    3.\nPerform segmentation between roots and soil background in a separate script\
    \ with the following steps.\n1.\nSelect regions of interest (ROI) for root and\
    \ soil to find spectral features for segmentation. Use the freehand selection\
    \ tool\nto mark a ROI on the image displayed at a wavelength previously identified\
    \ with good contrast between roots and soil.\nHere, use three ROIs on the root\
    \ (old and young laterals, tap root) and two ROIs in the soil (dry, wet region).\n\
    2.\nDisplay a rectangle with the selected ROIs and the remaining part as a black\
    \ mask and visualize the selected ROI image\nat all wavelengths.\n3.\nRemove all\
    \ lines in the image matrix containing pixels of spectral intensity = 0 (black\
    \ pixels).\n4.\nFuse the root and soil ROIs into one foreground (root) and one\
    \ background (soil) matrix for segmentation.\n5.\nSearch spectral bands (intensity\
    \ of single spectra or spectral ratios) providing the best separation between\
    \ root foreground\nand soil background27. Quantify the distinction between the\
    \ resulting pixel histograms for root and soil using Bhattacharyya\ndistance28.\n\
    6.\nSelect a threshold intensity value separating the histograms.\n7.\nCreate\
    \ a binary image by applying the selected threshold to the original image. This\
    \ sets all pixels having smaller intensity\nthan the threshold to zero and those\
    \ with higher intensity to one (done automatically be the script).\n8.\nSave the\
    \ binary image as tiff-file.\n4.\nOpen the binary image and analyze root traits.\
    \ Select (i) Based on grey levels, and (ii) Pale Root on Black Background in the\n\
    Root & Background Distinction menu and use global intensity threshold (the image\
    \ is already binarized).\n5.\nFor mapping the water content from the hyperspectral\
    \ data acquire a calibration dataset and apply a calibration equation to a\nrhizobox\
    \ image.\n1.\nSubdivide a rhizobox into 5 cm compartments using polystyrene sheets\
    \ to fill them with soil (same substrate and db as\nused for the experiment) at\
    \ different water contents (Figure 8).\n2.\nCalculate the respective amounts of\
    \ water to be mixed with soil and fill the compartments (same procedure as described\
    \ in\n1.3. for the entire rhizobox).\n3.\nScan the calibration rhizobox with the\
    \ same settings as used for the planted rhizoboxes.\n4.\nPerform the following\
    \ steps using a script.\n1.\nMerge the four parts of a stride from the water calibration\
    \ box to one stride and normalize it with dark and white\nstandards.\n2.\nSelect\
    \ rectangular boxes at each compartment with different water content and save\
    \ them in a structure array.\n3.\nDetermine the spectral feature that best separates\
    \ the water content compartments. This is done with a search\nalgorithm for the\
    \ global maximum of the intensity differences between mean spectra of adjacent\
    \ water contents.\n4.\nCalculate the mean spectral intensity value for this feature\

    Figure 9 provides details on root segmentation based on color thresholding for\
    \ cultivar Ferrara at day after sowing (DAS) 35. As a reference\n(Figure 9A),\
    \ a binary image is used where all roots were manually tracked with a Graphic\
    \ Tablet. The time required for manual tracking of the\nentire, fully developed,\
    \ dense sugar beet root system was around four hours. Figure 9B gives a detailed\
    \ view on a selected area at the top of\nthe image where old lateral roots are\
    \ present. Here several root axes are not classified by the color threshold. At\
    \ the bottom (Figure 9C) on the\ncontrary, where white young roots are predominant,\
    \ the color based segmentation properly classifies all root axes. The binarized\
    \ root system\n(Figure 9D) shows a black area at the left side from the illumination\
    \ artefact which was defined as exclusion region before running quantitative\n\
    analysis. Figure 9E shows the corresponding pixel histograms of selected features\
    \ (roots vs. soil) for the red channel of the RGB image from\nFerrara at DAS 35.\
    \ The root pixels (blue color) clearly show three peaks corresponding to bright\
    \ young laterals, dark old laterals and tap root.\nThe overlap between the old\
    \ laterals and the soil background is very strong, leading to unclassified root\
    \ axes (cf. Figure 9B).\nJournal of Visualized Experiments\nwww.jove.com\nCopyright\

    \ differ substantially from the background in intensity of most spectral bands.\
    \ For the old laterals\nthe intensity differences are much lower. A feature that\
    \ can be inferred visually is the different slope of the spectrum around water\
    \ absorption\nregion (1450 nm). Here the slope of root spectra is higher compared\
    \ to soil spectra. Furthermore a change of tap and young lateral spectra in the\n\
    region around 1100 nm can be identified that does not occur in the old laterals.\n\
    Figure 12A shows the result from the search algorithm identifying a spectral ratio\
    \ with strongest foreground-background contrast. The ratio\nof spectra at 1476\
    \ nm to 1076 nm provides the best separation between roots and soil. The resulting\
    \ histogram of root foreground and soil\nbackground pixels is shown in Figure\
    \ 12B. Although there is some overlap, most pixels are clearly separated from\
    \ the soil background. Fitting a\nbimodal Gaussian curve through the histogram\
    \ and using Bhattacharyya distance for quantification, a value of 7.80 is obtained.\
    \ A value higher\n3.0 indicates strong image contrast allowing reliable separation28.\n\

    \ 14A shows the mean spectra of the compartments in the calibration rhizobox (cf.\
    \ Figure 7) filled with soil of different water content.\nThe shape of spectra\
    \ is similar between the compartments, i.e. here a spectral ratio does not necessarily\
    \ provide a more stable classification\ncriterion. Thus intensity at a single\
    \ spectral band (1680 nm), where the average difference between adjacent water\
    \ contents is maximized, is\nidentified as best separating criterion. The resulting\
    \ pixel histograms for this spectral wavelength are shown in Figure 14B.\nJournal\

    \ from spectral intensity becomes difficult. A significant regression (either\
    \ linear or exponential) with high\nR2 can be fit to water contents up to around\
    \ 0.30 cm3 cm-3. Wetter soil conditions cannot be reliably predicted by the intensity\
    \ value. Similar\nbehavior of an exponential relation between reflectivity and\
    \ water content with a decreasing response to water contents higher 0.30 cm3 cm-3\n\
    was also found in other studies30.\nA rhizobox image with fine mapping of water\
    \ content is shown in Figure 16. Four aspects have to be remarked. First, a region\
    \ of lower water\ncontent can be seen in the rooted parts of the rhizobox. Second,\
    \ strongest depletion is concentrated in the vicinity to single root axes. Third,\n\
    depletion zones also occur where no root axes are visible on the surface, indicating\
    \ regions where roots are hidden in soil. Fourth, water\nmapping without further\
    \ image-processing results in a patchy appearance due to the aggregated soil.\
    \ This can indicate inhomogeneous water\ncontent distribution at the aggregate\
    \ scale, but also surface morphology effect on image quality. Chemometric image-processing\
    \ techniques are\nan option to overcome such morphological effects in spectral\
    \ images31, but are not implemented so far in the Matlab scripts used here.\n\

    \ from one replicate).\n(C) and (D) are functional relations between traits as\

    \ area ratio on\ndry matter production and (D) the relation of root surface area\
    \ to stomata conductance. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.\n\
    Figure 17A and 17B are relevant for phenotyping focusing on comprehensive aboveground\
    \ and belowground plant characterization. Figure 17A\nshows root growth of sugar\
    \ beet cultivar Ferrara (cf. Figure 8 for images). Expansion of the root system\
    \ indicates the capacity of a cultivar to\nexplore the soil volume in a given\
    \ time span of the vegetation period. Figure 17B shows leaf-to-root surface area\
    \ ratio of six sugar beet cultivars,\nproviding a descriptor for the balance between\
    \ plant supply (root) and demand (leaf).\nFigures 17C and 17D give examples for\
    \ functional relations of interest in physiological research. In Figure 17C leaf-to-root\
    \ surface area ratio is\nrelated to dry matter formed during the experiment, indicating\
    \ the predominant role of the assimilating surface as a limiting factor for dry\
    \ matter\naccumulation. The lack of significance in spite of a comparatively high\
    \ R2 is related to the low number of paired data (n=6) used here. Figure\n17D\
    \ reveals that cultivars with higher root surface area (improved uptake) have\
    \ an average higher stomata conductance over the course of the\nexperiment. The\
    \ higher root area apparently sustains water extraction, thereby prolonging stomata\
    \ opening.\nDiscussion\nThe protocols provide two complementary approaches for\
    \ soil grown root system imaging. A critical step for reliable experimental results\
    \ is\nfilling of the rhizoboxes that has to ensure an even and homogeneous substrate\
    \ layer at the front glass to provide tight root-soil contact at the\nobservation\
    \ window and avoid air gaps. This is the main reason to use comparatively fine\
    \ sieved soil of < 2 mm: Larger aggregates result in\nhigher surface morphology\
    \ at the observation window with voids between aggregates. Besides a higher risk\
    \ of root tip dehydration, this also\nrequires more complex image processing techniques\
    \ for water mapping31.\nModifications of the protocol therefore focus on improved\
    \ and quick filling of rhizoboxes. Currently filling time is about 30 minutes\
    \ per box.\nFurthermore use of rhizoboxes with two glass windows for imaging from\
    \ both sides and modifications to optimize illumination homogeneity for\nbetter\
    \ RGB images are tested. Further hardware extension might also consider integration\
    \ of planar optodes32 as well as capacitance imaging33\ninto the rhizobox system.\
    \ This however is beyond current upgrading activities.\nSoftware modifications\
    \ focus on automatic image registration to fuse the top and bottom RBG images34.\
    \ For hyperspectral imaging advanced\nunsupervised feature extraction approaches28\
    \ as well as more sensitive supervised target detection methods such as SVMs35\
    \ are tested.\nThereby the hyperspectral data potentially allow for the assessment\
    \ of multiple soil, rhizosphere and root properties36. Furthermore it is\nintended\
    \ to develop a (semi)automatized software for rhizobox root images based on a\
    \ modified version of Root System Analyzer37 to quantify\nmorphological (length,\
    \ diameter, surface) as well as architectural traits (branching frequency, branching\
    \ angles).\nThe main limitation of the protocol compared to 3D imaging approaches\
    \ is the restriction to the surface visible root and rhizosphere properties.\n\
    However it has been demonstrated that the visible root traits are a reliable proxy\
    \ for the whole root system21. The rhizobox technique is easily\ncombined with\
    \ traditional destructive sampling (washing) at the end of dynamic growth imaging\
    \ in order to validate the relation of visible vs. total\nroot system traits.\
    \ As this relation might vary among species21, destructive sampling is recommended\
    \ to ensure reliable inference from visible\ntraits for any new phenotyping series\
    \ with a different crop species.\nJournal of Visualized Experiments\nwww.jove.com\n\

    \ protocol presented here is the combination of realistic growing conditions (soil),\
    \ relatively high potential throughput for\nthe temporally resolved RGB imaging\
    \ and inference on root functionality (e.g. water uptake) via the chemometric\
    \ root and rhizosphere data from\nhyperspectral imaging. Thereby the methods overcomes\
    \ inference restrictions in high throughput seedling and non-soil root imaging\
    \ methods14,\nwhile it partially allows deep phenotyping insights into functional\
    \ processes with less experimental complexity and higher throughput compared to\n\
    advanced 3D methods15.\nIn upcoming experiments the protocol will be used to study\
    \ the effect of mycorrhiza on root system development and functionality of legumes\
    \ as\nwell as for phenotyping root characteristics of cover crop species in relation\
    \ to soil structure, nitrogen and carbon cycling.\nDisclosures\nThe authors have\

  explanation: This study uses a sensory system called a “leaf monitor” to predict
    plant water status in almond and walnut trees. Leaf monitors were installed on
    trees within the orchards, and sensors on the monitors collected data on leaf
    temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, photosynthetically active radiation
    (PAR), wind speed, and stem water potential (SWP). The collected data was used
    to compute the Modified Crop Water Stress Index (MCWSI), which was used to quantify
    the water status of the trees. This index was calibrated against measured SWP,
    the standard method for determining plant water stress (PWS). These relationships
    between MCWSI and SWP were used to implement variable rate irrigation (VRI), which
    was demonstrated to save 39% water as compared with the traditional 100% ET replacement
    irrigation method.

    all metrics Abstract Persistent drought conditions in the Central valley of California
    demands efficient irrigation scheduling tools such as precision or variable rate
    irrigation (VRI). To assist VRI scheduling, an experiment was conducted in almond
    and walnut orchards using a sensor system called ‘leaf monitor’, which was developed
    at UC Davis to detect plant water status. A Modified Crop Water Stress Index (MCWSI)
    was calculated to quantify plant water status using leaf temperature and environmental
    data collected by the leaf monitor. This technique also took into account spatio-temporal
    variability of plant water status. Stem water potential (SWP), which is considered
    a standard method for determining plant water stress (PWS), was also measured
    simultaneously. Relationships between measured deficit stem water potential (DSWP),
    which is the difference between SWP and the saturated baseline, and MCWSI were
    developed for both crops based on data collected during the 2013 and 2014 growing
    seasons. A linear relationship was found in the case of walnut crop with a coefficient
    of determination (r2) value of 0.67. A quadratic relationship was found in the
    case of almonds with a coefficient of multiple determination (R2) value of 0.75.
    Moreover, these results highlighted that at lower PWS of below 0.5 MPa of DSWP,
    almonds crops did not show any decrease in transpiration rate. However, when the
    stress level exceeded 0.5 MPa of DSWP, transpiration rate tended to decrease.
    On the other hand, walnut crop showed decrease in transpiration rate even at low
    PWS of below 0.5 MPa of DSWP. Temporal variability was noticed in PWS as it was
    found that coefficients of saturation baseline used for MCWSI method changed significantly
    throughout the season. MCWSI values estimated before an irrigation event was used
    to calculate the irrigation amount for low frequency variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) based on the relationship found between MCWSI and DSWP, and VRI led to an
    average 39% reduction in water usage as compared to the fixed 100% ET replacement
    irrigation method for all trees. Based on the results, leaf monitor showed potential
    for use as an irrigation scheduling tool. Similar content being viewed by others

    in drip-irrigated ‘Regina’ cherry trees Article 01 March 2024 Introduction The
    agriculture industry is facing a challenge to produce more food with limited resources
    in the face of increasing populations. Water is one of the major limiting factors
    to food production. Severe drought situations experienced in California in the
    recent past highlighted the need for irrigation techniques that use available
    water resources very efficiently and produce as much food as possible from every
    drop of water (Swain et al. 2014). This demands use of precision irrigation techniques
    to assist in the application of the right amount of water, at the right location,
    at the right time. Soil or Plant water status detection is a primary requirement
    to implement precision irrigation (Fereres and Soriano 2006). Plant water requirements
    and weather patterns change significantly over the cropping season (Goldhamer
    2005), so irrigation prescriptions should adjust to these changes. Plant water
    requirements also change spatially within a field due to differences in canopy
    size, soil variability, and field topography (Starr 2005). Therefore, it is important
    that plant water stress (PWS) is determined frequently and on a dense spatial
    scale. Usually, PWS is estimated by measuring stem water potential (SWP), especially
    in tree crops. In this technique, a leaf is cut from the tree and placed in a
    chamber while the leaf petiole remains outside the chamber through a rubber seal.
    The pressure in the chamber is gradually increased using compressed nitrogen gas
    until the sap comes out of leaf petiole. Upon sap expulsion, the pressure inside
    the chamber is recorded and referred to as “leaf water potential” (Turner 1988).
    To measure SWP, a leaf should be enclosed in reflective plastic bag for at least
    30 min to stop transpiration from the leaf surface and equilibrate the leaf water
    potential with stem water potential before removing the leaf from the tree (McCutchan
    and Shackel 1992; Fulton et al. 2002). “Pressure bomb” or “pressure chamber” is
    usually considered the standard device for measuring SWP because of its reliability
    and temperature independence (Turner 1981). However, it is very labor intensive
    and time consuming to make multiple mid-day SWP measurements using a pressure
    chamber in an orchard, which makes it difficult to obtain the large numbers of
    samples necessary to develop efficient irrigation scheduling techniques (Jones
    2004). Also, it is not feasible to develop automated Variable Rate Irrigation
    (VRI) systems based on manual measurements of SWP. VRI systems based on PWS measurements
    require convenient and automated method for PWS estimation. The Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI) is a popular parameter used to determine PWS. CWSI uses leaf temperature
    data of well-watered and fully water-stressed plants as references for calculation
    of the stress index (Idso et al. 1981). Idso et al. reported that for a well-watered
    crop, the difference of canopy temperature and air temperature (ΔT) was linearly
    related to vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and named this equation the well-watered
    baseline (ΔTww). $$\Delta {\text{T}}_{\text{ww}} = {\text{a}} + {\text{b }}\left(
    {\text{VPD}} \right)$$ (1) Where VPD (KPa) is calculated using air temperature
    (Tair) and relative humidity (RH) given by the equation: $${\text{VPD}} = 0.6108\left(
    {e^{{\frac{{17.27{\text{T}}_{\text{air}} }}{{{\text{T}}_{\text{air}} + 237.3}}}}
    } \right)\left( {1 - \frac{RH}{100}} \right)$$ (2) Moreover, it was found that
    the ΔT term for highly stressed crops (\({\text{i}}.{\text{e}}., \;\Delta T_{str}\))
    with no transpiration was constant, did not depend on VPD, and could be obtained
    empirically or from the well-watered baseline at VPD = 0. By knowing ΔT for well-watered
    (\(\Delta T_{ww}\)) and fully stressed (\(\Delta T_{str}\)) conditions, CWSI can
    be expressed as: $$CWSI = \frac{{\Delta T - \Delta T_{ww} }}{{\Delta T_{str} -
    \Delta T_{ww} }}$$ (3) CWSI has been recommended as a useful technique for PWS
    prediction. Idso (1982) empirically calculated CWSI and developed non-water stress
    baselines for 26 different crops. Alderfasi and Nielsen (2001) developed baseline
    equations for different genotypes of winter wheat for CWSI calculations. CWSI
    has also been used for PWS prediction in watermelons (Orta et al. 2003). In another
    study, Testi et al. (2008) measured pistachio tree canopy temperature and calculated
    CWSI to predict leaf water potential. They found that CWSI was a sensitive indicator
    of PWS, and that CWSI values measured during the 12:00–3:00 p.m. time interval
    were good indicators of seasonal changes in water status. However, most of the
    studies on canopy temperature and CWSI were conducted on field crops, and many
    researchers have suggested that additional work should be conducted on tree crops
    (e.g., Ben-Gal et al. 2010; Wang and Gartung 2010). An important requirement for
    a PWS detection method is to be used to trigger automated VRI. In general, the
    automated VRI systems in common use are based on simple automated timer operation,
    or in some cases the signal is provided by soil moisture sensors (Torre-Neto et
    al. 2000). Miranda et al. (2005) developed and tested an autonomous feedback distributed
    irrigation control system allowing site-specific management of fixed irrigation
    systems. This system proved to be reliable, affordable, and effective in maintaining
    the soil water potential in the root zone close to a preset value (less negative
    than − 18 kPa) for 100% of the time during the study. Few VRI Studies based on
    plant measurements have been conducted to date. For example, it was demonstrated
    that irrigation scheduling of almonds trees is feasible based on diurnal stem
    diameter fluctuations, which has the potential to be used as a fully automatic
    system (Goldhamer and Fereres 2004). Thermal sensing or CWSI of canopy has been
    used for VRI as well. O’Shaughnessy et al. (2012) used CWSI summed over daylight
    hours (CWSI-TT, CWSI time threshold) as a trigger for automatic irrigation scheduling
    in grain sorghum. Some researchers have studied the relationship of CWSI with
    leaf/stem water potential or another physiological response of crop to water stress,
    not many studies used these relationships to implement variable rate irrigation
    (Bellvert et al. 2013; Köksal et al. 2010). But temporal variation throughout
    the season in relationship between SWP and leaf temperature measurements is primary
    challenge to use these measurements for implementing VRI. Udompetaikul (2012)
    used a leaf energy balance equation to predict leaf temperature as a function
    of plant water status and microclimatic variables with a mobile sensor suite for
    almond and walnut crops. These prediction equations were used to classify trees
    as water-stressed and well-watered in almond, walnut, and grape crops (Dhillon
    et al. 2014). However, the prediction models were found to change as the season
    progressed (i.e., temporal variability), which suggested a need to calibrate these
    prediction equations multiple times during the season. Dhillon et al. (2017) developed
    a sensor system called “leaf monitor” to measure leaf temperature almost continuously
    (every 4 min) in order to track PWS throughout the season. The leaf monitor can
    be installed on a tree and is capable of measuring leaf temperature, air temperature,
    relative humidity, ambient light, and wind conditions continuously (every 4 min).
    Based on the challenges mentioned above faced in PWS detection, temporal variability
    in PWS throughout season, and VRI implementation based on PWS measurements, this
    research explored potential use of a leaf monitoring system to detect spatio-temporal
    adjusted plant water status and implement VRI schemes. The specific objectives
    of this study were: (1) to use leaf monitor data to compute the spatio-temporal
    adjusted Modified Crop Water Stress Index (MCWSI) to quantify plant water status
    of almond and walnut crops and to develop empirical relationships between MCWSI
    and SWP for almond and walnut crops (2) to use leaf monitor for monitoring plant
    water stress over the growing season for almond and walnut trees with three different
    irrigation treatments i.e. ET-based deficit, traditional grower irrigation, and
    SWP-based irrigation (3) to implement variable rate irrigation (VRI) using the
    MCWSI values derived from the leaf monitor data. The corresponding hypotheses
    for these objectives were: (1) there are crop specific empirical relationships
    between MCWSI values and SWP values in almond and walnut crops, (2) the leaf monitor
    derived MCWSI values can be used to monitor PWS of almond and walnut crops that
    are subject to different irrigation treatments, and (3) these MCWSI values can
    be used to implement VRI. Materials and methods Data collection Experiments were
    conducted during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons in almond and walnut orchards
    at the Nickels Soil Lab near Arbuckle, CA (Fig. 1). Both almond (Non-pareil variety)
    and walnut (Chandler variety) trees were 7 years old during the 2013 growing season.
    Parameters measured during this experiment were leaf temperature, air temperature,
    relative humidity, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), wind speed, SWP,
    amount of water delivered during irrigation events, and yield at the end of the
    season. Leaf temperature and above-mentioned microclimatic parameters were logged
    on 16-min interval from mid-May to mid-October of both growing seasons using a
    device called “leaf monitor”. The leaf monitor consisted of an infrared sensor
    for measuring leaf temperature, a combination air temperature and relative humidity
    sensor, a PAR sensor, and a wind speed sensor. It can be installed on a tree branch
    to monitor a targeted leaf. Only shaded leaves were monitored in this study based
    on findings by Dhillon et al. (2014). Figure 2a, b shows leaf monitor installed
    on a walnut and almond leaf, respectively. Other than the sensors installed on
    a printed circuit board, the leaf monitor also consisted of a solar radiation
    diffuser dome and a wind barrier to ensure consistent light conditions and reduced
    wind speed around the leaf. More information about development of the leaf monitor,
    sensors and other components, installation procedures, and performance is discussed
    in Dhillon et al. (2017). Each leaf monitor unit was connected to a solar-powered
    eKo Pro Wireless Sensor Node (Memsic Inc., Andover, MA) for power and data communication.
    These nodes formed a wireless mesh network in the orchard and requested data from
    the leaf monitor every 16 min, and leaf monitor sensors made measurement every
    4 min and reported the averaged data on request by a node. Ultimately, data were
    transmitted to a gateway computer thorough a network of nodes and repeaters where
    they were stored in a database and could be uploaded to the web. Fig. 1 Field

    a walnut tree (without solar radiation diffuser) and b almond tree (with solar
    radiation diffuser) for field testing Full size image Reference plant water status
    measurements of trees on which leaf monitors were installed were obtained using
    a pressure chamber (Model 3005, Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara,
    CA 1) that measured mid-day SWP (measured at solar noon ± 1 h) on the first day
    after irrigation and then every day (or, in some cases, on alternate days) until
    the next irrigation. Actual tree water stress level was defined with respect to
    baseline stem water potential (BSWP), which is defined as maximum SWP achieved
    when the plant is fully irrigated at a given environmental condition. BSWP for
    almond (McCutchan and Shackel 1992) and for walnut crops (unpublished work) are
    given as function of Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) as follows: $${\text{Almond:}}\quad
    BSWP = -\,0.120\left( {VPD} \right) -\, 0.410$$ (4a) $${\text{Walnut:}}\quad BSWP
    = -\, 0.064\left( {VPD} \right){-}\, 0.278$$ (4b) Coefficients in empirical Eq.
    4 should be good for any location for the VPD range of 1–5 kPa. Then, deficit
    stem water potential (DSWP) was calculated using Eq. 5 presented below: $${\text{Deficit}}\;{\text{SWP}}
    = \;{\text{Baseline}}\;{\text{SWP}}\,{-}\,{\text{mid-day}}\;{\text{SWP}}$$ (5)
    A higher magnitude of DSWP indicates higher water stress at the time of measurement.
    Irrigation treatments A drip irrigation system was used in both orchards. The
    remote irrigation setup with eKo wireless sensor nodes, actuators, and latching
    solenoid valves to apply the desired amount of water was implemented using reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) from the nearest California Irrigation Management Information
    System (CIMIS) weather station at Colusa, CA (Jimenez-Berni 2013). Crop ET (ETc)
    was calculated using crop coefficients for almond and walnut crops, respectively.
    Irrigation dates and irrigation amounts (in minutes) were recorded for each tree
    during each irrigation event. Pressure sensors (P51-100-S-A-I36, SSI Technologies
    Inc., Janesville, WI) were installed on the drip lines, which were connected to
    the same network. These sensors recorded the time for which irrigation water was
    applied. The irrigation system flow rate was calibrated by collecting water delivered
    from emitters using catch can method. Three different irrigation treatments listed
    below were used to achieve different water stress levels and plant water status
    was measured (i.e., mid-day SWP) for all trees under all treatments. (1) ET-based
    irrigation Trees were irrigated to replace 60% of ETc (i.e., ET-based deficit
    irrigation). (2) Grower irrigation Trees were irrigated with the grower’s customary
    irrigation management practice, which was based on measuring soil moisture contents
    at a single location at three different depths in a nearby plot. These trees were
    normally irrigated two times a week. Grower irrigation was monitored, and the
    amount of water applied as a percentage of ETc was calculated for both crops.
    (3) SWP-based irrigation The amount of water delivered was adjusted iteratively
    to maintain trees’ SWP levels mid-way between the SWP level of other two treatments
    (i.e., ET-based and grower irrigation). Management zones Previous grower experience
    and plant water stress data from the 2012 growing season indicated that there
    was substantial spatial variability in plant water stress levels even when the
    trees in our experimental plots were subjected to uniform irrigation management.
    Therefore, three management zones were developed based on three plant parameters
    measured in 2012. Variables used for zone delineation were (a) average measured
    SWP throughout season 2012, (b) yield produced by trees for 2012 season, and (c)
    average PAR absorbed by the trees at mid-day. Average PAR absorbed by tree is
    directly proportional to the canopy size of the tree and was measured by Rojo
    et al. (2014) as part of another study. Management Zone Analyst (MZA v1.0.1, USDA-ARS)
    assigned each tree to one of the three zones, named as zones 1, 2 and 3 which
    represented high, medium, and low water requirement areas in the orchard, respectively.
    Trees in the orchard were divided into blocks of five consecutive trees along
    the same row and new drip lines were added to deliver irrigation independently
    to each block. Treatments were assigned randomly in each management zone for fifteen
    such blocks for each crop, as shown in Fig. 3. Blocks were always within a single
    management zone and did not cross the border between management zones. Nine leaf
    monitors per crop were installed—one for each treatment in each management zone.
    All trees under all three treatments were given the same amount of fertilizer
    at the same time through a separate irrigation line controlled by the grower.
    Any other chemical applications (pesticides, herbicides, etc.) administered through
    sprayers or cultural operations were also similar for all three treatments and
    were implemented by the grower using established practices. Fig. 3 Layout of assignment
    of irrigation treatments to all fifteen blocks of five trees in almond and walnut
    orchards and installation of nine leaf monitor (LM) units Full size image MCWSI
    calculation Data were analyzed using the SAS software package (SAS Institute,
    Inc. v.9.3 Cary, NC). The SAS program was used to organize the leaf monitor, SWP,
    and irrigation data. As mentioned earlier, the wireless nodes recorded leaf temperature,
    air temperature, relative humidity, PAR, and wind speed approximately every 16
    min. Moving-average of four such data points was calculated and recorded from
    10:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. to filter out data when transpiration level was significant
    lower with respect to solar noon. Using these data, several parameters were calculated
    for further analysis: (i) saturation vapor pressure \(\left( {{\text{e}}_{\text{s}}
    [{\text{T}}_{\text{air}} ]} \right)\) at air temperature Tair, (ii) vapor pressure
    deficit (VPD), and (iii) slope of saturated vapor pressure–temperature relation
    (∆) for air temperature Tair. It should be noted that in Eq. 1, the dependent
    variable ΔT and the independent variable VPD are both calculated using measured
    Tair. Temperature of the leaf, TLeaf, was a tree parameter measured by the leaf
    monitor (not calculated using any of the microclimatic parameters). To overcome
    issues related to terms related Tair appearing on both sides of Eq. 1, a new method
    was proposed in which TLeaf was used as the dependent variable for developing
    a baseline for the well-watered condition. It was assumed that TLeaf at the well-watered
    condition was a function of Tair, PAR, Δ, and VPD based on energy balance equation
    of plant tissue (Jones 2013). Hence, in this method, the well-watered baseline
    was expressed in a functional form as follows: $$T_{L}^{ww} = f\left( {T_{air}
    ,VPD,PAR,\Delta } \right)$$ (6) However, it was found that independent variables
    Tair, VPD, and Δ were highly correlated to each other, as Tair was being used
    in calculation of VPD and Δ, and there was high multi-collinearity when regression
    coefficients were estimated for these variables. Therefore, the first principal
    component was calculated using these three variables (i.e., Prin1 = f (Tair, VPD,
    Δ)), which explained more than 95% of variability. The well-watered baseline equation
    is represented as Eq. 7. $$T_{L}^{ww} = f\left( {PRIN1, PAR} \right)$$ (7) Many
    studies in the literature used the ΔTstr as the intercept of the well-watered
    line (ΔTsat) or sometimes ΔTstr = 5 °C as a stressed baseline (Cohen et al. 2005;
    Möller et al. 2007; Alchanatis et al. 2009; Meron et al. 2010). However, Sammis
    et al. (1988) used ΔTstr = 6 °C and 4 °C for open and closed canopy, respectively,
    in pecan trees. It should be noted that all of these studies were conducted using
    sunlit canopies. A water-stressed sunlit canopy/leaf is expected to be at a higher
    temperature than air temperature, as evaporative cooling of the leaf is restricted
    by limited transpiration. Based on the conclusions found in previous study by
    Dhillon (2015) on sunlit and shaded leaves for prediction of plant water status,
    leaf temperatures of only shaded leaves were measured in this study; for shaded
    leaves, leaf temperature is lower than air temperature even for stressed trees.
    Therefore, ΔT was calculated as (Tair − TLeaf) instead of (TLeaf − Tair) because
    (TLeaf − Tair) was found to be a negative number for shaded leaves for well-watered
    to water-stressed conditions. A value of ΔTstr = 0.75 was determined with an iterative
    trial and error method to represent the fully water-stressed baseline, which was
    found to produce a good sensitivity for MCWSI. Assuming a value of ΔT = 0.75 for
    a fully water-stressed condition implies that a shaded water-stressed leaf is
    0.75 °C cooler than the ambient air temperature, perhaps due to convective heat
    loss from the leaf. So, the equation for the water-stressed baseline becomes \(T_{L}^{str}
    = T_{a} + 0.75\). Therefore, MCWSI was calculated using Eq. 8. $$MCWSI = \frac{{T_{L}
    - T_{L}^{ww} }}{{T_{L}^{Str} - T_{L}^{ww} }}$$ (8) Please refer to Dhillon et
    al. (2017) for additional details on MCWSI calculation. Spatio-temporal variability
    in MCWSI One of the objectives of this study was to explore the spatial and temporal
    variation of the water stress levels in the trees, as it has been reported that
    relationships between canopy temperature, plant water stress, and micro-climatic
    conditions changes throughout the season (Udompetaikul 2012; Dhillon et al. 2014).
    Idso (1982) also found temporal variability for barley and wheat crops, and developed
    two well-watered baselines corresponding to pre-heading and post-heading growing
    phases for those crops. To properly account for the temporal variability in MCWSI,
    we proposed a methodology that updated the well-watered baseline after every irrigation.
    This temporal scale was selected to ensure that well-watered baseline is updated
    after every irrigation that accounts effect of last irrigation and seasonal variations
    in plant water requirements. Temporal variability was accounted for by developing
    a new well-watered baseline for each irrigation event. This method allowed to
    correct for changes that occur in plant water requirements due to weather, plant
    phenological stage, or stress history for a specific tree. The first or second
    day after irrigation was selected as the reference day. Data corresponding to
    the reference day were used to develop well-watered baselines, as described below,
    where α1, α2, and α3 are regression coefficients for the reference day: $$T_{L}^{ww
    } = \left( {\alpha_{1} + \alpha_{2} PRIN1_{1} + \alpha_{3} PAR_{1} } \right)$$
    (9a) The coefficients corresponding to the reference day were used to calculate
    \(T_{L}^{ww }\) for nth day after the irrigation event, as follows: $$T_{L}^{ww
    } = \left( {\alpha_{1} + \alpha_{2} PRIN1_{n} + \alpha_{3} PAR_{n} } \right)$$
    (9b) Then, MCWSI values were calculated using Eq. 8. For each irrigation, coefficients
    α1, α2, and α3 were updated to compensate for any temporal changes. Spatial variability
    was accounted for by developing well-watered baselines per tree (or zone, in some
    cases). Variable rate irrigation using MCWSI MCWSI values measured using the leaf
    monitor data from the 2013 season and most of the 2014 season were regressed against
    measured DSWP. A relationship was found between MCWSI and DSWP (discussed in the
    results section and shown in Table 2). In light of this relationship, daily MCWSI
    was used to implement VRI by making irrigation decisions and to adjust crop evapotranspiration,
    ETc, before the irrigation. VRI was implemented as preliminary experiment for
    6 weeks at the end of season 2014. If measured SWP for a tree was higher than
    threshold SWP or critical SWP (CSWP), the tree was considered water-stressed.
    Dhillon et al. (2014) reported equations to calculate critical SWP (CSWP) based
    on BSWP that was influenced by weather conditions and crop. These equations are
    as follows: $${\text{Almond:}}\;{\text{CSWP}}\left( {\text{MPa}} \right) = {\text{BSWP}}\,{-}\,0.8$$
    (10a) $${\text{Walnut:}}\;{\text{CSWP}}\left( {\text{MPa}} \right) = {\text{BSWP}}\,{-}\,0.4$$
    (10b) Using the recommended CSWP, a critical value of MCWSI was calculated based
    on the relationship found between DSWP and MCWSI. A technique was presented to
    use critical value of MCWSI to adjust irrigation amounts, as it was assumed that
    irrigation frequency is mostly decided by availability of water, especially where
    water supply is limited, like in the Central Valley of California. Usually, irrigation
    was applied twice a week for these orchards, however for the VRI experiment irrigation
    was conducted once a week with objective of saving water. Management factor, f,
    was calculated (Eq. 11) based on critical MCWSI and was used in Eq. 12 to calculate
    adjusted crop evapotranspiration, ETc, where ETo is reference evapotranspiration
    (ET), Kc is crop coefficient, and \(f\) is management factor. MCWSI was calculated
    on the day of irrigation and used to adjust the amount of water to be delivered
    at night during irrigation. $$f = 1 + \left( {measured\;MCWSI - critical\;MCWSI}
    \right)$$ (11) $$ET_{c} = f*K_{c} *ET_{o}$$ (12) This method allowed us to increase
    the amount of water proportionally if a tree was stressed more than the critically
    stressed condition, and reduce the amount of applied water if a tree was found
    to be less stressed than critically stressed condition before irrigation. Results
    and discussion Results are discussed in three sections as per each objective of
    this study: Spatial temporal variability in MCWSI and its relationship to SWP
    Spatio-temporal MCWSI Leaf monitor data were downloaded from the gateway in CSV
    format and were used to calculate MCWSI automatically using data around solar
    noon (1:00–4:00 p.m.) for all trees on which leaf monitors were installed. Figure
    4 shows calculated MCWSI values for one irrigation event each for an almond and
    a walnut tree and depicts the typical trend in the stress index found in most
    of the data. The X-axis displays the “days after the last irrigation event”. As
    expected, MCWSI had very low or close to zero values for the first day after an
    irrigation event, and it further decreased for the second day, indicating that
    the tree was still recovering from water stress on the second day after irrigation.
    On the third day after the irrigation event, there was a rapid increase in the
    stress index. The indices reached a plateau after approximately 8–10 days after
    irrigation. MCWSI values depend on the difference between air temperature and
    leaf temperature, and according leaf energy balance equation, leaf temperature
    further depends on transpiration rate from leaf surface. Therefore, lower leaf
    temperature or lower MCWSI values after irrigation event corresponds to higher
    transpiration rate. The trees transpired at the maximum potential level for the
    first 3 days, and then there were sudden decreases in transpiration rates as the
    trees became water-stressed. Following this rapid decrease in transpiration, the
    trees continued to transpire at very low levels, which corresponded to highest
    stomatal resistance for a leaf at particular light level and environmental conditions.
    This pattern was observed most of the time in both crops with some differences
    in number of days it took to reach the maximum potential transpiration following
    an irrigation event, and different saturation levels for different trees depending
    on weather conditions. It should be noted that plots shown in Fig. 4 correspond
    to preliminary experiments conducted to explore the response of the leaf monitor
    to plant water stress induced by withholding irrigation. Typically, irrigation
    in these orchards was done twice a week so that such high stress levels that lead
    to almost total stomatal closure never occurred. Fig. 4 Typical pattern of MCWSI
    values after an irrigation event for a almond and b walnut trees Full size image
    A crucial step towards bringing precision irrigation to practice is the mapping
    of spatial and temporal variability in plant water status. To compensate for spatial
    and temporal changes throughout the season in MCWSI, tree-specific well-watered
    baselines were calculated for the reference day after every irrigation event using
    Eq. 9. Data corresponding to 2 days after irrigation (reference day) were used
    for well-watered baseline calculations. By definition, MCWSI values become zero
    for the reference day. However, there was a concern about assuming unique saturation
    baselines for each tree due to the possibility that a tree was not at its saturation
    condition even after irrigation or on the first or second day after irrigation.
    It was expected that trees in 60% deficit ET treatment might be water-stressed
    even after irrigation. Therefore, it was not possible to calculate tree-specific
    saturation baseline for trees in 60% deficit ET treatment. This phenomenon was
    statistically tested with DSWP data collected on the first or second day after
    an irrigation event to determine if trees in this treatment were significantly
    different from trees in the other two treatments using ANOVA. The sample size
    required for this analysis for a power of 0.95 was 27 in order to detect differences
    between means that exceed twice the variance when using the sample size determination
    technique (Kutner et al. 2005). Sample sizes of 33 and 60 were used in this analysis
    for almond and walnut crops, respectively, thus assuring a power of at least 95%
    for the statistical tests. This analysis showed that water stress levels of almond
    trees did not differ from each other for all treatments after irrigation (p value
    of 0.1131). Therefore, it was assumed that all almond trees achieved the saturation
    level after irrigation, and unique saturation baselines were developed for each
    tree. On the other hand, walnut trees with the 60% ET deficit treatment were significantly
    different from the two other treatments (p value was 0.0047 in this case). Therefore,
    ET-based walnut trees did not reach the same low stress level (i.e., saturation
    level) as grower- and stress- based trees, even after irrigation. This suggests
    that these trees should not be considered as well-watered trees even after irrigation.
    Therefore, the saturation baseline for walnut trees was calculated as zone-specific
    rather than tree-specific. Grower-based trees in the same zone were used to produce
    the saturation baseline. This suggests that it was important to calculate zone-specific
    saturation baselines to adjust for spatial variability. The coefficients of saturation
    baseline changed throughout the season. Temporal variability was tested for the
    coefficient of principal component PRIN1 (first principle component of variables
    Tair, VPD, Δ). The ANOVA (analysis of variance) model tested for these analyses
    for almond and walnut crop given as Yijk = μ + αi + βj(i) + εijk, Where, Yijk = regression
    coefficient of prin1 from saturation baseline equation for kth observation for
    jth irrigation event within ith year, αi = year, βj(i) = irrigation event nested
    within year, εijk = error term for kth observation for jth irrigation event within
    ith year. Results showed that the coefficient of PRIN1 for all irrigations events
    were significantly different throughout the season. Table 1 lists the results
    of ANOVA for the almond and walnut crops. One or more coefficients in saturation
    baseline are significantly different for at least one irrigation event at a significance
    level of 0.05 throughout the season for both crops. The p value was 0.0179 and
    0.0011, for the almond and walnut crops, respectively. Table 1 ANOVA table for
    testing variability in coefficient of first principal component in saturation
    baseline for the almond and walnut crops Full size table Tukey’s multiple comparison
    test was used to check the differences in coefficients for different irrigations.
    As expected, coefficients of PRIN1 for irrigation events were different from each
    other as these coefficients were different for irrigation events throughout the
    season Overall, for walnut crop, of the total 55 irrigation events, ~ 1480 tests
    were conducted and in 17% of these tests coefficients of prin1 were significantly
    different. Similarly, for total 45 irrigation events for almonds, ~ 945 tests
    were conducted and in 12% of these tests coefficients of prin1 were significantly
    different. Baselines for irrigation events from early in the season showed significant
    change in coefficients in comparison to middle of the season and end of the season
    as weather changed significantly. Therefore, considering the variability throughout
    the season, saturation baselines should be updated throughout the season for better
    irrigation management. Seasonal variability of leaf temperature based on micro-climatic
    variables has been studied by Udompetaikul (2012). He developed multiple linear
    regression models to predict leaf temperature using measured micro-climatic variables
    in almond and walnut orchards. He found that leaf temperature predicted by a model
    that uses early season (July) micro-climatic data correlated very well with leaf
    temperature measured at the same time. This correlation resulted in R2 values
    of 0.9 and 0.85 in almond and walnut crops, respectively, with zero intercept
    and unit slope. When he used the same model to predict leaf temperature later
    in the season, the model predicted leaf temperature with R2 values of 0.78 and
    0.60 in almonds and walnut crops, respectively. Moreover, linear relationship
    between measured and predicted leaf temperature resulted in slopes of 1.53 and
    1.04 and intercepts of − 14.3 and 1.708 for almond and walnut crops, respectively.
    These results also show that the relationship between leaf temperature and environmental
    variables varies throughout the season. Therefore, saturation baselines should
    be updated throughout the season to accommodate for temporal variability. The
    reason for this variability in regression coefficients throughout the season could
    be different transpiration potential of trees at different phenological stages.
    A given tree’s transpiration rate under saturated conditions can be affected differently
    by weather parameters, crop physiology, and interaction of these factors during
    the growth stages of bloom, canopy and fruit growth, and post-harvest. It has
    been mentioned in literature that transpiration levels for a crop can change throughout
    the season. Seasonal changes in transpiration have also been reported as a linear
    function of leaf area index(LAI) during time-period of bud-burst to the end of
    first flush expansion (mid-June) for oak trees, and transpiration for the later
    part of the season was found to be influenced by relative extractable water (REW)
    from soil (Bréda and Granier 1996). Variability in the regression coefficients
    suggests that it is important to consider temporal variability in a plant’s response
    for irrigation management decision making. With a high frequency leaf monitor
    data, it is possible to obtain these relationships in real-time by monitoring
    one or more trees in saturated conditions in an orchard or within a management
    zone, as long as there is a sufficient range in PAR and VPD during the time period.
    Overall, this spatio-temporal method of calculating saturation baseline allows
    to incorporate spatial and temporal variability, and makes it possible to manage
    irrigation at zone- or block- levels of trees, or even for individual tree levels,
    if required. Comparison of MCWSI with SWP The relationships among the MCWSI and
    SWP measured were studied as a means of establishing the pattern of crop physiological
    response to water stress. MCWSI has the potential to predict direct leaf or plant
    measurements and to provide a more convenient and less labor-intensive method
    to measure plant water status and its spatial pattern by having multiple leaf
    monitors in an orchard. For some irrigation events throughout the 2013 and 2014
    seasons, daily (or alternate day) mid-day SWP values were measured for the trees
    on which leaf monitors were installed for the comparison with MCWSI. DSWP values
    were calculated from measured SWP data by adjusting for VPD using Eqs. 4 and 5.
    MCWSI and DSWP were plotted together to see the trend for both curves following
    the irrigation. Figures 5 and 6 provide examples of comparison of MCWSI values
    with DSWP data for typical irrigation events in walnut and almond crops, respectively,
    with “days after irrigation” on the horizontal axes. A slight decrease in water
    stress was observed on the second day after irrigation, or even on the third day
    for some instances, and then increases in MCWSI and DSWP were observed as trees
    became water-stressed. These figures show that MCWSI follows similar trend and
    can be used to predict the overall DSWP trend. This is very important as usually
    it is not practical to obtain daily mid-day SWP data, and it is very difficult
    to automate irrigation systems based on SWP data. Fig. 5 MCWSI values calculated
    from leaf monitor data for typical irrigation events for walnut crops in comparison
    to same-day measured DSWP values Full size image Fig. 6 MCWSI values calculated
    from leaf monitor data for typical irrigation events for almond crops in comparison
    to same-day measured DSWP values Full size image Correlation between MCWSI and
    DSWP Since MCWSI had similar patterns to plant water stress following an irrigation
    event, so the data were analyzed to explore relationships between DSWP and stress
    index values. The plots of DSWP and MCWSI are shown in Fig. 7a, b for walnut and
    almond trees, respectively. Fig. 7 Comparison between DSWP and MCWSI values calculated
    for a walnut and b almond crops Full size image A linear relationship was found
    between DSWP and MCWSI for walnut crops (Fig. 7a) with coefficient of determination
    of 0.67. However, the relationship between DSWP and MCWSI for almond crops appeared
    to be curvilinear with (Fig. 7b) with coefficient of determination of 0.75. To
    check the possibility of a quadratic relationship, the square of the DSWP term
    was calculated, and a stepwise model selection technique was used to find the
    best model for the relationship between DSWP and MCWSI. The analysis indicated
    that both the linear and quadratic terms were highly significant for the almond
    crops. The selected models are listed in Table 2. Table 2 Stepwise model selection
    procedure for relationship of DSWP with MCWSI = f(DSWP, DSWP2) Full size table
    Similar results with coefficient of determination varying from 0.73 to 0.90 for
    different months throughout the season have been found when canopy temperature
    based index was compared with leaf water potential for cotton (Cohen et al.2005).
    Möller et al. (2007) predicted stomatal conductance using CWSI for grapevines
    for four different days throughout the season and also found linear correlation
    with coefficient of determination varying from 0.66 to 0.95. It should be noticed
    that current study used data from different months and different trees to develop
    correlation between DSWP and MCWSI after adjusting for spatial–temporal variability.
    Not many studies were found in literature where canopy temperature based index
    was used to predict SWP using data throughout the season. Figure 7b shows that
    there was negligible change in MCWSI values between 0 and 0.5 MPa (5 bar) change
    in DSWP, following which there was an increase in MCWSI values in the range of
    0.5–1.6 MPa of DSWP. These results suggest that the almond trees were transpiring
    at a maximum potential up to 0.5 MPa (or 5 bar) of DSWP water stress. On the other
    hand, walnut crops were sensitive even at small water stress and were showing
    decrease in transpiration rate even at low PWS of below 0.5 Mpa of DSWP as there
    was a linear increase in stress level, even at very low plant water stress. These
    results show that different crop’s response to water stress could be different.
    Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2018) also found these results in case of mandarin and late
    oranges crops for a regulated deficit irrigation experiment where 50–55% less
    water was applied as compared to control irrigation to study the impact on transpiration
    and yield and found that mandarin is less sensitive to water stress than late
    orange. Monitoring trees in different irrigation treatments using leaf monitors
    MCWSI was calculated for all trees that were monitored by LM in all three management
    zones for ET-based, SWP-based, and grower irrigation treatments. MCWSI values
    calculated for almond and walnut trees during the 2014 season are shown in Fig.
    8. This plot compares stress index values for trees with different irrigation
    treatments in the same management zone. As expected, Fig. 8a shows that ET-based
    deficit treatment (solid line) trees had higher water stress values for most of
    the season. Compared to the other two treatments, this treatment resulted in the
    lowest amount of water application and trees with the highest water stress levels.
    The almond crop had no irrigation for almost 3 weeks after mid-August because
    of harvest preparation. During that period, the grower treatment trees (dash line)
    were more stressed than the trees in the other two treatments. This may imply
    that trees in ET-based and SWP-based (dash dot line) treatments had adapted to
    some water stress by adjusting their root-to-shoot ratios or using other water
    stress adaption strategies as discussed by Chaves et al. (2002), whereas grower
    trees showed rapid increases in stress when irrigation was cut off. Similarly,
    Fig. 8b shows that the walnut trees with ET-based deficit irrigation treatment
    (solid line) were more stressed than other trees even though other trees were
    at similar stress levels for some part of the season (i.e., in late August and
    early September). There was some variability in the topography of the orchard
    leading to elevation differences within the same zone, particularly for the walnut
    crop. This situation influenced the stress levels of the trees because of surface
    runoff that caused water applied at one location to move to a different location.
    Some grower treatment trees at higher elevations may have been stressed because
    water was running off from those locations. Inclusion of a digital elevation map
    when creating management zones may help address this issue. Fig. 8 MCWSI calculated
    during the 2014 season on trees in the same management zones treated with three
    different irrigation treatments for a almond and b walnut crops (ET ET-based treatment,
    G grower irrigation treatment, SW SWP-based irrigation) Full size image At the
    end of each season, total irrigation water used by three treatments was calculated,
    and yields corresponding to the treatments were measured to calculate water productivity.
    As mentioned above, the water application rate for ET-based deficit irrigation
    treatment was controlled to 60% of ET requirements for both crops during the 2013
    and 2014 seasons. During the 2013 growing season, the SWP-based irrigation treatment
    used approximately 80% and 85% of ET requirements throughout the season (May to
    October) for almond and walnut crops respectively, and grower irrigation used
    more than 100% ET replacement for both crops. In the 2014 season, SWP-based irrigation
    treatment used approximately 70% of ET requirements throughout the season (May
    to October) for both crops, and grower irrigation used approximately 115% ET replacement
    for both crops. Exact amounts of water used (in liters and as percentages of ET)
    for the almond and walnut crops, measured yield, and water productivity data are
    provided in Table 3. Table 3 Amount of water used in liters and as a percentage
    of ET requirements for almond and walnut trees for three irrigation treatments
    during the 2013 and 2014 seasons Full size table For almond crop in 2013 and 2014
    and for walnut crop in 2013, grower management had the highest average yield,
    but the yields were not statistically different among the treatments at a significance
    level of 0.05 for this two-year study. These results are in accordance with regulated
    deficit irrigation (RDI) treatment experiment conducted by Stewart et al. (2011)
    for almond crop. In that study it was found that even though RDI applied 13% less
    water on average as compared to the control, there were no significant reductions
    in overall yield or amount of irrigation water used per gram of nutmeat. However,
    it was found that in another study that when high water savings about 40% for
    four continuous years were observed a significant reduction in yield (20%) was
    and a nonsignificant (3%) reduction in kernel dry mass Girona et al. (2005) were
    noticed. Water productivity (WP) of trees was calculated as the ratio of average
    yield (g) of a tree for a particular treatment to the average irrigation amount
    (liters) of a tree for that treatment. Almond trees had higher WP in comparison
    to walnut trees, and ET-based deficit irrigation treatment had the maximum WP
    for both almond and walnut crops, as depicted in Fig. 9. For 2013 almond crop
    data, WP for ET-based irrigation treatment was significantly higher than grower
    treatment, when tested statistically based on Tukey’s multiple comparison test
    at a significance level of 0.05. For 2013 walnut crop data, same test resulted
    that WP for ET-based irrigation treatment was significantly higher than grower
    and SWP-based treatments. These indicate that deficit irrigation could be more
    efficient compared to traditional grower practices, which is very useful especially
    in drought conditions. Similar results of higher WP for regulated deficit irrigation
    (RDI) treatment were also found by Goldhamer and Beede (2004) for experiment on
    pistachio trees to assess the impact of deficit irrigation during various parts
    of the season with the goal of determining which period was most stress tolerant
    in terms of nut production. For 2014 almond data, ET-based irrigation treatment
    had the maximum WP, but WP was not significantly different for the three treatments
    at a significance level of 0.05. In the case of the walnut crops, during 2014
    season, based on Tukey’s multiple comparison test, grower irrigation treatment
    had lower WP compared to the other two treatments at a significance level of 0.05.
    Fig. 9 Water productivities of almond and walnut trees assigned to different irrigation
    treatments during the a 2013 and b 2014 seasons (Note these results include water
    usage for the months of May to October only.) Full size image Variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) At the end of season 2014, this study demonstrated potential of using leaf
    monitor as a device to schedule VRI as a plant based method. Daily MCWSI data
    were used to implement variable rate irrigation to demonstrate the feasibility
    of using the leaf monitor as an aid to irrigation management. SWP data measured
    before irrigation were used to classify trees as water-stressed or as not water-stressed.
    Similar predictions were made using DSWP and MCWSI relationships provided in Table
    3. Table 4 highlights the results of prediction of water stress levels based on
    MCWSI. Then, management factors were used to calculate the amounts of water to
    be applied based on MCWSI before irrigation (Eqs. 11 and 12). Table 4 also provides
    the calculation of water applied based on MCWSI values. These estimations show
    that MCWSI values calculated using leaf monitor predictions result in correct
    water stress most of the time. Using management factors based on MCWSI values
    obtained before irrigation events, the VRI led to an average 39% reduction in
    water usage as compared to the fixed 100% ET replacement irrigation method for
    all trees. It should be noted that for data in Table 4, even trees that were not
    water-stressed were also irrigated, but irrigation amounts were adjusted, as irrigation
    frequency was decided by availability of water. VRI results show that there is
    potential for saving water by making decisions based on plant water stress, and
    the leaf monitor can be a useful device for this purpose. It is recommended that
    this VRI technique be implemented on more trees for an entire season, and yield
    quality and quantity data be compared with data from traditional methods of irrigation.
    Table 4 Variable rate irrigation (VRI) based on MCWSI measured before irrigation
    and comparison with a traditional method of irrigation Full size table Goal of
    irrigation scheduling system is to determine the irrigation frequency and duration.
    In this study, irrigation frequency was decided by the water availability and
    MCWSI values were used to calculate irrigation duration/amount. If irrigation
    water is available daily, MCWSI based on leaf monitor data has potential to be
    used to determine the irrigation frequency by following the daily trend of MCWSI.
    Software can be modified to alert the grower when critical MCWSI value is reached.
    There is a potential to use this technique as automated VRI method but more work
    is required in the future to implement the automation. It should also be tested
    during the whole growing season on different crops to verify the reliability.
    Conclusions In this study, a leaf monitoring system was used to predict plant
    water status. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the leaf monitoring
    system is a useful device to collect data that can be used to monitor spatio-temporal
    variations in crop water stress index values necessary to implement VRI. The leaf
    monitor data were used to develop tree-specific/treatment zone-specific Modified
    Crop Water Stress Index (MCWSI) values to quantify plant water stress levels.
    MCWSI values were correlated with measured plant water stress levels. Plant water
    stress levels were measured by measuring SWP and then subtracting the baseline
    to obtain deficit stem water potential (DWSP). Relationships between DSWP and
    MCWSI were developed for both crops. A linear relationship was found for walnuts,
    with a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.67. A quadratic relationship
    was found for almonds, with a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.75.
    Moreover, these results highlighted that at lower PWS of below 0.5 MPa of DSWP,
    almonds crops did not show any decrease in transpiration rate. However, when the
    stress level exceeded 0.5 MPa of DSWP, transpiration rate tended to decrease.
    On the other hand, walnut crop showed decrease in transpiration rate even at low
    PWS of below 0.5 MPa of DSWP. Temporal variability was noticed in PWS as it was
    found that coefficients of saturation baseline used for MCWSI method changed significantly
    throughout the season. The relationship between MCWSI and DSWP was used to implement
    variable rate irrigation or precision irrigation in the latter part of the 2014
    growing season. MCWSI values measured before irrigation were used to calculate
    irrigation amounts necessary for low frequency irrigation in walnut crops. Analysis
    showed MCWSI values can accurately predict plant water stress and can be used
    to adjust irrigation amounts. Moreover, on average, 39% less water was used for
    variable rate irrigation compared to the 100% ET replacement method. Based on
    these results, it is clear that the leaf monitor has the potential to be used
    as an irrigation scheduling tool in that it provided daily spatio-temporal stress
    index values that correlated well with traditional plant water stress measurements.
    Leaf monitor also offers few advantages that were reported as issues by other
    researchers i.e. inclusion of hot background soil during canopy temperature measurements,
    inconsistent light conditions on different parts of canopy, and changes in leaf
    angle and curling in water stressed canopies (Möller et al. 2007). Future studies
    should aim at (i) evaluating DSWP-MCWSI models for almond and walnut crops for
    VRI for complete and multiple seasons. (ii) evaluating leaf monitor and MCWSI
    for more crops and varieties to test its performance with respect to predicting
    water stress, convenience of use, and ability to assist in VRI management. Notes

  explanation: This study explored the use of canopy temperature and trunk diameter
    fluctuations to monitor water stress in citrus orchards. The authors found that
    maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) and canopy temperature - air temperature (TC - Ta)
    were highly sensitive to water stress compared to stem water potential and stomatal
    conductance. They concluded that MDS and TC - Ta could be used as suitable indicators
    for irrigation scheduling in citrus orchards with varying water stress conditions.
  extract_1: Maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) and TC – Ta showed high sensitivity to
    water stress in comparison to Ψstem and gS.
  extract_2: Significant relationships were found among MDS and TC – Ta with Ψstem
    and gS, for monitoring the crop water status by means of MDS vs Ψstem and TC –
    Ta vs Ψstem.

    2011 Abstract The continuous monitoring of crop water status is key to the sustainable
    management of water stress situations. Two deficit irrigation (DI) treatments
    were studied during the maximum evapotranspirative demand period in an orange
    orchard (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb. cv. Navelina): sustained deficit irrigation
    irrigated at 55% crop evapotranspiration (ETC), and low-frequency deficit irrigation
    treatment, in which the plants were irrigated according to stem water potential
    at midday (Ψstem). Additionally, a control treatment irrigated at 100% of ETC
    was established. The daily canopy temperature (TC) was measured with an infrared
    thermometer camera together with measurements of trunk diameter fluctuations (TDF),
    Ψstem and stomatal conductance (gS). The time course of all physiological parameters
    and their relationships were analysed, confirming that canopy air temperature
    differential (TC – Ta) variations and TDF are suitable approaches for determining
    the water stress. In addition, the maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) and TC – Ta showed
    high sensitivity to water stress in comparison to Ψstem and gS. Significant relationships
    were found among MDS and TC – Ta with Ψstem and gS, for monitoring the crop water
    status by means of MDS vs Ψstem and TC – Ta vs Ψstem. Thus, the combination of
    these techniques would be useful for making scheduling decisions on irrigation
    in orchards with high variability in plant water stress. Additional keywords:

    all metrics Abstract Variable-rate irrigation by machines or solid set systems
    has become technically feasible, however mapping crop water status is necessary
    to match irrigation quantities to site-specific crop water demands. Remote thermal
    sensing can provide such maps in sufficient detail and in a timely way. In a set
    of aerial and ground scans at the Hula Valley, Israel, digital crop water stress
    maps were generated using geo-referenced high-resolution thermal imagery and artificial
    reference surfaces. Canopy-related pixels were separated from those of the soil
    by upper and lower thresholds related to air temperature, and canopy temperatures
    were calculated from the coldest 33% of the pixel histogram. Artificial surfaces
    that had been wetted provided reference temperatures for the crop water stress
    index (CWSI) normalized to ambient conditions. Leaf water potentials of cotton
    were related linearly to CWSI values with R 2 = 0.816. Maps of crop stress level
    generated from aerial scans of cotton, process tomatoes and peanut fields corresponded
    well with both ground-based observations by the farm operators and irrigation
    history. Numeric quantification of stress levels was provided to support decisions
    to divide fields into sections for spatially variable irrigation scheduling. Similar

    Site-specific irrigation may be defined as matching water application in time
    and quantity to actual crop needs at the smallest manageable scale to achieve
    the desired crop responses. As variable-rate water application technology is already
    available, field scale application will depend on the ability to map the variation
    in crop water status (Camp et al. 2006). Devices for point sensing of soil or
    crop water status that use wireless communication are abundant and can be connected
    to the irrigation machines for real time control (e.g. Peters and Evett 2004;
    Kim et al. 2007). Applying enough of them to match the spatial variability, however
    will be prohibitive in terms of cost with current technology (Or 1995; Schmitz
    and Kuyper 1998; Schmitz and Sourell 2000). Remote thermal imagery is a viable
    alternative to point measurements, since the canopy temperature of the whole field
    can be measured at once, and a map of the distribution of plant water status in
    the field can be produced. Evaluation of relevant crop temperatures by pattern
    recognition of sunlit leaves (Leinonen and Jones 2004; Cohen et al. 2005) may
    approximate the theoretical ‘big leaf’ temperature for heat balance calculations.
    However, this method is limited to very fine pixel resolutions and it requires
    exact co-registration of the thermal image with the visible one, which limits
    the practicality of aerial surveys. Histogram processing of image frames, taken
    at a pixel size of less than half the width of the cropped fraction in a partially
    covered canopy, enables separation of canopy from soil temperatures as they correspond
    to different portions of the histogram (Meron 1987). The coldest 33% of the remaining
    canopy related pixels after separating soil can be used as the representative
    ‘cold’ crop temperature for water stress evaluation, as demonstrated in Meron
    and Charitt (2003). More detailed evidence to support this procedure is in preparation.
    The widely accepted concept of the crop water stress index (CWSI) (Jackson et
    al. 1981) is defined as a fraction of the canopy temperature between an upper
    (dry) and a lower (wet) reference under ambient conditions. The relation between
    ambient conditions and a variety of baselines and references have been investigated
    over the years. Empirical well watered base lines introduced initially with CWSI
    were found later to be strongly related to specific conditions (Idso 1982). Temperatures
    of natural surfaces such as a well watered crop (Gardner et al. 1992a, b) are
    good indicators, but such surfaces need dedicated maintenance, which impedes the
    implementation of this approach at the production scale. Reference temperatures
    derived from foliage that has been wetted or greased are mainly useful for micro-scale
    methods (Jones, 1999). Wetted reference surfaces constructed of manmade materials
    are well-defined and reproducible indicators of ambient conditions, with some
    limitations at non-turbulent wind velocities (Meron and Charitt 2003). The area
    covered by a thermal survey system is defined by swath width (sensor array width
    multiplied with the pixel size on the ground) and velocity. Pixel size is limited
    to the largest size that will enable the separation of soil temperatures and detection
    of fractions of canopy temperature; this is usually smaller than half of the width
    covered by the crop row. Flight velocity is limited by shutter speed, which determines
    pixel sharpness. Cooled imagers are fast and sharp, but expensive. Bolometric
    thermal imagers are more widely used because they are more affordable. However,
    their acquisition speeds of 1/140 to 1/200 s are too slow to freeze motion. Aerial
    or ground surveys with bolometric cameras must slow down to eliminate blur, or
    the processing must be able to handle blurred images and enlargement of the pixel
    size because of pixel ‘smear’ in the direction of movement. Economic thermal mapping
    depends on the system’s capacity to cover the area in a given time. One of the
    options to enhance the capacity is to skip swaths and frames, and then interpolate
    CWSI values to generate maps. The objective of this work was to establish the
    relation of crop stress properties to a remotely measured thermal index, and to
    explore the feasibility of mapping crop stress by remote thermography for site-specific
    irrigation. Materials and methods High resolution ground surveys on a single field
    Location Ground-based measurements were obtained during the summer of 2007 at
    a commercial cotton (Gossypium hirsutum x barbadense hybrid c.v. Acalpi) field
    in the Hula Valley of Israel (N33.11, E35.35). The soil at the site is a brown
    alluvial hydromorphic gromosol, and the climate is Mediterranean. The field was
    selected as an experimental site from previous observations of variable crop development,
    apparently related to very variable soil water-holding characteristics caused
    by the spatially variable alluvial deposits. The cotton was planted in 0.96 m
    spaced rows, cultivated by conventional methods, and was free of pests and diseases.
    The crop was irrigated uniformly with a lateral moving sprinkler system. Irrigation
    was scheduled by the grower, based on recommendations from the extension service
    and available water supply. Potential evapo-transpiration (ETp) was evaluated
    from a nearby weather station by a modified Penman formula, similar to the CIMIS
    grass reference (Craddock 1994) method. Watering dates and amounts related to
    ETp are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Evaporative demand (70 and 100% ETp), irrigation
    amounts and survey events (arrows) in the monitored field at the Hula Valley 2007
    Full size image Thermography A FLIR (Bilerica, MA) model SC2000 radiometric infrared
    (IR) camera, equipped with a 45º FOV lens, was mounted about 5 m above crop level,
    3 m left of the boom center and pointing straight down 180° to zenith on the spraying
    boom of a TECNOMA model “Laser 4000” self propelled, high pass sprayer (Epernay,
    France) (Fig. 2). The camera was remotely controlled by FLIR ThermaCam™ software
    on an IBM ThinkPad laptop. A GPS receiver (MID-TECH model RX 400p) with 1–3 m
    spatial accuracy was mounted on the sprayer and connected to the same computer.
    Images were captured and locations were measured every second. The IR images were
    matched to location by the computer’s clock. Fig. 2 Infrared scanner mounted on
    a high pass sprayer Full size image Sampling Ten sampling sites were selected
    along a crop row that displayed very variable soil water holding capacity and
    were marked with a 2 m high fiberglass pole for repeated examinations (Fig. 3).
    The sites were selected by a visual examination of crop development before the
    start of irrigation. Two young, sunlit, fully expanded leaves within 0.5 m of
    each marking pole were sampled for leaf water potential (LWP) using a pressure
    chamber (Ari-Mad, Israel). The LWP was determined on every scanning day within
    15 min of the field scan. Leaves to be used for LWP analysis were wrapped with
    aluminum foil at cutting and pressurized while wrapped as described by Meron et
    al. (1987). Plant height from ground level to the main stem tip was recorded weekly
    on the marking pole for each sampled plant until the cessation of growth. Fig.

    and reference surfaces The artificial reference surface (ARS) was placed at the
    edge of the field, together with the weather station. It consisted of a wet, white,
    non-woven viscose-polyester fabric in a double layer covering a polystyrene float.
    The float was placed in a 0.4 × 0.3 m water-filled plastic box, and the fabric
    was kept constantly wet via a wick from the water. An Apogee (Logan UT) IR thermal
    sensor mounted 0.1 m above the surface recorded ARS temperatures. The sensor was
    connected to a Campbell Scientific (Logan UT) system comprising a CR10X data logger,
    an air temperature and relative humidity sensor (Vaisala model HMP50), a global
    radiation sensor (Li-Cor model 200X) and a rotating cup anemometer (RM Young model
    3101) at 2 m elevation. Values were measured at intervals of 6 s and averages
    were recorded every minute. Image processing Images were processed in Visual Basic
    5 using OLE automation functions provided in the FLIR Researcher™ package. First,
    the histogram of the image was constructed with 256 bins in the 19–45.5°C range
    and an interval of 0.1°C. Next, only pixels within the temperature limit described
    by Eq. 1 were retained, assuming that temperatures outside this range are not
    canopy-related. $$ \left( {T{\text{air}}- 10} \right) < T{\text{pixel}} < \left(
    {T{\text{air}} + 7} \right), $$ (1) where Tair (°C) is air temperature and Tpixel
    (°C) is the calibrated pixel temperature The cumulative average weights of the
    coldest 33% pixels were calculated by Eq. 2. $$ T{\text{canopy}} = {\frac{{\sum\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{0.33N} {T_{i} *f_{i} } }}{{\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^{0.33N} {f_{i} } }}}, $$
    (2) where T i (°C) is the temperature, f i is the number of pixels in each ith
    class of the histogram and 0.33 N is 33% of the pixels retained at the first step
    after the non crop related pixels were discarded.The CWSI was subsequently calculated
    by Eq. 3: $$ CWSI = {\frac{{T_{\text{canopy}} - T_{\text{ARS}} }}{{T_{\text{air}}
    + 5^{^\circ } - T_{\text{ARS}} }}}, $$ (3) where Tcanopy is the mean temperature
    of the 33% coldest pixels after discarding pixels hotter than 7°C from the air,
    TARS is the wet ARS temperature and Tair is air temperature (°C) at the time of
    image acquisition. Crop cover was determined by dividing the number of plant related
    pixels by the total number of pixels per square meter in the frame. Survey and
    mapping Six ground surveys were performed throughout the season. Swath widths
    were 4.5 m, except for the first survey which had 1.5 m swath widths. Frames were
    recorded every 3 m along the row, and the resulting frame area covered was 4.5–13.5
    m2 corresponding to the swath width. Distance between swaths ranged from 12 to
    24 m. Survey dates and the relevant details are given in Table 1. Table 1 Survey
    dates, times (GMT + 2), field cover and ambient conditions Full size table The
    center point of each CWSI frame was assigned to the corresponding GPS location
    as a point feature in an ArcView 9.2 GIS map (ESRI, Redland CA). The resulting
    grid densities of the CWSI points ranged from 3 × 24 m to 3 × 12 m (Table 1).
    Maps were generated by inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation of the CWSI
    points using inbuilt functions of ArcView 9.2 Spatial Analyst extension. Aerial
    survey To test the feasibility of the proposed method at a larger scale, an aerial
    survey was conducted over several field crops in the Hula Valley, Israel, on August
    20 2007; see ambient conditions over the area in Table 1. Thermography The radiometric
    imager (FLIR SC2000), equipped with a 45º FOV lens was mounted looking straight
    down over an opening in the aircraft floor, and the GPS antenna was mounted under
    the front windshield. Given the 0.20 s GPS acquisition interval at 40 m s−1 ground
    speed, location accuracy in the flight direction was ±8 m. Image acquisition was
    recorded at 2 frames s−1 with 0.01 s accuracy. Flights were directed along the
    rows by visible wheel paths of the lateral irrigation system in the sprinkler
    fields, and by flag bearers on the ground in the drip irrigated fields. The flight
    altitude was 45–50 m above ground, adhering to Israeli ceilings for agricultural
    aerial applications, which resulted in swath widths of 45–50 m. The ground pixel
    sizes obtained were about 0.15 m across the flight direction, but due to ‘smear’
    caused by the slow shutter speed pixel size increased to 0.3 m along the path.
    Image processing and map generation Original images of 45 × 33 m in size were
    subdivided during processing into six equal sub-frames of two rows and three columns
    covering a crop area of about 250 m2. The CWSI was evaluated for each sub-frame
    as described by Eqs. 1–3. The center location of each sub-frame was calculated
    from the frame’s GPS center point, elevation and azimuth data using basic trigonometry
    (Fig. 4). Each CWSI value was assigned to the center point of the sub-frame. Maps
    of water stress were generated in ArcView by IDW interpolation as described in
    the ground surveys. Fig. 4 Ground referenced thermal image showing image division
    and the points of CWSI assignments Full size image Results and discussion Ground
    measurements Site selection validation The first survey was done 1 day before
    the commencement of irrigation. An overview of the test area showing LWP sampling
    point locations overlaid on the June 18 CWSI map is shown in Fig. 5a. The extents
    of stress levels at the ten sampling points are illustrated in Fig. 6 where crop
    height, crop cover and LWP are closely correlated. Main stem elongation rates
    and LWP are established crop stress indicators in cotton (Grimes and Yamada 1982;
    Howell and Meron 2007). In the absence of watering before the first irrigation,
    the cotton consumed the water stored in the soil, and water stress developed as
    a function of the different water holding capacities of the soil in various sections
    of the field (Fig. 5). Plants growing in more sandy soil with low water holding
    capacity consumed all the available water, and remained small and deeply stressed.
    Conversely, plants growing in soil with higher water capacity flourished. Fig.
    5 Cotton CWSI maps of the field monitored in the Hula Valley acquired on six separate
    days by ground survey in 2007. The LWP sampling points for 18 June are shown in
    map a. Distance scale in 5 b Full size image Fig. 6 Relationships between crop
    cover, crop height and LWP on 18 June 2007, before the first irrigation in the
    monitored field Full size image Crop stress monitoring during the season The maps
    in Fig. 5 show the results from six ground surveys. Stress levels on the survey
    dates are the outcomes of irrigation timing and the amounts of water applied (Fig.
    1). The second survey (Fig. 5b) was done after the second irrigation, and the
    third survey (Fig. 5c) was immediately before the third irrigation was applied.
    The soil water deficit is evident from the ETp and water applied during the first
    two irrigations (Fig. 1, arrows 1 and 2). Corresponding plant stress levels in
    Fig. 5b and c show the deficit clearly, mainly in the soil with low water holding
    capacity. The amount of water applied was increased at the third irrigation to
    reach 100% ETp (Fig. 1, arrows 3–5). The fourth survey (Fig. 5d), immediately
    before the fourth irrigation, shows the moderate stress levels that were expected.
    In the fifth survey (Fig. 5e), before the fifth irrigation, the plants on the
    more sandy soil appear to be less stressed than those on soil with a higher water
    holding capacity. This contradiction can be explained, by the fact that plants
    grown in soil with a low water holding capacity were smaller, with reduced crop
    cover and less surface exposed to transpiration. Their estimated water consumption
    was closer to 70% ETp, therefore, with the amount of water applied to replace
    full ETp they were over irrigated. The last ground survey (Fig. 5f) was done after
    considerable stress was developed by reducing irrigation before defoliation. The
    stress is evident in the entire field, and it became more enhanced in the rapidly
    drying sandy soil. Relation of CWSI to leaf water potential Leaf water potentials
    (Fig. 7) correlated linearly (R 2 = 0.816) with CWSI over the full range of crop
    stress recorded during the season. The scatter is considerable in the part of
    the graph representing the well-watered range, from the origin to a CWSI of 0.4
    (~−1 to −1.5 MPa LWP). This scatter makes it difficult to fine-tune stress detection
    within this range. However, the stressed range above CWSI 0.4 is clearly discernible
    from the well-watered range. According to this result, CWSI can replace LWP for
    cotton water-stress evaluation, at least as an indicator of stress or no-stress.
    The importance of this finding is that it enables aerial thermography, which is
    a fast and efficient tool for monitoring and mapping crop stress over wide areas,
    to be used for managing irrigation Fig. 7 Relation of cotton CWSI to leaf water
    potentials in six scanning days, at the monitored field in the Hula Valley 2007
    Full size image Aerial survey The aerial surveys of August 20, 2007 included two
    lateral moves, one center pivot and one drip irrigated field. The peanut field
    (Fig. 8) was scanned while irrigation water was being applied; the lateral move
    position is indicated by the arrow. Mean CWSI levels and CWSI histograms, calculated
    from the interpolated values on the mapping grid, are shown on the figure. Stress
    levels are 0.2 CWSI units less after irrigation, and are less scattered on the
    histogram. In the drip-irrigated process tomato field (Fig. 9) stress levels are
    quite moderate, but less uniform than expected from such an even water distribution
    system. Factors other than water distribution uniformity appear to have contributed
    to the variation in crop stress in this field. Fig. 8 Water stress map of a peanut
    field during irrigation on 20 August 2007. Mean CWSI values are indicated ahead
    and behind the lateral move position (arrow) Full size image Fig. 9 Water stress

    The cotton field where the ground monitoring took place was scanned by the aerial
    survey 1 day before the final irrigation, and the stress map is shown in Fig.
    10. The western part of the field, where the irrigation cycle begins, is more
    stressed with CWSI values about 0.2 units higher than in the eastern part. Variation
    in stress levels evident in the field is the result of incremental outcomes of
    previous irrigations and soil water holding capacities; they are increasingly
    discernible with time after the previous irrigation. The polygon marked on the
    stress map in Fig 10 is less detailed compared to the ground stress maps of the
    same section (Fig. 5f) as the resolution of the aerial scan was much coarser than
    that of the ground scan. After the final irrigation in the center-pivot cotton
    field (Fig. 11), overall stress levels were high, but a difference of 0.14 CWSI
    units is still discernable between the earlier and more recent irrigation dates.

    management Moving irrigation machines Irrigation machines based on a center pivot
    or that move laterally can be sub-sectioned, and the sections can then be controlled
    separately with technology that already exists and with relatively little additional
    investment. The potential for variable-rate, site-specific water application is
    shown by Fig. 12, which was surveyed from the ground on June 18 (Fig. 5a) before
    the first irrigation. Once such maps are available there are several choices;
    for example, pre-irrigation of the stressed sections only or application of different
    amounts of water according to the stress levels. Other related spatial information
    derived from the same scan, such as crop cover and plant height, or other sources
    such as yield maps or soil information, could refine site-specific irrigation
    management further. Fig. 12 Management zones in a per-section controlled variable-rate
    lateral move irrigator. Scattered lines are wheel paths Full size image Solid
    set irrigation Maps provide valuable visual information, but they need additional
    processing to quantify the information for management. Digital map information
    on crop stress enables spatial statistics to be computed from the CWSI data on
    a grid, and numeric reporting of crop stress levels for each management zone (Fig.
    13). The grower can assess mean values of crop water status, the distribution
    of stress levels around the mean and the extent of water stress extremes in the
    field at a glance on the graph, without studying the maps. This is particularly
    important in solid set systems where irrigation is managed in whole units controlled
    by a single valve. When crop water stress is monitored routinely, short-term changes
    in stress levels from previous scans can be related directly to changes made in
    the management of irrigation. The CWSI mean and dispersal statistics also enable
    the scheduling of irrigation to suit drier, wetter or average stress levels. In
    the long term, stress maps enable reorganization of irrigation zones according
    to uniformity criteria. Fig. 13 Mean crop stress levels (CWSI) and their distribution

    Conclusions A set of thermal remote sensing surveys were conducted from ground
    and low flying aerial platforms in the Hula Valley of Israel to provide crop stress
    maps, a prerequisite of site-specific irrigation management. Leaf water potentials
    of cotton measured at 10 fixed sampling points during the season related linearly
    (R 2 = 0.816, n = 56) to CWSI at the same position, processed by the reported
    procedure. The range of values indicating stress was clearly separated from the
    well-watered range. This finding opens the door to simplification of thermal image
    evaluation by histogram analysis, eliminating the need for much more complex visible
    image co-registration and sunlit foliage pattern recognition processing. The CWSI
    maps generated from the ground surveys of the cotton field corresponded well to
    irrigation history and to the calculated soil water balance. Spatial variability
    in the aerial stress maps of peanuts, process tomato and cotton fields could have
    been related to distinct irrigation events on the ground. These results suggest
    that this method could be extended to other crops after crop specific calibration
    of the imagery. According to the methods tested and developed, aerial thermography
    can provide the maps needed for site-specific irrigation management. Post processing
    of the maps to indicate particular levels of stress in irrigation machine sections
    of the field can provide a template for the machine to deliver spatially variable
    rates of irrigation. Beyond direct visual evaluation, stress statistics in management
    zones derived from the map database, enables the grower to make quantitative scheduling
    decisions for both mobile or static irrigation. References Camp, C., Sadler, E.

    Abstract This study assessed the capability of several xanthophyll, chlorophyll
    and structure-sensitive spectral indices to detect water stress in a commercial
    farm consisting of five fruit tree crop species with contrasting phenology and
    canopy architecture. Plots irrigated and non-irrigated for eight days of each
    species were used to promote a range of plant water status. Multi-spectral and
    thermal images were acquired from an unmanned aerial system while concomitant
    measurements of stomatal conductance (gs), stem water potential (Ψs) and photosynthesis
    were taken. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), red-edge ratio
    (R700/R670), Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized
    by the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI), the Photochemical
    Reflectance Index using reflectance at 530 (PRI) and 515 nm [PRI(570–515)] and
    the normalized PRI (PRInorm) were obtained from the narrow-band multi-spectral
    images and the relationship with the in-field measurements explored. Results showed
    that within the Prunus species, Ψs yielded the best correlations with PRI and
    PRI(570–515) (r2 = 0.53) in almond trees, with TCARI/OSAVI (r2 = 0.88) in apricot
    trees and with PRInorm, R700/R670 and NDVI (r2 from 0.72 to 0.88) in peach trees.
    Weak or no correlations were found for the Citrus species due to the low level
    of water stress reached by the trees. Results from the sensitivity analysis pointed
    out the canopy temperature (Tc) and PRI(570–515) as the first and second most
    sensitive indicators to the imposed water conditions in all the crops with the
    exception of apricot trees, in which Ψs was the most sensitive indicator at midday.
    PRInorm was the least sensitive index among all the water stress indicators studied.
    When all the crops were analyzed together, PRI(570–515) and NDVI were the indices
    that better correlations yielded with Crop Water Stress Index, gs and, particularly,
    Ψs (r2 = 0.61 and 0.65, respectively). This work demonstrated the feasibility
    of using narrow-band multispectral-derived indices to retrieve water status for
    a variety of crop species with contrasting phenology and canopy architecture.

    Continuous advances in technology have promoted the use of unmanned aerial systems
    (UAS) for a large range of applications (Anderson and Gaston 2013). Precision
    agriculture is one of the most promising applications (Mulla 2013; Gago et al.
    2015) since low-cost UAS can be equipped with robust sensors providing very high
    resolution, such as miniaturized narrow-band and hyperspectral and thermal cameras
    used to remotely monitor vegetation (Bendig et al. 2012). Farm assessment by remote
    sensing using UAS enables crop monitoring from a closer range and a higher frequency
    than is currently possible with satellites. Inter- and intra-field variability
    of crops can then be assessed in detail providing farmers with crucial information
    to better optimize farm management and increase farmers’ profitability (Mulla
    2013). Water availability is becoming the most limiting factor for crop production
    in much of the world (Field 2014). This fact has increased the emphasis that policy-makers
    are placing on both demand and supply options to water management. Remote sensing
    takes on special significance within this context since it enables a better monitoring
    of large cultivated areas making it easier to assess the proper functioning of
    irrigation systems (for example, by identifying water-stressed areas or irrigation
    leaks with thermal images) and the precise management of plants water stress,
    which has been extensively pointed out in the literature (Taghvaeian and Neale
    2011) as a key factor to ensure the success of water-saving irrigation strategies
    based on irrigating plants below their full water requirements. High resolution
    thermal imagery has been successfully used in a variety of crops to assess the
    variability in plant water status at the field and farm scales (Bellvert et al.
    2013; Berni et al. 2009; Gonzalez-Dugo et al. 2012). Bellvert et al. (2013) mapped
    the spatial variability in leaf water potential of different vineyards based on
    high resolution thermal imagery and then used that information for scheduling
    irrigation. Similarly, Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013) identified water-stressed areas
    from thermal images in a farm composed of five fruit tree crops and based on the
    relationship between the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) and the stem water potential
    (Ψs) established a CWSI threshold for scheduling irrigation. Notwithstanding the
    suitability of thermal sensing for plant water stress assessment, alternative
    indices less sensitive to variations in the air vapor pressure deficit and more
    related to biophysical parameters such as the chlorophyll or xanthophylls pigment
    content are currently of interest (Zarco-Tejada et al. 2013). That is because
    in the field, in order to cope with drought, plants usually exhibit adaptive mechanisms
    at leaf level such as the dissipation of excitation energy (associated with an
    increase in the concentration of de-epoxidized xanthophyll cycle components),
    decrease in leaf chlorophyll concentration and down-regulation of photosynthesis
    (Chaves et al. 2002). Greenhouse experiments have shown that water stress periods
    of even eight days may have a significant effect on the content and organization
    of chlorophyll in the mesophyll (Albert and Thornber 1977). A variety of narrow-band
    optical indices obtained from remote sensing data have been related to leaf chlorophyll
    concentration (Haboudane et al. 2002; Zarco-Tejada et al. 2004). Combination of
    indices such as the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI)
    and the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) to give the TCARI/OSAVI
    index (Table 1), have been shown as more robust indices to estimate chlorophyll
    concentration than simple indices because of a lower sensitivity to soil background
    and crop leaf area index variations (Haboudane et al. 2002; Zarco-Tejada et al.
    2004). Table 1 Formulations used to obtain the vegetation indices: Photochemical
    Reflectance Index (PRI), normalized PRI (PRInorm), PRI using the reflectance band
    at 515 nm [PRI(570–515)], red edge ratio (R700/R670), Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized
    by the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) Full size table
    The narrow-band Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI, Table 1) proposed by Gamon
    et al. (1992), which is based on the xanthophylls cycle activation as a mechanism
    to dissipate the excess of energy when photosynthesis declines under conditions
    of stress, has been also successfully tested as a water stress indicator in several
    studies (Peguero-Pina et al. 2008; Suárez et al. 2010; Hernández-Clemente et al.
    2011). These authors, however, also pointed out that PRI is highly affected by
    factors such as canopy structure, viewing and illumination geometry effects, and
    background, which challenge its widespread use as a water stress indicator. Different
    formulations of PRI (based on different wavelength references) have been studied
    in this sense searching to overcome these limitations (Hernández-Clemente et al.
    2011). Recently, Zarco-Tejada et al. (2013) proposed a modified PRI-based index
    (PRInorm) to track the diurnal trends of water stress using a combination of a
    structural index (Renormalized Difference Vegetation Index, RDVI) and an index
    sensitive to the leaf chlorophyll content (the red edge ratio, R700/R670) to normalize
    PRI. The PRInorm index was tested in an experimental vineyard site in a diurnal
    setting, yielding higher correlations than PRI with the CWSI and the commonly
    used water stress indicators, leaf water potential and stomatal conductance (gs).
    Spectral indices have been usually evaluated in orchards consisting of a single
    crop. It is not uncommon for farms to be made up of several crop species with
    different canopy architectures, nutrient status and even phenological stages.
    Under these circumstances, the possibility of using a single multi-spectral index
    that could provide reliable information regarding the plant water status of all
    the co-existing crops in the farm would considerably simplify the farm assessment.
    With that objective in mind, a study was performed in a commercial farm consisting
    of five fruit tree crop species in which the capability of xanthophyll, chlorophyll
    and structure-sensitive spectral indices to track the effects of water stress
    on trees was assessed. The sensitivity of these indices to the imposed drought
    conditions were assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis as other authors (Goldhamer
    et al. 1999; Moriana and Fereres 2002; Intrigliolo and Castel 2006) have reported
    for the evaluation of alternative indirect physiological indicators. Thus, the
    specific objectives of the present work were: (i) to assess the sensitivity of
    xanthophyll, chlorophyll and structure-sensitive spectral indices to water stress
    conditions; (ii) to explore the relationship between the spectral indices and
    Ψs, gs and CWSI for each of the fruit tree crop species studied, and; (iii) to
    identify which of the spectral indices could more accurately track the water stress
    effects on trees when the five fruit tree crop species were assessed together.
    Materials and methods Site characteristics and irrigation treatments The study
    was performed in July 2010 in the same 42-ha commercial farm described in Pérez-Sarmiento
    et al. (2010) and Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013), located in the Mula Valley (37°55′N,
    1°26′W), Murcia (Spain), where the climate is considered as semi-arid Mediterranean.
    The annual reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and rainfall for the experimental
    season were 1182 and 445 mm, respectively. The farm consisted of five orchards
    planted in 1999 with almond (Prunus dulcis cv. Garrigues and cv. Ramillete), apricot
    (Prunus armeniaca cv. Bulida), peach (Prunus persica cv. Catherine), orange (Citrus
    sinensis cv. Lane Late) and lemon (Citrus x limon cv. Fino 49) trees. Each orchard
    was divided into 2–4 irrigation units, which enabled different irrigation managements
    and the development of contrasting plant water status. The number of irrigation
    units and other characteristics such as tree spacing, canopy ground cover and
    number of emitters per tree used within each orchard are shown in Table 2. At
    the time of the study (July), almond, peach, lemon and orange trees were being
    irrigated daily. In order to generate different levels of tree water status in
    these orchards, irrigation was withheld for eight days prior to the measurements
    in one single irrigation unit in the almond, lemon and orange orchards, and in
    two irrigation units in the peach orchard. Apricot trees, on the other hand, had
    already been harvested and water had not been applied since 24 days before the
    measurements date. Thus, to generate different water status in the apricot orchard,
    irrigation was resumed in one single unit eight days prior to the measurements.

    Multispectral images were acquired on July 7th at 13.00 h (local time; UTC + 1
    h) with a 6-band multispectral camera (MCA-6, Tetracam Inc., California, USA)
    installed on a two-meter wingspan fixed–wing UAS platform. The image resolution
    was 1280 × 1024 pixels with 10-bit radiometric resolution and optical focal length
    of 8.5 mm. The UAS (mX-SIGHT, UAV Services and Systems, Germany) was controlled
    by an autopilot for autonomous flying (AP04, UAV Navigation, Madrid, Spain) following
    a flight plan of around 1 h at 350 m above the ground and 5.8 kg take-off weight
    using waypoints to acquire imagery from the entire orchards under study. At this
    flight altitude, the camera delivered a ground resolution of 200 mm pixel-size.
    The autopilot had a dual CPU controlling an integrated attitude heading reference
    system (AHRS) based on a L1 GPS board, 3-axis accelerometers, gyros and a 3-axis
    magnetometer (Berni et al. 2009). The ground control station and the UAS were
    radio-linked, transmitting position, altitude and status data at 20 Hz frequency.
    The bandsets chosen for this study were centered at 515, 530, 570, 670, 700 and
    800 nm (10 nm bandwidths). The high-resolution of the multispectral imagery enabled
    the identification of every single crown within the orchard. A region of interest
    was established in the center of each crown to extract pure vegetation reflectance
    and to avoid soil background effect. Then, the different indices were calculated
    at the object level (crown). The average crown reflectance derived from the imagery
    of well-watered and deficit-irrigated trees for each of the five tree crop species
    studied is shown in Fig. 1. Reflectance values obtained for the six spectral bands
    enabled the calculation of vegetation indices sensitive to variations in canopy
    structure, chlorophyll and xanthophyll pigment content (Table 1). Fig. 1 Average
    crown reflectance derived from the imagery of well-watered (WW) and deficit irrigated
    (DI) trees for each of the five fruit tree crops studied Full size image The Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to track changes in canopy structure.
    Effect of treatments on the leaf chlorophyll concentration was assessed with the
    red edge index (R670/R700), which uses the reflectance at 670 and 700 nm wavelengths,
    and the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized by
    the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI). Finally, PRI, PRI
    using reflectance at 515 nm [PRI(570–515)] instead of 530 and PRInorm were also
    determined. The spectral indices were compared with Tc and CWSI, which were determined
    in a parallel study by Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013) in the same trees. Thermal
    images were obtained from a thermal camera (MIRICLE 307, Thermoteknix Systems
    Ldt., Cambridge, UK) also installed on the UAS during the study. Field data collection
    Concomitant measurements of Ψs and gs were taken during the flight in selected
    irrigated and non-irrigated trees from each species. Measurements were carried
    out by five teams composed of 3–5 people each with experience taking in-field
    determinations. The Ψs determinations were carried out with five Scholander pressure
    chambers (Model 600 Pressure Chamber, PMS Instrument Company, Albany, USA) in
    two mature leaves per tree covered with aluminum foil for at least 90 min before
    measurements. The number of trees used for the Ψs and other in-field determinations
    within each irrigation unit are shown in Table 3. The gs was measured in 2-4 sunny
    leaves per tree using a diffusion porometer (SC-1 porometer, Decagon, WA, USA)
    in the lemon, orange and peach crops and a portable photosynthesis system (LI-6400
    Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) equipped with a LI-6400/40 Leaf Chamber Fluorometer
    and a LICOR 6400-01 CO2 injector in the almond and apricot crops. Leaf gas exchange
    was measured on fully expanded leaves placed in a 200 mm2 leaf cuvette. The CO2
    concentration in the cuvette was maintained at 400 µmol·mol−1 (≈ambient CO2 concentration).
    Measurements were performed at saturating light intensity of 1800 µmol·m−2·s−1
    and at ambient temperature and relative humidity. The airflow was set to 300 μmol·s−1,
    which enabled also recording the leaf net CO2 assimilation. Additionally, three
    leaf samples were taken from selected irrigated and non-irrigated trees of all
    the species with the exception of peach to determine the leaf chlorophyll content
    (Table 3). For the leaf chlorophyll determination, approximately 30 mg leaves
    were sampled from the same, avoiding major veins. Chlorophyll was eluted from
    the leaf by submerging them in 3 ml of N, N-dymethylformamide in the dark for
    at least 72 h. The amount of absorbance was read at 647 nm and 664.5 nm with a
    Thermo Spectronic (model Helios alpha, UVA No. 092009, England) and used to calculate
    fresh mass-based chlorophyll content according to the equations of Inskeep and
    Bloom (1985). Table 3 Number of trees in which measurements of stem water potential
    (Ψs), stomatal conductance (gs), leaf net CO2 assimilation (photosynthesis) and
    leaf chlorophyll content (Chl) were taken within each irrigation treatment Full
    size table Weather conditions at the time of flights were recorded with a portable
    weather station (Model WXT510, Vaisala, Finland) placed just outside the orchard.
    Mean values for the air temperature, vapor pressure deficit and wind speed at
    the time of flight were 31.9 °C, 3.76 kPa and 1.9 m s−1, respectively. Statistical
    analysis Sensitivity of the spectral indices related to the water stress conditions
    was assessed by means of a sensitivity analysis (sensitivity defined as signal
    to noise ratio) based on that proposed by Goldhamer and Fereres (2001) and comparison
    with traditional indicators of plant water status. When there were significant
    differences between treatments, the value “signal” for Ψs, Tc and the vegetation
    indices was calculated as the ratio between the average value for the water-stressed
    and control treatments while, for gs, it was obtained from the ratio between the
    average value for the control and water-stressed treatments. The “noise” was defined
    as the average coefficient of variation (CV) among trees from the same treatments
    as the signal value. The relationship between the spectral indices and Ψs, gs
    or CWSI for each of the crop species studied, as well as when data from all the
    crops were pooled together, was explored by correlation analyses. Results and
    discussion Sensitivity of the indicators to detect water-stressed areas Results
    obtained from the sensitivity analysis showed that Tc was the indicator with the
    lowest variability and highest sensitivity in three out of the four crop species
    included in the analysis (Table 4). Data from the orange orchard were not included
    in the analysis due to the non-significant differences in plant water status observed
    between treatments. Apricot was the only crop in which Ψs resulted in the most
    sensitive indicator to the imposed irrigation treatments, followed by PRI(570–515)
    and Tc. These results were mainly due to the low CV observed in Tc within trees
    from the same treatment in the almond, lemon and peach orchards, and the low tree
    to tree variability observed in Ψs in apricot trees at 13:00 h compared to the
    other indicators (Table 4). Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013) determined Tc in trees
    of the same orchards used in this experiment at different times (09:00, 11:00
    and 13:00 h). Their results (Gonzalez-Dugo et al. 2013) showed, in fact, that
    apricot was the species with the highest variability in Tc at any of the three
    measurement times and that CV within this crop was lowest at 11:00 h. Taking this
    information into account, the analysis was repeated for this species with Ψs,
    gs and Tc data obtained at 11:00 h (Table 4). For this time frame, results revealed
    that sensitivity of Tc was higher than that of Ψs and gs (no multispectral data
    were available at 11:00 h). Table 4 Sensitivity analysis of the stem water potential
    (Ψs), stomatal conductance (gs), Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Photochemical
    Reflectance Index (PRI), normalized PRI (PRInorm), PRI using the reflectance band
    at 515 nm [PRI(570–515)], red edge ratio (R700/R670), Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized
    by the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) for each of the
    species assessed in the experiment Full size table Interestingly, PRI(570–515)
    was found to be the second most sensitive indicator to the imposed water-stressed
    conditions in all the cases. The results obtained for PRI(570–515) contrast with
    those obtained for PRInorm which, along with gs, was the indicator with the highest
    noise and least sensitivity. The multispectral indices NDVI, TCARI/OSAVI, R700/R670
    and PRI570 had, in general, intermediate values of sensitivity (Table 4). Relationships
    between the spectral indices and Ψs, gs or CWSI within each orchard Scaling up
    observations of plant water status from the leaf to the field, or even the farm
    level, requires validation of remote sensing data with ground-truth data. Here,
    data obtained from the multispectral imagery of selected trees within each orchard
    were compared with those of in-field measurements of Ψs and gs as well as CWSI,
    which had been already validated for this particular farm by Gonzalez-Dugo et
    al. (2013). Within the Citrus species, only indices sensitive to leaf chlorophyll
    content were significantly correlated with Ψs, gs or CWSI (Table 5). When R700/R670
    was plotted against gs, orange trees yielded a coefficient of determination (r2)
    of 0.62 (p < 0.05). In lemon trees, however, R700/R670 and TCARI/OSAVI were significantly
    correlated with Ψs (r2 = 0.41; p < 0.05) and CWSI (r2 = 0.64; p < 0.001), respectively.
    The structural and photochemical indices were not correlated with Ψs, gs or CWSI
    in any of the Citrus species, which could be related to the small range of plant
    water status reached in these two orchards compared to the others. The evaluation
    of structure, xanthophyll and chlorophyll sensitive indices in orange trees to
    detect plant water stress has been also studied by Zarco-Tejada et al. (2012).
    These authors found that in spite of the wide range of Ψs reached in that study
    (from −0.5 to −2.0 MPa) compared to the work presented here, PRI, TCARI/OSAVI
    and NDVI, although sensitive, were poorly correlated with Ψs. In that case, the
    PRI using the band 515 as a reference, proposed by Hernández-Clemente et al. (2011),
    and the structure-sensitive indicators RDVI, MTVI1 or TVI were shown as more robust
    water stress indicators for orange trees. Other recent studies (Romero-Trigueros
    et al. 2016), however, have reported significant changes in NDVI in grapefruit
    and mandarin trees as a consequence of short-term changes in Ψs. Table 5 Coefficients
    of determination obtained for the relationships between the Photochemical Reflectance
    Index (PRI), normalized PRI (PRInorm), PRI using the reflectance band at 515 nm
    [PRI(570–515)], red edge ratio (R700/R670), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
    (NDVI) and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized
    by the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) and the more classical
    water stress indicators: stem water potential (Ψs), stomatal conductance (gs)
    and Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) for each of the crops and cultivars studied
    Full size table Better correlations than in Citrus were obtained for the crops
    from the genus Prunus (Table 5). In almond trees, PRI(570–515), PRI, NDVI and
    TCARI/OSAVI indices were statistically correlated with Ψs, gs and CWSI with r2
    ranging from 0.32 to 0.79. The Ψs was better correlated with PRI(570–515) and
    PRI (r2 = 0.53 and 0.52, respectively; p < 0.001). The gs yielded the highest
    correlation with TCARI/OSAVI (r2 = 0.65; p < 0.001) while CWSI yielded the highest
    correlation with PRI(570–515) and NDVI (r2 = 0.79 and 0.70, respectively; p <
    0.001). Measurements of photosynthesis taken in almond trees were highly correlated
    with TCARI/OSAVI (Fig. 2). No correlations, however, were obtained with the other
    chlorophyll sensitive indicator, R700/R670. When comparing results from the two
    almond cultivars used in the study (cv. ‘Garrigues’ and cv. ‘Ramillete’), the
    relationships obtained between PRI(570–515) or TCARI/OSAVI and Ψs, gs and CWSI
    were similar. Nevertheless, PRI and NDVI relationships with Ψs, gs and CWSI were
    weaker for cv. ‘Ramillete’ (r2 ranging from 0.13 to 0.68) than for cv. ‘Garrigues’
    (r2 ranging from 0.46 to 0.89). Fig. 2 Relationships between photosynthesis (μmol
    m−2 s−1) and TCARI/OSAVI obtained in almond (r2 = 0.67; p < 0.001) and apricot
    (r2 = 0.75; p < 0.001) trees Full size image Apricot trees were in the stage of
    postharvest when the experiment was performed. In contrast to that obtained for
    almond trees, no correlations were found between Ψs, gs or CWSI and any of the
    PRI formulations studied. NDVI was significantly correlated with gs (r2 = 0.42;
    p < 0.05) and CWSI (r2 = 0.69; p < 0.01) but not with Ψs. Among the spectral indices,
    TCARI/OSAVI was the indicator that yielded the best correlations in apricot trees
    with Ψs, gs and CWSI (r2 ranging from 0.77 to 0.88; p < 0.001). TCARI/OSAVI is
    an index related to the chlorophyll content and not an index directly linked with
    the water status. Nevertheless, all the trees in this study were managed similarly
    before the beginning of the experiment. As aforementioned, apricot had already
    been harvested and water had not been applied for 24 days before the measurements
    date. In this case, and in order to increase the range of water status for this
    crop, irrigation was resumed in one single unit eight days prior to the measurements.
    Thus, the variation that is observed in the index might be related to the contrasted
    water status and the natural variability observed in the field. As also observed
    in almond trees, TCARI/OSAVI was highly correlated with photosynthesis (Fig. 2).
    Differences observed in the relationship between TCARI/OSAVI and photosynthesis
    between apricot and almond trees may be related to differences in the phenological
    stage between these two crops. Results obtained in the peach orchard were somewhat
    different from those reported for almond and apricot trees (Table 5). High correlations
    were obtained for all the spectral indices with the exception of PRI and TCARI/OSAVI.
    PRI(570–515), PRInorm, R700/R670 and NDVI yielded similar r2 compared with CWSI
    (0.61 to 0.68; p < 0.001). PRInorm and R700/R670, however, were the spectral indices
    with the highest correlations with Ψs and gs (r2 from 0.81 to 0.93; p < 0.001).
    The PRInorm has been reported as a more reliable water stress indicator (r2 =
    0.82 when compared against Ψs) than PRI (r2 = 0.53) in grapevines (Zarco-Tejada
    et al. 2013). Here, that was the case for peach trees but the opposite was observed
    for almond trees (Table 5). Most of the studies found in the literature assessing
    the use of spectral information to detect plant water stress have been conducted
    in one particular crop, generally crops of high economic interest such as olive
    (Berni et al. 2009; Suárez et al. 2008; Zarco-Tejada et al. 2004) and grapevines
    (Gago et al. 2015 and references therein). In the present study, multi-spectral
    indices were assessed in a farm composed of crops with different canopy architecture,
    nutrient status and phenology, which meant that a specific indicator performed
    better in some crops than in others. The use of a single multi-spectral indicator
    that would be sensitive enough to variations in the plant water status of several
    crops would facilitate the assessment of irrigation needs at the farm scale. Relationships
    between the spectral indices and Ψs, gs or CWSI at farm scale Pooling data from
    all the fruit tree crops species together, PRI(570–515), PRInorm, R700/R670 and
    NDVI showed a statistically significant correlation with Ψs with r2 ranging between
    0.15 and 0.65 (Table 6). Linear relationships were found for PRI(570–515), PRInorm
    and NDVI while R700/R670 was best-fitted by a polynomial curve (Fig. 3). Among
    these indicators, PRI(570–515) and NDVI were those which yielded the highest r2
    (0.61 and 0.65, respectively; p < 0.001). Table 6 Coefficients of determination

    the species were pooled together Full size table Fig. 3 Relationships between

    Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index normalized by the Optimized Soil Adjusted
    Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) for all the fruit species together Full size image
    Although weak, statistically significant correlations were also found between
    PRI(570–515), PRI and NDVI with gs (r2 of 0.16–0.18; p < 0.01), and between PRI(570–515),
    PRInorm, R700/R670 and NDVI with CWSI (r2 ranging from 0.19 to 0.33; p < 0.01)
    (Table 6). Mean chlorophyll content within the farm ranged from 0.10 µg mm−2 in
    lemon trees to 0.41 µg mm−2 in almond trees (Table 7). Both, the TCARI/OSAVI and
    the R700/R670 indices were statistically correlated with leaf chlorophyll concentration
    when data from all the species were pooled together (Fig. 4). The red edge ratio
    yielded higher r2 (0.67; p < 0.001) than TCARI/OSAVI (0.40; p < 0.001). Table

    Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) and; b the red edge ratio (R700/R670)
    for all the crop species together Full size image The PRInorm, which was originally
    formulated to deal with contrasting canopy architecture and pigment content, did
    not perform as was expected. The non-linear relationship observed between water
    potential and the red edge ratio (R700/R670) shown in Fig. 3 might be responsible
    for the low performance observed for this index. Results obtained for the NDVI
    were also surprising considering that water restrictions were just applied during
    eight days and considerable canopy structure effects were not expected. Instead
    of that, NDVI yielded the best correlations with Ψs. Recent studies, however,
    have also shown a response of NDVI to short-term changes in Ψs (Romero-Trigueros
    et al. 2016). Overall, NDVI and the PRI(570–515) were the indices able to retrieve
    water status when the five fruit tree crops species were assessed together. These
    results suggest that these indicators could be used to detect water-stressed areas
    in farms composed of a variety of crop species with contrasting phenology and
    canopy architecture. Conclusions The work presented here evaluated the capability
    of a series of narrow-band indices sensitive to biophysical parameters of different
    nature to track water stress effects on a farm composed of five fruit tree crop
    species. Structure, chlorophyll and xanthophyll sensitive indices were all able
    to detect differences between irrigation treatments. Nevertheless, not all the
    indices were correlated with Ψs in all the fruit tree crop species studied. Weak
    or no correlations were found for the Citrus species. While best correlations
    in almond trees were obtained with the PRI and PRI(570–515) indices, TCARI/OSAVI
    was the index that best correlated with Ψs in apricot trees. Both chlorophyll
    and xanthophyll sensitive indices, on the other hand, correlated well with Ψs
    in peach trees. Comparison of the sensitivity analysis performed for direct and
    indirect physiological water stress indicators measured in the study, pointed
    out Tc and PRI(570–515) as the first and second most sensitive indicators to the
    imposed water conditions in all the crops with the exception of apricot trees.
    In fact, PRI(570–515), along with NDVI, were the spectral indices that better
    tracked differences in plant water status (r2 = 0.61 and 0.65, with Ψs, respectively)
    between treatments when all the fruit tree crop species were assessed together.
    These results demonstrate the feasibility of using multi-spectral narrow-band
    indices (i.e. 10 nm bandwidths) acquired from miniature cameras on board a UAS
    to retrieve water status for a variety of crop species with contrasting phenology
    and canopy architecture. Abbreviations gs : Stomatal Conductance Ψs : Stem Water

    \ large efforts have been made to develop new methods to optimize\nstress detection\
    \ in crop ﬁelds. Thus, plant phenotyping based on imaging techniques has become\
    \ an\nessential tool in agriculture. In particular, leaf temperature is a valuable\
    \ indicator of the physiological\nstatus of plants, responding to both biotic\
    \ and abiotic stressors. Often combined with other imaging\nsensors and data-mining\
    \ techniques, thermography is crucial in the implementation of a more\nautomatized,\
    \ precise and sustainable agriculture. However, thermal data need some corrections\n\
    related to the environmental and measuring conditions in order to achieve a correct\
    \ interpretation of\nthe data. This review focuses on the state of the art of\
    \ thermography applied to the detection of biotic\nstress. The work will also\
    \ revise the most important abiotic stress factors affecting the measurements\n\
    as well as practical issues that need to be considered in order to implement this\
    \ technique, particularly\nat the ﬁeld scale.\nKeywords: Remote sensing; proximal\
    \ sensing; thermography; plant phenotyping\n1. Introduction\nEnvironmental conditions\
    \ driven by climate change and infections are great challenges\nthat need to be\
    \ overcome by modern agriculture. The economic loss in agriculture caused by\n\
    increasing environmental pressures could reach an annual 0.3% to 0.8% of projected\
    \ global\ngross domestic product by the end of the century [1]. Moreover, plant\
    \ diseases are the main\ncause of the drop in production and economic losses in\
    \ agriculture worldwide, reaching\nyield losses of 20 to 30% depending on the\
    \ crop [2]. Current practices and social activities\n-such as intensiﬁed monoculture\
    \ in large areas, the use of genetically uniform plant varieties\nand the development\
    \ of global supply chains and logistic activities- contribute largely to\nthe\
    \ widespread of plant disease epidemics and rapid pathogen evolution [3].\nPlant\
    \ phenotyping based on imaging techniques is a pertinent approach to quantify\n\
    the appearance and performance of crops under different environmental conditions\
    \ while\naddressing the spatial heterogeneity of crop ﬁelds. Therefore, plant\
    \ phenotyping, applied\nto precision agriculture, is a valuable tool for the diagnosis\
    \ and detection of plant stress,\neven in the absence of symptoms. Optical sensors\
    \ have been used to study (a) the response\nof plants to pathogens, pests and\
    \ abiotic stressors; (b) to identify primary disease foci; (c) to\nmonitor resistance\
    \ or susceptibility of different plant genotypes to speciﬁc stress factors;\n\
    (d) to evaluate the severity of symptoms; (e) and to assess plant biomass and\
    \ yield [4].\nStomatal activity is one of the most important physiological traits\
    \ for plant growth\nand development. It plays a crucial role in the carbon and\
    \ water balance by controlling\nphotosynthesis and transpiration [5]. Hence, stomatal\
    \ conductance to water (gs) is related\nto yield and to the tolerance of environmental\
    \ stresses [6] and correlates strongly with leaf\ntemperature [7–9]. Thermal long-wave\
    \ infrared (TIR) cameras (or simply thermal cameras)\nare calibrated sensors able\
    \ to record emitted radiation in the thermal range (8–14 µm)\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 68. https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13010068\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n2 of 21\nand provide images representing temperature\
    \ values per pixel. Thus, conventional, time-\nconsuming ground-based gs measurements\
    \ can be feasibly replaced by thermal images\nevaluating plant physiological status\
    \ at different scales in short periods of time [10,11]. Ad-\nditionally, highly\
    \ sensitive thermal cameras with a relatively simple operational procedure\nhave\
    \ become more available to research groups, at a lower cost and at higher spatial\
    \ reso-\nlution [12,13]. Moreover, TIR imaging is a very valuable method of stress\
    \ detection prior to\nthe appearance of symptoms since it operates out of the\
    \ visual range of the spectrum [14].\nHowever, some considerations must be taken\
    \ when interpreting thermograms in terms\nof gs since plant surface temperature\
    \ is mainly driven by environmental factors such as\nair temperature and relative\
    \ humidity. Even though high-end thermal cameras carry out\ncorrections for these\
    \ two parameters, there are other factors affecting canopy temperatures,\nsuch\
    \ as wind speed and light intensity, as well as by plant features, ranging from\
    \ leaf size\nor angle to canopy structure. A number of corrections for these factors\
    \ can be found in\nthe literature as TIR stress indices (Table 1). Some of these\
    \ parameters have been found\nto correlate with physiological traits related to\
    \ the water balance status of plants (Table 2).\nThe most common TIR parameters\
    \ are:\n1.\nNormalized canopy or leaf temperature with reference to air temperature\
    \ (∆T), uti-\nlized as an index of crop water status. The applications of ∆T was\
    \ recently reviewed\nby Still et al. [15];\n2.\nCrop water stress index (CSWI),\
    \ which introduces two baselines: (Tcanopy − Tair)wet\nas the estimated difference\
    \ for a well-watered plant, and (Tcanopy − Tair)dry for a\ndry (non-transpiring)\
    \ plant. CWSI is one of the most commonly used normalization\nmethods for TIR\
    \ measurements, which overcomes the effects of other environmental\nparameters\
    \ affecting plant temperature [16,17];\n3.\nIndex of stomatal conductance (IG),\
    \ since it is directly proportional to this parame-\nter [18];\n4.\nMaximum temperature\
    \ difference (MTD), calculated for every leaf or sample [19].\nThis parameter\
    \ has only been correlated with the severity of symptoms for several\ndiseases,\
    \ as reviewed in [20,21];\n5.\nNormalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT),\
    \ based on the maximum and the\nminimum temperature measured in the whole ﬁeld\
    \ trial. This parameter has been\nfound to be a valid estimation of the crop water\
    \ status [22];\n6.\nAverage canopy temperature (Tav), based on maximum and minimum\
    \ values of\ntemperature, was one of the ﬁrst parameters used by the conventional\
    \ infrared\nthermography [23,24]. However, this parameter can excessively simplify\
    \ outcome\ndata, and some important thermal information can be lost. Estimated\
    \ shape factors\nderived by ﬁtting the whole temperature data of the thermal images\
    \ to the Weibull\ndistribution could solve this constraint [25].\nTable 1. Most\

    AN\nPapaya\nPS\n[28]\nDespite the wide use of thermography applied to agronomy,\
    \ this technique per se\nhas a very limited capacity for diagnosis. Indeed, temperature\
    \ raises may be due to\nstomatal closure, which is on its own an unspeciﬁc mechanism\
    \ of plant defense against\nboth abiotic and biotic stressors. Even more, temperature\
    \ raises can also respond to a\ndecreased capacity for water evaporation or even\
    \ to the loss of vegetation [10]. In contrast,\nsome stresses can cause temporary\
    \ decreases in leaf temperature. That would be the case\nof some pathogens that\
    \ can interfere in the regulation of stomatal movements to favor\ntheir entry\
    \ to the mesophyll [68]. As a consequence, alterations in TIR parameters stand\n\
    as ambiguous clues for diagnosis. Moreover, abiotic stress factors (mostly drought,\
    \ soil\nsalinity or extreme ambient temperature) also cause increases in canopy\
    \ temperature.\nThis is most important under natural conditions, where abiotic\
    \ stressors are difﬁcult to\nassess and avoid. Keeping in mind that under such\
    \ conditions, several stress factors often\naffect the vegetation simultaneously,\
    \ possible misinterpretations of TIR data would lead to\ninaccurate determination\
    \ of the incidence and severity of a particular pathogen infection\nor even to\
    \ a wrong diagnosis.\nTo overcome the restraints of thermography as a diagnostic\
    \ technique, authors have\nincreasingly applied it in combination with other imaging\
    \ techniques. Roitsch et al. [69]\nand Sperschneider [70] reviewed the implementation\
    \ of TIR cameras with other sensors,\nsuch as RGB, multi- or hyperspectral cameras,\
    \ in phenotyping platforms. The identiﬁcation\nof spatial and temporal patterns\
    \ of TIR parameters in combination with other relevant\nvegetation indices (VIs)\
    \ could be of great help to establish robust methods for the early di-\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n4 of 21\nagnosis in crop ﬁelds. However, a preliminary analysis\
    \ of a given plant-stressor interaction\nis desirable to obtain a stress-speciﬁc\
    \ signature [20].\nThe use of complementary imaging techniques provides valuable\
    \ and very complex\ninformation. This complexity is caused by the increasing number\
    \ of dimensions that can\nbe considered and the incessant improvements in their\
    \ spatial and temporal resolution.\nTo enhance our capacity for data analysis,\
    \ most recent works have included data-mining\nin their analysis. This multidisciplinary\
    \ approach, based on probability theory, statistics,\ndecision theory, visualization\
    \ and optimization, outperforms more conventional statistical\nanalysis in terms\
    \ of ﬁnding patterns in data [71,72]. Classiﬁers are algorithms able to learn\n\
    patterns from a database of known samples and, based on that knowledge, to identify\
    \ or\ncategorize new samples [73]. When applied to agriculture, this approach\
    \ facilitates the\ninterpretation of data and the decision-making process to such\
    \ an extent that no study\nappears to be complete without this type of analysis.\n\

    \ of thermogra-\nphy for plant stress detection, little attention has been paid\
    \ to the physiological perspective\nof temperature alterations related to stressed\
    \ plants. Attending to this need, this review will\nrevise the most relevant applications\
    \ of thermography to agriculture with the main aim of\nproviding TIR camera users\
    \ with a collection of host plant–pathogen systems described in\nthe literature\
    \ in terms of thermal response and the mechanisms of plant defense involved.\n\
    Furthermore, a state-of-art review on the detection of abiotic stress by thermography\
    \ will\ncomplement our current knowledge on thermography applied to the diagnosis\
    \ of biotic\nstress in plants.\n2. Biotic Stress Detection by Thermography at\
    \ Different Scales\nStomata are the main natural entry of pathogens into the plant\
    \ tissues. Hence, the regu-\nlation of the stomatal movements plays a key role\
    \ in plant defense against microbes [86]. The\nrecognition of a potential pathogen\
    \ by plants usually triggers stomatal closure; to counteract\nthis defense response,\
    \ some pathogens are able to override the plant signaling pathways to\nactivate\
    \ stomatal aperture [87]. Other effects of pathogen infection include disturbances\
    \ on\nleaf development, cell wall and leaf cuticle composition or integrity, alterations\
    \ in the plant\nmetabolism or even necrosis of the tissues. These physical and\
    \ chemical disturbances affect\nthe plant water status, which can be monitored\
    \ by thermography [88–90].\n2.1. Proximal Sensing on Growth Chambers and Greenhouses\n\
    2.1.1. Viral Infections\nEven when some virosis cause alterations neither in gs\
    \ nor in leaf temperature [91],\nthermography is very often helpful in tracking\
    \ viral infections on plants. Most of those\nworks report temperature increases\
    \ between +0.5 and +1.5 K; on the contrary, some works\nreported decreases in\
    \ leaf temperature of −0.5 K relative to mock-controls. Hypersensi-\ntive response\
    \ (HR) to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) could be visualized as spots of elevated\n\
    temperature before any disease symptoms became visible on tobacco leaves. Those\
    \ spots\nwere conﬁned to the site of infection as a result of the HR triggered\
    \ by salicylic acid. On\nthe other hand, no thermal response was observed on susceptible\
    \ tobacco-TMV-infected\nplants [92]. In the case of Pepper middle mottle virus\
    \ (PMMoV)-Nicotiana benthamiana plants,\nvirus spreading through asymptomatic\
    \ leaves could be ﬁrst detected by an increase in\ntemperature on the tissues\
    \ around the main veins. This effect extended to adjacent tissues\nbefore the\
    \ spreading of the virus across the midrib of the leaf, as shown by immunolocaliza-\n\
    tion. Interestingly, the thermal symptoms caused by the most severe strain of\
    \ PMMoV were\ndetected before those caused by the less virulent one [93]. Among\
    \ other tobamoviruses,\nCucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Cucumber green mottle\
    \ mosaic virus (CGMMV) have a\nparticular impact on cucumber production. Plants\
    \ infected with CMV displayed homoge-\nneously higher temperature in the whole\
    \ inoculated leaf relative to the controls, whereas\nleaves of CGMMV-infected\
    \ cucumber plants showed a heterogeneous temperature pattern,\nconsisting of cold\
    \ spots at the infection sites. However, none of those changes was de-\ntectable\
    \ presymptomatically. Nevertheless, classiﬁcatory algorithms could early detect\
    \ the\ninfection caused by each pathogen when combining data obtained by TIR,\
    \ ﬂuorescence and\nhyperspectral imaging [94]. Another virus of agricultural interest\
    \ is the Sweet potato feathery\nmottle virus, which is the most widespread virus\
    \ that infects sweet potato plants, causing\ndevastating problems when co-infecting\
    \ with Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus. Higher leaf\ntemperatures were associated\
    \ with more severe symptoms; thus, plants co-infected with\nboth viruses displayed\
    \ higher temperatures than single virus-infected plants [95].\nRemote Sens. 2021,\
    \ 13, 68\n6 of 21\n2.1.2. Bacterial Infections\nIn the case of bacterial-infected\
    \ plants, literature reports temperature changes relative\nto the controls ranging\
    \ between −3.3 K and +3 K. The tumor caused by Agrobacterium\ntumefaciens in the\
    \ hypocotyl of castor oil plant produces irreversible disruption of the plant\n\
    epidermis and hence, the tumor lacks a protective cuticle against water loss.\
    \ Moreover,\nstomata located at the tumor edge are hypertrophied and non-functional;\
    \ as a consequence,\nthe tumor surface was the coldest part of the plant [96].\
    \ Some works have studied the\nrole of plant defense elicitors produced by bacterial\
    \ pathogens. That is the case of the\nproteinaceous harpin synthesized by the\
    \ bacterium Erwinia amylovora. When inﬁltrated\nin the leaves of Nicotiana sylvestris\
    \ wild plants, harpin induced a marked presymptomatic\ncooling at the inoculation\
    \ sites, followed by an increase of temperature during the HR [97].\nThe same\
    \ trend was described for spots of bacterial canker caused by Pseudomonas syringae\n\
    pv. actinidiae on kiwifruit leaves [98]. The decrease in temperature localized\
    \ at the infection\nsites could be related to bacterial virulence factors that\
    \ actively open the stomata by\ninterfering with hormonal signaling pathways leading\
    \ to stomatal closure [99]. On the\nother hand, it is well known that recognition\
    \ of some pathogen-associated molecular\npatterns triggers stomatal closure to\
    \ impede bacterial entrance through these natural\napertures [68]. In bean plants,\
    \ P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 induces an HR, whereas\nP. syringae pv. phaseolicola\
    \ 1448A produces systemic infection. First symptoms are evident\nafter 10 h and\
    \ 2 days post-infection, respectively. Thermography could presymptomatically\n\
    reveal those bacterial challenges as an increase of temperature of the inoculated\
    \ areas at 1\nand 2 h post-infection in the case of HR and systemic infection,\
    \ respectively [100].\nSeveral works have addressed the effect of the Dickeya\
    \ dadantii infection on plant tran-\nspiration by thermography. This bacterium\
    \ usually produces soft-rot, a characteristic tissue\nmaceration, as in the case\
    \ of N. benthamiana infected at high inoculum dose. After mechani-\ncal inﬁltration,\
    \ the temperature of the affected areas raised presymptomatically, linked to\n\
    an increase in hormones controlling stomatal closure. In subsequent days, the\
    \ temperature\ncontinued rising, affecting the whole leaf. However, N. benthamiana\
    \ can activate an efﬁcient\ndefense response against D. dadantii when the plant\
    \ is inoculated at doses resembling the\nnatural infection. In this case, after\
    \ an initial increase in temperature of the inﬁltrated\narea, infected plants\
    \ could recover, and temperature subsequently decreased [101]. Inde-\npendently\
    \ of the inoculum dose, D. dadantii does not cause tissue maceration on melon\n\
    leaves. It produces brownish spots at the inoculation sites that evolve chlorosis\
    \ in the\nsurrounding tissues in successive days; those symptoms appeared earlier\
    \ when high dose\nconcentrations were applied. Only inﬁltrated areas shown increased\
    \ temperatures at the\nbeginning of the infection process when inoculated at a\
    \ low dose; the whole leaf ﬁnally\ndisplaying higher temperature respecting to\
    \ the controls. However, when a high inoculum\ndose was applied, the whole melon\
    \ leaf displayed a higher temperature [102]. The whole\nleaf of another cucurbit,\
    \ such as zucchini, displayed higher temperature relative to the\ncontrols when\
    \ inoculated with D. dadantii, whereas visual symptoms (different degrees\nof\
    \ chlorosis proportional to the inoculated dose) were circumscribed to the inﬁltrated\n\
    spots [103,104]. Features extracted from TIR and multicolor ﬂuorescence images\
    \ were used\nto feed algorithms, which provided a good performance of classiﬁcation\
    \ of plants into\ncategories of infected and controls in both melon and zucchini\
    \ plants [102–104].\n2.1.3. Interactions with Pathogenic Fungi and Oomycetes\n\
    Thermography has been widely used to assess the effect of fungi and oomycetes\
    \ on\nhost plant transpiration. Depending on how these pathogens interact with\
    \ host plants,\ninitial phases of pathogenesis can induce increases or decreases\
    \ in leaf temperatures\naffecting only the inoculation sites or wholes leaves.\
    \ Subsequent symptoms development\nmay cause transitory drops in temperature as\
    \ the affected cells die and lose water. Later\ninfection phases usually lead\
    \ to an increase in temperature due to the lack of natural\ncooling of the necrotic\
    \ tissues. Concerning healthy areas, it is possible to ﬁnd in the cited\nliterature\
    \ that biotrophic fungi and oomycetes can cause temperature decreases ranging\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n7 of 21\nfrom −0.1 to −2.5 K, whereas increases have\
    \ been registered from +0.6 to +2 K. For their\npart, hemibiotrophic pathogens\
    \ can decrease leaf temperature between −0.6 and −2.2 K, or\ncontrary, increase\
    \ it in +0.4 to +7.5 K. Finally, it is possible to register temperatures decreases\n\
    between −2 and −5 K and increases ranging from +0.3 to +9 K when necrotrophic\
    \ fungi\nare studied by TIR imaging.\nConcerning infections caused by biotrophic\
    \ fungi leaves from wheat plants infected\nwith Blumeria graminis or Puccinia\
    \ striiformis (fungi causing powdery mildew and stripe\nrust, respectively) displayed\
    \ low temperatures due to the very low resistance to water\nevaporation of growing\
    \ mycelia [105,106]. The phytopathogens Pseudoperonospora cubensis\nand Podosphaera\
    \ xanthii are the causal agents of cucumber downy mildew and cucurbits\npowdery\
    \ mildew, respectively. In cucumber leaves, these pathogens produce infective\n\
    spots with lower temperatures than the surrounding healthy areas due to an abnormal\n\
    stomatal opening. In the case of P. xanthii infection, the thermographic detection\
    \ was\nnot presymptomatic, whereas disease caused by P. cubensis could be revealed\
    \ one day\nbefore the appearance of symptoms. Under laboratory conditions, the\
    \ MTD increased\nduring both pathogenesis and was related to disease severity\
    \ [19,94,107,108]. Despite\nbeing a biotrophic oomycete, P. cubensis also produces\
    \ necrosis in the latest infection phase\nassociated with an increase in cucumber\
    \ leaf temperature [19,108]. Leaves of rose infected\nwith the fungus Podosphaera\
    \ pannosa var. rosae (causal agent of powdery mildew in roses)\nshowed a presymptomatic\
    \ decrease in temperature. Furthermore, two algorithms were\ntrained on features\
    \ extracted from TIR images, obtaining high accuracy in classifying\nhealthy and\
    \ infected plants [109]. Raza et al. [110] also used information extracted from\
    \ TIR\nand RGB pictures to automatically detect tomato plants infected with Oidium\
    \ neolycopersici\nin a presymptomatic way, but the work did not address the physiological\
    \ changes caused\nby the fungus.\nRegarding hemibiotrophic fungi, TIR imaging\
    \ could describe the severity of the\ninfection, which could be related to the\
    \ disease stages but also to the host plant resistance\nto the pathogen. Thus,\
    \ Oerke et al. [111] and Belin et al. [112] analyzed apple trees\nsuffering from\
    \ apple scab. In that case, the detection of infection, as well as differences\n\
    in the virulence of several Venturia inaequalis isolates infecting apple trees,\
    \ were detected\nmore accurately by thermography than by chlorophyll ﬂuorescence\
    \ imaging. The thermal\nresponse was presymptomatic and consisted of spots of\
    \ decreased temperature due to\nthe subcuticular growth of V. inaequalis. A soilborne\
    \ fungus, Rhizoctonia solani, induces\nnecrosis in lettuce plants, which could\
    \ be visualized as an increase in leaf temperature\nand MTD [113]. The damage\
    \ produced by another soilborne fungus, Fusarium oxysporum,\nto whole cucumber\
    \ leaves could be detected as a presymptomatic raise in temperature\ninduced by\
    \ abscisic acid, followed by a slight decrease as wilt symptoms developed. Finally,\n\
    the temperature of whole leaves presenting necrosis increased again [114]. On\
    \ the contrary,\npea plants infected with this fungus showed an early and slight\
    \ reduction of temperature\ncompared to the control plants. At an advanced stage\
    \ of the infection, the leaf temperature\nincreased above control levels in the\
    \ case of susceptible plants, whereas the temperature of\nthose showing F. oxysporum-resistance\
    \ remained similar to the controls [115].\nIn the case of infections caused by\
    \ necrotrophic fungi, sugar beet plants inoculated\nwith Cercospora beticola (causal\
    \ agent of Cercospora leaf spot) displayed spots of presymp-\ntomatic low temperature\
    \ corresponding to the infection sites. Cold spots appeared pro-\ngressively until\
    \ covering the whole leaf surface, whereas lesions were hardly visible by\nthe\
    \ naked eye. Toxins inﬂuencing cell membrane permeability and produced by C. beticola\n\
    could account for this temperature decrease [92]. Aspergillus carbonarius is a\
    \ fungus causing\nsour rot of grape berries and produces ochratoxin-As, toxic\
    \ for humans. Mycelium growth\nareas showed low temperatures that identiﬁed affected\
    \ fruit sites at the very early-stages of\nA. carbonarius infection [25]. Thermography\
    \ also revealed that Alternaria alternata, A. bras-\nsicae and A. brassicicola\
    \ caused a decrease of temperature during the ﬁrst seven days of\ninfection on\
    \ oilseed rape leaves, followed by a temperature increase in successive days.\n\
    However, those plants inoculated with A. dauci only developed increases of mean\
    \ tem-\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n8 of 21\nperature at 21 days after inoculation\
    \ [116]. The infection with Botrytis cinerea (gray mold)\non bean plants caused\
    \ a presymptomatic increase of temperature at the infection sites. In\nsubsequent\
    \ days, leaves developed hot brownish necrotic lesions surrounded by a lower\n\
    temperature area [117]. Contrary, B. cinerea–infected roses ﬁrst showed a decrease\
    \ of tem-\nperature at regions where lesions were initially formed, followed by\
    \ a rise in temperature\nonce necrosis occurred [109]. Rosellinia necatrix (soilborne\
    \ fungus causing white root rot) is\none of the most important constraints to\
    \ production for a wide range of woody crops such\nas avocado. In the late phases\
    \ of R. necatrix infection, trees undergo a water deﬁcit in the\naerial part due\
    \ to failure of the root system [118]. As a result, infected plants experienced\
    \ a\nsigniﬁcant increase in leaf temperature from the early symptomatic stage\
    \ onwards [119].\nFurthermore, infected avocado trees in an orchard could be detected\
    \ by thermography (see\nSection 2.2) [120].\n2.1.4. Herbivory and Parasitic Plants\n\
    Herbivore insects disrupt the integrity of leaves, leading to uncontrolled water\
    \ loss\nfrom wounds and triggering intricate processes that affect gas exchange\
    \ also in the re-\nmaining leaf tissue. Thus, it is possible to ﬁnd temperature\
    \ drops from −0.3 to −3 K\nin the literature. TIR images of soybean leaﬂets affected\
    \ by corn earworm caterpillars\n(Helicoverpa zea) showed that leaf areas adjacent\
    \ to wounds were cooler than distant regions\nor sister leaﬂets [121]. The same\
    \ leaf temperature pattern was visible after injuries caused\nby cabbage looper\
    \ (Trichoplusia ni) instars on Arabidopsis [122], tobacco hornworm (Man-\nduca\
    \ sexta) on Nicotiana attenuata [123], or larval gypsy moth (Lymantria dyspar)\
    \ and gall\ndamage produced by midge ﬂies (Harmandia sp.) on aspen leaves [124].\
    \ When elevated\nCO2 was applied to the atmosphere, the cooling effect of gall\
    \ formation on remaining leaf\ntissue was reduced [124].\nThermography was also\
    \ useful in the detection of plants infested by parasites, reveal-\ning temperature\
    \ increases (from +0.4 to +0.9 K) due to a reduction in the plant water uptake\n\
    by affected roots. Examples of these interactions are the nematode Heterodera\
    \ schachtii\nwith susceptible sugar beet cultivars [125], as well as the obligatory\
    \ root parasitic plant\nOrobanche cumana (broomrape) and sunﬂower [126]. The early\
    \ detection of broomrape\nby nondestructive techniques was unprecedented since\
    \ natural infestation causes subtle\nalterations on host physiology and proceeds\
    \ unnoticed until the emergence of the ﬂoral\nshoots, by the time of sunﬂower\
    \ bloom.\n2.2. Remote Sensing on Crop Fields\nIn crop ﬁelds, thermography has\
    \ facilitated the detailed analysis of crop ﬁelds affected\nby pathogens, helping\
    \ in the localization of areas where plants are infected and requiring\nurgent\
    \ intervention [127]. In general, pathogen-infected plants show changes in their\n\
    temperature of -2 K to +3.1 K, relative to the temperature of healthy plants;\
    \ however, it is\nworth noticing that these values should be handled with care\
    \ depending on the sensitivity\nand the accuracy of the used TIR cameras. The\
    \ identiﬁcation of potentially infected plants\nusing classiﬁers provides accuracies\
    \ ranging between 59 and 89%, depending on the\napplied algorithm and parameters\
    \ used to feed it.\nIn sugar beet, canopy temperature correlated signiﬁcantly\
    \ with the density of the\nnematode parasite H. schachtii in the case of a susceptible\
    \ cultivar, whereas no correlation\ncould be found for the resistant one [128].\
    \ P. syringae pv. actinidiae infection in kiwifruit\norchards was assessed by\
    \ TIR maps based on canopy temperature. Images revealed\nthat infected trees were\
    \ signiﬁcantly warmer than the healthy ones, being localized in\nthe outer canes\
    \ of the canopy [98]. Temperature increases measured on pines infected\nwith Dothistroma\
    \ septosporum (causal agent of red band needle blight) and on winter wheat\ninfected\
    \ with Zymoseptoria tritici (causing septoria leaf blotch) could be positively\
    \ correlated\nto the damages caused by these hemibiotrophic fungi [90,129]. Necrotic\
    \ spots on leaves\nfrom three woody trees (oriental cherry, Japanese cornel and\
    \ sawtooth oak) caused by three\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n9 of 21\nfungi (Mycosphaerella\
    \ cerasella, Elsinoe corni and Tubakia dryina, respectively) can also be\ndetected\
    \ as dots with higher temperatures relative to healthy areas [130].\nThe fusion\
    \ of thermography with other imaging techniques such as multi- or hyper-\nspectral\
    \ reﬂectance or chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging cameras is very often an adequate\n\
    approach for stress detection. The combination with chlorophyll ﬂuorescence imaging\
    \ al-\nlowed monitoring several constraints (fungal infection, galls and chewing\
    \ damages caused\nby arthropods) in understory hardwood saplings. Thus, changes\
    \ in transpiration could be\nrelated to photosynthesis impairment in affected\
    \ trees [131]. However, the combination\nof TIR imaging with multi- or hyper-spectroscopy\
    \ reﬂectance is more feasible since both\ntechniques are based on passive measurements.\
    \ Moreover, it is possible to obtain multi-\nple reﬂectance VIs that could correlate\
    \ with physiological parameters. Furthermore, VIs,\ntogether with temperature\
    \ derived parameters, could be implemented on algorithms to\nclassify plants into\
    \ categories of interest in the earliest stages of infection. That was the\ncase\
    \ of important bacterial diseases causing a high impact on both agriculture and\
    \ the envi-\nronment, such as citrus greening or Huanglongbing in citrus trees\
    \ [132], or Xylella fastidiosa,\na quarantine pathogen in olive orchards [133].\n\
    In the case of diseases caused by foliar fungal pathogens, the joint use of thermography\n\
    and reﬂectance made it possible to discriminate between severity levels. That\
    \ was the\ncase of red leaf blotch (caused by Polystigma amygdalinum) in almond\
    \ trees [134] and also\nearly and late leaf spot diseases (caused by Passalora\
    \ arachidicola S. Hori and Cercosporidium\npersonatum, respectively) on peanut\
    \ trees [135]. Minimum temperature corrected by air\ntemperature showed a negative\
    \ correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index\n(NDVI) in opium\
    \ poppy orchards infected by the oomycete Peronospora arborescens (causal\nagent\
    \ of downy mildew) [136]. Furthermore, a strong relationship between yield, several\n\
    VIs and canopy temperature was observed in maize plants suffering tar spot complex\n\
    (caused by Phyllachora maydis and Monographella maydis) [137], as well as in chickpea\n\
    infected with Ascochyta rabiei (causing Ascochyta blight disease) [138].\n∆T correlated\
    \ with disease severity caused by soilborne fungal pathogens, such as\nVerticillium\
    \ dahliae (causal agent of Verticillium wilt) in olive trees or R. necatrix in\
    \ avocado\ntrees. Moreover, classifying algorithms applied to the data obtained\
    \ by spectral and TIR\nimaging could identify affected trees with high accuracy\
    \ [120,139,140].\n3. Assessing of Plant Abiotic Stress by Thermography\nIn natural\
    \ environments, abiotic stress conditions often concur with biotic stresses,\n\
    making their evaluation difﬁcult. For this reason, it is important to understand\
    \ how abiotic\nconditions can affect vegetation. The successive sections will\
    \ review how thermography\nhas been applied to monitor crop water stress, salinity,\
    \ nutrient availability, and application\nof herbicides, among others, at proximal\
    \ and remote scales.\n3.1. Proximal Sensing on Growth Chambers and Greenhouses\n\
    Drought, which importance emerges from the damage caused and its extent, is con-\n\
    sequently one of the main abiotic stresses monitored by TIR imaging to help farmers\
    \ to\nestablish precise water management and scheduling [141]. Most of the studies\
    \ related to\ndrought stress have been conducted in crop ﬁelds, but it is possible\
    \ to ﬁnd some works\ncarried out on plants grown under controlled conditions (Table\
    \ 2). Furthermore, salinity\nis essentially water stress that results from the\
    \ osmotic effect of ions in the soil solution,\nreducing the water availability\
    \ for plants. In addition, ions can accumulate in plant leaves\nup to toxic concentrations\
    \ [142]. Thus, TIR imaging provides an opportunity to screen\nfor salinity tolerance\
    \ traits in a reliable, quantitative and efﬁcient manner. The effects of\ndifferent\
    \ abiotic stress factors on leaf temperature at proximal sensing are summarized\
    \ in\nTable 3. The increase in temperature registered in these works for infected\
    \ plants ranges\nfrom +1.5 to +6 K.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n10 of 21\nTable\

    \ +0.7 to +7 K between healthy and stressed\nplants have been reported in the\
    \ literature at a remote sensing scale. These alterations in\ncanopy temperature\
    \ allowed stress detection with accuracies up to 75% using classiﬁcatory\nalgorithms\
    \ based on TIR stress indices.\nVineyards under different water regimes are proposed\
    \ as an exemplary study model\nthanks to the geometry of orchards. Moreover, climate\
    \ change threatens the most important\nwine-producer countries worldwide, which\
    \ will suffer increased frequency and severity\nof drought periods. On the contrary,\
    \ ﬁne-tuning irrigation management during the grow-\ning season leads to a slight-to-moderate\
    \ water deﬁcit, which stimulates optimal grape\nquality without signiﬁcantly compromising\
    \ yield [47]. Many authors have monitored\nphysiological parameters related to\
    \ water balance by handheld devices and correlated\nthem with stress indices extracted\
    \ from TIR images (Table 2). They found that TIR imaging\ncan distinguish between\
    \ irrigated and non-irrigated canopies and even between different\ndeﬁcit irrigation\
    \ treatments. However, the relationship between TIR stress indices and\nphysiological\
    \ parameters was found to be stable throughout the season in some cases [47]\n\
    or, on the contrary, affected by the phenological stage or the varieties [49,158].\
    \ All these\nworks have used TIR ground-based cameras positioned (lateral or nadir)\
    \ or implemented\non UAVs. However, it is also possible to use TIR images from\
    \ Landsat-5 for irrigation\nmanagement purposes [159].\nAs the water demand for\
    \ agriculture is steadily increasing, exploring indices obtained\nby thermography\
    \ to evaluate drought stress in other crops different from vineyards also\nhas\
    \ been extensively addressed (Table 2). The efﬁciency of the VI named photochemical\n\
    reﬂectance index (PRI) as an indicator of water stress was evaluated by TIR imaging\
    \ in\nolive and peach orchards under different water regimes. It was found that\
    \ PRI showed a\nhigher correlation with ∆T and gs than other vegetation indices\
    \ [30,160]. Regarding the\nmonitoring of water regimes in crops using satellite\
    \ images, thermal images taken with\nASTER could distinguish between rain-fed\
    \ and artiﬁcially irrigated olive tree orchards [161].\nBased on these works,\
    \ it can be concluded that thermal information remotely obtained by\nTIR cameras,\
    \ alone or in combination with other imaging techniques, is robust enough to\n\
    estimate the water status of crops and to help farmers to establish an appropriate\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling for plantations. However, this conclusion should be taken\
    \ with caution since\nthere are exceptions to the rule. As an example, canopy\
    \ temperature in maize ﬁelds under\ndrought stress only partially reﬂected gas\
    \ exchange rates and grain yield, presumably as a\nconsequence of other alterations\
    \ caused by this stress factor in plants, such as impairments\nin photosynthesis\
    \ and partitioning rates or alterations in plant leaves and canopy structures\n\
    (leading to ﬂuctuations in energy absorption and/or dissipation) [162]. Moreover,\
    \ the use\nof TIR imaging to ﬁgure out biologically relevant traits constitutes\
    \ a challenge under\nﬂuctuating conditions, as recently reviewed by Vialet-Chabrand\
    \ and Lawson [75].\nIn addition to physiological variables related to the water\
    \ status of plants, production\nparameters such as grain yield could be evaluated\
    \ by thermography in cereals. That was\nthe case of spring barley [163], maize\
    \ [162] and wheat [61,164,165], where grain yield under\ndifferent water regimes\
    \ showed good correlations with TIR stress indices. CWSI is a good\npredictor\
    \ of garlic bulb biomass under different water availability levels [166]. Another\n\
    production parameter, the average fruit weight of mandarins “clementina de Nules”\
    \ at\nharvest, could also be correlated signiﬁcantly with canopy temperature when\
    \ different\nirrigation regimes were tested [32].\nRegarding the nutrient availability\
    \ in soils, wheat crops growing under higher nitrogen\nsupplies exhibited lower\
    \ canopy temperature (and thus, lower CWSI) than those that were\nnot treated\
    \ [167]. Kefauver et al. [168] compared different nitrogen treatments in three\n\
    barley varieties and elaborated a detailed correlation network of physiological\
    \ traits, TIR\nand other imaging data. Another common stress in crop ﬁelds is\
    \ low temperatures. TIR\nimaging has been applied to study frost resistance in\
    \ apple orchards. When the soil was\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n12 of 21\ndefrosted,\
    \ the whole tree froze starting from peripheral twigs, whereas when the soil was\n\
    frosted, the tree started to freeze from the trunk at the tree base [169].\n4.\
    \ Future Perspectives\nFor more sustainable agriculture, the development of tools\
    \ providing real-time in-\nformation on the health status of plants is highly\
    \ demanded, as well as on their physical\nand physiological interactions with\
    \ their micro- and macro-environment, from soil to\natmosphere. In this sense,\
    \ the progressive implementation of high-throughput analysis\nbased on imaging\
    \ sensors and big data have represented an outstanding innovation [72].\nAutomation\
    \ allows rapid evaluations of plants and crops, avoiding subjectivity associ-\n\
    ated with visual assessments, reducing the cost of labor and permitting more frequent\n\
    assessments on the same plants over time [21]. Indeed, thermography implemented\
    \ in\nhigh-throughput facilities is contributing to the development of next-generation\
    \ crops by\ncrop breeders. However, before thermal sensing is adopted as a routine\
    \ tool in agriculture\nand integrated into decision-making for a wide range of\
    \ users, further research is necessary\nto address current challenges of the technology\
    \ and interpretation of thermal data [13,76].\n4.1. Future Technical Development\
    \ of Thermography\nTIR cameras suffer from challenges common to sensors for image\
    \ acquisition. At the\nproximal sensor scale, the volume of plants that can be\
    \ monitored at the same time is a\nlimitation. On the other hand, standardized\
    \ environments of measurements at a short\ndistance from the target may complicate\
    \ the scale up to the ﬁeld. Indeed, at a remote\nsensing scale, atmospheric conditions\
    \ are challenging. Wind makes the crops move around\nor may destabilize UAVs affecting\
    \ the quality of images. Rain, fog, and other atmospheric\nfactors could delay\
    \ scheduled measurements. Even more, satellites could not cover the\nentire desired\
    \ area or do it when atmospheric conditions are inadequate, reducing their\ntime\
    \ resolution or even limiting the measurements during long periods in the rainy\
    \ seasons.\nOperational conditions of TIR cameras must be observed, whereas technical\
    \ features,\nsuch as sensitivity and accuracy, should be taken into consideration\
    \ when handling thermal\ndata to avoid misinterpretation of the results. Thermography\
    \ also needs corrections\nto the accuracy of leaf or canopy measurements via the\
    \ development of more accurate\ncomplementary measurements of atmospheric conditions\
    \ disturbing the temperature of\nthe vegetation. That would include wind speed\
    \ and reﬂection of solar radiation on canopy\nsurfaces, dependent on the intensity\
    \ and quality of light affected by weather conditions\non day ﬂights, as reviewed\
    \ in [15,80]. Particular attention must be paid to the spatial\nand temporal variations\
    \ in these factors during the actual measurement. Even though\nthe last generation\
    \ of thermal cameras can make corrections for relative humidity and\ntemperature\
    \ of the air, these atmospheric parameters should be taken into account for other\n\
    TIR sensors. These complementary measurements are needed to improve the quality\
    \ of\nthe thermal data and to help in interpreting thermal information [15]. The\
    \ use of current\nUAVs minimizes the time-of-measurement effects [76]. On the\
    \ other hand, ﬂight altitude\naffects the measurements due to thermal infrared\
    \ radiation attenuation by the atmosphere,\nrequiring some corrections [65]. Focal\
    \ length, related to the ﬂying altitude, is another\ntechnical feature to take\
    \ into consideration in airborne thermography [170]. Nonetheless,\nnanosatellites\
    \ and new generation satellites with increasingly higher time and spatial\nresolution\
    \ could be the future of remote sensing applied to agriculture [84].\nPublic datasets\
    \ are progressively gaining relevance in plant phenotyping, as in many\nother\
    \ research ﬁelds since they offer great opportunities for networking and collaboration.\n\
    However, comparing data with other researchers is limited by technical features.\
    \ A possible\nsolution for this issue would be the development of a system of\
    \ standardization (similar to\nthose issued by the International Commission on\
    \ Illumination, CIE) that could be adopted\nby the international community.\n\
    Remote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n13 of 21\n4.2. Strategies to Overcome the Intrinsic\
    \ Non-Speciﬁcity of Thermal Patterns\nThermography is a sensitive tool for plant\
    \ stress detection. However, alterations in leaf\nor canopy temperature are intrinsically\
    \ unspeciﬁc for the stressor. Indeed, on crop ﬁelds\nunder natural conditions,\
    \ plant diseases are often found concurrent with abiotic stresses.\nConsequently,\
    \ in terms of diagnosis, thermography must be used in combination with other\n\
    phenomics techniques with the aim of ﬁnding distinctive patterns that better explain\
    \ the\netiology of the disorder, thus helping to cut down potential causes of\
    \ disease. Appropriate\nmanagement and control of abiotic stress factors considering\
    \ the heterogeneities of the\nfarmed land appear mandatory to avoid misinterpretations\
    \ of the thermal imagery. For\nexample, in orchards, water management can be improved\
    \ by precise measurements of\nsoil humidity by thermography, as reviewed by [171].\
    \ Thus, an accurate diagnosis and\nquantiﬁcation of the extent and severity of\
    \ disease-related symptoms can only be achieved\nbased on a collection of inputs\
    \ such as the geological features and history of the farmed\nland or weather conditions\
    \ at the time of image collection.\nDeep learning is key in the process of turning\
    \ data into knowledge, particularly when\nthermography is integrated with other\
    \ imaging techniques in a multidimensional analysis,\nas recently reviewed by\
    \ [72]. Public accessibility and interoperability of datasets, from\nhigh-throughput\
    \ phenotyping platforms and satellites, promoted by cooperative initiatives\n\
    such as those funded by the International Plant Phenotyping Network (https://www.plant-\n\
    phenotyping.org), are contributing to develop the potential of plant phenotyping\
    \ [172].\n4.3. Uses of Plant Thermography for Agriculture in the Near Future\n\
    In recent years, huge investments have been made in plant phenotyping facilities\
    \ to\nsupport basic and applied research. Further work is needed to widen our\
    \ knowledge on\nplant physiology upon stress as well as developing improved stress\
    \ detection methods.\nFuture research should also address the development of more\
    \ general stress detection\nmethods, valid for a range of plant species and growth\
    \ conditions, including location,\nor even independent from those factors. The\
    \ contribution of thermography to precision\nagriculture should not be limited\
    \ to the detection of stress.\nThermography also appears as a very convenient\
    \ tool to study other aspects of plants\nthat are out of the scope of this review,\
    \ such as seeds vigor [173], investigations on circadian\nrhythms [174,175], the\
    \ effects of microgravity on plant physiology [176], interactions with\nplant-symbiotic\
    \ microorganisms [177–180], the impact of climate change in ecology [15],\nor\
    \ food industry [181]. Thermography is also a very relevant tool for screening\
    \ for mu-\ntants [182,183] and cultivars [21] with desirable phenotypes such as\
    \ pathogen resistance\nor improved performance upon certain abiotic stress conditions.\
    \ In summary, thermog-\nraphy implemented in high-throughput facilities is contributing\
    \ to the development of\nnext-generation crops by crop breeders.\n5. Concluding\
    \ Remarks\nThe huge collection of works applying thermography to plants and crops\
    \ shows that\nthis technique is overcoming inherent constraints, being able to\
    \ determine plant water\nstatus and to detect plant stress in a robust, reliable,\
    \ low-cost way. On one hand, TIR stress\nindices are often more reliable than\
    \ actual temperature values as they counteract the effects\nof ambient conditions\
    \ on the measurement, providing good correlations with physiological\nparameters\
    \ related to the plant water status. On the other hand, the combined use of\n\
    thermography with other imaging sensors and the application of big data tools\
    \ are an\nadvantageous approach that allows identifying stressed plants and even\
    \ evaluating the\nseverity of symptoms. In spite of this, more detailed studies\
    \ are needed to build a solid\nbase of knowledge applicable to practitioners.\
    \ Additionally, platforms based on imaging\ntechnologies should be developed to\
    \ cover the needs of a wide range of end-users.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 68\n14\

    and content Abstract To effectively and precisely manage crop production is important
    to meet increasing demands of high quality and safe agricultural products. In
    this study, evaluation of water stress in terms of water potentials of leafy vegetables
    using hyperspectral imaging technology was conducted for the future development
    of an agri-robotic system in greenhouses. The leafy vegetable Fengjing Pakchoi
    was cultivated under water stress treatments in a phytotron; both water potential
    and hyperspectral images were measured. The Modified Partial Least Squares Regression
    (MPLSR) with a correlation coefficient of 0.826 was successfully developed to
    determine the water potentials of leaves using hyperspectral imaging. Uneven distribution
    of water potentials on leaves was illustrated and discussed. Water stress which
    reflected irrigation status was visualized and compared by pseudocolor contour
    figures. This study had established a basis for the subsequent development of
    an agri-robotic system for automation and precision irrigation in greenhouses.

  explanation: This study investigates the use of real-time soil matric potential
    measurements to optimize almond irrigation scheduling and explores the potential
    for deficit irrigation to limit negative effects on crop productivity. The authors
    found that a soil water potential threshold (SWPT) of -45 kPa resulted in significant
    water savings (16%) compared to the grower's current management practices without
    affecting crop yield.
  extract_1: For the 4 yr of the experiment, the medium treatment used about 20% less
    water than the grower treatment, with no decrease in average yield. A SWPT of
    −45 kPa is therefore recommended in sandy loam soils under San Joaquin Valley
    conditions between May and harvest to reduce irrigation water use without diminishing
    productivity.
  extract_2: This study also showed that almond trees were negatively affected by
    both excess irrigation and deficit irrigation (−55 kPa).

    PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Core Ideas Maximum yields were obtained with wireless
    real-time tensiometers initiating irrigation at –45 kPa. A significant 16% reduction
    in water use relative to the grower control was achieved by initiating irrigation
    at –45 kPa with no yield reduction. Almond crop is sensitive to water management,
    as being too wet (initiation at -35 kPa) or too dry (initiation at –55 kPa) reduced
    yield by about 11.0 and 11.3%, respectively. ABSTRACT In North America, almond
    [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb] trees are grown almost exclusively in the Central
    Valley of California. Research on deficit irrigation is needed to improve water
    productivity. Real-time technology assessing soil water potential to manage irrigation
    initiation has led to significant improvements in water productivity in other
    crops. The objective of this study was to examine the possibility of using real-time
    tensiometry for irrigation to trigger irrigation events and to generate water
    savings without affecting crop yield. The yield responses and water consumption
    of mature almond trees were quantified from 2012 to 2015 for four different irrigation
    strategies in a commercial orchard located in the San Joaquin Valley in California.
    Three of the treatments were based on soil water potential threshold (SWPT) measurements
    and the fourth on the grower’s current management practices, which used estimated
    crop evapotranspiration (ETc). The SWPT treatments were based on three different
    stress levels: wet (–35 kPa), medium (−45 kPa), and dry (−55 kPa). There was no
    significant difference in marketable yield between the grower irrigation strategy
    and the medium treatment, although the latter used 139 mm less water as a yearly
    average. In the dry treatment, there was 10% less water applied relative to the
    medium treatments and 30% less than the grower treatment but a 10% yield reduction
    compared with the medium and grower treatments. These results indicate that irrigation
    management for almond could be optimized by initiating irrigation at –45 kPa.

    obtained with tensiometers VPDleaf leaf vapor pressure deficit Almonds are produced
    on more than 345,000 ha in California, mainly in the Central Valley (USDA-NASS,
    2015). This area is responsible for almost all almond production in the United
    States and 80% of the world’s production (Almond Board of California, 2016). Directly
    or indirectly, the industry provides about 104,000 jobs and yields an annual economic
    output of about $21.5 billion (Sumner et al., 2014). Although almonds are considered
    to be drought-resistant (Torrecillas et al., 1996), approximately 600 to 1500
    mm of water is required annually to generate acceptable yields (Micke and Kester,
    1998). In California, agriculture uses nearly 80% of the dedicated freshwater
    (Canessa et al., 2012). Excessive pumping leads to lower groundwater levels, saline
    water intrusion, and dry wells (Croyle et al., 2014) and producers are under increasing
    social and environmental regulatory pressure to reduce water use for irrigation.
    The water requirements of almond trees cannot be met by current levels of precipitation
    (75–305 mm, depending on the area), a situation worsened by drought years, like
    those which prevailed in the 2004–2014 period (California Department of Water
    Resources, 2014). With 70% of producers now using microirrigation, water use has
    decreased by almost 33% over the same period (Almond Board of California, 2015)
    but despite this improvement, additional gains in water productivity are needed
    to decrease the water use associated with this major crop. There are three main
    types of irrigation scheduling in use, based on climatic (Type 1), plant (Type
    2), or soil water (Type 3) measurements. The climatic system, Type 1, is the most
    commonly used but requires an accurate estimate of local ETc, which depends on
    the canopy, the irrigation method, the climate, and crop development (Allen et
    al., 1998). Although it provides a good approximation of the quantity of water
    required, it does not, however, determine when it is required, as no soil or plant
    measurements are involved. With respect to Type 2 irrigation scheduling, researchers
    have developed several methods based on tree water status measurements to determine
    when irrigation should be activated (Fereres and Goldhamer, 2003; Fulton et al.,
    2001; Goldhamer et al., 2006; Shackel et al., 1997). Midday stem water potential
    (MSWP) has thus become the current standard irrigation management tool (Fereres
    and Goldhamer, 2003; Fulton et al., 2014; Shackel, 2007; Shackel et al., 1997).
    The continuous monitoring required by this technique is time-consuming (Fulton
    et al., 2001) and requires well-trained technicians (Williams and Araujo, 2002).
    Moreover, it is ill-suited to automated irrigation (Jones, 2004). Thermal sensing
    represents a promising alternative to detect plant stress, especially with the
    rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle technology (Maes and Steppe, 2012).
    Dhillon et al. (2014) have also developed a set of mobile sensors that measure
    leaf temperature and climatic variables to predict water stress. These techniques
    will need to be improved before they can be fully automated (Dhillon et al., 2014;
    Maes and Steppe, 2012). The Type 3 approach to irrigation scheduling uses soil
    water measurements. However, many researchers (Fereres, 1996; Naor, 2006) have
    identified difficulties with regard to these measurements, such as variability
    arising from soil heterogeneity, equipment cost limitations, and calibration requirements.
    Nonetheless, soil water measurements can be collected at multiple locations in
    real time, fully automated, and easily integrated into an irrigation system to
    provide well-timed irrigation (Hodnett et al., 1990; Moutonnet et al., 1981).
    Tensiometers are used to measure soil water potential and have proven to be very
    useful in timing irrigations (Richards and Marsh, 1961; Shock and Wang, 2011).
    Recent technologies based on real-time soil matric potential measurements have
    been successfully implemented in cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) (Pelletier
    et al., 2013) and strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) (Létourneau et al.,
    2015; Anderson, 2015; Gendron et al., 2017) production to reduce water use and
    increase productivity. This technology also has been shown to successfully increase
    celery (Apium graveolens L.) and onion (Allium cepa L.) yields, and spinach (Spinacia
    oleracea L.) germination (Rekika et al., 2014) and prevents tip burn in romaine
    lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in muck soils (Périard et al., 2015), but has
    never been tested for almond. A problem that has been reported when irrigation
    is reduced for strawberry (Anderson, 2015, Gendron et al., 2017) and lettuce (Périard
    et al., 2015) production is that a small delay in initiating irrigation can be
    detrimental to crop growth. These studies used real-time tensiometry to manage
    irrigation and its potential to anticipate coming stress as well as manage deficit
    irrigation to limit any negative effect on crop productivity. However, this approach
    also has never been tested for almond production and may not necessarily be applicable,
    as almond is a tree crop and thus yields respond not only to yearly irrigation
    but, to a large extent, to fruit bearing-spur numbers formed in the previous years
    (Lampinen et al., 2011). The crop is therefore expected to respond to both short-term
    and long-term water management. Therefore, additional research is needed in almond
    to test irrigation scheduling based on real-time soil water potential measurements.
    The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of real-time soil water
    matric potential irrigation thresholds on almond yield and water consumption and
    its potential to manage deficit irrigation in a long-term trial. MATERIAL AND
    METHODS Experimental Site The experiment was conducted from 2012 to 2015 in a
    mature almond tree orchard located in Shafter, CA (35.346° N, 119.2067° W), just
    outside Bakersfield in the San Joaquin Valley. The site is characterized by a
    Milham sandy loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Haplargids)
    (O’Green et al., 2016). The experiment ran from 3 Apr. to 19 Aug. 2012, from 2
    Apr to 15 Aug. 2013, from 1 Apr. to 8 Aug. 2014, and from 18 May to 8 Aug. 2015.
    The almond (cv. Nonpareil) trees were planted on alternate rows (see further details
    below). The experimental plot was located on a 1.2-ha section of a 30.4-ha field,
    with 5.5-m (within-row) by 7.3-m (inter-row) tree spacing. Trees were irrigated
    with a 12-jet microsprinkler irrigation system placed midway between trees at
    58 L h–1 at 0.17 to 0.24 MPa, with a 2-m wetted radius (Gironet, Netafim, CA).
    The soil surface was kept weed-free with herbicides during the experiment according
    to the grower’s management practices following the state appropriate recommendation
    (Weed Research and Information Center; http://wric.ucdavis.edu, accessed 28 Jan.
    2019). Experimental Design The trial comprised 16 rows of 22 trees each (Nonpareil
    variety) separated by guard rows of other varieties (‘Sonora’ and ‘Fritz’). Rows
    were divided into four blocks of four treatments: wet, medium, dry, and grower
    irrigation. Two sample trees per replicate were randomly selected to monitor tree
    water stress (Fig. 1). The experimental layout was arranged as a completely randomized
    block design, with each of the four irrigation treatments described above randomly
    allocated to one single row of the Nonpareil variety within each of the four blocks.
    All four blocks (rows) of a same treatment were irrigated at the same time, independently
    of the other treatments (see below), following the procedure described below.

    treatment represents the block number. MSWP, midday stem water potential; VPDleaf,
    leaf vapor pressure deficit. Climatic, Soil and Tree Water Data In Block 2, three
    tensiometers, connected to a TX3 wireless station (Hortau Inc., Saint-Nicolas,
    QC, Canada), were installed in each of the four treatments at three different
    depths: 25, 50, and 75 cm. Soil water potential data (SWT) were collected continuously
    at 15-min intervals and sent to a web server (Irrolis, https://irrolis.hortau.net,
    accessed 17 Jan. 2019). These depths were chosen after observations made on site
    when the cores were sampled. Roots were not present below 75 cm and root growth
    was sampled idicated that roots were concentrated in the 0- to 50-cm depth at
    the beginning of the experiments. Likewise, an oxidized layer was observed at
    about 75 cm, indicating that little water movement occurred below this depth.
    Several studies have shown that active water uptake by roots occurs mainly in
    the upper soil layer (0–30 cm) and decreases significantly below that depth and
    that the total root zone is limited to the 90- to 100-cm soil depth (Andreu et
    al., 1997; Koumanov et al., 1997, 2006; Vrugt et al., 2001). Tensiometers were
    installed at a distance of 1 m from the microsprinkler, within the 2-m wetted
    radius, at a 45° horizontal angle to the tree row. Because of cost limitations,
    only one station per treatment was used and installed within Block 2, located
    centrally on the site (Fig. 1). Additional hand-held tensiometers were installed
    and used to make sure that the wireless tensiometers’ readings were representative
    of the overall treatment effect. Irrigation was controlled to maintain the soil
    water potential above the target threshold (SWPT) in each treatment: –35 kPa (wet),
    −45 kPa (medium), and −55 kPa (dry). The SWPT values were determined by averaging
    the readings of the tensiometers (the SWT data) at the 25- and 50-cm depths. These
    thresholds were selected according to the model of Rekika et al. (2014), which
    uses site estimates of the expected ETc, the rooting depth, and the soil hydraulic
    properties described below to estimate the critical SWPT when the soil water supply
    could not meet ETc under steady-state conditions. Preliminary evaluations suggested
    that the driest thresholds (−55 and −45 kPa) were low enough to generate some
    stress to the crop relative to the wettest one (–35 kPa). When the threshold was
    attained, irrigation was activated for all rows of the same treatment by a control
    unit (CTR, Hortau Inc.), which remotely triggered solenoid valves (Irritrol, Riverside,
    CA; Rainbird, Azusa, CA) and an electric pump. Irrigation was stopped when the
    wetting front reached the tensiometer at the 75-cm depth (when the SWT at 75 cm
    began to increase). The grower treatment (grower) was controlled by the producer
    on the basis of ETc estimates and amounted to 758, 754, 685, and 450 mm yearly
    from 2012 to 2015. The producer aimed to replace 100% of ETc losses over 2- or
    3-wk cycles. Climatic data were measured by an automated weather station (Hortau
    Inc.) installed on site. Reference evapotranspiration was calculated via the Penman–Monteith
    equation (Allen et al., 1998) for a fully irrigated grass cover. For comparison
    purposes, the crop coefficient (Kc) values of Allen et al. (1998), Goldhamer and
    Viveros (2000), Steduto et al. (2012), and Sanden (2009) were used to estimate
    ETc. Water use differed from year to year as the duration of the trial varied
    from year to year. For that reason, the percentage of cumulative crop evapotranspiration
    of the monitoring season (%ETc), calculated as the sum of irrigation water use
    and rainfall divided by ETc, was used to compare water use among years and between
    the two treatments. Midday stem water potential was measured weekly (12:00 PM
    to 16:00 PM) (Fulton et al., 2014) on the same two trees in each plot with a pump-up
    chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Albany, OR) and a pressure chamber (Soil Moisture
    Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA). Stem water potential bags (PMS Instrument
    Company) were installed on shaded leaves on a lower branch near the trunk at least
    10 min before measurements were taken (Fulton et al., 2001). Measurements were
    taken immediately after leaf excision. Before installing the stem water potential
    bags, leaf temperature was measured with an infrared thermometer (IR 1000, Klein
    Tools, IL). Shaded leaves are better suited for determining plant water status
    and measuring leaf temperature (Dhillon et al., 2014). Leaf temperature and relative
    humidity, as measured by the weather station, were used to estimate the leaf vapor
    pressure deficit (VPDleaf). Plant measurements were taken from the beginning of
    May until harvest in mid-August and were averaged per single tree per year for
    statistical analysis. In 2012, soils were excavated to describe and characterize
    soil properties by horizon and to evaluate root growth. Profiles were made midway
    between trees on the same row. Thirteen undisturbed soil cores (8.2 cm diameter
    by 5.5 cm height) were collected at depths of 25 (×7) and 50 cm (×6) to determine
    bulk density, which averaged 1.67 g cm–3 at the 25-cm depth and 1.65 g cm–3 at
    the 15-cm depth. Data on soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention
    curves have been reported elsewhere (Collin, 2017). Root distribution was observed
    in open profiles and noted. Textural classes were determined from particle size
    analysis of disturbed samples taken in 2011 (Gee and Bauder, 1986). At the beginning
    and end of each season, new profiles were characterized, root distribution was
    recorded, and disturbed soil samples were analyzed in all plots to monitor electrical
    conductivity and pH at the 25- and 50-cm depths via the soil saturated extract
    method (Brown, 1988) to check salinity buildup under different irrigation management
    systems. Yield Measurements At harvest, two trees per replicate were mechanically
    shaken by commercial equipment. Immediately afterwards, almonds were collected
    in an average area of 5.5 by 7.3 m and weighed. Subsamples (∼300 almonds) were
    cracked, sorted, and dried at 80°C until equilibrium weight was attained to determine
    marketable yield. Additional yield values were obtained from producer data for
    2011 to 2014 for neighboring plots in which the same wireless tensiometer technology
    was used. The in-season (May to mid-August) average SWPT at 25 to 50 cm was related
    to these average yields to obtain more response values. Water Use During the monitoring
    period, rotary flowmeters were installed to measure the quantity of water applied,
    with an accuracy of ±1.5% (IP80-Series, Seametrics, WA) and ±3% (TM Series, GPI,
    KS). Flowmeters measured all water applied to the crop: water used for irrigation
    treatments and water used for fertilizer applications. Fertilizer applications
    were performed weekly in four shots in April, before the irrigation treatments
    started. Flowmeters were installed for treatments at the beginning of irrigation
    lines (IP80-Series flowmeters) and at the end of the first block of all irrigation
    treatment (TM Series flowmeters). Water use was recorded continuously by flowmeters
    and transmitted by a wireless station at 15-min intervals (Hortau Inc.) in the
    SWPT treatments and weekly for fertilization application and the grower irrigation.
    The SWPT treatments were connected to the grower irrigation system through manual
    valves to ensure that all treatments received the same fertilization. The valves
    were opened before and closed after the fertilizer applications by a technician.
    Irrigation was taken over by the producer 2 wk before harvest to allow the same
    preharvest management in all treatments. Statistical Analysis ANOVA was carried
    out with SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) via the GLM procedure. Least
    significant differences were calculated to compare treatment means. Statistical
    comparisons were considered significant at P < 0.05. Statistical analysis and
    relationships were based on the mean values of seasonal MSWP, VPDleaf, SWPT, and
    %ETc of the whole season. The boundary approach (Webb, 1972) was used to approximate
    the optimum values for MDSWP, VPDleaf, SWPT, and %ETc on the basis of almond yield.
    The boundary data were established via the Schnug approach (Schnug et al., 1996)
    without excluding outliers or lifting data. Polynomial and spline functions were
    used on the boundary data to generate the boundary lines. The boundary line analysis
    was programmed using R software (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). This
    approach is often chosen for biological databases when one has little control
    over the environmental conditions (Webb, 1972), like the case here, and was selected
    for this reason. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The textural analyses showed that the
    soil is a fine sandy loam at both depths, consistent with O’Green et al. (2016).
    Soil analysis did not indicate crop limitation effects or treatment effects on
    pH and electrical conductivity. Soil salinity never exceeded the salt tolerance
    threshold of 1.5 dS m–1 (Bernstein et al., 1956; Brown et al., 1953; Maas, 1990)
    for the 4 yr of the experiment (Table 1). Bulk density values did not indicate
    crop limitations effects and were characteristic of light-textured soils. Roots
    were mainly observed in the first 50 to 60 cm, as reported above, in the first
    two samplings and were observed to have moved deeper in the profile (70–90 cm)
    in 2015 and closer to the emitter. Table 1. Soil chemical and physical properties

    Tree and Soil Water Status With available water in the soil from winter rain,
    irrigation, additional water from fertigation, and reduced evapotranspiration
    demand, the trees were not subjected to hydric stress at the beginning of the
    season (before May). Even if irrigation treatments started in early May, stresses
    were mainly observed from early June to harvest, when ETc demand peaked, as confirmed
    by plant water status measurements. Table 2 presents the cumulative water input,
    SWPTs, and the number of irrigation applications for each year of the experiment.
    Figure 2 presents the cumulative water components for each season: ETc, rainfall,
    and irrigation water for each SWPT treatment as calculated from the tensiometer
    readings at the 25- and 50-cm depths. During the monitoring period, the grower,
    wet, and medium treatments received more water than the dry treatment. Over the
    4-yr experimental period, the grower treatment used about 557 mm (24%) more irrigation
    water than the wet and medium treatments, and about 971 mm (51%) more than the
    dry treatment. The medium and wet treatments received similar amounts of water,
    probably because of the reduced growth observed in the wet treatment, which is
    likely to be a result of root asphyxia, leading to lower water consumption. Table

    The experiment was carried out from 3 Apr. to 19 Aug. 2012, from 2 Apr. to 15
    Aug. 2013, from 1 Apr. to 8 Aug. 2014, and from 18 May to 8 Aug. 2015. ‡ The percentage
    of cumulative crop evapotranspiration of the monitoring season (%ETc) was calculated
    as the sum of irrigation water use and rainfall divided by crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) with the crop coefficient provided by Allen et al. (1998). Values in parentheses
    are in mm. § Average SWPT ± SD ¶ Number of irrigation applications corresponds
    to the number of samples used for mean SWPTs. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer Cumulative
    water input (for treatments), site rainfall, and crop evapotranspiration (ETc)
    in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. A water use trend is apparent in the three SWPT
    treatments through all 4 yr, especially so in the dry treatment. Although the
    target SWPT was the same every year and ETc decreased with time, water use in
    %ETc increased from 2012 to 2015; this increase was particularly evident at the
    end of 2015. In the wet and medium treatments, increased water use was observed
    in 2014 and 2015, relative to the first 2 yr. In 2015, water use in all treatments
    exceeded ETc. Qualitative in-field observations suggest that with more regular
    irrigation and a wetting bulb (the wetted volume by the emitter) of quite uniform
    size relative to uneven irrigation, almonds trees reacted by increasing root development
    at the periphery of the wetting bulb. In the profile dug up in 2015, roots were
    found deeper than in 2012 and were located in between the tensiometer and the
    emitter. This increased root density caused a reduction of the wetting bulb dimension,
    because of roots intercepting the water front moving from the emitter toward the
    tensiometer. As the tensiometers remained in the same location from year to year,
    the expected tensiometer responses were delayed because of this interception for
    the same irrigation duration, which led to increased water applications. This
    observation made in the profile is consistent with those of Coelho and Or (1999)
    and Vrugt et al. (2001), who showed that irrigation strategy influences root development.
    Consequently, in future studies and for long-term use in irrigated almond orchards,
    tensiometers should be moved periodically to avoid such an effect. Targeted SWPTs
    differed slightly from the observed values as the thresholds were difficult to
    achieve at the beginning of the season during fertigation and were exceeded at
    the end of the season during the dry period when water applications were delayed
    because of restricted water allocation and availability. Furthermore, since irrigation
    water had to be ordered in advance for a specific threshold and because SWT readings
    at the 50- and 75-cm depths reacted only a couple of hours after the beginning
    of irrigation, the start of irrigation needed to be approximated and, consequently,
    irrigation had sometimes to be activated earlier or was sometimes delayed relative
    to the target threshold because of these ordering or additional usual operational
    constraints (staff or equipment limitations). Despite these limitations, the thresholds
    for all treatments were not significantly different from the target values, except
    for the wet treatment in 2013. All data were kept, though, as the wet treatment
    still remained wetter than the medium and the dry treatments in that year. Regarding
    the objective of the study, the most important difference among treatments was
    that the grower treatment used more water but this treatment had a more variable
    threshold, indicating that the grower sometimes irrigated when the soil was still
    wet and sometimes when it was too dry. The second important observation regarding
    the objective of this study was that MSWP and VPDleaf in the dry treatment (–1.346
    MPa and 2.419 kPa) were different (higher for VPDleaf and lower for MSWP) from
    those in the other treatments (Table 3). The values were similar in the wet (–1.246
    MPa and 2.371 kPa) and medium (–1.198 MPa and 2.354 kPa) treatments, except for
    MSWP in 2013. The grower treatment (–1.089 MPa and 2.297 kPa) showed the least
    stress (higher MSWP or less negative), consistent with the higher water consumption
    measured in this treatment. The mean seasonal MSWP in all treatments was generally
    maintained in the mild stress zone [–1.0 to –1.4 MPa according to Fulton et al.,
    (2014)], except in the dry treatment in 2012–2013 (–1.643 and –1.401 MPa) and
    in the wet treatment in 2013 (–1.520 MPa). Table 3. Midday stem water potential

    suggesting that the overall growing conditions were representative, if not better,
    than normal almond orchard operations and productivity (USDA-NASS, 2016) and that
    factors other than irrigation were unlikely to control plant responses. Table

    were used to determine relationships between seasonal yield and the following
    variables: soil water potential threshold (SWPT), midday stem water potential
    (MSWP), leaf vapor pressure deficit (VPDleaf), and percentage of cumulative crop
    evapotranspiration of the monitoring season (%ETc). § Not applicable. The average
    yield (2012–2015) from the medium treatment (−45 kPa) exceeded that of the wet
    (11.0% increase) and dry (11.3% increase) treatments and these differences were
    significant. The results associated with the wet treatment relative to the medium
    treatment could be attributable to increased vegetative growth, as reported by
    other studies (Ebel et al., 1995; Hutmacher et al., 1994); root asphyxia causing
    stomatal closure and a consequent decrease in photosynthesis (Amador et al., 2012);
    or other constraints. Yield reductions in the dry treatment were linked to decreased
    fruit load and kernel size resulting from limited soil water availability and
    the possible years of cumulative irrigation effect on spur production (Lampinen
    et al., 2011). Indeed, even if yield is possibly affected by the same year’s irrigation
    management, it is also affected by antecedent management (including irrigation)
    effects on fruit-bearing spurs produced the years before. Therefore, irrigation
    effects may be better evaluated by looking at long-term yield irrigation trials.
    When summed over 4 yr, although the grower and medium treatments produced the
    same average yield, the medium treatment used an yearly average of 139 mm less
    water (16% less). Moreover, the grower treatment produced a higher yield than
    the wet treatment (11.2% higher). This yield difference may be attributable to
    the more variable irrigation pattern in the grower treatment, as reflected by
    the higher SD of the SWPT of grower’s data relative to the wet treatment (Table
    2). Indeed, data for the grower treatment indicated a SD of SWPT of 21.6 relative
    to 12.5 kPa for the wet treatment, showing that irrigation was sometimes initiated
    as low as −60.6 kPa (–39.0 + 1 times the SD of –21.6 kPa), in comparison with
    −53 kPa for the wet treatment. Dry periods in this treatment may have allowed
    more oxygen to enter the soil profile than the more uniform irrigation pattern
    in the wet treatment. Relative to the medium treatment, the dry periods in the
    grower treatment may have also caused some yield decrease (the medium treatment
    reached a low −57.0 kPa on average for 4 yr) but also some wetter conditions in
    the grower treatment, with irrigation initiation in the range of –27.4 kPa (–39
    + 21.6 kPa), compared with –37 kPa for the medium treatment. These results indicate
    that all water potential irrigation treatments had a less variable SWPT than the
    grower treatment. There were significant yield differences among years (P < 0.0001)
    and for the interactions among treatments and years (P = 0.0004) and treatments
    and blocks (P < 0.0001). Although the linear correlations were generally low (R2
    = 0.166 and 0.150, and 0.455 and 0.102 respectively for MSWP vs. VPDleaf and yield
    in 2012 and 2013, they were significant (data not shown). Figure 3 shows data
    for all years for MWSP, VPDleaf, and %ETc in relation to yield. Midday stem water
    potential was concentrated between –0.8 and –1.4 MPa in the grower treatment and
    between –1.0 and –1.4 MPa in the wet and the medium treatments, except in 2013,
    when MSWP in the wet treatment was lower than –1.4 MPa. Midday stem water potential
    in the dry treatment was generally lower than –1.3 MPa (indicating more stress),
    except in 2015, when it rose to –1.00 MPa (see Table 3). According to the boundary
    line, optimum yields were obtained for MSWPs between –1.1 and –1.3 MPa. This finding
    is consistent with that of Fulton et al. (2014), who suggested maintaining MSWP
    in the –1.0 to –1.4 MPa range from mid-June through to July. The VPDleaf data
    were more variable, ranging from 2 to 2.9 kPa for each treatment. Higher yields
    corresponded to VPDleaf values between 2.2 and 2.5 kPa. Although there was only
    one %ETc value for each treatment in each year, the boundary line indicated the
    highest yields when ETc was near 100%, according to the Kc recommended by Allen
    et al. (1998). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer Midday stem water potential (MSWP),
    leaf vapor pressure deficit (VPDleaf), and percentage of cumulative crop evapotranspiration
    of the monitoring season (%ETc) related to almond yield for all experimental years,
    except for VDPleaf in 2014, when leaf temperatures were missing. Each point represents
    the season average data of the same tree (weekly measurements between 1200 and
    1600 hr as recommended by Fulton et al. (2014)), with the same replicate, with
    its corresponding yield. In the same way, the boundary line for SWPT and yield
    data was used to determine the optimal value (Fig. 4). We used mean yield data
    from neighboring fields collected over different years and monitored with SWT
    stations to improve this relationship. When we used a polynomial regression on
    the boundary data, a SWPT of −45 kPa was found to be optimal, according to our
    experiment. This is wetter than the recommendations of Taylor (1965) and Micke
    (1996), who suggested starting irrigation between −50 and −80 kPa for deciduous
    fruit trees or between −50 and −70 kPa at a depth of 45 to 60 cm for almonds.
    On the basis of the results obtained in the experimental treatments from 2012
    to 2015 (Fig. 4), however, it seems that a small deviation from the −45 kPa target
    value would lead to a greater decrease in marketable yield than the boundary line
    responses obtained for values from the neighboring fields for different years
    monitored with SWT stations. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer Relationship between
    soil water potential threshold (SWPT) and almond yield via the boundary line approach.
    The regression was drawn from the boundary data (open boxes). Boxes that appear
    to be filled simply reflect superimposition of symbols. Figure 5 shows simulated
    relationships between MSWP and %ETc and between SWPT and %ETc, with boundary lines
    for yield (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4), as suggested by Webb (1972). Even if the intervals
    between the SWPTs in this study were relatively large, the treatments were still
    in the mild stress range according to the MSWP values. The boundary lines for
    these parameters show that almond yield was affected by both insufficient and
    excess irrigation. Most studies focus principally on deficit irrigation, so little
    information is available on the effects of excess water in almond production.
    In a young orchard, Hutmacher et al. (1994) found no significant difference in
    yield between treatments receiving 150 and 175% ETc through drip irrigation. However,
    their experiment detected leaching even at the rate of 100% ETc and the authors
    questioned their irrigation frequency, application rates and wetted volume. They
    also showed that applying more water than required increased vegetative growth.
    Girona et al. (2005), on the other hand, reported no surplus vegetative growth
    for a 130% ETc treatment and a nonsignificant decrease in yield between 70 and
    130% relative to 100% ETc in a young (<5 yr) orchard under micro-sprinkler irrigation;
    ours was much older (>8 yr). Nevertheless, even if this phenomenon is more frequent
    in flood irrigation, hypoxia has been found to cause atmospheric gas exchange
    problems leading to growth reductions (Drew, 1983). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer
    Boundary relationships between percentage of cumulative crop evapotranspiration
    of the monitoring season (%ETc) and midday stem water potential (MSWP) and between
    %ETc and soil water potential threshold (SWPT). Red, orange, and blue lines represent
    crop stress associated with different MSWP levels in almonds according to Fulton
    et al. (2014). For practical use and irrigation guidance, this study also indicates
    the importance of the choice of Kc value to calculate the 100% ETc water requirements,
    as the height of water to be applied through irrigation will vary according to
    the calculated 100% ETc and hence the chosen model. For models indicating maximum
    yield at 80% ETc like Sanden (2009) and those recommended by Goldhamer, as cited
    by Steduto et al. (2012), applying water up to 100% ETc will obviously result
    in 20% extra water use than other Kc values suggested by Allen et al. (1998) (Fig.
    6). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer Percentage of cumulative crop evapotranspiration
    of the monitoring season (%ETc) related to almond yield for all experimental years,
    using crop coefficient values from Allen et al. (1998), Goldhamer (Steduto et
    al. 2012), Sanden (2009), Girona (2006), and Goldhamer and Viveros (2000). According
    to the results of this study, increased irrigation would probably have reduced
    yields and led to overapplication of water. This difference emphasizes the importance
    of Kc in irrigation scheduling based on ETc and indicates that using the Kc suggested
    by Allen et al. (1998) would help producers reduce water consumption without compromising
    yield. The study also emphasizes the importance of having soil water potential
    measurements not only to detect appropriate irrigation timing but also to allow
    adjustment for biases with evapotranspiration models used for irrigation management.
    The −45kPa threshold recommended here is for a full season, after fertilizer application
    and prior to harvest. This threshold reduced water use by 16% relative to the
    grower treatment, with the same yield. Further research is needed to determine
    optimum SWPTs for different stages of growth, as some additional water savings
    could be generated, particularly prior to harvest. There is also a need to adjust
    these thresholds to account for spatiotemporal variability (Collin, 2017). Practical
    Implications First, the results of this study indicate that growers under the
    same orchard conditions can use a SWPT of −45 kPa between May and harvest to schedule
    irrigation with wireless tensiometers. This threshold represents the mean value
    of tensiometers placed at the 25-cm depth and those at the 50-cm depth. Irrigation
    should be stopped when the wetting front reaches the 75-cm tensiometer. Tensiometers
    should be placed in the wet zone at the periphery of the wetted perimeter and
    moved as the perimeter evolves. Practically, they should be moved every second
    year as the rooting volume moves closer to the emitter with time. If only one
    tensiometer station is used in a field, it should be coupled with direct observations
    or plant measurements of MSWP several times during the season to ensure that the
    system is functioning adequately. Additional soil water potential measurements
    at different locations should be performed to confirm that the station is located
    in a representative spot of the orchard. Ideally, additional stations should be
    added to provide a good average and to increase the net margin of almond orchards,
    as reported by Collin, (2017). Second, this study shows that almond yield is adversely
    affected by excess water, possibly because of surplus vegetative growth or root
    asphyxia. Third, it was noted that using the new Kc values recommended for almond
    production (Steduto et al., 2012) under the conditions of this study would not
    only have led to increased water use but decreased marketable yield as well. Growers
    should therefore take care to use the Kc values best suited to their specific
    orchard characteristics. CONCLUSION For the 4 yr of the experiment, the medium
    treatment used about 20% less water than the grower treatment, with no decrease
    in average yield. A SWPT of −45 kPa is therefore recommended in sandy loam soils
    under San Joaquin Valley conditions between May and harvest to reduce irrigation
    water use without diminishing productivity. This study also showed that almond
    trees were negatively affected by both excess irrigation and deficit irrigation
    (−55 kPa). Finally, some attention should be paid to the Kc recommendations in
    almond orchards to ensure optimal yield and water use. CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT

    Get rights and content Highlights • An empirical CWSI determined from mini RPAS
    is assessed in a SHD olive orchard. • The Non-Water-Stressed Baselines were not
    constant along the irrigation season. • CWSI derived from aerial thermal imagery
    was sensitive to tree water status. • Stomatal conductance exhibited the tightest
    relationship with CWSI. Abstract Characterization of the spatio-temporal variability
    of tree water status is a prerequisite to conducting precise irrigation management
    in fruit tree orchards. This study assessed the suitability of a crop water stress
    index (CWSI) derived from high-resolution aerial thermal imagery for estimating
    tree water status variability in super high density (SHD) olive orchards. The
    experiment was conducted at a commercial SHD olive orchard near Seville (southwestern
    Spain), with drip irrigated trees under three irrigation treatments (four plots
    per treatment in a randomized block design): a full irrigation treatment to replace
    the crop water needs (ETc) and two regulated deficit irrigation treatments to
    replace ca. 45% of ETc. Meteorological variables, soil moisture content, leaf
    water potential, stem water potential and leaf gas exchange measurements were
    performed along the irrigation season. Infrared temperature sensors (IRTs) installed
    approximately 1 m above the canopies were used to derive the required Non-Water-Stressed
    Baselines (NWSBs) for CWSI calculation. NWSBs were not common during the growing
    season, although the seasonal effect could be partly explained with solar angle
    variations. A thermal camera installed on a mini Remotely Piloted Aircraft System
    (RPAS) allowed for the recording of high-resolution thermal images on 5 representative
    dates during the irrigation season. The CWSI values derived from aerial thermal
    imagery were sensitive to the imposed variations in tree water status within the
    SHD olive orchard. Among the recorded variables, maximum stomatal conductance
    showed the tightest correlation with CWSI. We concluded that high-resolution thermal
    imagery captured from a mini RPAS is a suitable tool for defining tree water status
    variability within SHD olive orchards. Previous article in issue Next article

    1. Introduction Hedgerow olive orchards with high plant densities (>1500 trees
    ha−1), or super high density (SHD) olive orchards, have expanded dramatically
    since the early 1990s. Over 100,000 ha are currently under this management system,
    half of them in Spain (Rius and Lacarte, 2010). Most SHD olive orchards are under
    irrigation, requiring ca. 5000 m3 ha−1 to replace maximum crop evapotranspiration
    in semi-arid areas such as SW Spain (Fernández et al., 2013). This explains the
    increasing interest in developing precision irrigation techniques to increase
    water productivity (Cuevas et al., 2013, Egea et al., 2016, Fernández et al.,
    2013, Gómez Del Campo and García, 2013, Padilla-Díaz et al., 2016). The spatial
    variability in crop water needs caused by soil heterogeneity and differences in
    canopy cover may be an important limitation for efficient irrigation when water
    is applied uniformly across the orchard (Couvreur et al., 2016). Characterization
    of the spatial variability of crop water needs is therefore a prerequisite to
    apply precise irrigation management within SHD olive orchards. It will allow to
    supply different irrigation amounts to zones within the orchard with different
    water requirements. Mapping the spatio-temporal variability of tree water needs
    with conventional methods such as the pressure chamber (Scholander et al., 1965)
    is time and labor consuming (Jiménez-Bello et al., 2011). In addition, the reliability
    of the information provided by the pressure chamber decreases when the species
    shows an isohydric behavior, characterized by a strong stomatal regulation that
    avoids marked decreases in leaf water potentials under conditions of low soil
    water and high evaporative demand (Fernández, 2014). There are other conventional
    although reliable indicators of water stress, such as the stomatal conductance
    but, once again, measurements must be made manually (Jones, 2007). Remote sensing
    techniques offer a promising alternative to traditional tree water status measurements,
    as they provide a snapshot of the whole orchard over a reduced period of time.
    The advent of Remote Piloted Aerial Systems (RPAS) has offered an opportunity
    to develop remote sensing-based methodologies for precision irrigation more affordably
    than the costly airborne campaigns with manned aircrafts and with higher spatial
    and temporal resolutions than those normally offered by satellites. Various sources
    of remotely sensed imagery, with differences in spectral, spatial, radioactive
    and temporal characteristics, are known to be suitable for different purposes
    of vegetation mapping (Xie et al., 2008). Among these sources, thermal imagery
    of vegetation is becoming popular for water stress detection and for irrigation
    management purposes (Bellvert et al., 2016b, Berni et al., 2009). This is due
    to the existing relationship between crop transpiration rate and canopy temperature
    through a cooling effect that the former exerts on vegetation temperature (Maes
    and Steppe, 2012). Since the refinement of the technique for measuring crop surface
    temperature with infrared thermometers in the 1960s (Fuchs and Tanner, 1966),
    thermal remote sensing has been extensively used to diagnose plant water stress
    in multiple crop species (Hatfield et al., 1985, Nielsen and Anderson, 1989, Sepulcre-Cantó
    et al., 2006, Testi et al., 2008). Variations in crop temperature are due to water
    stress, but are also affected by various meteorological and morphological factors
    (Maes and Steppe, 2012). Therefore crop temperature must be normalized before
    being used as water stress indicator. In the early 1980s, Idso et al. (1981) and
    Jackson et al. (1981) developed the concept of CWSI, a normalized index that overcomes
    the influence that other environmental variables play on the relationship between
    crop temperature and water stress. Since then, CWSI has been successfully used
    in a variety of crops, in which temperature readings were often made with hand-held
    infrared thermometers (Alderfasi and Nielsen, 2001, Hatfield et al., 1985). Currently,
    the combined used of modern high-resolution thermal infrared cameras and RPAS
    offer the possibility to map spatial variability in tree water status from thermal
    imaging and temperature-derived indicators (Bellvert et al., 2016a). As reviewed
    in Maes and Steppe (2012), CWSI can be determined by at least three different
    methodologies. Among them, the empirical CWSI has attained much more popularity
    and become more successful among scientists and non-scientists mainly due to the
    limited data requirements and straightforward calculation as compared to the analytical
    and direct methodologies (Agam et al., 2013, Maes and Steppe, 2012). Idso et al.
    (1981) calculated the empirical CWSI as follows: (1) where Tc-Ta denotes the measured
    canopy-air temperature difference; (Tc-Ta)LL is the lower limit of (Tc-Ta) for
    a given vapor pressure deficit (VPD) which is equivalent to a canopy transpiring
    at the potential rate; and (Tc-Ta)UL is the maximum (Tc-Ta), which corresponds
    to a non-transpiring canopy. (Tc-Ta)LL is a linear function of VPD (non-water-stressed
    baseline, NWSB) that, once empirically obtained, (Tc-Ta)LL is calculated by solving
    the baseline equation for the actual VPD. To our knowledge, there are two reports
    in the literature that provide empirical NWSBs for olive trees (Bellvert et al.,
    2016a, Berni et al., 2009). However, both equations are reasonably different as
    denoted by the very small (expressed as absolute value) slope (−0.35 °C kPa−1)
    obtained by Berni et al. (2009) as compared to that (−2.05 °C kPa−1) reported
    in Bellvert et al. (2016a). These differences in the sensitivity of Tc-Ta to VPD
    in olive are so important that more research is needed to reduce the degree of
    uncertainty in the appropriate NWSB to be used in SHD olive orchards. Moreover,
    these studies provided a single NWSB obtained with measurements collected at a
    certain daytime (e.g. 12:30 GMT in Berni et al. (2009)), but a comprehensive study
    on how NWSB varies both along the day and the season is lacking in olive trees.
    To reduce the lack of information mentioned above on the use of CWSI and NWSB
    in olive, we design this study according to the following objectives: (i) to determine
    the NWSB for olive in a commercial SHD olive orchard as well as its diurnal and
    seasonal (throughout the irrigation season) time courses, (ii) to compute CWSI
    throughout the irrigation season in trees under three irrigation treatments from
    the obtained NWSB and high resolution aerial thermal imagery taken from a mini
    RPAS, and (iii) to assess the suitability of the derived CWSI values to estimate
    the variation of tree water status within SHD olive orchards. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Experimental site The experiment was conducted in 2015 at a commercial
    SHD olive orchard near Seville, in southwestern Spain (37.248979, −5.796538).
    Nine year-old olive trees (Olea europaea L., cv. Arbequina) were planted with
    4 m x 1.5 m tree spacing (1667 trees ha−1). The drip irrigation system consisted
    of one drip line per tree row and three 2 L h−1 pressure compensating drippers
    (0.5 m apart) per tree. One flow meter per irrigation treatment recorded the amount
    of water applied during each irrigation event. An irrigation controller (Agronic
    2000, Sistemes Electrònics PROGRÉS, S.A., Lleida, Spain) was used for irrigation
    scheduling. Trees were fertilized to cover the crop needs and no weeds were allowed
    to grow in the inter-row spacing over the spring-summer seasons. The climate of
    the study area is Mediterranean, with rainfall occurring normally from late September
    to May. The average annual value of potential reference evapotranspiration (ET0)
    and precipitation calculated for the 2002–2014 period from data recorded by a
    standard weather station belonging to the Andalusian government and located near
    the orchard, were 1528 mm and 540 mm, respectively. Table 1 shows the weather
    data (monthly averages) recorded over the experimental year. The orchard soil
    has a sandy loam top layer (0.0–0.4 m) and a sandy clay layer (0.4–1.0 m) underneath.
    The electrical conductivity of the saturated soil-paste (ECe), pH and organic
    matter content determined in the 0.0-0.4 m soil layer were 2.5 dS m−1, 6.34 and
    0.28%, respectively. Table 1. Weather variables measured during 2015 at a nearby

    treatments Three irrigation treatments were established in the orchard, as described
    in Padilla-Díaz et al. (2016): a full irrigation treatment (FI) in which the trees
    were irrigated daily for the whole irrigation season to supply 100% of the irrigation
    needs (IN), and two regulated deficit irrigation treatments (45RDI) for which
    the total water supplied during the season was aimed to replace 45% of IN. One
    of the 45RDI treatments was scheduled on the basis of the crop coefficient method
    (45RDICC), whereas the other 45RDI treatment was scheduled from leaf turgor related
    measurements (45RDITP) made with ZIM probes (Zimmermann et al., 2008). The 45RDI
    trees were irrigated with enough water to replace IN in three periods of the year
    when olive is most sensitive to water stress (Fernández, 2014): from the last
    stages of floral development to full bloom (period 1, mid-April), at 6–10 weeks
    after full bloom (period 2, June) and some 3 weeks prior to ripening (period 3,
    from late August to mid-September). For the rest of the year just one or two irrigation
    events per week are applied. The crop coefficient method was applied for scheduling
    irrigation in both the FI and 45RDICC treatments, with crop coefficients adjusted
    for the orchard conditions by Fernández et al. (2013). For the 45RDITP treatment
    irrigation was scheduled from the outputs of the ZIM probes, which are related
    to the leaf turgor pressure. We used the approach described by Padilla-Díaz et
    al. (2016). Basically, the shape of the daily curves provided by the ZIM probes
    and the 3-day weather forecast were used to adjust irrigation in the three periods
    mentioned above, such that the irrigation amounts were close or equal to IN in
    those periods. In between the periods and after period 3, all treatments were
    irrigated with the crop coefficient approach and according to the 45RDI strategy
    described by Fernández (2014). We used four 16 m x 12 m plots per treatment, in
    a randomized block design. Each plot contained 32 trees, of which measurements
    were made on the central 8 trees to avoid border effects. 2.3. Thermal imagery
    acquisition A thermal infrared (TIR) camera (Tau 2 324, FLIR Systems, Inc., Oregon,
    USA) was mounted on a multirotor RPAS (Remote Piloted Aerial System) model Phantom
    2 (SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China). The RPAS is equipped with a
    GNSS receptor, has flight autonomy of 25 min and a remote control range of 1000
    m in open spaces. The TIR camera was installed to aim vertically downward (nadir
    view) at the bottom of the RPAS. The camera spectral range is 7.5–13.5 μm with
    a resolution of 324 × 256 pixels, a focal length of 9 mm, and a field of view
    of 49° (H) x 39° (V). The RPAS was flown across the experimental orchard on five
    clear sky days, at 20 m above the ground level and at solar noon, delivering thermal
    images with a ground spatial resolution of 5 cm. The thermal images were stored
    on board in a raw format with 14-bit radiometric resolution. At the time of each
    flight, surface temperature measurements of ground targets were used for indirect
    calibration of the thermal imagery (Bellvert et al., 2014, Dupin et al., 2011).
    In particular, a cold (wet cotton sheet) and hot references (40 cm x 50 cm black
    plastic panels) located in the center of each experimental plot along with four
    monitored trees with infrared thermometers (IRTS) (Section 2.4) were used as ground
    targets. The cold and hot references were measured with a hand-held infrared thermometer
    model FLUKE 62 Max (FLUKE, Washington, DC, USA). 2.4. Measurements at ground level
    Volumetric soil water content (θ) was measured in all plots (n = 4) with a PR2-type
    Profile Probe (Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK). In each location, measurements
    were made at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6 and 1.0 m depth, once every 7–10 days throughout
    the irrigation season. The θ measurements were always performed after an irrigation
    event, between 10:00 and 12:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), i.e. close to solar
    noon at the longitude of our experimental site. The probe was calibrated in situ
    by Fernández et al. (2011). The θ values were used to calculate changes in the
    relative extractable water (REW) for all treatments, as described elsewhere (Fernández
    et al., 2013). The midday stem water potential (Ψst) was measured with a Scholander-type
    pressure chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Albany, Oregon, USA) on the same days
    that the RPAS was flown. One leaf per tree, from the inner part of the canopy,
    was wrapped in aluminum foil ca. 2 h before sampling, in two representative trees
    per plot (n = 8). Measurements of Ψst were made at 11:30–12:30 GMT when minimum
    daily values are usually recorded in olive. Stomatal conductance (gsm) was measured
    on the same days and on the same trees where Ψst was measured, but between 09:00–10:00
    GMT, the time of maximum daily stomatal conductance in this species (Fernández
    et al., 1997). A Licor LI-6400 portable photosynthesis system (Li-cor, Lincoln
    Nebraska, USA) with a 2 cm × 3 cm standard chamber was used to measure gsm and
    leaf transpiration rate (Em) in sunny leaves of current-year shoots from the outer
    part of the canopy facing SE and in ambient light (≈1500 μmol m−2 s−1) and CO2
    (370–400 μmol mol−1) conditions. Four Infrared Remote Temperature Sensors (IRTs)
    (model IR120, Campbell Scientific Ltd., Shepshed, UK) were mounted over two representative
    trees of one out of four plots in FI and 45RDITP treatments. The sensors had an
    angular field of view of 20° (half angle), and the accuracy over the calibrated
    range was ± 0.2 °C. The IRTs were mounted on galvanized steel masts with a horizontal
    mounting arm (model IR1 × 0, Campbell Scientific Ltd., Shepshed, UK) ending with
    a white PVC solar shield (model IR-SS, Campbell Scientific Ltd., Shepshed, UK)
    to protect the sensor. The IRTs were mounted to aim vertically downward (nadir
    view), targeting the center of the canopy from a distance of approximately 1 m.
    The dense canopies typical of hedgerow olive orchards allowed the IRTs to view
    mostly foliage in a circular area of approximately 0.7 m diameter at the top of
    the canopy. The IRTs were connected to two dataloggers (model CR1000, Campbell
    Scientific Ltd., Shepshed, UK), which recorded the canopy temperatures (Tc) every
    minute and stored the 15-min averages. The canopy temperature measurements began
    on June 16th, 2015 (DOY 167) and continued with a sole interruption of 12 days
    due to power outage until November 5th (DOY 275). Values of Tc measured with the
    IRTs above the FI trees were used to derive the Non-Water-Stressed Baselines (NWSB)
    for CWSI calculation. Only clear-sky days were used for NWSB determination. Clear-sky
    days following a rainfall event were also discarded to avoid errors associated
    with wet foliage. Air temperature (Ta) along with VPD data were recorded in the
    orchard every 30 min with a Campbell weather station (Campbell Scientific Ltd.,
    Shepshed, UK) at the same time that Tc were used to derive the NWSB of the SHD
    olive orchard. 2.5. Image processing and CWSI calculation The thermal images taken
    with the RPAS (Fig. 1) were used to calculate the mean canopy temperature (Tc)
    of each experimental plot. Only the central 8 trees of each plot were used to
    calculate the mean Tc to avoid border effects. An image segmentation algorithm
    written in R (R Core Team, 2015) was used to extract pure vegetation pixels from
    the thermal image. At solar noon, the effects of tree shadow are minimized, and
    the thermal images are composed mainly of canopy, soil and mixed plant-soil pixels.
    Firstly, vegetation pixels from a bi-modal histogram (i.e. a histogram with two
    clearly differentiated peaks ascribed to soil and vegetation pixels in the point
    cloud) (Fig. 2) were selected with the mentioned algorithm. Then, the ‘full width
    at one-eighth maximum (FWEM)’ rule was used to distinguish the pixels with high
    probability of being pure vegetation from pixels that were likely to be mixed
    vegetation with soil and/or shadow effects. The FWEM rule is similar to the ‘full
    width at half maximum’ (FWHM) rule that has been previously used to extract pure
    vegetation pixels from olive canopies (Rud et al., 2015), but differed in the
    amplitude of the selected histogram (one-eighth of the maximum in FWEM versus
    half the maximum in FWHM). FWHM demonstrated a lack of suitability for segmenting
    thermal images with multiple trees that differ greatly in their Tc, since vegetation
    pixels from trees with severe water stress can be erroneously discarded by the
    FWHM rule (Fig. 3). The selected segment resulting from the FWEM rule was then
    used to compute the mean Tc for each experimental plot. Download : Download high-res

    to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of
    this article.) Mean Tc was used to calculate the CWSI for each experimental plot
    using Eq. (1). For each day of flight, (Tc-Ta)LL was calculated from the NWSB
    that was determined with the IRTs, as described in Section 2.4 and with the actual
    air VPD. The value of (Tc-Ta)UL was determined as Ta + 5 °C based on previous
    studies conducted in different crop species (Irmak et al., 2000, Möller et al.,
    2007), including olive trees (Agam et al., 2014, Agam et al., 2013, Ben-Gal et
    al., 2009, Rud et al., 2015). 2.6. Statistical analyses The relationships between
    Tc-Ta and VPD (NWSBs) as well as between CWSI and the physiological measurements
    were analyzed through linear regression analyses. The diurnal time-course of slopes
    and intercepts of the derived NWSBs was modeled through non-linear regression
    analysis. In all cases, the coefficient of determination (R2) was used to assess
    the goodness of fit of the associations among variables. Significant differences
    between slopes and non-zero intercepts of the NWSBs obtained diurnally and seasonally
    were evaluated with the Comparison of Regression Lines tool included in the statistical
    package Statgraphics (Statgraphics Centurion XV). 3. Results 3.1. Non-Water-Stressed
    baselines The relationship between hourly ΔT (Tc − Ta) and VPD values derived
    for FI olive trees in clear-sky days throughout the study period, did not yield
    any significant relationship when all hours and days were pooled together (data
    not shown). The relationships became significant when ΔT and VPD were regressed
    for a given time of the day, as shown in Table 2. The coefficients of determination
    (R2) were notably affected by the daytime. The highest R2 were observed early
    in the morning (R2 = 0.74 at 8.00 GMT). These values decreased progressively down
    to 0.28 (14:00 GMT), recovering partially afterwards (R2 = 0.51 at 18.00 GMT).
    The intercepts and slopes of the fitted NWSBs also varied throughout the day.
    The intercepts were higher at midday (2.50 at 12:00 GMT) and lower in the morning
    and afternoon whereas the slopes showed an increasing trend throughout the day
    (from −0.77 °C kPa−1 at 8.00 GMT to around −0.3 °C kPa−1in the evening). Table

    on the NWSBs, a marked seasonal effect in the ΔT vs VPD relationship was also
    observed (Fig. 4), as the NWSB shifted in August (Period B) and September (Period
    C), compared to the values derived in June-July (Period A). When ΔT and VPD of
    a given time of the day and for a given period were regressed, the level of agreement
    of the NWSBs increased significantly, and the diurnal effect of R2 observed using
    pooled data (Table 2) was not noticed (Table 3). Seasonal variations in the NWSBs
    were mainly due to significant variations in the NWSB-intercepts, as the NWSB-slopes
    remained almost invariant throughout the irrigation season (Table 3). As observed
    for the NWSBs obtained with pooled data (Table 2), the NWSBs derived during the
    three periods of study (A, B and C) also exhibited a strong diurnal variation
    (Fig. 5). The diurnal time-course of the NWSB-intercepts was successfully modeled
    with fourth-order polynomial equations during the three periods of study (A, B
    and C) (Fig. 6), whereas that of the NWSB-slopes was successfully modeled with
    second-order polynomial equations (Fig. 7). In order to reduce the empiricism
    and site specificity of these models, the parameters of the NWSBs obtained were
    regressed against the zenith solar angle (Testi et al., 2008). While the relation
    between the NWSB-slopes and zenith solar angle was not significant (data not shown),
    the NWSB-intercepts showed a tight relationship with solar angle (Fig. 8). As
    depicted in Fig. 8a, this relationship showed a marked hysteresis during periods
    A and B but not in period C. When the dataset was split into morning and afternoon
    data, it was observed that the relationship NWSB-intercept vs solar angle was
    season-dependent during the morning hours only (period C differed from A and B)
    (Fig. 8b), whereas no seasonal effect on NWSB-intercept was observed during the
    afternoon (Fig. 8c). Download : Download high-res image (207KB) Download : Download

    stress index derived from IRTs and RPAS The canopy temperature measurements obtained
    with the IRTs and with the thermal camera mounted on the RPAS were used to derive
    the seasonal dynamics of CWSI in the irrigation treatments (Figs. 9a, b). The
    CWSI obtained from the IRT readings was markedly influenced by the irrigation
    regime (Fig. 9a). In FI, CWSI values ranged within the interval −0.17 to 0.15
    throughout the irrigation season, with a mean value of 0.00. During the first
    water stress period depicted in Fig. 9 (DOY 174–236), the deficit irrigation treatment
    monitored with the IRTs (45RDITP) exhibited values of CWSI that were much higher
    than those found in FI trees, up to approximately 0.7 (Fig. 9a). During the last
    water stress period (DOY 258 onwards), the differences in CWSI between FI and
    45RDITP were lower, with values close to 0 and 0.2, respectively. Download : Download

    arrow indicates the end of a water stress period. The error bars represent the
    standard error of the mean (SE). In (b) and (c), asterisks denote significant
    differences at P < 0.05. The CWSI values determined from aerial thermal imaging
    in FI, 45RDITP and 45RDICC treatments are depicted in Fig. 9b. The FI trees exhibited
    values of CWSI that ranged from −0.07 to 0.17, with mean seasonal values of 0.04.
    The 45RDITP and 45RDICC treatments showed similar trends, with maximum values
    close to 0.8 observed during the first water stress period. The differences in
    CWSI between FI and 45RDI treatments for DOY 239 and 281 were much smaller and
    not statistically significant, with mean values close to 0.3-0.4 in 45RDITP and
    45RDICC and close to 0 in FI. The seasonal trend of CWSI derived from aerial thermal
    imaging was similar to that of REW (Fig. 9c), which also revealed significant
    differences between FI and the 45RDI treatments during the first water stress
    period but not afterwards. 3.3. Relationship between CWSI and other plant-based
    water status indicators The CWSI values derived from aerial thermal imaging for
    the five days of flight and the three irrigation treatments were plotted against
    stem water potential (Ψst), leaf water potential (Ψl), stomatal conductance (gsm)
    and leaf transpiration rate (Em) (Fig. 10). In all cases, significant (P < 0.01)
    linear regressions were observed. The goodness of fit of the relationship between
    Ψst and Ψl with CWSI were similar, with coefficients of determination close to
    0.7 (Figs. 9a, 9b). The relationship between leaf transpiration rate (Em) and
    CWSI was somewhat weaker than that previously described for Ψst and Ψl, with a
    coefficient of determination of 0.6 (Fig. 10d). Stomatal conductance (gsm) was
    the physiological variable that exhibited the tightest linear relationship with
    CWSI, with a coefficient of determination of 0.91 (Fig. 10c). Download : Download

    The diurnal variation observed in the non-water-stressed baselines (NWSBs) derived
    for olive trees (Fig. 5) has already been described in other woody species, such
    as pistachio (Testi et al., 2008) and grapevine (Bellvert et al., 2014). Both
    of these studies found that diurnal shifts in the NWSBs were mainly due to variations
    in the NWSB-intercept, as the slope of the baselines was rather stable. As explained
    theoretically by Jackson et al. (1981), the intercept of the NWSB is expected
    to increase with solar radiation and to decrease with wind speed. In our case
    study, diurnal variations of the NWSB-intercept due to wind speed are unlikely
    since the experimental area is not particularly windy (diurnal wind speed was
    below 2 m s−1 most of the days) and the effect of low to moderate wind speed on
    NWSB has been reported to be negligible (Testi et al., 2008), although it has
    to be noted that was in a different species with different aerodynamic conductance
    for sensible heat flux. Therefore, the observed diurnal variation in the NWSB-intercept
    (Table 2, Table 3) was likely driven by solar radiation, as evidenced by the tight
    relationship found with zenith solar angle (Fig. 8). As compared to previous findings
    in which NWSB-intercept and solar angle were linearly related (Testi et al., 2008),
    in our olive trees the relationship showed a marked hysteresis during periods
    A and B (Fig. 8a). This behaviour indicates that, for similar radiation and VPD
    levels, the cooling effect of transpiration in the summer (periods A and B) is
    higher during the morning hours. This can be due to the fact that, in olive, stomata
    opening is greater in the morning than in the afternoon (Fernández et al., 1997).
    Therefore, transpiration and its cooling effect is also greater in morning than
    in afternoon hours. Unlike what has been observed in previous studies on woody
    crops (Bellvert et al., 2014, Testi et al., 2008), the diurnal evolution of the
    NWSB-slope in olives was stable only from 12:00 GMT onwards, whereas an increasing
    trend that was more pronounced as the season progressed was observed between 8:00
    to 12:00 GMT Compared to other crop species, the NWSB-intercept derived for olives
    (the maximum was approximately 3.5 °C for period A and close to 3 °C in periods
    B and C; Fig. 6) was within the order of magnitude of those found in the literature
    for other herbaceous (Idso, 1982) and woody crop species (Bellvert et al., 2015,
    Testi et al., 2008). However, the NWSB-slope (maximum values around −0.5 °C kPa−1
    for periods A and B and close to −0.7 °C kPa−1 in period C; Fig. 7) derived for
    olives was substantially lower (expressed as an absolute value) than the slopes
    derived for other crop species, with the sole exception of the values derived
    for citrus trees (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014). In herbaceous crops, Idso (1982)
    found NWSB-slope values within the interval −3.25 °C kPa−1 to −1.23 °C kPa−1,
    whereas in other fruit tree species the corresponding midday values were around
    −1.35 °C kPa−1 (pistachio), −1.7 °C kPa−1 (peach) and −1.9 °C kPa−1 (vineyard)
    (Bellvert et al., 2016a, Bellvert et al., 2014, Testi et al., 2008). In olive
    trees, two previous studies provide controversial NWSB-slope values, as denoted
    by the very small slope (−0.35 °C kPa−1) obtained by Berni et al. (2009) compared
    to that (−2.05 °C kPa−1) reported by Bellvert et al. (2016a). Our findings are
    in agreement with the small slope value found by Berni et al. (2009), who argued
    that this value was a consequence of the small size of olive leaves, which makes
    them to be highly coupled to the atmosphere, causing a marked stomatal closure
    when the evaporative demand increases, even in trees under non-limiting soil water
    conditions (Fernández et al., 1997). Seasonal differences in the NWSBs were already
    reported early in the 1980s for two herbaceous crops, wheat and barley (Idso,
    1982), but little is known about the seasonal stability of the NWSBs derived for
    many others herbaceous and woody crop species. In peach trees, within season differences
    in the NWSB were small (Bellvert et al., 2016a); thus, a unique NWSB for the whole
    growing season was recommended by the authors. In olive trees, Berni et al. (2009)
    obtained their NWSB (Tc− Ta = −0.35·VPD + 2.08, R2 = 0.67) by computing the values
    from clear days (12:30 GMT) from April to September. They did not report any seasonal
    effect on such a relationship, but stressed the high scatter and the low slope
    as compared to those reported by other authors. By comparing their NWSB with the
    one obtained in this study (Tc− Ta = −0.36·VPD + 2.50, R2 = 0.49) for the period
    June-September at a similar time (12:00 GMT, Table 2), it can be observed that
    there are no differences in the slopes and the intercepts are very similar. Therefore,
    a plausible explanation for the high scatter reported by Berni et al. (2009) is
    a within-season shift in the NWSB, like the one shown by our results. Recently,
    Bellvert et al. (2015) found that some vineyard cultivars exhibited seasonal NWSB
    shifts, which were associated to variations in the energy balance of the canopy,
    zenith solar angle or leaf orientation. In our case study, the seasonal shift
    of the NWSBs (Fig. 6, Fig. 7) was partly explained by variations in zenith solar
    angle (Fig. 8). In fact, the seasonal variation of NWSB-intercept derived for
    afternoon hours could be explained by zenith solar angle variations (Fig. 8c).
    However, this could not be done for the morning NWSB-intercept values, since NWSB-intercept
    of period C was higher than that of periods A and B for similar solar angles (Fig.
    8b). In any case, the robustness of the derived NWSB to be used for irrigation
    scheduling, as well as its daily and seasonal dynamics, should be assessed in
    different locations and cultivars similarly to what has been performed for other
    olive water status indicators (Corell et al., 2016). Although the CWSI values
    calculated from IRTs and RPAS are not fully comparable, since the former was calculated
    from measurements collected at one out of the four plots used to compute CWSI
    from RPAS measurements, both indicators followed the same seasonal trend and depicted
    values within the same order of magnitude, both for the FI and 45RDITP treatments
    (Fig. 9). Although CWSI is supposed to vary within 0 and 1, slightly negative
    values of CWSI may also be found in well-watered plants, as in our FI trees (Fig.
    9a, b), due to the data scatter of the NWSBs (Bellvert et al., 2015, Testi et
    al., 2008). Values of CWSI derived from the FI trees with both sensing platforms
    throughout the irrigation season were close to zero. The deficit treatment that
    was monitored with IRTs and RPAS exhibited the highest values during the first
    water stress period depicted in Fig. 9 (end of June-end of August), reaching ca.
    0.7 and 0.8 respectively for REW values ca. 0.2 (Fig. 9c). The close matching
    in CWSI trends among proximal (IRTs) and remote (RPAS) thermal sensing indicates
    that the Tc measurements derived from the mini RPAS using a segmentation method
    based on a bi-modal histogram analysis and the FWEM rule are suitable for monitoring
    the CWSI in SHD olive orchards. The suitability of CWSI as a water stress index
    for SHD olive orchards was also demonstrated through the sound relationships found
    between CWSI and the reference plant water stress indicators, such as Ψst, Ψl,
    gsm and Em (Fig. 10). Interestingly, the CWSI explained 91% of the variability
    observed in gsm across treatments and periods (Fig. 10c), whereas the variability
    of Ψst, Ψl and Em that could be explained with CWSI was only 60%–73% (Fig. 10a,
    b and d). These results are in agreement with the theoretical basis of CWSI (Maes
    and Steppe, 2012) which denotes that, under water stress, variations in CWSI are
    driven by variations in Tc and gsm is a main driving physiological variable. However,
    and due to the near-isohydric behavior of the olive tree (Cuevas et al., 2010),
    decreases in leaf and stem water potential under conditions of water stress are
    minimized by stomatal regulation, thus explaining the poorer relationships found
    between CWSI and these variables. In a previous work conducted in an olive orchard
    with less tree density than ours, Berni et al. (2009) also found that CWSI was
    linearly related to both gsm and Ψl and that CWSI was better correlated with gsm
    than with Ψl. However, gsm is not always better correlated with CWSI than Ψl,
    as recently found in nectarines (Bellvert et al., 2016a). Despite that leaf transpiration
    (Em) and gsm are strongly related (Jones, 1992), the relationship between CWSI
    and Em was weaker than that with gsm (Fig. 10), likely because Em depends not
    only on gsm but also on the boundary layer conductance (gb) (Jones, 1992), whose
    value within the leaf cuvette of the gas analyzer set by the user may greatly
    differ from the prevailing gb values in the orchard. In the majority of studies
    performed to assess CWSI performance on fruit tree species, the variable used
    to validate the suitability of CWSI as a water status indicator was Ψst (Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al., 2014, Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013, Testi et al., 2008) or Ψl (Bellvert
    et al., 2016a, Bellvert et al., 2015, Bellvert et al., 2014). However, reported
    relationships between CWSI and these variables are not always linear, as it has
    also been observed in this study (Figs. 10a, b). For mandarin and orange trees,
    for instance, curvilinear relationships have been reported (Gonzalez-Dugo et al.,
    2014). In other species, such as grapevine (Bellvert et al., 2015, Bellvert et
    al., 2014) or peach (Bellvert et al., 2016a, Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013) both
    linear and curvilinear relationships have been reported. 5. Conclusions The Non-Water-Stressed
    Baseline (NWSB) for CWSI calculation in SHD olive orchards was not constant throughout
    the growing season, but its seasonal shift could be partly explained by variations
    in zenith solar angle. Both NWSB-intercepts and NWSB-slopes exhibited diurnal
    variation, but these trends were successfully modeled with polynomial equations
    to ease CWSI calculation at any time of the day. In order to reduce the empiricism
    and site specificity of these models, a sound relationship between NWSB-intercept
    and solar angle was found. The CWSI values derived from high-resolution thermal
    imagery captured from a mini RPAS demonstrated to be a suitable indicator for
    both monitoring water stress and assessing water status variability in SHD olive
    orchards. Stomatal conductance had the tightest relationship with CWSI, over performing
    other widely used plant water status indicators such as leaf or stem water potential.

  explanation: The study's goal was to create a continuous leaf monitoring system
    to predict plant water stress by measuring leaf temperature, air temperature,
    relative humidity, ambient light, and wind conditions near a shaded leaf. The
    system was then integrated into a wireless mesh network for remote data collection
    and valve control. Experiments in commercial walnut and almond orchards during
    the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons showed the system to be reliable and capable
    of providing real-time, remote data visualization with minimal technical difficulties.

    Wireless mesh network. Abstract. There is increased demand for irrigation scheduling
    tools that support effective use of the limited supply of irrigation water. An
    efficient precision irrigation system requires water to be delivered based on
    crop needs by measuring or estimating plant water stress. Leaf temperature is
    a good indicator of water stress. In this study, a system was developed to monitor
    leaf temperature and microclimatic environmental variables to predict plant water
    stress. This system, called the leaf monitor, monitored plant water status by
    continuously measuring leaf temperature, air temperature, relative humidity, ambient
    light, and wind conditions in the vicinity of a shaded leaf. The system also included
    a leaf holder, a solar radiation diffuser dome, and a wind barrier for improved
    performance of the unit. Controlled wind speed and consistent light conditions
    were created around the leaf to reduce the effect of nuisance variables on leaf
    temperature. The leaf monitor was incorporated into a mesh network of wireless

    for remote data collection in commercial orchards. Experiments were conducted

    to predict plant water status by measuring the leaf temperature and microclimatic
    variables in nut crop trees and grapevines. The sensor suite consists of an infrared
    thermometer to measure leaf temperature along with other relevant sensors to measure
    microclimatic variables. The sensor suite was successfully evaluated in commercial
    orchards in the Sacramento Valley of California on three orchard crops, i.e.,
    almond (Prunus dulcis), walnut (Juglans regia), and grape (Vitis vinifera), for
    both sunlit and shaded leaves. Stepwise linear regression models developed for
    shaded leaf temperature yielded coefficient of multiple determination values of
    0.90, 0.86, and 0.86 for almond, walnut, and grape crops, respectively. Stem water
    potential (SWP) was found to be a significant variable in all models. The regression
    models were used to classify trees into water stressed and unstressed categories.
    Critical misclassification errors (classifying a water stressed tree as unstressed)
    for sunlit and shaded leaf models were 8.8% and 5.2% for almond, 5.4% and 6.9%
    for walnut, and 12.9% and 8.1% for grapevine, respectively. Canonical discriminant
    analyses were also conducted using the sensor suite data to classify trees into
    water stressed and unstressed trees with critical misclassification errors for
    sunlit and shaded leaves of 9.3% and 7.8% for almond, 2.0% and 4.1% for walnut,
    and 9.6% and 1.6% for grapevine, respectively. These results show the feasibility
    of the sensor suite to determine plant water status for irrigation management
    of nut and vineyard crops. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 19 Share Facebook

    Get rights and content Highlights • Technology to acquire thermal images using
    UAVs has progressed very much lately. • Thermal imaging was used to estimate within-vineyard
    variations in water status. • The technique showed a great potential to monitor
    instantaneous variations. • At seasonal scale, it was related to relevant agronomic
    variables. • Multiple dates of thermal images are required to monitor seasonal
    water status. Abstract Thermal imaging can become a readily usable tool for crop
    agricultural water management, since it allows a quick determination of canopy
    surface temperature that, as linked to transpiration, can give an idea of crop
    water status. In the last years, the resolution of thermal imaging systems has
    increased and its weight decreased, fostering their implementation on Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for civil and agricultural engineering purposes. This approach
    would overcome most of the limitations of on site thermal imaging, allowing mapping
    plant water status at either field or farm scale, taking thus into account the
    naturally existing or artificially induced variability at those scales. The aim
    of this work was to evaluate to which extent high-resolution thermal imaging allows
    evaluating the instantaneous and seasonal variability of water status within a
    vineyard. The novelty and significance of our approach is that the specifically
    designed and build unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provided very high-resolution
    imaging (pixel <9 cm), and that it was used at a commercially relevant acreage
    (7.5 ha). This set-up was used to obtain Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) from thermal
    images in a clear-sky day. CWSI values were and compared to stem water potential
    (Ψs) and stomatal conductance (gs) measured at 14 sampling sites across the vineyard
    at the moment when images where acquired. In order to evaluate the potential of
    CWSI acquired in a single day to estimate within-vineyard patterns of variation
    in water status, a spatial modeling approach was used. CWSI correlated well with
    Ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition, showing to have a great potential
    to monitor instantaneous variations in water status within a vineyard. The information
    provided by thermal images proved to be relevant at a seasonal scale as well,
    although it did not match seasonal trends in water status but mimicked other physiological
    processes occurring during ripening. Therefore, if a picture of variations in
    water status is required, it would be necessary to acquire thermal images at several
    dates along the summer. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    1. Introduction In the last two-decades, Precision Agriculture techniques have
    been progressively implemented in viticulture, giving birth to what is called
    Precision Viticulture (PV). Along those years, PV has focused on delineating management
    zones, i.e.: on defining within-vineyard areas that are relatively homogeneous,
    and different to other areas in the same vineyard (Arno et al., 2011, Arnó et
    al., 2009, Urretavizcaya et al., 2014). This approach is very appropriate for
    high-value crops such as grapevine and, when transferred to grape-growing companies,
    it usually implies adopting site-specific cultural practices for each zone defined
    (Bramley et al., 2011b, Santesteban et al., 2013, Serrano et al., 2015). In those
    companies, where new generation grape harvesters are available, the zones delineated
    can also be used to automatically segregate grapes from the same field into two
    batches to improve global wine quality (Bramley et al., 2011a, Santos et al.,
    2012). The most common sources of information on field spatial variability for
    zone delineation are (i) vegetation indices obtained from airborne multispectral
    cameras, (ii) soil apparent conductivity or resistivity, and (iii) data gathered
    in situ following a sampling grid (Arnó et al., 2009). However, those approaches
    are not considering any variable directly related to plant water status, which,
    in semi-arid areas, is usually regarded to be the major factor determining grape
    yield and berry composition (Medrano et al., 2014). Besides, in a context of climate
    change, water status is also expected to play an increasingly relevant role in
    cooler areas, as water deficit periods along the growing season are expected to
    occur more likely in the near future (Ashenfelter and Storchmann, 2016, Fraga
    et al., 2012, Viguié et al., 2014), so PV approaches should pay much greater attention
    to water availability. Whole field imaging using thermal cameras is a source of
    useful information in this regard, as it allows estimating canopy temperature,
    known to be related to plant transpiration and, therefore, to plant water status
    (Jackson et al., 1988, Jackson et al., 1981). High resolution thermal cameras
    have been successfully mounted on aircraft platforms (Sepulcre-Canto et al., 2006)
    and on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), increasingly using higher performance sensors
    in terms of lower size and weight, and of greater spectral and spatial resolutions.
    Last generation thermal cameras can reach centimeter ground resolution, providing
    enough accuracy for canopy extraction in discontinuous crops in rows such as grapevines
    and fruit trees, and are a promising tool for field and irrigation management
    applications (Berni et al., 2009, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012). In viticulture,
    proximal thermal sensing has been shown to be a good tool to estimate plant water
    status (Fuentes et al., 2012, Grant et al., 2007, Jones et al., 2002, Pou et al.,
    2014). In those approaches, a thermal camera is directly used to get a lateral
    view, or mounted on a shaft or a crane, to get a zenithal view; and relatively
    good agreement is observed between canopy-temperature derived indices and plant
    water potential or stomatal conductance. On the contrary, the implementation of
    UAV-based thermal imaging solutions has not been well explored yet in viticulture,
    since the resolution obtained must be sufficient to enable targeting pure canopy
    pixels, avoiding mixed soil/vegetation pixels (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2015), which
    is particularly complicated in most vineyards due to the structure of the crop,
    trellised in narrow rows. In one of those works, Baluja et al. (2012a) evaluated
    the water status variability of a commercial rainfed Tempranillo vineyard using
    a UAV platform, and observed that some vegetation indices, not derived from thermal
    images but from multispectral ones, were better correlated to stomatal conductance
    and leaf water potential, probably as they reflected a longer term response. Another
    research team also working in Spain, evaluated the correlation between Crop Water
    Stress Index (CWSI, a canopy-temperature derived index) and leaf water potential,
    reporting that correlation improved at noon (Bellvert et al., 2014), and exploring
    the potentiality of the technique for setting thresholds useful for irrigation
    scheduling (Bellvert et al., 2015a, Bellvert et al., 2015b). Gonzalez-Dugo et
    al. (2013) recently suggested that the requirements to achieve the water stress
    monitoring using aerial platforms are: (a) establish a strong correlation between
    stress indices and actual water stress in the field; (ii) the spatial resolution
    must be sufficient to enable targeting pure canopy pixels, avoiding mixed soil/vegetation
    pixel; (iii) the ability to evaluate entire fields in individual flight; (iv)
    faster turn-around acquisition times and processing in order to provide quasi-real
    time water status maps helping the farmer decision-making process. The aim of
    this study is to evaluate the interest of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging
    to estimate the instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within
    a vineyard. The significance of our approach is that we worked at a commercially
    realistic scale (7.5 ha), the high resolution of the thermal images acquired (9
    cm pixel−1), and that we tested to which extent the information provided by one
    flight campaign can be used to evaluate spatial variability in water availability
    across the season. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Vineyard characterization The
    experimental work was performed in a 7.5 ha vineyard located in Traibuenas, Navarra,
    Spain (42°22′20.1″N 1°37′34.2″W, WGS84, Altitude: 328 m), in a region characterized
    by a semiarid climate (Bs type in Koppen’s classification; P < 350 mm; ETPPenman
    >1150 mm). The vineyard is trained as a vertical shoot positioned bilateral cordon,
    bud number fixed at 12 buds per m of row line, plant spacing being 3 m between
    rows and 1 m within the row. The vineyard was 18 years-old at the beginning of
    the experiment, it was managed according to standard practices in the area, and
    vines were not affected in a significant way by pests or diseases, with the sole
    exception of approx. 2% of the vines showing slight to moderate esca symptoms.
    Spatial variability within the vineyard was characterized setting up two sampling
    grids. The first one (Fig. 1a), dedicated to the agronomical characterization
    of the vineyard, was comprised of 92 sampling points (SP), and followed a relatively
    regular rectangular pattern with a mean distance of 25 × 25 m between SP. The
    second grid was dedicated to vine water status characterization, followed an irregular
    pattern (Fig. 1b) conformed by 14 water status measurement points (WSP). On every
    SP and WSP, 10 vines located at two adjacent rows were marked, and all of them
    used for the experimental measurements and sampling procedures detailed below.

    Fig. 1. Aerial view of the vineyard indicating the location of (a) Sampling Points
    (SP) and (b) Water status Sampling Points (WSP). The agronomical characterization
    of the 92 SP included the following measurements: - Vegetative growth, estimated
    as the total shoot cross sectional area (SCSA) per vine. The basal diameter of
    all the shoots in the 10 vines in the SP was measured with a hand-held caliper
    at the end of July, once apical growth had stopped. At winter rest, trunk cross
    sectional area (TCSA) was determined measuring trunk diameter 30 cm above-ground.
    - Yield, determined at harvest by counting and weighting all the clusters produced
    in the 10 vines at each SP. - Grape composition at harvest: one 300-berry sample
    was taken at each SP was taken to determine berry weight (BW) as well as the main
    composition parameters. After crushing, total soluble solids concentration (TSS)
    was measured with a temperature compensating refractometer RFM840 (Bellingham-Stanley
    Ltd., Kent, UK), pH and titratable acidity (TA) using a pH-Burette 24 auto-titrator
    (Crison, Barcelona, Spain), malic (MalA) and tartaric acid (TarA) concentration
    was measured enzymatically using an autoanalyzer (Easychem, Systea s.p.a., Italy),
    whereas yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) was estimated following the procedure
    described by Aerny (1996) with the modifications detailed in Garcia et al. (2011).
    Total anthocyanins (TAnt) content was evaluated after 4 h extraction at pH = 1.0
    following the methodology described in Glories and Augustin (1993). - Berry carbon
    isotope ratio (δ13C), measured in 50-berry samples gathered at harvest, then oven-dried
    and ground into a fine homogeneous powder, and analysed as using an Elemental
    analyzer (NC2500, Carlo Erba Reagents, Rodano, Italy) coupled to Isotopic Mass
    Spectrometer (Thermoquest Delta Plus, ThermoFinnigan, Bremen, Germany) as detailed
    in Santesteban et al. (2012). This measurement was done in 2014 and in 2015. The
    characterization of the 14 WSP included, in addition to the agronomic measurements
    described for the SP, weekly measurements of stem water potential at mid-morning
    (Ψs-m) and at noon (Ψs-n). Measurements were taken from 15 days after fruit set,
    until harvest time in 2014 and 2015. At each WSP, five healthy leaves were bagged
    1.5 h prior to measurement using zip-bags covered with a metalized high-density
    polyethylene reflective film (SonocoRF, Sonoco Products Co., Hartsville, SC, USA).
    Stem water potential was determined using a Scholander pressure bomb (P3000, Soil
    Moisture Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). Last, we also had information available
    on soil apparent electric conductivity (ECa) and on Plant Cell Density (PCD) vegetation
    index. ECa was estimated in December 2014, when soil was at field capacity, at
    every SP using a handheld EM38 conductivity meter (Geonics Ltd, Ontario, Canada).
    PCD was calculated as the ratio between RED/NIR bands from images acquired by
    an airborne RGB-NIR sensor, gathered in a commercial mission performed by a private
    company (Agropixel SA) on August 10th of 2015. PCD values were normalized to a
    8-bit scale (0–255). 2.2. UAV platform and payload The UAV platform (Fig. 2a)
    was a modified multi-rotor MikrokopterOktoXL (HiSystems GmbH, Moomerland, Germany),
    an open-source project described in detail in Matese et al. (2015), which included
    a pre-assembled hardware and a GPS V3.0 module as positioning system, able to
    carry a 2 kg payload for 15 min flight time. Flight parameters communication to
    the ground operator were provided by a radio link at 2.4 GHz, while another channel
    at 5.8 GHz was used for remote sensing data transmission. The core of the UAV
    system is a Flight Control board (FlightCtrl), based on an ATMega1284P microcontroller
    (Atmel Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA), which communicates with the eight brushless
    controllers by a two-wire bi-directional serial bus (I2C). It integrates a pressure
    sensor and 3-axis accelerometers to calculate and align the UAV with gravity.
    The FlightCtrl is linked to a navigation control board (NaviCtrl), equipped with
    an ARM9 microcontroller (Atmel Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA) and a MicroSD slot
    card for waypoint data storage. An integrated navigation sensor system based on
    a 3D digital compass to monitor the z (yaw) axis rotation and a LEA-6 GPS module
    (U-blox AG, Thalwil, Switzerland) with a circular error of about 2 m, allow various
    levels of autonomous flight. The UAV mounts eight ATMEGA8 control cards (Atmel
    Corporation, San Jose, CA, USA), dedicated to the management of each brushless
    motor with a very quick time response (less than 0.5 ms). The flight planning
    was conducted with Mikrokopter Tools software, which allows the user to generate
    a route of waypoints as a function of the sensor Field Of View (FOV), the degree
    of overlap between images and the ground resolution needed. A universal camera
    mount equipped with three servomotors allows a correct image acquisition by correcting
    the tilt and rolling effects. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    acquisition (a) and detailed view of multispectral (b) and thermal (c) cameras
    mounted on it. A FLIR TAU II 320 (FLIR Systems, Inc., USA) was used for thermal
    data acquisition. This sensor, optimized for UAV application, is of minimal size
    (44.5 × 44.5 × 30.0 mm) and weight (72 g). Imaging sensor characteristics, i.e.
    324 × 256 pixels and 24° × 18° FOV with fixed focal length of 19 mm, allows obtaining
    images of about 40 × 30 m at the ground, with a resolution of 0.13 m/pixel at
    100 m flight altitude. The camera is equipped with an uncooled sensor able to
    measure longwave radiation in the spectral range 7.5–13 μm. Radiometric calibration
    was conducted in the laboratory, using blackbodies under varying target and ambient
    temperatures to develop radiometric calibration algorithms following the procedure
    described in Berni et al. (2009). 2.3. Flight campaign At early veraison (28th
    July 2015), the site was monitored with a single flight survey at 70 m above ground
    level at solar noon, providing 9 cm pixel−1 ground image resolution. Camera settings
    were set to a fixed exposure with automatic trigger at 2 s frequency. The waypoint
    route was generated to obtain 80% overlap both between photos (forward overlap)
    and between flight lines (lateral overlap), in order to achieve the highest accuracy
    in mosaicking elaboration step. The images were recorded during homogeneous and
    stable radiation conditions, under clear sky conditions and with no wind. The
    thermal acquisition by the UAV was made between 13:00 to 14:30 h by means of five
    consecutive flights of 15 min each. Shortly after thermal image acquisition by
    the UAV (5–10 min later), stem water potential (Ψs) and leaf stomatal conductance
    (gs) were measured in all the WSP. Ψs was measured following the same protocol
    and sample size used in the weekly measurements of Ψs-m and Ψs-n, wheras gs was
    determined in three sunlit leaves per WSP using a hand-held porometer (SC-1, Decagon
    Devices Inc., Pullman, Washington). 2.4. Image data processing Leaf emissivity
    acquired in the thermal infrared spectral region allowed the computation of water
    stress related to leaf temperature, through the estimation of CWSI (Crop Water
    Stress Index) using the modified Eq. (1) derived by (Jackson et al., 1988): (1)
    CWSI = (Tleaf − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet) where Tdry and Twet are, respectively, the
    dry leaf reference temperature representing a stressed leaf temperature and wet
    leaf temperature reference in total absence of stress, while Tleaf indicates the
    leaf surface temperature. Respect to the original equation defined by Jackson,
    the modified one uses the canopy temperature (Tleaf) instead of the differences
    between canopy and air temperature (Tc − Ta), moreover identify Tdry and Twet
    as the upper limit (Tc − Ta)UL and the lower limit (Tc − Ta)LL respectively. Tleaf
    data in absolute temperature (°C) were calculated from thermal camera’s digital
    number (DN) using an empirical line correction. The DN-values in the thermal imagery
    represent at-sensor radiance. Conversion was carried out in field conditions,
    by means of three different colour panels (1 × 1 m) at known temperature as reference.
    Those measurements were achieved at the beginning and the end of each flight and
    replicated three times with a 10 s delay. The reference target temperature was
    calculated taking into account the emissivity coefficient of panel material (0.95).
    The average temperature of the reference targets was 33 °C, 54 °C and 66 °C for
    the white, blue and black respectively during the entire flight acquisitions.
    The temperature range of the three panels (black, blue and white) had a variation
    of 6.6 °C, 3.4 °C and 1.5 °C respectively during the five flights. The averaged
    values derived from 6 measures for each target and for each flight. The reference
    temperature (Tdry and Twet) estimation procedure is a step that requires utmost
    care and precision, as it represents a key factor in the stress map computation.
    CWSI reference measurements were achieved at the end of each flight and replicated
    three times with a 10 s delay. The emissivity coefficient applied to leaf measurements
    was 0.98. The average temperature of the Tdry reference was 36.1 °C and for Twet
    23.6 °C. The temperature range of the Tdry and Twet had a variation of about 1.3
    °C and 2.4 °C respectively during the five flights. Many studies reported different
    methods to measure and calculate these references (Alchanatis et al., 2010, Cohen
    et al., 2005, Grant et al., 2007, Jones et al., 2002, Testi et al., 2008, Yuan
    et al., 2004). In this work, we preferred the approach suggested by Jones et al.
    (2002). In detail, leaves of two sampling vines were coated on both sides with
    petroleum jelly, in order to prevent the leaf transpiration and interrupt the
    transpiration cooling phenomenon, simulating the leaf physiological response to
    water stress conditions. At the same time, the wet reference was obtained wetting
    both sides of other two sampling vines. Temperature monitoring was carried out
    with a handheld thermal sensor FLIR I7, Tdry was measured 30 min after applying
    petroleum jelly, while Twet 20 s after wetting leaves with water. Thermal images
    acquired by UAV were mosaicked using Agisoft Photoscan Professional Edition 1.1.6
    (Agisoft LLC, St. Petersburg, Russia), a commercial computer vision software package.
    This software provides a completely automated computer vision SfM procedure, taking
    a set of images as input and automatically going through the steps of feature
    identification, matching and bundle adjustment. The procedure aligns images captured
    by the thermal camera. A polygon mesh was computed from the dense 3D point, and
    the pixel values of each image were then projected onto the mesh to create an
    orthomosaic. When combined with the GPS positions, this process allows the creation
    of a high-resolution orthophoto and a digital elevation model (DEM) of the research
    site. 2.5. Row extraction and spatial analysis The DEM output from Agisoft software
    allowed developing a filtering procedure of the pure row pixels, since they have
    greater heights from the ground, and can be easily discriminated by global thresholding
    algorithms. The first step was to applicate the Top-Hat morphological operation
    (Gonzalez and Wintz, 2002) directly on the DEM image. Through this technique,
    usually used for non-uniform illumination correction, we made “flat” the terrain
    that may in fact be pending. Then, using a global thresholding method (Otsu et
    al., 1979), two different zones were obtained: rows and ground. The Otsu method
    discriminates the two classes automatically determining a threshold that maximizes
    the interclass variance. The purpose of this procedure is to split the image f
    (x, y) in two parts (row and inter-row), imposing a threshold on the histogram
    image intensity that, in this case, coincides with the height. DEM rows in the
    image have a height, then intensity, almost constant, consistent with each other
    and always more than the ground. Data extraction for single plants was made averaging
    values in 0.8 × 0.3 m polygons along rows (Fig. 3), polygon size being chosen
    to properly identify each plant from the adjacent ones. Download : Download high-res

    of the vineyard after the soil removing procedure. 2.6. Evaluation of the relationship
    between CWSI and plant water status In order to evaluate the instantaneous correspondence
    between water status characterization through standard proxy techniques and thermal
    imagery, the Ψs and gs values measured at the WSP in the flight campaign day were
    compared to their CWSI through regression analysis. At the seasonal scale, the
    evaluation of the appropriateness of thermal images acquired at one date to estimate
    seasonal variability in water status along the field was done through a spatial
    modeling approach. Spatial modeling of leaf water potential along the vineyard
    was done according to the approach proposed by Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010a, Acevedo-Opazo
    et al., 2010b, Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2008. In this approach, one (or more) ancillary
    variable(s), whose spatial distribution is well known, is combined with plant
    water status information at a reference site to elaborate a model that estimates
    plant water status. In our paper, we used the same procedure considered by Herrero-Langreo
    et al. (2013), where more details on the methodology can be found. Following that
    procedure, we considered carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) measured at the 92 SP in
    the previous season as the ancillary variable, and the most stressed WSP as the
    reference site. The model was calibrated and tested using the measurements of
    Ψs at all the WSP, considering the measurements made weekly in 2014 and 2015.
    Seasonal average leaf water potential at each SP could then be estimated from
    the model. Independent models were calculated for Ψs-m and Ψs-n. Following the
    empirical approach proposed by Acevedo-Opazo et al. (2008), the spatial model
    tested in this study, is shown in Eq. (2). (2) Where corresponds to any of the
    92 locations where a δ13C value was measured corresponds to the reference site,
    where was measured throughout 18 dates. corresponds to any of the 18 dates when
    was measured at the reference site, is the estimated at each site, , and date,
    . is the auxiliary variable, , at each site, . is measured at the reference site,
    , for each date . and are the coefficients of the model For each date, tj, the
    model extrapolates Ψ measured at the reference site, Ψ (Sre, tj), to any of the
    locations, si, where a δ13C value was measured. Hence, δ13C (s), accounts for
    the spatial variability of Ψ, while temporal variation is indicated by . The model
    was adapted to the case study following the same procedure considered by Herrero-Langreo
    et al. (2013) where a more extensive explanation on the methodology can be found.
    The comparison between CWSI and average seasonal Ψs-m and Ψs-n values was done
    using two different procedures. First, we interpolated maps for those variables
    onto a 3 × 3 m grid using block kriging performed with VESPER software (Minasny
    and McBratney, 2002), and compared them visually. Kriging is an interpolation
    procedure in which estimates of values at unsampled sites are interpolated on
    the basis of known values at georeferenced locations, weighted according to the
    parameters of the variogram – a model that describes variation within a dataset
    as a function of the distance or lag separating the samples comprising it (Bramley
    et al., 2011b). In our work, all variables were fitted to exponential models,
    taking as kriging parameters maximum distance = 100 m, 30 lags and 50% of lag
    tolerance. The second procedure for comparison was classifying CWSI in 3 and 5
    classes through fuzzy k-means cluster analysis, and then calculating mean Ψs-m
    and Ψs-n values for pixels belonging to each class with P > 0.8. Fuzzy k-means
    analyses and boxplots were obtained using R software. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Within-vineyard variability of agronomic variables The vineyard considered
    showed a relatively wide range of within-vineyard variability concerning vegetative
    growth, yield, berry weight and grape composition (Table 1a). In general terms,
    the range of variability embraced was high for all variables and the coefficients
    of variation were twice those reported in previous studies for the same variety
    in a neighbouring region (Baluja et al., 2012b, Urretavizcaya et al., 2016). That
    variability makes the field suitable for a precision viticulture based management
    (Urretavizcaya et al., 2014), aimed at decreasing variability or at segregating
    grape batches according to their composition. Although within-vineyard average
    values can be considered as adequate for quality wine making – according to regional
    standards for the variety-, the presence of less-ripen or “greener” grapes would
    impact negatively in wine organoleptic quality (Kontoudakis et al., 2011). Table

    Within-field variability in vine water status was also remarkable, δ13C ranging
    from −24.1‰ to −27.9‰ (Table 1a). These values, according to the scale proposed
    in (Santesteban et al., 2015), correspond to conditions ranging from nearly severe
    water stress to weak deficit. This variability in water status probably explains
    the variability in other agronomical variables, since water availability is known
    to be the major factor determining growth, yield and grape composition in semiarid
    areas (Medrano et al., 2014). The range of variability embraced by the WSP grid
    was smaller (Table 1b), but represented well the range of conditions observed
    in the denser SP grid. In fact, in most cases, WSP maximum and minimum values
    were similar to percentiles 5–95 in the SP grid, indicating that, in general terms,
    90% of within-vineyard variability is covered by the WSP grid. 3.2. Evaluation
    of the instantaneous variability in water status through thermal images Thermal
    image processing led to a map of CWSI distribution along the field (Fig. 4). A
    wide range of CWSI values was found (0.28–0.69), confirming the relevance of within-field
    variability observed with agronomic variables, and the pertinence of taking into
    account this variability. When CWSI values obtained from thermal images for the
    WSP were compared to instantaneous measurements in the field, they showed a relatively
    good correspondence with both Ψs and gs (Fig. 5, R2 > 0.65, P < 0.01), presenting
    lower values of Ψs and gs at the WSP with higher CWSI. The coefficients of determination
    are relatively high partly as one of the points monitored was clearly more stressed
    than the remaining ones, so when little variation in within-field water status
    exists correlation can be expected to be lower. Download : Download high-res image

    Stress Index values calculated from UAV-acquired thermal images and (a) stem water
    potential and (b) stomatal conductance measured at the WSP at the same time. The
    results obtained agree with those observed for thermal imaging in vineyards, either
    using a proxy (Fuentes et al., 2012, Grant et al., 2007, Jones et al., 2002, Pou
    et al., 2014) or a remote (Baluja et al., 2012a, Bellvert et al., 2015a, Bellvert
    et al., 2015b, Bellvert et al., 2014) sensing approach. According to the principles
    established in early research regarding temperature sensing as an estimator of
    plant water status, plants having a greater water availability usually show increased
    transpiration, which leads to certain evaporative cooling and, as a consequence,
    to lower leaf temperature (Jackson et al., 1988, Jackson et al., 1981). Therefore,
    from this point of view, our results add further evidence on the suitability of
    this approach, and reinforce the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as
    an instantaneous water-stress mapping tool. 3.3. Evaluation of the seasonal variability
    in water status through thermal images Spatial modeling of stem water potential
    applied following the approach proposed by Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010a, Acevedo-Opazo
    et al., 2010b, Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2008) proved to be successful. The model
    allowed a good estimation of Ψs-m and Ψs-n at the WSP using the most stressed
    WSP as the reference site, and carbon isotope ratio measured the previous season
    (δ13C) in the SP as ancillary information (Fig. 6). Thus, it could then be used
    to estimate Ψs-m and Ψs-n values at the SP, subsequently represented as maps in
    Fig. 7(c, d), which displays how water status varied within the field. Download

    of spatial patterns From the visual comparison of the maps showed in Fig. 7, a
    recurrent spatial pattern, roughly agreeing to the topography of the field, can
    be observed for PCD, δ13C2014 and δ13C2015 datasets, which had been obtained independently.
    This pattern had also clear resemblances to ECa map, where a horizontal strip
    of higher ECa values matched areas of higher PCD and δ13C values. This coherence
    was not detected for the bottom-left part of the map, where ECa showed intermediate
    or even low values, whereas relatively high values of PCD, δ13C2014 and δ13C2015
    were observed. ECa measurements are probably integrating several soil characteristics
    of different relevance for plant performance, which explain those differences
    in behaviour (Brevik et al., 2006). The spatial distribution of Ψs-m and Ψs-n
    also followed the general pattern described above, although differences were attenuated
    at the right-top of the map, and exacerbated at the right-bottom. Last, the distribution
    pattern of classic agronomic variables followed a very different structure, the
    eastern (right) part of the field showing higher values of plant trunk section
    (TCSA), yield and berry weight (BW), and lower berry sugar content (TSS). CWSI
    estimated from thermal imaging followed a pattern that could be interpreted as
    a combination of the two major patterns described above (Fig. 4). On one side,
    a horizontal strip of higher CWSI appeared in the middle of the field, though
    much milder levels of water stress were detected at the lower part of the map.
    On the other side, certain degree of differentiation between the left and the
    right part of the map can also be appreciated. It is interesting to highlight
    that the highest CWSI values were found at the right-top of the map, corresponding
    exactly with the biggest and most productive vines. This behaviour, can be regarded
    as anomalous at first sight, but matches the water dynamics in this vineyard.
    According to the expert knowledge of the technical staff in the owning winery,
    that area has a deep soil, but much more gravely than the rest of the field and,
    as a consequence, lower water holding capacity. According to owners experience,
    that part of the field usually shows a very active growth in spring and early
    summer, and usually a high crop. However, when deficit conditions occur – from
    July on – soil water depletion happens faster, and plants end the season with
    greater water stress than other parts in the field. This behaviour can be explained
    as higher leaf area (Reynolds and Heuvel, 2009) and higher crop load (Miller et
    al., 1997, Naschitz and Naor, 2005) enhance water consumption and, as a consequence,
    can result in decreased water reservoirs from mid-season on. Thus, although at
    some fields information provided by CWSI could be redundant to that provided by
    vegetation indices, such as NDVI or PCD, it was not the case in this vineyard.
    It is common to assume that higher vigour areas will experience milder water stress,
    but under some circumstances such as those described here (deeper soils with lower
    water holding capacity), some parts of the field having greater leaf area (estimated
    through PCD), could experience higher water deficit at the end of the season.
    b. Correspondence between CWSI classes and other variables CWSI pixel values were
    classified in three and five classes using fuzzy k-means. For each class, the
    values of the remaining variables calculated for each pixel were examined through
    boxplots (Fig. 8, Fig. 9). When three classes were defined (Fig. 8), the correspondence
    between CWSI classes and seasonal water status related parameters was very low.
    Only a certain trend to lower δ13C2015 for increasing values of CWSI was observed,
    and no correspondence at all for Ψs-m and Ψs-n. However, there was a much higher
    degree of agreement between CWSI and other variables. PCD was observed to be higher
    at lower CWSI and, specially, very neat correspondence was found between CWSI
    and agronomical variables, higher CWSI plants showing higher values of TCSA, higher
    yields, bigger berries and a decreased sugar content (TSS). When cluster analysis
    was used to define five CWSI classes (Fig. 9), a very similar pattern was found,
    CWSI holding a clearer relationship with yield, berry weight and sugar content
    than water status related variables. Download : Download high-res image (412KB)

    estimated very well what was happening from an agronomic point of view between
    the onset of ripening (occurring at the time of measurement) and harvest. High
    CWSI classes were precisely those that had greater yield and bigger berries (Fig.
    8h, i; Fig. 9h, i), and showed a delayed sugar accumulation (lower TSS, Figs.
    8j and 9j). Variations in crop (sink size) have already been shown to play a major
    role to explain within-vineyard variations in grape composition in semi-arid areas
    (Urretavizcaya et al., 2016), as it constitutes one of the two components of source-to-sink
    balance, critical for grape quality (Howell, 2001). As mentioned above, higher
    yields enhance water consumption (Miller et al., 1997, Naschitz and Naor, 2005),
    and also cause lower sugar contents (Edson et al., 1995, Naor et al., 1997), especially
    under deficit conditions (Santesteban et al., 2011). On the contrary, CWSI measured
    at a single day did not provide a good estimation of variations of plant water
    status. The vineyard considered in the study showed a stable structure of variation
    in seasonal water status, as there was a big resemblance between berry δ13C measured
    in 2014 and 2015 (Fig. 7a, b). This stability agrees with that observed for water
    status in other vineyards when several years were compared (Acevedo-Opazo et al.,
    2010b, Herrero-Langreo et al., 2013, Taylor et al., 2010). The relationship between
    berry δ13C and water status has been widely proved for cv. ‘Tempranillo’ (Santesteban
    et al., 2012), and it is sensible to consider this spatial structure mirrors stem
    water potential pattern, estimated here through modeling. The fact CWSI measured
    in a single – but representative – day did not follow this seasonal pattern cannot
    be regarded to be indicative of a bad performance for this index (or for this
    data acquisition platform). In fact, high CWSI pixels corresponded to high yielding
    parts of the field where sugar accumulation was observed to be limited, possibly
    as during the last weeks before harvest available water was not enough for such
    a leaf area and crop load. Thus, CWSI calculated from high-resolution UAV-based
    thermal imaging has shown a high potentiality for precision vineyard management
    applications, and could be a complementary tool for the implementation of precision
    irrigation systems that, in the near future, would help grape growers to manage
    water resources in a sounder and more sustainable way. 4. Conclusions UAV-based
    thermal imagery has a great potential to map instantaneous variations in water
    status within a vineyard. The information provided by thermal images proved to
    be relevant at a seasonal scale as well, although it did not match seasonal trends
    in water status, but mimicked other physiological processes occurring during ripening.
    Therefore, if a picture of variations in water status is required, it would be
    necessary to acquire thermal images at several dates along the summer. Conflict

    ways in which thermal and spectral remote sensing can be used to monitor the development
    of water deficits in horticultural crops and to schedule irrigation. The first
    part outlines the basic principles involved in the use of remote sensing for monitoring
    plant responses to water deficits. Thermal sensing is shown to be particularly
    sensitive to stomatal closure, while spectral sensing can be used to study both
    the development of leaf area (using standard vegetation indices) and the responses
    of processes such as photosynthesis (using chlorophyll fluorescence and the photochemical
    reflectance index). Such remote sensing methods may be applied both within-field
    and from airborne or even satellite-mounted sensors. The specific opportunities
    and problems of applying this technology to a range of horticultural crops will
    then be addressed and recommendations made, particularly relating to its application
    to irrigation scheduling. The problems involved with scaling up remote sensing
    from the leaf scale to the canopy scale are discussed with particular emphasis
    on the large potential errors involved when inverting a remotely sensed index
    (whether CWSI or any other vegetation index) to estimate a biophysical par¬ameter
    such as leaf area index, stomatal conductance or photosynthesis rate. Article

  key_findings: Thermal and spectral sensing can effectively monitor plant water stress
    by detecting stomatal closure and changes in leaf area and photosynthetic processes.
    Remote sensing technologies can be applied at both the leaf and canopy levels,
    but scaling up to the canopy level introduces potential errors in estimating biophysical
    parameters.
  limitations: The paper focuses on the use of remote sensing technologies in horticultural
    crops, which may limit its generalizability to other crop types. Additionally,
    the paper does not provide specific examples or case studies demonstrating the
    implementation of these technologies in real-time irrigation management systems.
  main_objective: To review the use of thermal and spectral remote sensing for monitoring
    plant water stress and scheduling irrigation in horticultural crops.

    water-status by plant-based sensors Alessio Scalisi [Department of Agricultural,
    Food and Forest Sciences, University of Palermo, Italy] Kushtrim Bresilla [Department
    of Agricultural Sciences, University of Bologna, Italy] Filipa Simões Grilo [Department
    of Agricultural, Food and Forest Sciences, University of Palermo, Italy] Recently,
    climate change has caused shortages of water worldwide, especially in semi-arid
    and arid regions. Several irrigation strategies have been studied with the aim
    of saving water overuse in agriculture. In the past most of the attention was
    directed towards soil water content, but recently the focus has moved to plant
    responses to water deficit. In recent years, crop evapotranspiration (ETc) obtained
    from reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficients (Kc), has become
    common for irrigation scheduling in several crops, but it does not provide precise
    insights on the tree water status. Today an increasing focus is being given to
    plant-based sensors for the continuous monitoring of plant water status to provide
    support to irrigation management strategies with a precision approach. In this
    work several plant-based (leaf, stem and fruit) devices used for plant water status
    sensing and for irrigation scheduling are reviewed. Scientists have managed to
    create and test a variety of small leaf-adapted sensors with the aim of 7collecting
    valuable information on water dynamics. Nondestructive continuous water status
    detection in leaves is difficult due to the intrinsic fragility of these organs.
    Yet, the data collected can provide insights on the actual status of one leaf,
    within a multitude of other leaves which might have a slightly different behavior
    because of factors such as age, sun exposure, canopy position and others. Leaf
    thickness sensors, leaf pressure and leaf thermal probes are discussed in this
    review. Stems and shoots establish the connection between climatic conditions
    and water availability in the soil. Continuous measurements of stem water status
    by non-destructive sensors provide information not only on the variations of soil
    water availability but also on the reserves of plant tissues. The use of stem
    dendrometers, sap flow probes, stem hygrometers and stem microtensiometers for
    continuous determination of plant water status and irrigation management is discussed.
    Moreover, it has been demonstrated that fruit water relations have key implication
    on horticultural production and quality. Measurements of fruit water status and
    fruit growth dynamics under different irrigation strategies might be crucial in
    order to reduce water use, maintain yield and/or improve fruit quality. Advantages
    and disadvantages of different sensors ranging from linear variable displacement
    transducers (LVDTs), strain-gauges, potentiometers and/or optoelectric sensors,
    are discussed. However, a unique methodology for continuous plant water status
    determination in fruit trees has yet to be found. An integrated approach, which
    considers contemporary use of sensors on different plant organs is proposed as
    effective strategy to collect exhaustive information on tree water status. DOI:

    key information necessary for efficient irrigation management schemes. A continuous
    leaf monitoring system based on leaf temperature and relevant microclimatic variables
    that can provide real-time PWS is currently available. Crop water stress index
    (CWSI) or modified crop water stress index (MCWSI) values are usually computed
    with leaf monitor data, which requires a knowledge of well-watered and fully stressed
    conditions. We proposed a methodology to compute CWSI and MCWSI using the leaf
    monitor data, where the well-watered and dry conditions were measured using a
    well-watered vine and simulated dry leaf. The objectives of this research were
    to implement a PWS based site-specific irrigation management scheme in a vineyard
    and to assess PWS of grapes by comparing MCWSI and CWSI with stem water potential
    (SWP). Samples were obtained prior to harvest to determine grape quality and yield
    information. The stressed based treatments received 69% of the amount of water
    compared to the grower treatment. Yield results show no significant differences
    between stressed and grower treatments, while quality results showed a significant
    difference in malic acid content (all other quality attributes were similar),
    suggesting this method of precision irrigation may be a useful tool for irrigation
    scheduling and controlling PWS in grapes, while conserving water and enhancing
    quality of the product. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) Share Facebook

    \ methods to monitor crop physiological responses help growers\nbetter understand\
    \ crop physiology and improve crop productivity. In recent years, developments\n\
    in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and sensor technology have enabled image acquisition\
    \ at\nvery-high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. However, potential\
    \ applications and limitations\nof very-high-resolution (VHR) hyperspectral and\
    \ thermal UAV imaging for characterization of\nplant diurnal physiology remain\
    \ largely unknown, due to issues related to shadow and canopy\nheterogeneity.\
    \ In this study, we propose a canopy zone-weighting (CZW) method to leverage the\n\
    potential of VHR (≤9 cm) hyperspectral and thermal UAV imageries in estimating\
    \ physiological\nindicators, such as stomatal conductance (Gs) and steady-state\
    \ ﬂuorescence (Fs). Diurnal ﬂights and\nconcurrent in-situ measurements were conducted\
    \ during grapevine growing seasons in 2017 and\n2018 in a vineyard in Missouri,\
    \ USA. We used neural net classiﬁer and the Canny edge detection\nmethod to extract\
    \ pure vine canopy from the hyperspectral and thermal images, respectively. Then,\n\
    the vine canopy was segmented into three canopy zones (sunlit, nadir, and shaded)\
    \ using K-means\nclustering based on the canopy shadow fraction and canopy temperature.\
    \ Common reﬂectance-based\nspectral indices, sun-induced chlorophyll ﬂuorescence\
    \ (SIF), and simpliﬁed canopy water stress index\n(siCWSI) were computed as image\
    \ retrievals. Using the coeﬃcient of determination (R2) established\nbetween the\
    \ image retrievals from three canopy zones and the in-situ measurements as a weight\n\
    factor, weighted image retrievals were calculated and their correlation with in-situ\
    \ measurements\nwas explored. The results showed that the most frequent and the\
    \ highest correlations were found for\nGs and Fs, with CZW-based Photochemical\
    \ reﬂectance index (PRI), SIF, and siCWSI (PRICZW, SIFCZW,\nand siCWSICZW), respectively.\
    \ When all ﬂights combined for the given ﬁeld campaign date, PRICZW,\nSIFCZW,\
    \ and siCWSICZW signiﬁcantly improved the relationship with Gs and Fs. The proposed\n\
    approach takes full advantage of VHR hyperspectral and thermal UAV imageries,\
    \ and suggests that\nthe CZW method is simple yet eﬀective in estimating Gs and\
    \ Fs.\nKeywords: remote sensing; PRI; SIF; CWSI; stomatal conductance; fluorescence;\

    Grapevine (Vitis spp.) is one of the most commercially important berry crops in\
    \ the world [1].\nIn grapevines, moderate water deﬁcit is necessary to achieve\
    \ desired berry quality and yield, although\nthe eﬀects of deﬁcit irrigation on\
    \ berry and quality are dependent upon the weather during the\ngrowing season,\
    \ soil type, grapevine variety, and timing of water application [2–5]. Understanding\n\
    the physiological responses of grapevine to mild to moderate water stress is fundamental\
    \ to optimize\ndeﬁcit irrigation timing and amount [5,6]. Additionally, vine physiology\
    \ is sensitive to diurnal cycles\nand vineyard microclimates, with even temporary\
    \ stress having the potential to alter berry chemistry\nand vine growth [7,8].\
    \ Therefore, it is critical to account for physiological changes associated with\n\
    these factors in ﬁeld conditions throughout diurnal cycles rather than focusing\
    \ only on pre-dawn or\nmidday measurements, which are often used [5,6].\nCurrent\
    \ methods for estimating physiological processes include quantiﬁcation of gas\
    \ exchange,\nstomatal conductance, canopy temperature, and stem water potential\
    \ [9]. These approaches are\ntime-consuming, labor-intensive, and destructive\
    \ (leaves need to be detached for stem water potential).\nFurther, they are unsuitable\
    \ for automation, subject to measurement and sampling errors, and the\ninstrumentation\
    \ required can be prohibitive in terms of cost [10,11]. More importantly, the\
    \ data\ncollected with traditional tools represent incomplete spatial and temporal\
    \ characterization of key vine\nphysiological parameters due to the time involved\
    \ in taking the measurements and the capacity of\nthe instruments themselves [12,13].\
    \ Therefore, it is necessary to have eﬃcient monitoring systems\nthat enable accurate\
    \ tracking of key parameters governing vine function at high spatial and temporal\n\
    resolution to obtain a reliable overview of vine physiology.\nHyperspectral and\
    \ thermal sensors installed on ﬁeld robots-, aircraft-, and satellite-based platforms\n\
    are an increasingly common approach used to characterize plant physiology [14–17].\
    \ In hyperspectral\nremote sensing, sensors measure radiative properties of plants\
    \ with hundreds to thousands of\ncontinuous narrow bands in the optical domain\
    \ (0.35–2.5 µm). This abundant spectral information\nincreases the chance of detecting\
    \ subtle physiological changes compared to multispectral data,\nwhich have a small\
    \ number of bands averaged over a wide spectral region and are insensitive to\
    \ narrow\nspectral signatures [18–20]. Photochemical reﬂectance index (PRI) and\
    \ sun-induced ﬂuorescence\n(SIF) retrieved from hyperspectral remote sensing are\
    \ the most widely used indicators in the remote\nassessment of plant photosynthetic\
    \ activity [21–24]. The PRI was formed to track the xanthophyll\ncycle, which\
    \ relates to plant oxidative stress associated with photosynthesis, using changes\
    \ in green\nreﬂectance centered at 531 nm [25]. SIF is a direct proxy of photosynthesis,\
    \ because it detects reemitted\nexcess light energy at 600–800 nm, from photosystems\
    \ I and II, to minimize photosystem damage as a\npart of the plant photo-protective\
    \ mechanism [26–29].\nThermal remote sensing (8–14 µm) is a popular tool but unlike\
    \ the aforementioned indices that\nrely on factors related to photosynthetic activity,\
    \ thermal data is a strong proxy for transpiration activity.\nTherefore, the rationale\
    \ behind the application of thermal remote sensing for plant stress detection\
    \ is\nthe correlation between stress level and plant temperature increase, which\
    \ is triggered by stomatal\nclosure and reduced transpiration [30]. To overcome\
    \ the eﬀects of varying meteorological conditions\non the stress and temperature\
    \ relationship, the canopy water stress index (CWSI) was developed by\nthe normalizing\
    \ canopy (Tc) and air temperate (Ta) diﬀerence with the evaporative demand [31,32].\n\
    When\nsatellite-\nor\naircraft-based\nhyperspectral\nand\nthermal\nobservations\n\
    are\nmade,\nthe above-mentioned remotely sensed indices are aﬀected by many factors,\
    \ including soil/background,\ncanopy architecture, and shadow due to the lack\
    \ of spatial resolution [17,33–36]. This is particularly true\nfor highly heterogeneous\
    \ ﬁelds of perennial woody crops (e.g., orchard and vineyards), where plants are\n\
    planted in rows with cover crops or bare soil between the rows [15,37,38]. Further,\
    \ low revisit frequency,\nhigh cost, and potential cloud occurrence limit the\
    \ suitability of satellite remote sensing in agriculture,\nwhile operational complexity\
    \ presents a major constraint for manned airborne platforms [39–41].\nAlternatively,\
    \ remotely sensed data from ﬁeld-based platforms (poles/towers and manned/unmanned\n\
    vehicles) have the capacity to assess plant health status [42,43]. However, there\
    \ are shortcomings in\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n3 of 30\nthese as well, such\
    \ as that ﬁeld-based remote sensing platforms are not easily transported and often\n\
    oﬀer a limited footprint [44–46].\nWithin the past few years, huge strides have\
    \ been made in unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) and sensor technologies, which\
    \ have enabled image acquisition at high spectral, spatial,\nand temporal resolutions\
    \ over small to medium ﬁelds. Inexpensive and agile UAVs equipped with\nlightweight\
    \ miniaturized sensors oﬀer attractive alternatives for ﬁeld-scale phenotyping\
    \ and precision\nagriculture [44,47,48]. However, UAV-based studies have been\
    \ limited by cost, experienced pilot\nshortages, lack of methods for fast data\
    \ processing, and strict airspace regulations [44]. With the\navailability of\
    \ lower-cost commercial UAV platforms (which are easy to operate) and sensors,\n\
    improved image processing methods, and eﬀective airspace regulations, those limitations\
    \ are becoming\nless relevant [44,49,50]. Indeed, high spatial resolution images\
    \ acquired at low altitudes have a\nfavorable signal-to-noise ratio; further,\
    \ it is possible to eliminate soil and shadow pixels with high\nconﬁdence [51–56].\
    \ Additionally, image information (radiance, reﬂectance, and temperature) extracted\n\
    from pure vegetation pixels is likely to reduce the eﬀects of shadows and background\
    \ soils, thus\nimproving the estimation of crop biochemical, biophysical, and\
    \ physiological parameters [22,35,56–58].\nRecently, questions have arisen regarding\
    \ the eﬀects of background and within canopy\nheterogeneity on SIF (sun-induced\
    \ ﬂuorescence) and CWSI (canopy water stress index) [17,38].\nHernández-Clemente\
    \ et al. [17] demonstrated the eﬀects of background pixels on SIF retrievals in\n\
    monitoring forest health impacted by water stress and Phytophthora infections.\
    \ Camino et al. [38]\nshowed an improved relationship between the SIF and photosynthetic\
    \ rate when SIF retrieved from\nthe sunlit pixels of the almond tree canopy, while\
    \ Gs has the best correlation with CWSI, which was\ncalculated using the coldest\
    \ and purest canopy pixels (under the 25th and the 50th percentile of\nthe canopy\
    \ pixels). Therefore, it is critical to ﬁrst separate non-vegetation pixels (shadows\
    \ and\nbackground soils) and pure vegetation pixels, before establishing the relationship\
    \ between remote\nsensing stress indicators such as SIF and CWSI, and in-situ\
    \ measurements. Importantly, studies\nby Hernández-Clemente et al. [17] and Camino\
    \ et al. [38] highlighted the signiﬁcance of very-high\nspatial (VHR) resolution\
    \ hyperspectral and thermal images for further understanding the eﬀects of\nbackground\
    \ and canopy structure on remote sensing stress indicators. Additionally, there\
    \ is a lack of\nconsensus on determining canopy temperature in vineyards due to\
    \ the unique canopy architecture\nthat can be divided into sunlit, nadir, and\
    \ shaded zones [59]. Reinert et al. [60] and Pou et al. [61]\nfound a high correlation\
    \ between sunlit canopy zone temperature and Gs and stem water potential.\nIn\
    \ contrast, Baluja et al. [62] and Möller et al. [63] showed promising results\
    \ when the nadir canopy\nzone was used to extract canopy temperature. These ﬁndings\
    \ guarantee further understanding of the\neﬀect of canopy structure on the commonly\
    \ used remote sensing indicators to take full advantage of\nthe information contained\
    \ within VHR hyperspectral and thermal images.\nIn this study, we build on previous\
    \ work and further explore applications of VHR hyperspectral and\nthermal images\
    \ in the quantiﬁcation of physiological parameters in plants. The objectives of\
    \ this study\nare (i) to investigate the relationship between information extracted\
    \ from VHR aerial images over three\ndiﬀerent canopy zones (sunlit, nadir, and\
    \ shaded zones) and in-situ physiological indicators, such as\nstomatal conductance\
    \ (Gs) and steady-state ﬂuorescence (Fs), and (ii) to test the canopy zone-weighting\n\
    (CZW) method’s capacity to use aerial data to approximate diurnal physiological\
    \ indicators.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Experimental Site Description and\
    \ Meteorological Measurements\nGround and aerial data were collected during the\
    \ 2017 and 2018 growing seasons in a 0.9 ha\nexperimental vineyard at the University\
    \ of Missouri-Columbia Southwest Research Center in Mount\nVernon, Missouri, USA\
    \ (37◦4′27.17′′ N, 93◦52′46.70′′ W). The climate of the region is continental\
    \ with\nan average annual temperature of 15.6 ◦C and a mean annual rainfall of\
    \ 1067 mm. The experimental\nvineyard consists of ungrafted ‘Chambourcin’ vines\
    \ and ‘Chambourcin’ scions grafted to one of\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n4 of\
    \ 30\nthe following rootstocks: Selection Oppenheim 4 (SO4), 1103 Paulsen (1103P),\
    \ and 3309 Couderc\n(3309C). In total, the vineyard includes four scion/rootstock\
    \ combinations: ‘Chambourcin ungrafted’,\n‘Chambourcin/SO4’, ‘Chambourcin/1103P’,\
    \ and ‘Chambourcin/3309C’. The ungrafted and grafted vines\nare planted in rows\
    \ with 3 m row and 3 m vine spacing along the row (Figure 1a). The vineyard has\n\
    an east–west row orientation. Vines were planted in 2009 and were eight years\
    \ old at the beginning\nof sampling in this study. ‘Chambourcin’ vines were trained\
    \ with a high wire cordon trellis and\nspur-pruned. The soil on the vineyard is\
    \ a combination of sandy loam, silt loam, and loam, with an\naverage pH of 6.\
    \ Additional details of the study site are available in Maimaitiyiming et al.\
    \ [64] and\nMaimaitiyiming et al. [65].\nThe ‘Chambourcin’ experimental vineyard\
    \ consists of nine rows, each of which is treated with one\nof three diﬀerent\
    \ irrigation treatments, replacing 0%, 50%, and 100% of evapotranspiration (ET)\
    \ losses.\nEach irrigation treatment is replicated three times (in three of the\
    \ nine rows) and ET is obtained from a\nweather station installed at 270 m from\
    \ the site. Each vineyard row includes 32 vines planted in cells\nof four adjacent\
    \ vines of the same type (‘Chambourcin’ ungrafted or grafted to the same rootstocks).\n\
    Within each four-vine cell, the two central vines were monitored through ground\
    \ measurements.\nMeasurements of hourly air temperature (◦C), relative humidity\
    \ (%), solar radiation (Watts/m2),\nand wind speed (m/s) were obtained from the\
    \ weather station. Vapor pressure deﬁcit (VPD, hPa),\nwhich represents water demand\
    \ of the atmosphere better than relative humidity [66], was calculated\nfrom air\
    \ temperature and relative humidity using the equations of Struthers et al. [67].\n\
    Figure 1. Central irrigation treatment rows and grapevines with diﬀerent rootstocks\
    \ (a). Figure (b)\nwas obtained with a Headwall Nano hyperspectral camera (red:\
    \ 659.27 nm, green: 549.27 nm,\nand blue: 479.69 nm, true-color image). Figure\
    \ (c) was obtained with an ICI (Infrared Cameras Inc.)\nthermal camera.\n2.2.\
    \ Diurnal Physiological Measurements\nStomatal conductance (Gs) and steady-state\
    \ chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (Fs) were employed as\nimportant indicators of plant\
    \ physiology because stomatal closure is one of the ﬁrst responses to water\n\
    deﬁcit occurring in the leaves, and both Gs and Fs are closely correlated with\
    \ net photosynthesis\nin grapevines and other species [9,68–71]. Measurements\
    \ of Gs and Fs were taken at veraison (the\nstage at which the berries begin shifting\
    \ from green to dark red, usually late July/early August)\nin 2018, and preharvest\
    \ in 2017 and 2018 under full sun conditions, coinciding with diurnal aerial\n\
    campaigns (15 September 2017, 1 August and 19 September 2018) (Figure 1).\nTable\
    \ 1 presents\ndetails on the ﬁeld and aerial data acquisition campaigns in the\
    \ two growing seasons. In 2017,\nGs and Fs were measured on 2–3 sunlit, youngest\
    \ fully-matured leaves (one leaf per shoot) from\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n\
    5 of 30\nmain exterior shoots per vine using a porometer (SC-1, Decagon, Pullman,\
    \ Washington, USA) and\nﬂuorometer (FluorPen FP 110, Photon Systems Instruments,\
    \ Drásov, Czech Republic), respectively.\nThe porometer has a manufacturer-claimed\
    \ measurement range of 0 to 1000 mmol H2O m−2 s−1 with\nan accuracy of 10% [72].\
    \ The physiological measurements were taken from the leaves located on\nthe upper\
    \ third and sunny (south-facing) side of the canopy to represent a whole vine\
    \ physiology,\nfollowing previous similar studies [17,38,59]. In 2018, leaf gas\
    \ exchange (Gs, photosynthetic CO2\nassimilation rate, etc.) and Fs measurements\
    \ were performed on a single leaf (the same standard from\nthe previous year was\
    \ applied for leaf selection) per vine using a portable LI-6400XT infrared gas\n\
    analyzer equipped with a pulse amplitude modulated leaf ﬂuorometer chamber (Li-Cor\
    \ Biosciences Inc.,\nLincoln, NE, USA). The leaves were measured at a controlled\
    \ CO2 concentration of 400 µmol mol−1,\nat a photosynthetic photon ﬂux density\
    \ of 1000 µmol photons m−2 s−1, and ambient conditions\nof air temperature and\
    \ relative humidity. Eighteen vines (four scion/rootstock combinations plus\n\
    ‘Chambourcin ungrafted’ and ‘Chambourcin/SO4’ combinations for each irrigation\
    \ treatment) in\n2017 and twelve vines (four scion/rootstock combinations for\
    \ each irrigation treatment) in 2018 were\nmonitored for physiology at the time\
    \ of each diurnal ﬂight, representing both irrigation and rootstock\ntreatments.\
    \ This experimental design was expected to cause a wider range of vine physiological\n\
    variations and aﬀorded the ideal site for high variability in a relatively small\
    \ area. Additionally, due to\nthe time per measurement needed, it would have been\
    \ unfeasible to representatively sample each\nsubgroup to correlate with diurnal\
    \ hyperspectral data.\nTable 1.\nSummary of ﬁeld campaign dates, platforms, sensors,\

    \ and Pre-Processing\nThe diurnal aerial campaigns were carried out in 2017 and\
    \ 2018 using thermal and hyperspectral\ncameras onboard UAVs (Figure 2). Ideally,\
    \ ground and aerial data collection should be carried out\nwith the same instruments\
    \ and cameras. In our case, this ideal scenario was not attainable due to\nlimited\
    \ resources and ﬁeld crew availability. However, this also aﬀorded us the opportunity\
    \ to validate\ncertain ﬁndings across multiple systems.\nOn 15 September 2017,\
    \ a DJI S1000+ octocopter, rotary-wing platform (DJI Technology Co., Ltd.,\nShenzhen,\
    \ China) was employed to carry an ICI (Infrared Cameras Inc.) 8640 P-Series thermal\
    \ camera\n(Beaumont, Texas, USA) (Figure 2a,b). The aerial platform was equipped\
    \ with a Pixhawk autopilot\nsystem, which enables autonomous ﬂights based on user-deﬁned\
    \ waypoints. The ICI thermal camera\nwas mounted on a custom-designed two-axis\
    \ gimble. During the aerial campaigns, the UAV was ﬂown\nat 30 m altitude above\
    \ the ground with a ﬁxed speed of 5 m/s. The ICI thermal camera has a resolution\n\
    of 640 × 512 pixels in a spectral range of 7–14 µm with a 13 mm focal length,\
    \ providing a ground\nsampling distance (GSD) of 4 cm at 30 m ﬂight height. To\
    \ successfully construct thermal orthomosaics,\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n\
    6 of 30\nthe ﬂight missions were planned to have 90% forward and 80% side overlap\
    \ of the thermal images,\nand the ICI camera was conﬁgured to capture a 14-bit\
    \ radiometric JPEG image every second during\nthe ﬂight.\nOn 1 August 2018, aerial\
    \ hyperspectral and thermal images were acquired using a visible and\nnear-infrared\
    \ (VNIR, 400–1000 nm) push-broom hyperspectral camera (Nano-Hyperspec VNIR model,\n\
    Headwall Photonics, Fitchburg, MA, USA) installed in tandem with a FLIR (Forward-looking\
    \ infrared)\nthermal camera (FLIR Vue Pro R 640, FLIR Systems, Inc., Wilsonville,\
    \ OR, USA) onboard a DJI\nhexacopter (Matrice 600 Pro, DJI Technology Co., Ltd.,\
    \ Shenzhen, China) (Figure 2c,d). The Matrice\n600 Pro is equipped with a DJI\
    \ 3A Pro Flight Controller, real-time kinematic (RTK), and a Global\nNavigation\
    \ Satellite System (GNSS) for positioning, which can provide ±0.5 m vertical and\
    \ ±1.5 m\nhorizontal accuracy. The cameras and an Applanix APX-15 global positioning\
    \ system (GPS)/inertial\nmeasuring unit (IUM) (Applanix, Richmond Hill, ON, Canada)\
    \ were ﬁxed on a DJI JI Ronin-MX\n3-axis gimbal, which directly connected to the\
    \ aerial platform. The ﬂight missions were carried out\nat an altitude of 80 m\
    \ above the ground with 2 m/s forward velocity, which produced the GSDs\n(ground\
    \ sampling distances) of 5 and 9 cm for the hyperspectral and thermal image, respectively.\n\
    The hyperspectral camera records 640 spatial pixels and 270 spectral bands in\
    \ the VNIR range at\n2.2 nm/pixel with a radiometric resolution of 12 bits. The\
    \ full width at half maximum of the camera is\n6 nm with an entrance slit width\
    \ of 20 µm. The hyperspectral images were acquired 40 frames per\nsecond at 2.5\
    \ ms integration time using a 12 mm focal length lens, yielding 25◦ of the ﬁeld\
    \ of view\nat nadir. The FLIR thermal camera has an image array of 640 × 512 pixels\
    \ with a 13 mm focal length,\nproviding 45◦ ﬁeld of view (FOV). It can acquire\
    \ longwave radiation in the 7.5–13.5 µm range at 14 bits,\nthe thermals were recorded\
    \ in a 14-bit JPEG format every second during the ﬂights. The ﬂight missions\n\
    were planned for the hyperspectral camera with a 40% side overlap, which ensured\
    \ the FLIR thermal\nimages had at least 80% forward and side overlap because of\
    \ the wide thermal camera FOV.\nOn 19 September 2018, thermal images were acquired\
    \ using the ICI thermal camera. The ﬂight\nmissions and the ICI thermal camera\
    \ settings were consistent with the 2017 aerial campaigns.\nFigure 2. UAV systems\
    \ and interrelated sensors. DJI S1000+ UAV system (a) with ICI thermal\ncamera\
    \ (b), DJI-Matrice 600 Pro UAV system, (c) with Headwall Nano Hyperspectral and\
    \ FLIR thermal\ncameras (d).\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n7 of 30\nBoth thermal\
    \ cameras used in this study are radiometrically calibrated sensors, which are\
    \ composed\nof uncooled microbolometers. Even with the radiometric calibrations\
    \ provided by manufacturers,\nthe performance of thermal cameras may be aﬀected\
    \ by atmospheric conditions, target emissivity,\nand distance. To improve the\
    \ accuracy of derived surface temperature, these factors were accounted\nfor by\
    \ background temperature, ambient humidity, barometric pressure, target emissivity,\
    \ and distance\nas calibration parameters and using algorithms in associated software\
    \ tools. For the ICI camera,\nthe raw thermal images were converted to surface\
    \ temperature (◦C) in 32-bit TIFF format by a\nproprietary equation within IR\
    \ (Infrafred) Flash version 2.18.9.17 software (ICI, Beaumont, TX, USA),\nwhich\
    \ allows adjusting atmospheric conditions and target properties. Similarly, before\
    \ FLIR imaging,\nthe temperature calibration parameters were entered to the FLIR\
    \ UAS version 2.0.16 app, which can\ncontrol the camera settings through Bluetooth\
    \ connection from a mobile device. The calibrated thermal\nimages were mosaiced\
    \ using Pix4DMapper version 4.3.31 software (Pix4D SA, Lausanne, Switzerland)\n\
    and georeferenced using the GCPs. Before each ﬂight, the thermal cameras were\
    \ turned on for at least\n30 min for stabilization and the local atmospheric parameters\
    \ were acquired from the on-site weather\nstation. Additionally, a calibrated\
    \ black body Model 1000 (Everest Interscience Inc., USA) and surface\ntemperature\
    \ of diﬀerent objects measured with a thermal spot imager FLIR TG167 (FLIR Systems,\
    \ USA,\n±1.5 ◦C accuracy) were used for the assessment of the thermal products.\
    \ For further details please see\nSagan et al. [73] and Maimaitijiang et al. [74].\n\
    The hyperspectral image preprocessing included radiometric correction, orthorectiﬁcation,\n\
    and atmospheric correction. In the radiometric correction step, digital numbers\
    \ of the raw 12-bit\nhyperspectral images were converted to calibrated radiometric\
    \ values using the SpectralView version\n5.5.1 software (Headwall Photonics, Fitchburg,\
    \ MA, USA). In the same software, the calibrated\nradiance images were orthorectiﬁed\
    \ using the Applanix IMU unit data as input. Further, the radiance\nwas converted\
    \ to reﬂectance in ENVI (Environment for Visualizing Images) version 5.5 software\n\
    (Harris Geospatial Solutions Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) by the empirical line correction\
    \ (ELC)\nmethod [75]. During the overpass of the aerial platform, a portable ﬁeld\
    \ spectroradiometer PSR-3500\n(Spectral Evolution Inc., Lawrence, MA, USA) was\
    \ available to provide reﬂectance spectra of an\naerial calibration tarp with\
    \ three levels of known reﬂectance levels (56%, 32%, and 11%), grapevines,\ngrass,\
    \ and soil, which were used as a spectral reference in the ELC method. The spectroradiometer\n\
    records upwelling radiant energy in a range 350–2500 nm with a spectral resolution\
    \ of 3.5 nm in\nthe 350–1000 nm range, 10 nm in the 1000–1900 nm range, and 7\
    \ nm in the 1900–2500 nm spectral\nrange. The targets were measured 3–5 times\
    \ at nadir from 30 cm distance, and a 99% Spectralon\ncalibration panel (Labsphere,\
    \ Inc., North Sutton, NH, USA) was used to convert the target radiance to\nreﬂectance.\
    \ The averaged target reﬂectance spectra were resampled to match the spectral\
    \ resolution\nof the Headwall spectral camera. The radiance of the aerial images\
    \ was extracted from a 25-pixel\n(5 by 5 pixels) region at the center of each\
    \ target. Finally, the relationship between the reference spectra\nand the image\
    \ radiance was established using the ELC method.\n2.4. Extraction of Grapevine\
    \ Canopy Row\nTo avoid the eﬀects of shadow and soil components and due to spatial\
    \ resolution discrepancy\nbetween thermal and hyperspectral images, extraction\
    \ of grapevine rows is accomplished diﬀerently\nfor thermal and hyperspectral\
    \ images. Over each monitored target grapevine, a 1 m wide region of\ninterest\
    \ (width of the region was determined by canopy size) was deﬁned and pixel values\
    \ within this\nregion were extracted for further analysis.\n2.4.1. Canopy Row\
    \ Extraction From Hyperspectral Images\nNeural net classiﬁers were trained to\
    \ extract pure grapevines row pixels from high-resolution\nhyperspectral images.\
    \ We chose to use a neural net classiﬁer due to the recent success of neural\n\
    networks in hyperspectral image classiﬁcation [76–80]. The neural net classiﬁers\
    \ were implemented\nusing ENVI version 5.5 software (Harris Geospatial Solutions\
    \ Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) by providing\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n8 of 30\n\
    regions of interest for ﬁve diﬀerent classes, including grapevine, grass, vine\
    \ canopy, shadow, and soil\n(Figure 3a). More than 6000 pixels were selected for\
    \ these classes, accounting for target and illumination\nvariability. The best\
    \ performance of neural net classiﬁers was found using 2 hidden layers and logistic\n\
    activation function with 500 training iterations. For other necessary parameters,\
    \ default values were\nused and the parameters included training threshold contribution,\
    \ training rate, training momentum,\nand training root mean square exit criteria.\
    \ The trained neural net classiﬁers showed an overall\naccuracy better than 99.33%\
    \ and a Kappa coeﬃcient of 0.991. Figure 3b shows the results of the\ndelineated\
    \ grapevine canopy boundary.\nFigure 3. Hyperspectral reﬂectance spectra of grapevine,\
    \ grass, grapevine canopy shadow, and soil (a).\nThe results of grapevine canopy\
    \ row delineation (white outlines, b).\n2.4.2. Canopy Row Extraction from Thermal\
    \ Images\nPure grapevine canopy pixels required for thermal image retrieval were\
    \ extracted using the Canny\nedge detection method [81]. Canny edge detection\
    \ is a multi-step algorithm that was designed to detect\nmagnitude and orientation\
    \ of image intensity changes. This method has been proven to be eﬀective\nin extracting\
    \ pure canopy pixels from high-resolution thermal images [82,83]. Canny edge detection\n\
    was implemented using the Open-source Computer Vision library (version 4.0.0)\
    \ with Python 2.7.\nThe detected vine canopy edges were diluted by up to ﬁve pixels\
    \ along the direction of the thermal\ngradient for more conservative extraction\
    \ of the vine pixels. Finally, the vine canopy edges were\nconverted into polyline\
    \ vector and the thermal orthomosaics were clipped using the vine edge polyline\n\
    vector (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. The thermal images showing the extraction of pure\
    \ grapevine pixels to estimate canopy\ntemperature (red polygons). (a) Example\
    \ of thermal orthomosaic acquired with ICI camera. (b) Example\nof thermal acquired\
    \ obtained with FLIR camera.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n9 of 30\n2.5. Estimation\
    \ of Pixelwise Canopy Shadow Fraction\nShadowing estimates of grapevine canopy\
    \ were produced using the Sequential Maximum Angle\nConvex Cone (SMACC) method\
    \ [84]. The SMACC was developed to generate spectral endmembers\nand endmember\
    \ abundance with less expert knowledge and time [85]. The SMACC can also calculate\n\
    shadow fractions of the abundances of reﬂectance when the sum of the fractions\
    \ of each endmember\nfor a pixel is constrained to one or less. Shadow fraction\
    \ of each grapevine canopy pixels within the\nhyperspectral images was estimated\
    \ using the SMACC tool in ENVI software. Figure 5a and b show\nhyperspectral reﬂectance\

    \ canopies from hyperspectral and thermal images were segmented into three\ncanopy\
    \ regions, corresponding to sunlit (slt), nadir (ndr), and shaded (shd) zones\
    \ using K-means\nclustering, a machine learning-based unsupervised clustering\
    \ algorithm [86] (Figures 6 and 7). K-mean\nclustering is an iterative algorithm\
    \ that tries to ﬁnd homogenous and non-overlapping clusters within\ndata. The\
    \ algorithm uses Euclidean distance as a similarity measure to minimize within-cluster\n\
    variation while also keeping the clusters as diﬀerent as possible. We employed\
    \ K-mean clustering for\nvine canopy segmentation, where we grouped canopy pixels\
    \ with similar shadow fraction (in the case\nof hyperspectral images) or canopy\
    \ temperature (in the case of thermal images), depending on the\ntype of the input\
    \ image. The K-means clustering was implemented to divide vine canopies into three\n\
    regions (K = 3) with maximum iterations of 100 in ENVI software.\nFigure 6. Subsets\

    \ from Aerial Image\n2.7.1. Hyperspectral Indices and SIF Retrieval\nCommonly\
    \ used hyperspectral reﬂectance indices closely related to plant physiology, pigment\n\
    concentration, structure, and water content were calculated from the hyperspectral\
    \ images to assess\ntheir ability to track diurnal physiological changes. Table\
    \ 2 summarizes speciﬁc spectral indices grouped\nby their categories associated\
    \ with (1) xanthophyll, (2) chlorophyll, (3) structure, (4) water content,\nand\
    \ (5) chlorophyll ﬂuorescence. Sun-induced chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (SIF) emission\
    \ was quantiﬁed\nfrom hyperspectral radiance images using the Fraunhofer Line\
    \ Depth (FLD) principle [87]. The FLD is\na radiance-based in-ﬁlling method, which\
    \ takes advantage of both the narrow absorption feature of\nO2-A absorption and\
    \ high spectral resolution [28]. Furthermore, the FLD method has shown reliable\n\
    SIF retrieval performance using hyperspectral cameras with relatively broad spectral\
    \ bandwidths\n(ranging between 5 and 7 nm FWHM), spectral sampling (lower than\
    \ 2.5 nm), and signal-to-noise\nratios of 300:1 or higher [22,88,89]. The FLD\
    \ was calculated from a total of three bands (FLD3) in and\nout O2–A feature,\
    \ using Equation (1) which is described in Reference [22,36].\nSIF = (Eout × Lin\
    \ − Ein × Lout)/(Eout − Ein)\n(1)\nwhere Eout is an average value of incident\
    \ solar irradiance at 750 and 780 nm, Lout is an average value\nof target radiance\
    \ at 750 nm and 780 nm, and Ein and Lin are incident solar irradiance and target\n\
    radiance at 760 nm, respectively. The incident solar irradiance was measured at\
    \ the time ﬂight using\nthe PSR spectroradiometer attached with a cosine corrector-diﬀuser\
    \ (180◦) for the entire spectral region\n(350–2500 nm).\nTable 2. Hyperspectral\

    \ of 30\n2.7.2. Simpliﬁed Canopy Water Stress Index (siCWSI)\nThe CWSI was proposed\
    \ by Jones [94] as:\nCWSI = (Tcanopy − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet\n(2)\nwhere Tcanopy\
    \ is average canopy temperature extracted from pure vine pixels, Twet is the temperature\n\
    of fully transpiring leaves, and Tdry is temperature of non-transpiring leaves.\
    \ Determination of\nTwet and Tdry for conventional CWSI calculation is always\
    \ climate-dependent, complex, and\ntime-consuming [95–97]. Conversely, histogram\
    \ analysis-based CWSI uses thermal images as a\nmajor input and it has reduced\
    \ the meteorological data dependency and ﬁeld measurements [82,83].\nWhen Twet\
    \ and Tdry were obtained using a canopy temperature histogram which follows Gaussian\n\
    distribution [98], it is necessary to remove mixed pixels that partially cover\
    \ canopy and background,\nincluding soil, shadow, and weed [82,83]. In particular,\
    \ simpliﬁed CWSI (siCWSI) developed by\nBian et al. [82] was used in this study\
    \ as this method outperformed other forms of CWSI in terms of\nmonitoring plant\
    \ water status from UAV-based high-resolution thermal images. To obtain siCWSI\n\
    parameters, Twet and Tdry were determined by the mean of the lowest 0.5% and the\
    \ highest 0.5% of\ncanopy temperatures, respectively. More details about the calculation\
    \ of siCWSI can be found in\nBian et al. [82].\n2.8. Proposed Canopy Zone-Weighting\
    \ (CZW) Method\nDiﬀerent canopy zones are expected to bring complementary information\
    \ on the targeted vine\nphysiology measurements by mitigating eﬀects caused by\
    \ illumination, viewing angle, and canopy\nstructure. Considering certain canopy\
    \ zones show higher coeﬃcients of determination (R2) than others\nin vine physiology\
    \ estimation [59,61], a weighting strategy to diﬀerent canopy zone can be detrimental\n\
    for estimating of vine physiology. Inspired by our previous work on fusing various\
    \ water quality\nvariables and spectral reﬂectance through weighted prior decision-level\
    \ fusion scheme [99], we herein\nproposed a new zone-weighting method, namely\
    \ canopy zone-weighting (CZW), to systemically\nintegrate canopy zone contribution,\
    \ in which R2 of each canopy zone was used to determine the\ncontributing weight,\
    \ denoted as ωi in Equation (3). The integration of multiple regression model\n\
    outputs may explain a wide range of variations in a target variable compared to\
    \ a single regression\nmodel [100]. The proposed CZW method is expected to leverage\
    \ the strengths and limit the potential\nbiases of using a single zone-based estimation.\n\
    A summary of the implementation steps of the CZW method is described as follows:\
    \ (1) Establish\nrelationships between aerial images’ retrievals (hyperspectral\
    \ indices and siCWSI) extracted from three\ncanopy zones (slt, ndr, and shd) and\
    \ grapevine physiological parameters (Gs and Fs), (2) determine the\ncontributing\
    \ weight (ω) and contribution weight ratio (c) of the canopy zones to the target\
    \ grapevine\nphysiological indicator using the best relationships obtained in\
    \ the previous step, and (3) calculate\ncanopy zone-weighted image retrieval (ξczw)\
    \ from three canopy zones using the corresponding c.\nRelationships between the\
    \ aerial image retrievals and grapevine physiological parameters were\nestablished\
    \ in the form of the coeﬃcient of determination (R2) using ﬁve diﬀerent linear\
    \ and non-linear\nregression models (e.g., second-degree polynomial, logarithmic,\
    \ exponential, and power) [24], and the\nbest R2 values of the canopy zones were\
    \ used to calculate the ω of each zone through Equation (3):\nωi =\n1\nlogR2\n\
    i\nP3\ni = 1 logR2\ni\n(3)\nwhere ωi is the contributing weight of ith canopy\
    \ zone, and R2\ni is the coeﬃcient of determination that\nindicates the strength\
    \ of the relationship between the ith canopy zone retrieval and the grapevine\n\
    physiological parameters.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n12 of 30\nc of the three\
    \ canopy zones to the grapevine physiological parameters were calculated by:\n\
    ci =\nωi\nP3\ni = 1 ωi\n(4)\nwhere ci is the contribution weight ratio of the\
    \ ith canopy zone.\nBased on the obtained c and the original image retrievals,\
    \ ξczw can be formulated by:\nξCZW = cslt × ξslt + cndr × ξndr + cshd × ξshd\n\
    (5)\nwhere cslt is the contribution weight ratio of the sunlit canopy zone, cndr\
    \ is the contribution weight\nratio of the nadir canopy zone, and cshd is the\
    \ contribution weight ratio of the shaded canopy zone.\nξstl is the original image\
    \ retrieval of the sunlit canopy zone, ξndr is the original image retrieval of\
    \ the\nnadir canopy zone, and ξshd is the original image retrieval of the shaded\
    \ canopy zone.\nThe aerial image retrievals derived from three canopy zones (slt,\
    \ ndr, and shd), the combination\nof any two canopy zones (slt + ndr, slt + shd,\
    \ and ndr + shd), the average value of entire canopy\n(avg), and the ξCZW (CZW)\
    \ were compared against Gs and Fs across all measurement time points\nand dates.\
    \ To explore the performance of the image retrievals on the entire diurnal dataset,\
    \ separate\nanalyses were carried out for all ﬂights together on a given ﬁeld\
    \ campaign date. Full relationships\nand their signiﬁcance obtained with the linear\
    \ and non-linear regression models were included as\nSupplementary Materials Tables\

    \ we report on several aspects of the experiments. First, we describe the\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions of the vineyard and vine physiological indicators. Next, correlations\
    \ of\nimage retrievals (calculated from slt, ndr, shd, slt + ndr, slt + shd, ndr\
    \ + shd, and avg canopy zone\npixels and CZW method) with physiological indicators\
    \ were analyzed to assess the eﬀectiveness of our\nproposed approach. Finally,\
    \ we show the diurnal changes in representative image retrievals within the\n\
    vine canopy and their ability to track diurnal variations of vine physiological\
    \ indicators.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n14 of 30\n3.1. Environmental Conditions\
    \ and Diurnal Physiological Indicators of Grapevine\nThere was no major diﬀerence\
    \ in the trends of environmental conditions for the three measurement\ndates (Figure\
    \ 9). Air temperature and VPD increased gradually until 16:00 p.m., and then decreased\n\
    sharply. Solar radiation followed a similar pattern as air temperature and VPD,\
    \ but solar radiation\nrapidly rose only until midday. Relative humidity was at\
    \ high levels in the morning, followed by a\ndecreasing trend, and then began\
    \ to increase from 16:00 p.m.. However, environmental conditions\non 19 September\
    \ 2018 were characterized by higher air temperature and lower relative humidity\n\
    throughout the day compared to the previous two measurement dates, resulting in\
    \ higher VPD values,\nthus more water-demanding atmosphere. All three measurement\
    \ dates were calm, with wind speed of\n3 m/s or lower, suitable for UAV data collection.\n\
    Figure 9. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, vaper pressure\
    \ deﬁcit (VPD), as well as\nwind speed for 15 September 2017, 1 August 2018, and\
    \ 19 September 2018.\nThe diurnal variations of grapevine physiological indicators\
    \ on all measurement dates had a\nsimilar trend. The Gs values were low in the\
    \ morning, increased sharply, and reached a maximum\naround midday (Figure 10a,c).\
    \ Afterwards, Gs decreased until the afternoon. The trend was caused,\nmost likely,\
    \ by environmental conditions. In general, the diurnal change of Fs followed the\
    \ same\npattern of Gs (Figure 10b,d). On most of the measurement dates, maximum\
    \ Fs values occurred\naround noon, while lower Fs values occurred in the morning\
    \ and afternoon. There were no signiﬁcant\ndiﬀerences in in-situ physiological\
    \ measurements at each ﬂight time among the irrigation and rootstock\ntreatments.\
    \ Daily Gs and Fs showed a relatively high coeﬃcient of variation (CV). Gs had\
    \ larger\ndaily variability compared to Fs for all the measurement dates. Both\
    \ Gs and Fs on 15 September 2017,\nhad 1–2 times higher values than the values\
    \ on 1 August 2018, and this could be due to the diﬀerent\ninstruments used to\
    \ determine the physiological indicators. Additionally, when the same instruments\n\
    were used, lower Gs and Fs values were observed on 19 September 2018 than the\
    \ corresponding values\non 15 September 2017. This agreed with higher VPD occurring\
    \ on 19 September 2018.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n15 of 30\nFigure 10.\nDiurnal\

    \ daily coeﬃcient of variations.\n3.2. Relationship between the Aerial Image Retrievals\
    \ and Grapevine Physiology\nOn 15 September 2017, the strongest correlation was\
    \ established with the midday and afternoon\nmeasurements of Gs for siCSWIczw\
    \ (R2 = 0.61, p < 0.01 and R2 = 0.60, p < 0.01 respectively), followed\nby siCWSIavg\
    \ in the midmorning (R2 = 0.30, p < 0.05) (Figure 11a). siCSWIczw provided the\
    \ strongest\nrelationship to Fs in the midmorning and midday (R2 = 0.82, p < 0.001\
    \ and R2 = 0.83, p < 0.001,\nrespectively), followed by siCWSIndr in the afternoon\
    \ (R2 = 0.52, p < 0.01) (Figure 11b). Comparing\nthe correlations from pooled\
    \ three ﬂights, both Gs and Fs were strongly correlated with siCWSIczw\n(R2 =\
    \ 0.71, p < 0.01 and R2 = 0.73, p < 0.01), followed by siCWSIavg with Gs and siCWSIslt+ndr\
    \ with\nFs, respectively.\nOn 1 August 2018, PRI, SIF, and siCWSI captured diurnal\
    \ changes in Gs and Fs as a function\nof grapevine physiological response. There\
    \ were no noticeable canopy structural eﬀects, pigments\ndegradation, and canopy\
    \ water content change between irrigation treatments during the hyperspectral\n\
    imaging campaign. This resulted in weak correlations (R2 ≤ 0.30) between RE, NDVI,\
    \ SR, and WI and\ngrapevine physiological parameters (Gs and Fs). Similar results\
    \ were observed for both separate ﬂights\nand when all ﬂights were combined. Therefore,\
    \ the results and discussion sections were focused on\nthe results of PRI and\
    \ SIF for hyperspectral data analysis.\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n16 of 30\n\
    Figure 11. Circular bar plots show the relationships (R2) established between\
    \ siCWSI from diﬀerent\ncanopy zones and stomatal conductance (Gs, (a)) and steady-state\
    \ ﬂuorescence (Fs, (b)) for the three\nthermal ﬂights on 15 September 2017 and\
    \ all three ﬂights combined. slt is for sunlit canopy zone, ndr is\nfor nadir\
    \ canopy zone, shd is for shaded canopy zone, avg is for average value of entire\
    \ canopy zone,\nand CZW is for canopy zone-weighting method.\nPRI more strongly\
    \ correlated with Gs during afternoon hours (2:00 p.m. and 3:45 p.m.) than\nearlier\
    \ hours (11:00 a.m. and 12:45 p.m.), while SIF showed a strong correlation with\
    \ Gs for all four\nﬂights (Figure 12a,b). When three canopy zones were considered\
    \ separately, PRIslt and PRIndr seemed\nto be correlated well with Gs. For SIF,\
    \ there was no single canopy zone that showed a consistently\nstrong relationship\
    \ with Gs (R2 ≤ 0.60). In most cases, PRI and SIF derived from two combined canopy\n\
    zones had a slightly higher correlation with Gs than that of a single canopy zone.\
    \ Meanwhile, slightly\nlower relationships were found by comparing PRIavg, and\
    \ SIFavg and Gs, except for the PRIavg in\nthe afternoon, where PRIavg showed\
    \ the highest correlation (R2 = 0.96, p < 0.001) compared to any\nPRI from single\
    \ canopy zone or combination of two. Generally, PRIczw and SIFczw improved the\n\
    relationship with Gs. In particular, PRIczw showed the strongest correlation in\
    \ the midmorning and\nafternoon (R2 = 0.35, p < 0.01 and R2 = 0.98 p < 0.001).\
    \ On the other hand, SIFczw appeared to have the\nclosest relationship with Gs\
    \ in the midmorning (R2 = 0.45, p < 0.05). When all ﬂights were analyzed\ntogether,\
    \ the relationships between PRIczw and SIFczw were stronger than the relationship\
    \ with PRI\nand SIF derived from any single, combined, and average canopy zone\
    \ pixels (R2 = 0.70, p < 0.01 and\nR2 = 0.89, p < 0.001).\nRegarding Fs, the obtained\
    \ results for all the ﬂights showed trends similar to those found for\nGs (Figure\
    \ 12c,d). Both PRI and SIF showed a strong and signiﬁcant relationship with Fs.\
    \ PRIsunlit\n(midmorning and midday) and PRIslt+ndr (midafternoon and afternoon)\
    \ showed the best ﬁtting with\nFs, while SIFczw was well-correlated with Fs for\
    \ all the ﬂights, except for midmorning. When four\nﬂights combined, the best\
    \ correlations were obtained with PRIczw and SIFczw, yielding (R2 = 0.76,\np <\
    \ 0.001 and R2 = 0.89, p < 0.001).\nThe highest correlation emerged between siCSWIczw\
    \ and Gs in the midmorning and afternoon\n(R2 = 0.98, p < 0.001 and R2 = 0.47,\
    \ p < 0.01) (Figure 12e). However, in the midday and midafternoon,\nsiCWSIslt+shd\
    \ and siCWSIndr respectively, showed the strongest relationship with Gs (R2 =\
    \ 0.89, p < 0.001\nand R2 = 0.96, p < 0.001), followed by siCWSIczw at both time\
    \ points (R2 = 0.87, p < 0.001 and R2 = 0.91,\np < 0.001). The strength of the\
    \ relationship for siCWSIndr was the strongest with Fs in the midafternoon\n(R2\
    \ = 0.96, p < 0.001), followed by sCSWIczw (R2 = 0.95, p < 0.001) (Figure 12f).\
    \ The strongest correlation\nwas observed between siCWSIslt+shd and Fs midmorning\
    \ and afternoon, respectively (R2 = 0.80, p < 0.01\nand R2 = 0.88, p < 0.001).\
    \ siCWSIczw was strongly correlated to Fs only in the midday (R2 = 0.72,\np <\
    \ 0.01). Using all four diurnal datasets, the strongest correlation was found\
    \ between siCWSIczw and\nboth Gs and Fs (R2 = 0.75, p < 0.01 and R2 = 0.74, p\
    \ < 0.01).\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n17 of 30\nFigure 12. Circular bar plots\

    \ this date (R2 = 0.70, p < 0.01 and R2 = 0.60,\np < 0.01) (Figure 13a). During\
    \ the midday, the highest correlation was found between siCWSIndr+shd\nand Gs\
    \ (R2 = 0.59, p < 0.01). For Fs, siCWSIndr+shd and siCWSIslt+ndr had the best\
    \ correlation with Fs\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n18 of 30\nin the morning and\

    \ and Tracking Physiological Indicators\nSIF and siCWSI retrievals from the VHR\
    \ images on 1 August 2018 showed diurnal changes in\nthe vine canopy (Figures\
    \ 14 and 15). It can be noted that there was no visual diﬀerence between\nirrigation\
    \ and rootstock treatments, and this was consistent with the in-situ physiological\
    \ measurements.\nHowever, visual diﬀerences between sunlit, nadir, and shaded\
    \ canopy zones could be easily recognized\nin both SIF and siCWSI images. Within-canopy\
    \ variability of SIF increased until midday and then\ndecreased (Figure 14b–e),\
    \ following the gradual decline in solar radiation. The highest within-canopy\n\
    variability of siCWSI was observed in the afternoon (Figure 15d), when air temperature\
    \ and VPD\nreached the maximum values for the day. In general, the eﬀects of diurnally\
    \ changing environmental\nfactors such as solar radiation, air temperature, and\
    \ VPD on the vine canopies corroborate the need\nto separate canopy zones, as\
    \ is shown with SIF and siCWSI retrievals. Furthermore, wide ranges of\nSIF and\
    \ siCWSI values were found (1–6.5 W sr−1 m−2 nm−1 and 0.1–1, respectively) for\
    \ each ﬂight,\nwhich conﬁrmed the relevance of canopy heterogeneity and the pertinence\
    \ of accounting for the\nvariability related to canopy structure.\nRemote Sens.\

    Using diurnal VHR aerial images and in-situ physiological measurements, the current\
    \ study\ninvestigated relationships between aerial image retrievals from diﬀerent\
    \ canopy zones and grapevine\nphysiological indicators. Implemented irrigation\
    \ treatments and rootstock/scion combinations in this\nstudy provided a wide range\
    \ of grapevine physiological status for testing the capability of aerial\nimages\
    \ in characterizing grapevine physiology. The pure grapevine canopy pixels were\
    \ extracted with\nhigh conﬁdence from the high spatial resolution images coupled\
    \ with neural network and computer\nvision-based methods. Then, the vine canopy\
    \ was segmented into three diﬀerent canopy zones using\nan unsupervised machine\
    \ learning algorithm. Additionally, the siCWSI values were well within\nthe range\
    \ of the theoretical CWSI limit (<1), conﬁrming that calculated siCWSI was based\
    \ on pure\nvegetation pixels and not subjected to soil background contamination.\
    \ It is worth mentioning that the\nemployed methods in this study stood out among\
    \ the limited similar studies [17,38,59] by taking full\nadvantage of spectral\
    \ information and temperature data as the basis for identifying diﬀerent canopy\n\
    zones and applying automated methods to streamline canopy zone segmentation from\
    \ hyperspectral\nand thermal images.\n4.1. Contribution of Diﬀerent Canopy Zones\
    \ to Grapevine Physiology: Hyperspectral Image Retrievals\nIn line with previous\
    \ studies [22,101–103], PRI and SIF derived from high-resolution aerial images\n\
    closely followed the diurnal physiological changes of grapevine indicated by Gs\
    \ and Fs (Figure 16).\nThe results of sunlit, nadir, and shaded canopy zones showed\
    \ diﬀerent levels of correlation with\ngrapevine physiology depending on the type\
    \ of aerial images and retrievals. There were only a few\ninstances where a single\
    \ canopy zone (either sunlit or nadir) showed the strongest correlations. PRI\
    \ and\nRemote Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n22 of 30\nSIF derived from either combination\
    \ of two canopy zones (slt + shd more frequent than slt + ndr) or\naveraged entire\
    \ canopy zone pixels showed the most frequent and the strongest correlation with\
    \ Gs\nand Fs measurements.\nAmong the recent eﬀorts to improve the ability of\
    \ PRI, some studies indicated the strong\ndependence of PRI on canopy shadow fraction\
    \ and conﬁrmed the importance of shaded leaves in\nthe simulation of canopy PRI\
    \ [104,105]. Zhang et al. [106] used a two-leaf (sunlit and shaded leaves)\napproach\
    \ to improve the ability of PRI as a proxy of light use eﬃcacy, which is closely\
    \ related to Gs, by\naccounting for sunlit and shaded leaf portion with weighted\
    \ leaf area index. Takala and Mõttus [84]\nexplained the illumination-related\
    \ apparent variation in canopy PRI by considering shadow eﬀects.\nThe results\
    \ of this study conﬁrmed the importance of considering both sunlit and shaded\
    \ canopy zones\nto improve the ability of PRI in tracking diurnal physiological\
    \ changes.\nSIF is also inﬂuenced by illumination, sunlit/shaded canopy, and soil\
    \ background, and these\ninﬂuences intensify when very-high-resolution hyperspectral\
    \ images are used for analysis [17,36].\nHernández et al. [17] and Camino et al\
    \ [38], who considered the eﬀects of canopy heterogeneity on SIF,\ndemonstrated\
    \ the signiﬁcance of sunlit canopy pixels in determining tree physiological status\
    \ and\nunderperformance of entire canopy pixels. This is somewhat contradictory\
    \ to what was observed in\nthis study, where SIF from entire canopy pixels also\
    \ performed well in multiple instances, and this\ncould be attributed to the discrepancy\
    \ in spatial resolution of the hyperspectral images used in this\nstudy (5 cm)\
    \ and previous studies (20 and 60 cm, respectively), where canopy pixels tend\
    \ to be easily\ncontaminated by soil and shaded background. In general, our results\
    \ showed the improvements from\ncombined (slt + ndr and slt + shd) or entire canopy\
    \ zones over sunlit zones, implying the importance\nof heterogeneity within canopy\
    \ structure in determining the relationship between SIF and in-situ\nphysiological\
    \ measurements.\n4.2. Contribution of Diﬀerent Canopy Zones to Grapevine Physiology:\
    \ Thermal Image Retrieval\nThe results from this study regarding the relationship\
    \ between the siCWSI and the physiological\nindicators were in agreement with\
    \ those from previous reports [103,107]. Canopy temperature is\naﬀected by tree\
    \ structure, which in turn aﬀects thermal image indices such as CWSI [31,32].\
    \ Furthermore,\nthere is a lack of consensus regarding the section of the sampling\
    \ zones (sunlit, nadir, and shaded\nzones). Sepúlveda et al. [59] and Belﬁore\
    \ [108] suggested to take into consideration the eﬀect of\nselecting canopy zones\
    \ to analyze thermal images. Suárez et al. [33] and Sepulcre et al. [107] found\n\
    a stronger relationship between canopy temperature and plant physiology in the\
    \ morning than\nmidday hours and indicated the importance of high spatial resolution\
    \ thermal images to minimize\nthe intensiﬁed midday soil eﬀects. This was not\
    \ the case in this study as siCWSI consistently showed\nstrong diurnal correlation\
    \ with in-situ measurements, suggesting that midday soil thermal eﬀects may\n\
    have been avoided with pure canopy pixel extracted from high-resolution thermal\
    \ images using the\ncomputer-vision-based method. However, the results showed\
    \ the slightly weaker relationship between\nsiCWSI and physiological indicators\
    \ at preharvest (15 September 2017 and 19 September 2018) than\nveraison (1 August\
    \ 2018), while thermal images collected at veraison had a lower spatial resolution.\n\
    This ﬁnding may be attributable to the diﬀerent growing stage because later in\
    \ the season, grapevines\nare more likely to be senescent [109] and in-situ measurements\
    \ may not represent the physiology of\nthe whole canopy well [59,63].\n4.3. Canopy\
    \ Zone-Weighting (CZW) Method Provided the Most Robust Estimates of Correlations\
    \ between\nAerial Image Retrievals and Grapevine Physiology\nTraditionally, image\
    \ retrievals were calculated over canopy pixels and averaged for each sampling\n\
    location for in-situ measurements. With recent advancements in UAV and sensor\
    \ technology, high\nspatial resolution aerial images have made it possible to\
    \ identify pure canopy pixels, and sunlit and\nshaded portions within tree canopies\
    \ [17,38,56]. When it comes to high-resolution hyperspectral\nimagery, Hernández-Clemente\
    \ et al. and Camino et al. [17,38] suggested separating sunlit and shaded\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2020, 12, 3216\n23 of 30\ncanopy zones to minimize the eﬀects of within-canopy\
    \ shadows caused by the illumination condition\nand canopy heterogeneity. Similarly,\
    \ Sepúlveda-Reyes et al. and Pou et al. [59,61] divided vine canopy\ninto sunlit,\
    \ nadir, and shaded zones in thermal imagery and found conﬂicting results in terms\
    \ of\nselecting an eﬀective canopy zone as a proxy for physiology. The CZW method\
    \ proposed in this\nstudy utilized the accumulated contribution of diﬀerent canopy\
    \ zones within the tree canopy instead\nof using a mean value averaged over a\
    \ certain portion of the canopy or entire canopy. Compared\nto conventional ways\
    \ of calculating image retrievals (using only sunlit pixels, while ignoring the\n\
    shaded pixels), the CZW better characterized the grapevine canopy heterogeneity,\
    \ and thus grapevine\nphysiology. Generally, our study is the only case that revealed\
    \ the complementary relationships\nbetween diﬀerent canopy zones using the CZW\
    \ method for tracking diurnal physiological changes.\nThe performance of diﬀerent\
    \ image retrieval from diﬀerent canopy zones was evaluated for\neach ﬁeld measurement\
    \ time point and all the measurement time points together for the given ﬁeld\n\
    date. The availability of thermal images enabled us to investigate the robustness\
    \ of the CZW method\nover multiple growing seasons (2017 and 2018) and stages\
    \ (veraison and preharvest). When a single\nmeasurement point was considered,\
    \ our results showed that PRIczw, SIFczw, and siCWSIczw were better\nrelated to\
    \ Gs and Fs in some cases than the image retrieval from a single canopy zone,\
    \ the combination\nof any two canopy zones, and the entire canopy. When all ﬂights\
    \ were analyzed, CZW-based retrievals\nalways performed better than any other\
    \ retrieval approaches, suggesting that CZW indeed worked well\nregardless of\
    \ hyperspectral or thermal images when there were large variations both in image\
    \ data and\nﬁeld measurements determined by illumination, bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ factor (BRDF), within-canopy\nheterogeneity, and diurnal physiological changes.\
    \ It is worth noting here that the CWZ would have\nled to even better performance\
    \ if the irrigation treatments had induced strong physiological changes\nduring\
    \ the ﬂights (that was not the case here).\nIt is commonly accepted that recorded\
    \ radiance and temperature from vegetation canopies are\nsubject to eﬀects of\
    \ sun angle, BRDF (especially in the case of hyperspectral imaging), shadows,\
    \ canopy\nbackground, structure, and leaf angle distribution, which in turn contribute\
    \ to the changes in the results\nto a diﬀerent degree. This is also true even\
    \ though the aerial images used in this study were acquired at\nlow altitudes\
    \ on sunny days with stable atmospheric conditions. Additionally, these eﬀects\
    \ may vary\ndepending on the diﬀerent canopy zones used in this study. Therefore,\
    \ it would be a logical follow-up\neﬀort to carry out a full analysis of the sensitivity\
    \ of the relationship between image retrievals and plant\nphysiology, focusing\
    \ on normalization or mitigation of these eﬀects speciﬁcally for each canopy zone.\n\
    4.4. Outlook\nWhile the proposed CZW method has been demonstrated to be a promising\
    \ advancement,\nfurther improvements may include the application of a pixel-weighting\
    \ approach and data fusion.\nIndeed, leaf photosynthetic status, water content,\
    \ pigment concentration, leaf angle distribution,\nand canopy architecture were\
    \ spatially diﬀerent within each canopy zone that was considered in this\nstudy.\
    \ Some of these spatial changes can be explained through rich spectral information\
    \ within a\npixel from hyperspectral images, and thus provide important information\
    \ about the plant physiology.\nLiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) or photogrammetric\
    \ point clouds, on the other hand, allow\nus to obtain accurate information about\
    \ the canopy architecture and the heterogeneity within the\ncanopy. Weighted pixels\
    \ containing spectral, thermal, and structural information can be combined\nand\
    \ will contribute to an improved understanding of plant physiology. Note that\
    \ the integration of\nmultisensory image data requires a highly accurate co-registration.\
    \ Despite the relatively diverse\ndataset (i.e., diurnal, two growing seasons\
    \ and stages for thermal images, and a single growing season\nand stage for hyperspectral\
    \ image), further work is needed to explore the robustness of the CZW\nmethod\
    \ on diﬀerent growing stages of grapevines, presence of a wide range of structural\
    \ and pigment\nchanges, and tree species other than grapevines.\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2020, 12, 3216\n24 of 30\n5. Conclusions\nThis study aimed to maximize the beneﬁts\
    \ of VHR hyperspectral and thermal UAV images to\nimprove the relationship between\
    \ the aerial image retrievals and diurnal indicators of grapevine\nphysiology.\
    \ Ultimately, this work allowed us to characterize physiological parameters at\
    \ a scale and\nwith speed not possible through other traditional measurements\
    \ of vine physiology. Besides enabling\nextraction of grapevine canopy with high\
    \ conﬁdence from both hyperspectral and thermal images,\nthe VHR images made it\
    \ feasible to quantitatively analyze the contribution of diﬀerent canopy zones\n\
    for characterizing diurnal physiological indicators. We proposed the CZW method\
    \ and evaluated\nits performance against the traditional image retrieval methods.\
    \ The results indicated that PRI, SIF,\nand siCWSI from sunlit and nadir zones\
    \ provided the best estimate of Gs and Fs when a single canopy\nzone was considered.\
    \ At a single ﬂight, PRI, SIF, and siCWSI computed over the combination of two\n\
    canopy zones (sunlit + nadir, sunlit + shaded, or nadir + shaded) or entire canopy\
    \ pixels showed a\nbetter relationship with diurnal Gs and Fs changes than the\
    \ PRI, SIF, and siCWSI calculated over a\nsingle canopy zone. Importantly, the\
    \ most frequent and the highest correlations were found for Gs\nand Fs with PRIczw,\
    \ SIFczw, and siCWSIczw. When all ﬂights combined for the given ﬁeld campaign\n\
    date, PRIczw, SIFczw, and siCWSIczw always signiﬁcantly improved the relationship\
    \ with Gs and Fs.\nIn summary, this study ﬁrst introduced the CZW concept to VHR\
    \ hyperspectral and thermal UAV\nimageries and provided a new train of thought\
    \ to the research and application of VHR images for\nremote assessment of plant\
    \ physiological indicators.\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available\

    \ of major issues that cause signiﬁcant economic loss for growers.\nThe labor-intensive\
    \ conventional methods for identifying the stressed plants constrain their\napplications.\
    \ To address this issue, rapid methods are in urgent needs. Developments of advanced\n\
    sensing and machine learning techniques trigger revolutions for precision agriculture\
    \ based on deep\nlearning and big data. In this paper, we reviewed the latest\
    \ deep learning approaches pertinent\nto the image analysis of crop stress diagnosis.\
    \ We compiled the current sensor tools and deep\nlearning principles involved\
    \ in plant stress phenotyping. In addition, we reviewed a variety of deep\nlearning\
    \ applications/functions with plant stress imaging, including classiﬁcation, object\
    \ detection,\nand segmentation, of which are closely intertwined. Furthermore,\
    \ we summarized and discussed the\ncurrent challenges and future development avenues\
    \ in plant phenotyping.\nKeywords: deep learning; convolutional neural network;\
    \ crop stress; precision phenotyping\n1. Plant Stress and Sensors\nPlant stress\
    \ is one of the major threats to crops causing signiﬁcant reduction of crop yield\n\
    and quality [1]. The detection and diagnosis of the plant stress is urgently needed\
    \ for rapid and\nrobust application of precision agriculture in crop measurement.\
    \ Presently, intensive studies focus\non developing optical imaging methods for\
    \ plant disease detection. Diﬀerent from the conventional\nmethods using the visual\
    \ scoring, optical imaging is advanced to measure changes caused by abiotic\n\
    or biotic stressors in the plant physiology rapidly and without contact. In general,\
    \ the common\nimaging technologies have been employed for detecting the crop stress,\
    \ including digital, ﬂuorescence,\nthermography, LIDAR, multispectral, and hyperspectral\
    \ imaging techniques [2]. The common optical\nsensors used for plant stress detection\
    \ are shown in Figure 1.\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2, 430–446; doi:10.3390/agriengineering2030029\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/agriengineering\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2\n431\nFigure 1.\
    \ Typical optical sensors used for plant stress detection. (a) Digital sensor\
    \ for maize heat\nstress [3]; (b) multispectral imaging sensor for maize water\
    \ stress [4]; (c) ﬂuorescence imaging sensor\nfor chilling injury of tomato seedlings\
    \ [5]; (d) thermal imaging sensor for potato water stress [6], and (e)\nhyperspectral\
    \ imaging sensor for apple water stress [7].\nDigital imaging sensors acquire\
    \ the visible range of wavelengths, i.e., RGB colored images with red,\nblue,\
    \ and green channels to detect plant diseases. Such images provide physical attributes\
    \ of the plants,\nsuch as canopy vigor, leaf color, leaf texture, size, and shape\
    \ information [8]. Color and texture features\nare important for identifying the\
    \ characteristic diﬀerence between healthy and symptomatic plants.\nFrequently\
    \ used color features are RGB, LAB, YCBCR, and HSV spaces [9]. Additionally, contrast,\n\
    homogeneity, dissimilarity, energy, and entropy features of images are descriptive\
    \ facets of texture [10].\nIn other words, quantitative diagnosis features for\
    \ identifying the symptomatic and healthy plants\nhave been collected in these\
    \ images.\nThermal imaging sensors obtain infrared radiating images ranging from\
    \ 8 to 12 µm, which are\noften applied for predicting plant temperatures. Under\
    \ the infection, the temperature of infected plant\ntissues varies and related\
    \ to the impacts caused by pathogens. The temperature variance, other the\nhand,\
    \ appears with a counter-eﬀect on transpiration rate [11]. In other words, stress\
    \ from the infection\ntrigger both transpiration rate decrease and leaf temperature\
    \ increase, resulting in stomatal closure\nin plants. In turn, based on these\
    \ alterations, thermal imaging sensors could identify the infection\ndiseases.\
    \ Each pixel of the thermal image represents the temperature value of the object,\
    \ which is\nexpressed in manners of false color. In plant disease detection, the\
    \ thermal sensor could be mounted to\nground automated vehicles (GAV) and unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles (UAV).\nFluorescence imaging sensors are often utilized to identify\
    \ variations of plant photosynthetic\nactivity [12]. The diﬀerences of stressed\
    \ and healthy leaves will be expressed in the diﬀerences of\nphotosynthetic activities,\
    \ which will be assessed by the photosynthetic electron transform using the\n\
    ﬂuorescence imaging sensor with an LED or laser illumination. For normal cases,\
    \ 685 nm is the\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2\n432\nwavelength at which chlorophyll\
    \ ﬂuorescence is emitted from photo-system II (PSII). The stressed\nplants could\
    \ change the patterns of chlorophyll ﬂuorescence emission, which could be reﬂected\
    \ and\nobserved in the ﬂuorescence imaging [13].\nBased on the number of spectral\
    \ bands in the optical sensing technologies, sensors contain 3–10 spectral\nbands\
    \ are named multispectral imaging sensors. The multispectral imaging sensors normally\
    \ extract a few\nor a stack of images from the visible to near-infrared spectrum\
    \ [14]. Plant stress often causes an increase in\nvisible reflectance, with a\
    \ decrease in chlorophyll and absorption of visible light. Additionally, reduced\n\
    near infrared (NIR) reflectance will happen due to changes of the leaf tissue.\
    \ Thus, the most used band\nchannels are green, red, red-edge and NIR. Multispectral\
    \ imaging sensor combined with drones have been\napplied broadly in remote sensing\
    \ for plant disease detection [15], while this type of sensors is limited to a\n\
    few spectral bands and sometimes cannot quantify the diseased plants severity.\n\
    Despite many successful studies having been applied to crop stress detection using\
    \ cheap\npassive imagery sensors, i.e., digital and near infrared (NIR), most\
    \ of the applications require fast\nimage processing and computational algorithms\
    \ for image analysis. Among the image analysis\ntechniques, supervised methods\
    \ have been popular with training data being used to develop a system.\nSuch methods\
    \ include shape segmentation, feature extraction, and classiﬁers for stress diagnosis.\n\
    In addition, machine learning algorithms search for the optimal decision boundary\
    \ in the feature space\nwith high dimensionality, which provides the basis for\
    \ many available image analysis systems [16].\nFor improving the image analysis\
    \ systems, deep learning has played a key role. Deep neural networks\nhave many\
    \ layers which transform input images to outputs (i.e., healthy or stressed) with\
    \ learning deep\nfeatures. The most applied networks are convolutional neural\
    \ networks (CNNs) in crop image analysis.\nCNNs consist of dozens or hundreds\
    \ of layers that process the images with convolution filters with a\nrespective\
    \ small size of batches [17]. Despite such initial successes, CNNs cannot collect\
    \ momentum\nwithout the advances in core computing systems and deep convolutional\
    \ networks become the current\nfocus. In agriculture, deep learning shows accepted\
    \ performance considering accuracy and efficiency based\non large datasets. To\
    \ build precise classifiers for improving plant disease diagnosis, the PlantVillage\
    \ project\n(https://plantvillage.psu.edu/posts/6948-plantvillage-dataset-download)\
    \ has obtained a large number of\nimages of healthy and diseased crops for free\
    \ [18]. Combined with the big data, deep learning has been put\nforwarded as the\
    \ future promising method in plant phenotyping [19]. For example, CNNs can effectively\n\
    detect and diagnose plant diseases [20] and classify plant fruits in the field\
    \ [21]. The promising results\npromote studies carrying out other phenotyping\
    \ tasks using deep learning, such as leaf morphological\nclassification [22].\
    \ Thus, we read many references about the utilization of deep learning in image-based\n\
    crop stress detection. Summarizing, with this paper we aim to:\n1.\nState the\
    \ principle of deep learning in the application for crop stress diagnosis based\
    \ on images.\n2.\nSearch for the challenges of deep learning in crop stress imaging.\n\
    3.\nHighlight the future directions that could be helpful for circumventing the\
    \ challenges in plant\nphenotyping tasks.\n2. Deep Learning Principle\n2.1. Machine\
    \ Learning\nMachine learning is a subset of artiﬁcial intelligence which is used\
    \ to operate speciﬁc tasks by\ncomputer systems [23]. In general, it is split\
    \ into supervised and unsupervised learning methods.\nSupervised learning methods\
    \ are expressed with an input matrix of independent x and dependent\ny variables.\
    \ This dependent variable of y has few formats, varying based on solving problems.\n\
    For classiﬁcation issues, y is usually a scalar for representing the category\
    \ labels, and it is a vector\ncontaining continuous values under regression [24].\
    \ Under segmented learning conditions, y is\nsometimes the ground truth label\
    \ image [25]. Supervised learning methods often aim to ﬁnd optimal\nmodel parameters,\
    \ which could predict the data to the greatest extent based on the loss function.\n\
    AgriEngineering 2020, 2\n433\nUnsupervised learning methods operate data processing\
    \ without dependent labels and aim to\nsearch for patterns (e.g., latent variables).\
    \ Common unsupervised learning methods include principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA),\
    \ k-nearest neighbors clustering, and T-distributed stochastic neighbor\nembedding\
    \ clustering [26]. Unsupervised training usually uses many diﬀerent loss functions\
    \ to process,\nsuch as reconstructing the loss function. The model must learn\
    \ to reconstruct the loss function in a\nsmaller dimension to reconstruct the\
    \ input data [27].\n2.2. Neural Network\nA neural network is built to recognize\
    \ patterns and provides the basis for most deep learning\nalgorithms [28]. A neural\
    \ network contains nodes that integrate input data with a set of coeﬃcients\n\
    and weights with amplify or dampen the input for learning the assigned tasks,\
    \ e.g., the common\nactivation function α and parameters Θ = \bw, β\t, here, w\
    \ represents the weights and β represents the\nbiases. An activation function\
    \ is normally followed by an elemental nonlinear factor/coeﬃcient σ, as a\ntransfer\
    \ function, as shown in Equation (1) [28]:\nα = σ\n\x10\nWTx + b\n\x11\n(1)\n\
    Sigmoidal and hyperbolic tangent functions are the common transfer functions for\
    \ neural networks.\nThe multilayer perceptron (MLP) is the most popular one in\
    \ traditional neural networks, with few\nconversion layers [28]:\nf(x; Θ) = σ\n\
    \x10\nWLσ\n\x10\nWL−1 . . . σ\n\x10\nW0x + b0\x11\n+ bL−1\x11\n+ bL\x11\n(2)\n\
    where WL is a matrix containing rows wk that is related with activation k in the\
    \ output, and L is the ﬁnal\nlayer. The so-called hidden layers are the layers\
    \ between input and output layers. A neural network\nwith many layers is often\
    \ called deep neural network (DNN), thence deep learning. The activation of\n\
    the last layer is mapped to distribution on the class P (y|x; Θ) through a softmax\
    \ function [28]:\nP\n\x10\ny\n\f\f\fx; Θ\n\x11\n= softmax (x; Θ) =\ne(WL\ni )Tx+bL\n\
    i\nPK\nk=1 e(WL\nk )Tx+bL\nk\n(3)\nwhere WL\ni is the weight vector associated\
    \ with class i to the output node. The typical diagram of deep\nneural network\
    \ MLP is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Typical architectures of deep neural network\
    \ used in imaging analysis. (a) autoencoder and\n(b) convolutional neural network.\n\
    AgriEngineering 2020, 2\n434\nCurrently, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is\
    \ the famous method for ﬁtting the parameter Θ\nto process a small population\
    \ dataset. With SGD, a small batch is employed in each gradient and\nmaximum likelihood\
    \ optimization is used to minimize the negative impact of the log-likelihood.\n\
    It tracks the log loss for a binary classiﬁcation task and the softmax loss for\
    \ multiclass classiﬁcation.\nA disadvantage of this method is that it usually\
    \ does not directly optimize the quantity of interest [28].\nDNN became popular\
    \ in 2016, when it performed layer-by-layer training (pre-training) in an\nunsupervised\
    \ manner, and then supervised and ﬁne-tuned the stacked network to obtain good\n\
    performance. Such a DNN architecture includes a stacked autoencoder (SAE) and\
    \ a deep summary\nnetwork (DBN). However, such methods are often complex, which\
    \ need a great deal of engineering\nto obtain acceptable results [28,29]. Recently,\
    \ end-to-end training has been conducted on popular\narchitectures in a supervised\
    \ manner by streamlining the training procedure. The common architectures\nare\
    \ CNN and recurrent neural network (RNN) [30,31]. CNN has been widely used for\
    \ image analysis,\nand RNN is becoming more and more popular.\n2.3. Convolutional\
    \ Neural Network\nThe main diﬀerence between MLP and CNN is reﬂected in two aspects.\
    \ First, weights of the\nCNN architecture are shared with a network when the architecture\
    \ operates convolutions on the input\nimage [32]. In this way, separate detector\
    \ learning is not required for the same object appearing at\ndiﬀerent locations\
    \ in the image. As a result, the network is equally variable in the translation\
    \ of input\nimages. In addition, the number of parameters to be learned is reduced.\n\
    During CNN training, the input images are convolved with a set of K kernels W\
    \ =\n\bW1, W2, W3, . . . WK\n\t and biases β =\nn\nb1, . . . , bK\no\nin the convolution\
    \ layer, yielding a new feature\nmap Xk. Such features are exposed to a nonlinear\
    \ transformation parameter σ and such process would\nrepeat for each respective\
    \ convolutional layer l [32]:\nXl\nk = σ\n\x10\nWl−1\nk\n× Xl−1 + bl−1\nk\n\x11\
    \n(4)\nSecond, the main diﬀerence between MLP and CNN is the pooling layer. In\
    \ such layers, the pixels\nof the neighborhood are added based on the permutation\
    \ invariant function in CNN. This may prompt\na certain amount of rendering invariance\
    \ [33]. Then, the fully connected layers are usually added\nwith constant weights\
    \ after convolutional processing. Then, the softmax function is used to provide\n\
    activation information in the last layer, resulting in a category assignment.\
    \ A typical CNN architecture\nis shown in Figure 3 for identifying the ripeness\
    \ of strawberry based on hyperspectral imagery [34].\nFigure 3. One typical CNN\
    \ architecture for estimating the ripeness of strawberry based on hyperspectral\n\
    imagery [34]. Note: Conv represents convolutional layer; FC: fully connected layer.\n\
    AgriEngineering 2020, 2\n435\n2.4. CNN Architecture\nCNN normally uses a 2D image\
    \ as input, with a format of m × n × 3 (m × n × 1 for greyscale\nimages), where\
    \ m and n are the respective image height and width, and 3 is the number of image\n\
    channels. The CNN architecture often contains a few diﬀerent layers, including\
    \ convolutional layers,\npooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional\
    \ and pooling layers are initial layers. A set\nof convolutional kernels (also\
    \ called ﬁlters) is used for each layer performing multiple transformations.\n\
    The convolution operations extract the associated features from small slices divided\
    \ from the full image.\nEach kernel is applied to the input slice and the output\
    \ of each kernel is applied to non-linear processing\nunits, making it capable\
    \ of learning abstraction and embedding non-linearity in the feature space [35].\n\
    The non-linear processing provides diﬀerent patterns of activations corresponding\
    \ to diﬀerent responses,\nwhich helps learn the semantic diﬀerences over the full\
    \ image. Then, the subsampling is applied to the\noutput of non-linear processing,\
    \ with summarizing the results and making the input insensitive to\nthe geometric\
    \ deformation [36]. The CNN architecture has been applied to many aspects, including\n\
    classiﬁcation, segmentation, and object detection, etc.\n2.4.1. Classiﬁcation\
    \ Architectures\nAmong the pre-trained networks, AlexNet is commonly used for\
    \ images classiﬁcation, which is\nrelatively simple with ﬁve convolutional layers.\
    \ The activation function of AlexNet is the hyperbolic\ntangent, which is the\
    \ most common choice in CNNs [37]. Then, the deep pre-trained networks appeared,\n\
    such as the VGG19 with 19 deep layers, winning the ImageNet challenge of 2014\
    \ [38]. These deeper\nnetworks use smaller stacked kernels and have lower memory\
    \ during inference, which improves\nthe performance of mobile computing devices,\
    \ such as smartphones [39]. Later, in 2015, the ResNet\narchitecture won the ImageNet\
    \ challenge and was made up of the ResNet blocks. The residual blocks\nlearn the\
    \ residuals and pre-processes the learning mapping for each layer, thereby providing\
    \ eﬀective\ntraining performance for deeper architectures. Szegedy et al. (2016)\
    \ developed a 22-layer neural\nnetwork referred as GoogLeNet, which employed the\
    \ inception blocks [40]. The advantage of using the\ninception blocks is that\
    \ it could increase the training process eﬃciency while decreasing the number\n\
    of parameters. The performance on ImageNet reached saturation after 2014 and crediting\
    \ the better\nperformance to the more complex architectures is biased. On the\
    \ other hand, it is not necessary\nto perform plant stress detection with the\
    \ deeper networks, providing a lower memory footprint.\nTherefore, AlexNet or\
    \ other relatively simple methods, such as VGG16, are still practical for crop\n\
    stress images.\n2.4.2. Segmentation Architectures\nSegmentation is important in\
    \ crop stress image analysis. The pixel in the image could be classiﬁed\nby the\
    \ CNN and the classiﬁed pixel could be presented with patches that extracted from\
    \ neighboring\npixels [41]. The disadvantage of this method is that the input\
    \ patches overlap, and the same convolution\nis repeatedly calculated. Fortunately,\
    \ the linear operators (convolution and dot product) can be written\nas convolutions\
    \ [42]. With a fully connected layer, a CNN can have a larger input image than\
    \ the\ntrained image and can generate a likelihood map instead of the output of\
    \ a pixel. Then, such a full\nconvolutional network can be eﬀectively applied\
    \ to the full input image.\n2.5. Hardware and Software\nThe dramatic increase\
    \ of deep learning applications could be due to the widespread development\nof\
    \ GPUs [43]. GPU computing started when NVIDIA launched CUDA (Computing Uniﬁed\
    \ Device\nArchitecture) and AMD launched Stream. The GPU is a highly parallel\
    \ computing engine which\noﬀers a great advantage compared with a central processing\
    \ unit (CPU). The Open Computing\nLanguage (OpenCL) uniﬁes diﬀerent GPU general\
    \ computing application programming interface\n(API) implementations and provides\
    \ a framework that can be used to write programs that execute on\nAgriEngineering\
    \ 2020, 2\n436\nheterogeneous platforms composed of a CPU and GPU. With the hardware,\
    \ deep learning on the GPU\nis much faster than on the CPU [44].\nOpen source\
    \ software packages also promote the development and application of deep learning.\n\
    These software packages allow users to operate the computing at a high level without\
    \ having to worry\nabout eﬃcient implementation. By far the most popular packages\
    \ include:\nCaﬀé, which oﬀers C++ and python interfaces, developed by graduate\
    \ students at UC Berkeley\nAI Research.\nTensorFlow, which provides C++ and python\
    \ interfaces, developed by Google Brain team.\nTheano, which provides a python\
    \ interface, developed by MILA lab in Montreal.\nPyTorch, which provides C++ and\
    \ python interface, developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab.\n3. Applications\
    \ of Deep Learning in Plant Stress Imaging\n3.1. Classiﬁcation\nDeep learning\
    \ has been applied successfully in plant phenotyping combined with various sensors\n\
    and speciﬁc tasks, including harvesting crop counting, weed control, and crop\
    \ stress detection [17,45–47].\nRegarding crop stress detection, with various\
    \ speciﬁc tasks, the image analysis methods are often\nvarying among classiﬁcation,\
    \ segmentation, and object detection in crop stress detection combined\nwith various\
    \ sensors (Figure 4). Image classiﬁcation is one of the earliest areas where deep\
    \ learning\ncontributed signiﬁcantly to the analysis of plant stress images. In\
    \ crop stress image classiﬁcation, one or\nmore images are usually used as input\
    \ data, and a diagnostic decision is used as output (e.g., healthy\nor diseased).\
    \ In this case, each diagnosis is a sample, and the size of the dataset is usually\
    \ smaller\ncompared to computer vision (thousands or millions of samples). Therefore,\
    \ for such applications,\nthe transfer learning should be popular for researchers.\
    \ Transfer learning essentially uses pre-trained\nnetworks to try to meet the\
    \ needs of deep network training on large datasets. At present, two transfer\n\
    learning methods are commonly applied: (1) the speciﬁc pre-trained network is\
    \ directly applied in\nimages processing, and (2) ﬁne-tuning the speciﬁed pre-trained\
    \ network for the aiming objective\nimages. Another beneﬁt of the former strategy\
    \ is that training a deep network is not necessary, making\nit easy to insert\
    \ the extracted features into existing image analysis pipelines. However, it is\
    \ still a\nchallenge to ﬁnd the best strategy. Barbedo (2019) used a CNN to classify\
    \ individual lesions and spots\non plant leaves instead of considering the entire\
    \ leaf [45]. This identiﬁed multiple diseases that aﬀect\nthe same leaf. The accuracy\
    \ obtained using this method was, on average, 12% higher than that obtained\n\
    using the original image. While proper symptom segmentation is still required\
    \ manually, preventing\nfull automation. Also, in this paper, the authors applied\
    \ deep learning to detect the individual lesions\nand spots for 14 plant species.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, this study used a pre-trained GoogLeNet CNN for training\nthe models.\
    \ The images were split into two groups for addressing diﬀerent objectives. The\
    \ ﬁrst group\nwas aimed to image classiﬁcation, to identify the origin of the\
    \ observed symptom, while the second one\nwas for object detection, which was\
    \ to identify disease areas amidst healthy tissue and to determine if\nsubsequent\
    \ classiﬁcation was conducted or not. The results showed that accuracies obtained\
    \ using this\napproach were, in average, 12% higher than those achieved using\
    \ the original images. The accuracies\nwere higher than 75% for all the considered\
    \ conditions or number of detected diseases, while the author\nalso claimed that\
    \ the resized input images for pre-trained neural network were not as advantageous\
    \ as\nthe original images under certain conditions. Other studies that applied\
    \ the deep learning into the\ncrop stress image classiﬁcation are shown in Table\

    Segmentation is used to identify the set of pixels or contours that make up the\
    \ target object [70].\nSegmentation is a common topic in papers applying deep\
    \ learning to plant disease imaging.\nVarious methods have been applied to segmentation,\
    \ such as developing unique segmentation\narchitectures based on CNNs and application\
    \ of RNNs. The popular segmentation CNN architectures\ninclude U-Net and Mask\
    \ R-CNN [71]. U-Net was investigated in biomedical image segmentation\nﬁrstly\
    \ [72], which was built upon a fully convolutional network (FCN). FCN is to provide\
    \ one\ncontracting network by continuous layers in which pooling layers are substituted\
    \ by up-sampling\noperators. The continuous layer would learn to gather a more\
    \ precise output, with an increase of\nthe resolution of the output. U-Net is\
    \ symmetric, that is, it has the same number of up-sampling\nand down-sampling\
    \ layers. The skip connections in U-Net use a concatenation operator between the\n\
    up-sampling and down-sampling layers [73]. This method connects the features in\
    \ the contact path\nand the extension path. This means that the entire image is\
    \ enabled to be processed forward through\nU-Net to directly generate a segmentation\
    \ mapping. In this way, U-Net could consider the entire image,\nwhich make it\
    \ more advanced than the patch-based CNN. Furthermore, Çiçek et al. (2016) built\
    \ one\n3D U-Net segmentation by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts\
    \ [74]. Lin et al. (2019)\napplied a U-Net CNN to segment and detect cucumber\
    \ powdery mildew-infected cucumber leaves\nobtained by an RGB sensor [46]. In\
    \ this study, since the powdery mildew-infected pixels were less than\nthat of\
    \ non-infected pixels, the authors proposed binary cross entropy loss function\
    \ to magnify the\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2\n439\nloss value of the powdery mildew-infected\
    \ pixels by 10 times. The results showed that the semantic\nsegmentation CNN model\
    \ achieved an average pixel accuracy of 96.08% for segmenting the diseased\npowdery\
    \ mildew on cucumber leaf images. It was still challenging to apply such deep\
    \ neural network\nin ﬁeld conditions. Diﬀerent applications of deep learning into\
    \ the crop stress image segmentation are\nsummarized in Table 2.\nTable 2. Applications\
    \ of deep learning for crop stress segmentation.\nReference\nSensor\nStress Type\n\

    \ neural network\n(GPDCNN)\nCucumber leaf\ndisease\nR-CNN combines rectangular\
    \ region proposals with CNN features. Generally, R-CNN includes\ntwo-stage detection\
    \ procedures. Firstly, the algorithm detects subset regions of an image which\
    \ may\ncontain an object and extracts CNN features from the region proposals.\
    \ Then the object in each region\nis classiﬁed. R-CNN takes a large amount of\
    \ training of the deep neural network when there are\n2000 or more region proposals\
    \ per image that need to be classiﬁed. Meanwhile, there is no learning\nprocedure\
    \ at the ﬁrst searching stage as the selective search algorithm is ﬁxed. As a\
    \ result, it may lead\nto tricky candidate region proposals being generated [80,81].\
    \ During R-CNN processing, the region\nproposals need to be cropped and resized,\
    \ while the Faster R-CNN detector processes the entire\nimage. Thus, Faster R-CNN\
    \ can be applied for real-time object detection. Additionally, Faster R-CNN\n\
    is the backbone of Mask R-CNN. Faster R-CNN includes two outputs, that is, a class\
    \ label and a\nbounding-box oﬀset. A third branch is added to mask R-CNN upon\
    \ faster R-CNN architecture, which\noutputs the object mask [71]. In addition,\
    \ Mask R-CNN is one of the instance segmentation algorithms\nwhich produce a mask\
    \ that uses color or grayscale values to identify pixels belonging to the same\n\
    object. Except to feed the feature map to the region proposal network and the\
    \ classiﬁer, Mask R-CNN\nuses a feature map to predict a binary mask for the object\
    \ inside the bounding box.\n3.3. Object Detection\nObject detection is a key part\
    \ in imaging diagnosis and one of the most laborious tasks.\nTypically, the task\
    \ involves locating and identifying objects throughout the image [82]. For a long\n\
    time, the research goal of computer vision was to automatically detect objects,\
    \ for improving detection\naccuracy, and reducing labor. The object detection\
    \ based on deep learning uses CNN for pixel\nclassiﬁcation and then applies some\
    \ post-processing to obtain object candidates [81–83]. Since the\nimage classiﬁcation\
    \ is to classify each pixel in the image, which is basically equal to object classiﬁcation,\n\
    thereby the CNN architectures of segmentation are alike to those for the classiﬁcation\
    \ task, while the\nimage labels imbalance, hard negative detecting, and eﬃcient\
    \ processing image pixels etc., still remain\nas the challenging issues to be\
    \ addressed for object detection. Fuentes et al., (2017) applied Faster\nR-CNN\
    \ and a VGG-16 detector to recognize tomato plant diseases and pests [55]. Diseases\
    \ and pests\ncould be identiﬁed using the bounding-box and score for each class\
    \ being shown on each infected leaf.\nThat is, the detection method provides a\
    \ solution for detecting the class and location of diseases in\ntomato plants\
    \ practically. R-CNN and Faster R-CNN have been applied to object detection as\
    \ well,\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2\n440\nusing the regions in the image to locate\
    \ the object. Recently, the YOLO algorithm has often been\napplied for object\
    \ detection, which uses a single convolutional network to predict the bounding\
    \ boxes\nand classify such boxes [84]. The YOLO algorithm divides the image into\
    \ an M × M grid, then m\n(m<M) bounding boxes are taken within each of the grids.\
    \ The network yields a class probability\nfor each bounding box. When the bounding\
    \ boxes have higher class probability than a threshold\nvalue, they would be selected\
    \ and applied for locating the objects in the image. The limitation of the\nYOLO\
    \ network is that it sometimes cannot identify small objects in the images [84].\
    \ Singh et al. (2020)\napplied Faster R-CNN with an InceptionResnetV2 model and\
    \ a MobileNet model on PlantVillage\ndatasets to detect plant disease, which included\
    \ 2598 images from 13 plants and over 17 diseases [85].\nOther applications for\
    \ object detection are summarized in Table 3.\nTable 3. Application of deep learning\

    4. Unique Challenges in Plant Stress Based on Imagery\nNoncontact plant stress\
    \ detection has been conducted on diﬀerent application scales, i.e., laboratory,\n\
    ground-based, and UAV. Additionally, the modality has been operated based on a\
    \ variety of sensors,\nsuch as digital, thermal, multispectral, and hyperspectral\
    \ imagery, with diﬀerent numbers of spectral\nchannels, from three to hundreds.\
    \ Such sensors could monitor the size, shape, and structural features\nor crops\
    \ based on the external views obtained from digital cameras. The digital sensors\
    \ could be\neasily operated under the natural light environment. Hyperspectral\
    \ imaging sensors could obtain the\ninside spectral signatures beyond the visible\
    \ wavelength range which could reﬂect the healthy crop\nconditions in a wide range\
    \ of spectra, while most of the commercial hyperspectral imaging sensors\ncould\
    \ only work in laboratory with controlled light conditions at present. On the\
    \ other hand, the wind\nwill make the crops move around. In general, for image\
    \ acquisition, it is still challenging for ﬁeld work.\nFurther, the crops are\
    \ not static:\nthe physiological properties change with their growth.\nEspecially\
    \ for biotic stress infected crops, the fungi or viruses in the crops have great\
    \ impacts\non the physiological changes. It will be diﬃcult to detect the stress\
    \ at an early stage without symptoms\nshowing based on image analysis. Further,\
    \ for the application of deep learning-assisted image analysis,\na lack of datasets\
    \ is a major obstacle as well. At present, the available open source images are\
    \ mainly\nfrom the PlantVillage dataset. On the other hand, one signiﬁcant challenge\
    \ is that of ground-truth\nlabelling, which is hugely laborious. The Amazon SageMaker\
    \ Ground Truth provides a service for\nmanaging the labelling, including two features.\
    \ One is annotation consolidation, which combines\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2\n441\n\
    diﬀerent people’s annotation task results into one high-ﬁdelity label. The second\
    \ one is automated\ndata labeling, which utilizes machine learning to label portions\
    \ of the provided data automatically.\nMoreover, to detect crop stress, the classiﬁcation\
    \ and segmentation are often used as binary\ntasks, i.e., healthy versus infected,\
    \ target infected area versus background. However, since these\ntwo categories\
    \ can be highly heterogeneous, this is usually a general simpliﬁcation. For instance,\n\
    the samples of the healthy class mainly consist of completely healthy objects\
    \ but also rarely few objects\nshowing early stresses. This could lead to classiﬁers\
    \ that are able to exclude the healthy samples but\ncannot identify the few rare\
    \ ones. The strategy for this case is to make a deep learning system with\nmulticlass\
    \ by giving it detailed annotations of all possible classes. Meanwhile, the within-class\
    \ variance\nfrom images may reduce the sensitivity of the deep learning system.\
    \ However, the between-classes\nvariance from a dataset that may not be generalized\
    \ to every image, such as the diﬀerent severity of\ndisease images, can obtain\
    \ a pseudo-deep learning training architecture in one certain experiment,\nbut\
    \ obstruct the usefulness of its broad application to practical decision-making\
    \ unless the nature of\nthis dataset is precisely understood. Parameter optimization\
    \ of the deep learning training models, i.e.,\nbatch size, learning rate, dropout\
    \ rate, etc., is a remaining challenge as well. There is currently no exact\n\
    method to achieve the best combinations of hyperparameters, which is often operated\
    \ empirically,\neven though Bayesian optimization has been put forwarded.\n5.\
    \ Outlook\nDeep learning has been applied successfully in plant stress (i.e.,\
    \ abiotic, and biotic stress) detection\neven though it still has many challenges.\
    \ Most of the papers we have reviewed are based on the 2D\nimages for symptomatic\
    \ stages, for example the digital and greyscale images. Such images could be\n\
    enabled to operate in the deep transfer learning architecture, such as Alexnet,\
    \ VGG, GoogleNet, while\nsuch pre-trained transfer networks could not be applied\
    \ to the 3D datasets, such as hyperspectral\nimages, which are more sensitive\
    \ to detecting the early-infected plants. In the future, deep neural\nnetworks\
    \ that can be used for 3D images should be the focus and early detections of plant\
    \ disease is\npivotal to the precision disease management, especially for diseases\
    \ without therapy using pesticide.\nOn the other hand, many tasks in plant stress\
    \ detection analysis could be granted, such as classiﬁcation,\nand such a strategy\
    \ may not be always optimal since it probably requires some post-processing, such\n\
    as segmentation. Further, semi-supervised and unsupervised deep learning are worthy\
    \ of being\nexploratory in the application of plant stress detection, though most\
    \ of studies are based on supervised\napproaches. The advantage of unsupervised\
    \ methods is that the networks training process could be\noperated without the\
    \ ground truth labels. The unsupervised approach for detecting the plant stress\n\
    are generative adversarial networks (GANs) [90], while another common unsupervised\
    \ approach,\ni.e., variational autoencoders (VAEs), is rarely applied for crop\
    \ disease diagnosis yet based on our\nknowledge [91]. Further, deep learning has\
    \ been applied for other objectives in agricultural imaging,\ne.g., crop load\
    \ estimation and harvesting, while image reconstruction remains unexplored, especially\n\
    for LiDAR point cloud data. In general, deep learning has provided promising results\
    \ in plant stress\ndetection, which could accelerate the development of precision\
    \ agriculture with the extension of\nﬁeld application.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    and a hyperspectral scanner (SCIO)
  explanation: This study explores the use of a low-cost hyperspectral scanner (SCIO)
    for non-invasive plant stress detection. The researchers conducted field experiments
    with onions, manipulating irrigation levels and soil amendment to induce varying
    stress levels. They collected spectral measurements using both a field spectrometer
    (Apogee) and the SCIO scanner and used machine learning to classify the onion
    treatments based on the spectral features. The results showed that the Apogee
    spectrometer outperformed the SCIO scanner in terms of accuracy, but the SCIO
    scanner still provided promising results for crop water stress monitoring.

    REFERENCES CITED BY     Abstract Many studies have shown that hyperspectral measurements
    can help monitor crop health status, such as water stress, nutrition stress, pest
    stress, etc. However, applications of hyperspectral cameras or scanners are still
    very limited in precision agriculture. The resolution of satellite hyperspectral
    images is too low to provide the information in the desired scale. The resolution
    of either field spectrometer or aerial hyperspectral cameras is fairly high, but
    their cost is too high to be afforded by growers. In this study, we are interested
    in if the flow-cost hyperspectral scanner SCIO can serve as a crop monitoring
    tool to provide crop health information for decision support. In an onion test
    site, there were three irrigation levels and four types of soil amendment, randomly
    assigned to 36 plots with three replicates for each treatment combination. Each
    month, three onion plant samples were collected from the test site and fresh weight,
    dry weight, root length, shoot length etc. were measured for each plant. Meanwhile,
    three spectral measurements were made for each leaf of the sample plant using
    both a field spectrometer and a hyperspectral scanner. We applied dimension reduction
    methods to extract low-dimension features. Based on the data set of these features
    and their labels, several classifiers were built to infer the field treatment
    of onions. Tests on validation dataset (25 percent of the total measurements)
    showed that this low-cost hyperspectral scanner is a promising tool for crop water
    stress monitoring, though its performance is worse than the field spectrometer
    Apogee. The traditional field spectrometer yields the best accuracy as high as
    above 80%, whereas the best accuracy of SCIO is around 50%. © (2018) COPYRIGHT

  explanation: The Water Index (WI), based on the reflectance of light at specific
    wavelengths, has been shown to track changes in stomatal conductance and is therefore
    a potential indicator of plant water status. In this study, potted grapevine plants
    subjected to contrasting water availability were examined to determine the feasibility
    of using the WI to estimate vine water status at the leaf and canopy levels. The
    results showed that the WI tracked changes in leaf stomatal conductance and was
    closely related to canopy transpiration under a range of moderate to severe water
    stress. The authors conclude that the WI effectively tracked variation in stomatal
    conductance and canopy transpiration under moderate to severe water stress and
    could be a useful tool for monitoring vineyard water status in precision viticulture.
  extract_1: In agreement with other studies conducted in potted plants (Medrano et
    al., 2002) different irrigation supply did not translate into significant differences
    in Ψp. Nonetheless, despite similar Ψp values in both treatments, deficit plants
    underwent earlier decreases in gas exchange parameters (A, gs and E) along the
    day when compared to control plants.
  extract_2: In field grown vines differences in water availability between years
    and among vineyards were translated into differences in canopy development as
    indicated by the close relationship between predawn water potential and NDVI.
    In addition, the WI was closely related to the midday canopy to air temperature
    difference, indicating that the WI effectively tracked variation in stomatal conductance
    within a range of moderate to severe water stress.

    Get rights and content Abstract In the Mediterranean arc, vines for wine production
    are mainly grown without the support of irrigation. Under such conditions, site
    variables affecting the extent and seasonal timing of water deficits are the dominant
    environmental constraints for grape production. Moreover, water availability and
    vine water status are the factors most comprehensively determining fruit composition
    and, thus, wine quality. Therefore, monitoring the extent of water stress in vines
    might be a valuable tool for the optimisation of grape yield and quality. The
    objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the reflectance
    based Water Index (WI) to estimate vine water status at the leaf and canopy levels.
    The study was conducted on Vitis vinifera cv. Chardonnay potted plants submitted
    to contrasting water availability and in ten commercial vineyards in the D.O.
    Penedès region (Catalonia, Spain) over two consecutive years (2007–2008). In potted
    plants, differences in water supply were translated into differences in net photosynthetic
    carbon assimilation, stomatal conductance (gs) and WI, despite similar predawn
    water potentials (Ψp). There was a negative close correlation between WI and gs,
    although the relationship was treatment dependent (r2 = 0.81 and r2 = 0.95, for
    control and deficit plants, respectively). Similarly the leaf to air temperature
    difference was inversely related to gs (r2 = 0.51). In the field study there were
    significant differences in Ψp among vineyards and between years and indicated
    that vines experienced moderate to severe water stress. Water availability determined
    vine canopy development as indicated by the close relationship between the Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index and in Ψp (r2 = 0.57). The canopy to air temperature
    difference (determined with an infrared thermometer at midday) was inversely correlated
    with WI with r2 = 0.45 and r2 = 0.56 in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Thus, the
    reflectance based Water Index effectively tracked variation in both leaf stomatal
    conductance and canopy transpiration under a range of moderate to severe water
    stress. The results are discussed in relation to the potential application of
    WI to irrigation scheduling and to monitoring vineyard performance. Research highlights
    ▶ Contrasting water supply promotes changes in both stomatal conductance and WI.
    ▶ WI closely follows diurnal changes in stomatal conductance at the leaf level.
    ▶ Predawn water potential indicates moderate to severe water stress in field grown
    vines. ▶ WI relates to the midday canopy to air temperature difference in field
    grown vines. ▶ WI tracks variation in canopy transpiration under moderate to severe
    water stress. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Vitis viniferaStomatal

    Water is the most limiting resource for crop growth in the Mediterranean region,
    rainfall is scarce and irregularly distributed along the year and climate change
    models predict even more arid conditions in the next decades (Bates et al., 2008,
    Jones et al., 2005, Schultz and Stoll, 2010). In many dry lands of the Mediterranean
    arc, vines for wine production are grown without the support of irrigation. Under
    such conditions, site variables affecting the extent and seasonal timing of water
    deficits are the dominant environmental constraints for grape production (Williams
    and Matthews, 1990). In the last decades, irrigation has been introduced in some
    areas in order to reduce drought impacts on yield. Concurrently, and due to increasing
    water scarcity, many efforts have been devoted to the development of appropriate
    irrigation strategies (e.g. deficit irrigation, partial root drying) that improve
    the productivity of water use while ensuring berry quality (Chaves et al., 2010,
    Cifré et al., 2005, Dry et al., 2001, Medrano et al., 2003). Therefore, monitoring
    the extent of water stress, both under irrigated and rain-fed conditions, might
    be a valuable tool for the optimisation of grape yield and quality. There is ample
    literature on the effects of water deficits on vegetative and reproductive growth
    and yield in grapevines (Chaves et al., 2010, Choné et al., 2001a, Matthews and
    Anderson, 1989, Medrano et al., 2003, Schultz and Matthews, 1988, Van Leeuwen
    and Seguin, 1994). Moreover, it has been recognized that the water supply to the
    vines and their concurrent water status are the factors most comprehensively determining
    berry ripening and composition and, thus, wine quality (Chaves et al., 2010, Choné
    et al., 2001a, Koundouras et al., 2006, Matthews and Anderson, 1988, Medrano et
    al., 2003, Seguin, 1983, Van Leeuwen and Seguin, 1994). In grapevines, as well
    as in other fruit crops, fruit quality benefits from a certain level of water
    deficit which facilitates to balance vegetative and reproductive growth and the
    flow of carbohydrates to reproductive structures. Since this balance relies on
    mechanisms that regulate carbon assimilation and partitioning, physiological indicators
    of grapevine water status has been proposed as better indicators for an effective
    crop management (Chaves et al., 2010, Cifré et al., 2005, Jones et al., 2002).
    Several physiological indicators are used to assess plant water status, or stress,
    with leaf water potential, stomatal conductance and transpiration being the most
    widely used in viticulture. Leaf water potential is a standard indicator of plant
    water status, but predawn and stem water potential are considered better indicators
    in vines (Choné et al., 2001b). Stomatal closure is one of the first responses
    of leaves to reduced soil water availability (Chaves et al., 2010, Flexas et al.,
    2002, Jones et al., 2002, Lovisolo et al., 2010). In grapevines, stomatal regulation
    is a complex phenomenon involving chemical (hormones), hydraulic (cavitation)
    and even electrical signals (Lovisolo et al., 2010). Indeed, grapevines were among
    the first plant species in which a direct role of ABA in stomatal closure was
    reported (Loveys and Kriedemann, 1974, Lovisolo et al., 2002). Grapevine stomata
    also strongly respond to plant water status: positive correlations between predawn
    water potential and gs have been generally found in grapevines subjected to water
    deficits (Correia et al., 1995). In addition, grapevines subjected to severe water
    stress have shown decreased hydraulic conductivity (Lovisolo et al., 2002, Schultz
    and Matthews, 1988) mainly as a result of drought-induced cavitation (Lovisolo
    et al., 2008, Schultz, 2003). Thus, it appears that stomatal conductance might
    be a good indicator of water status in grapevines (Cifré et al., 2005, Jones et
    al., 2002). While a decrease in stomatal conductance is a short term response
    to reduced water availability, reduced vegetative growth occurs under long standing
    water deficits (Chaves et al., 2010). In grapevine, shoot growth has been reported
    to decrease in response to water deficits (Dry and Loveys, 1999, Matthews et al.,
    1987, Pellegrino et al., 2005, Schultz and Matthews, 1988) and, in particular,
    decreases in leaf area and intercepted light have been used as indicators of grapevine
    water status (Pellegrino et al., 2005). Moreover, vineyard leaf area influences
    fruit ripening rate, fruit characteristics and, thus, wine quality (Downey et
    al., 2004, Smart et al., 1982). Therefore, measures of vine canopy structure might
    be used to estimate differences in berry yield and quality brought about by variation
    in water availability. The use of airborne remote sensing as a means of monitoring
    vine canopy characteristics is attracting interest because of opportunities for
    cost-effective generation of spatial data amenable to precision agriculture activities
    (Hall et al., 2002). According to the physiological and growth responses of grapevine
    to water deficits mentioned above, there are currently two types of remote sensing
    approaches that might assist in grapevine water stress detection, one based on
    radiometric surface temperature detection derived from thermal band imagery and
    a second approach that relies on the ability of indices derived from surface reflectance
    data to assess plant water status or their effects on growth. Current remote sensing
    methods in precision viticulture use multispectral airborne sensors to detect
    changes in grapevine canopy vigour through the use of vegetation indices derived
    from reflectance in the red and near-infrared regions of the spectrum (Hall et
    al., 2002, Johnson et al., 2001, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2005). In particular, the
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), have proven useful to estimate
    vineyard leaf area index (m2 leaf area per m2 of ground) and leaf area per vine
    (m2 per vine) (Dobrowski et al., 2002, Johnson, 2003). These data, in conjunction
    with spatial determinations of yield, have been used to assist as management support
    for selective harvesting (Hall et al., 2002, Johnson et al., 2001, Lamb et al.,
    2004). Thus, so far, remote sensing techniques have been mainly used to target
    harvesting strategies according to canopy structure (vegetative growth). Reflectance
    indices such as the NDVI or the simple ratio (SR), are useful for characterizing
    canopy structure and pigment concentration, and, thus, potential photosynthetic
    activity, but have proven less useful for monitoring photosynthetic functioning
    under stress conditions (Gamon et al., 1995, Gamon et al., 1997). Thus, these
    indices have proven less useful for monitoring plant physiological status (e.g.
    photosynthesis and/or water status) under stress conditions. Leaf or canopy temperature
    is highly dependent on the rate of transpiration and can therefore be used as
    an indicator of stomatal opening. Several studies have assessed the potential
    of monitoring canopy temperature using thermal infrared radiation to assist in
    crop water stress detection (Berni et al., 2009, Jackson et al., 1981). In vineyards,
    this technique has been widely studied and developed mainly at ground level using
    thermal cameras: Jones et al. (2002) and Grant et al. (2007) have shown reasonable
    estimations of whole canopy gs based on thermometric determinations. At larger
    scales, Möller et al. (2007) have recently showed improved accuracy in estimates
    of vine water status and stomatal conductance by combining thermal and visible
    imagery. Besides the thermal region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the near
    and short wave infrared region present several water absorption features that
    might be useful for the detection of plant water status. The longer wavelengths,
    such as the 1450 and 1900 nm water absorption bands, make poor indicators for
    estimating plant water content due to the low incoming solar energy and high levels
    of interference by atmospheric water vapour (Sims and Gamon, 2003). Several studies
    suggest that the ideal wavelengths for predicting water content are wavelengths
    with weak absorption coefficients that allow the radiation to penetrate far into
    canopies, providing a suitable dynamic range (Peñuelas et al., 1993, Serrano et
    al., 2000, Sims and Gamon, 2003). In particular, the Water Index (WI) (Peñuelas
    et al., 1993, Peñuelas et al., 1997) derived from the near infrared water absorption
    band centered at 970 nm (WI = R900/R970) has been tested at the leaf, canopy and
    landscape levels. At the leaf level, the WI was reported to closely track changes
    in leaf water content and gs during drought (Peñuelas et al., 1993, Peñuelas et
    al., 1997). Subsequently, Serrano et al. (2000) and Sims and Gamon (2003) showed
    the usefulness of the WI to track variation in relative water content (RWC) at
    the canopy and landscape scales using airborne sensors. Moreover, recent studies
    have documented good relationships between the WI and water fluxes at the canopy/landscape
    level in Mediterranean vegetation (Claudio et al., 2006, Fuentes et al., 2006).
    The feasibility of the WI to assess water status in grapevines has not yet been
    fully addressed. Cifré et al. (2005) suggested that, because the development of
    the 970 nm signal entails substantial variation in water content (Peñuelas et
    al., 1993), its use for water stress assessment in near-isohydric grapevine cultivars,
    capable of maintaining RWC within narrow ranges, might be not suitable. Indeed,
    in irrigated vineyards, Rodríguez-Pérez et al. (2007) did not find consistent
    relationships between the WI and stem water potential or equivalent water thickness
    (ratio of mass of water to leaf area) at the canopy level. Nonetheless, in the
    Mediterranean arc, rain-fed vineyards usually experience periods of moderate to
    severe water stress and, thus, the use of the WI might be of potential interest.
    Moreover, because the WI has been reported to respond to both changes in water
    content and vegetation structure (Serrano et al., 2000) its use under rain-fed
    conditions might be of potential interest since, as mentioned above, water deficits
    affect both water status and canopy structure (vegetative growth). Thus, we tested
    the ability of the near infrared based WI derived from reflectance spectra to
    determine vine water status at the leaf and canopy levels. The study was conducted
    on potted plants and in commercial vineyards over two consecutive years under
    varying soil water availability. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Leaf level study
    The study was conducted on two-year-old plants Vitis vinifera L. cv. Chardonnay
    grafted on R-110. Plants were planted in mid March in 10 L pots with a mixture
    of sand and peat turf (1:1, V:V) and placed in a greenhouse. During the growing
    period, minimum and maximum temperatures within the greenhouse were 18.3 °C and
    27.7 °C, respectively, and relative humidity varied between 86% and 20%. Plants
    were daily irrigated at field capacity with tap water. Additionally, twice a week
    all potted plants received 0.3 L of a full Hoagland solution (Hoagland and Arnon,
    1950) to promote growth. Lateral shoots, buds, and young flowers were removed,
    leaving only winter buds and leaves. On May 15, irrigation treatments were initiated
    by applying different amounts of water per plant and day: irrigation was provided
    twice a day during 10 min using 4 L h−1 (control plants) 2 L h−1 (deficit plants)
    drippers (i.e. approximately 1300 and 650 ml per plant and day). There were 6
    plants per treatment. Measurements were carried out two months after initiating
    the irrigation treatments when plants were about 1.2 m high. Three plants per
    treatment were placed outside the greenhouse and diurnal cycles of gas exchange
    and reflectance measurements were carried out on July 7. Predawn water potential
    (Ψp) was determined using a Scholander pressure chamber (Soilmoisture 3005, Soil
    Moisture Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA) on 3 leaves (1 leaf plant−1) similar to
    those where gas exchange and leaf reflectance were determined. Six fully expanded
    leaves (2 leaves per plant; 6 leaves per treatment) were measured approximately
    every 2 h under current ambient photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), air
    temperature (Tair) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) conditions. Leaves had a
    similar appearance although different orientations (light exposure). Net CO2 assimilation
    rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E) and leaf temperature (Tleaf),
    as well as environmental conditions (PPFD, Tair and VPD), were measured with a
    portable gas exchange system CIRAS-2 (PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA, USA) at
    a CO2 concentration in the cuvette of 360 ppm. Afterwards, leaf reflectance was
    determined using a spectroradiometer UNISPEC (PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA,
    USA) with a 2.3 mm diameter bifurcated fibre optic (model UNI410, PP Systems,
    Havervill, MA, USA). The detector samples 256 bands at roughly even intervals
    (average band-to-band spacing 3.3 nm) within a 400–1100 nm effective spectral
    range. The Water Index was derived from reflectance measurements as: (1) where,
    R indicates spectral reflectance and subindices are the respective wavelengths
    in nanometres. Above ground biomass and leaf area were determined on each plant
    at the end of the experiment (i.e., after conducting the diurnal cycles). Analyses
    of variance were carried out using the statistical package SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,
    Chicago, IL, USA). Water availability (control or deficit) and time of day were
    considered as sources of variation. Means were compared using the Bonferroni''s
    test and correlation and regression analyses were used to study the relationships
    among several variables. 2.2. Field canopy study A field study was conducted during
    two consecutive years (2007–2008) in ten commercial vineyards in the D.O. Penedès
    region (Catalonia, Spain, 1°48′22″W; 41°28′54″N). The region has a Mediterranean
    climate with average annual temperatures ranging from 11 to 15 °C, average annual
    precipitation ranging from 600 to 900 mm. In the last ten year series (1998–2007)
    cumulative rainfall and evapotranspiration were 431 mm and 900 mm, respectively.
    Weather data during the study period were obtained in a nearby weather station
    located at Hostalets de Pierola (1°48′31″W; 41°31′59″N). The study was conducted
    on V. vinifera L. cv. Chardonnay plants of K5V1 clone. Vines were trained to Double
    Royat. Vine age and rootstocks differed among vineyards (see Table 1). Plantation
    density ranged from 2083 to 3704 vines ha−1 with variable vine spacing between
    and within rows. The main characteristics of the vineyards are reported in Table
    1. In each plot, 3 vines with contrasting vigour were chosen to carry out measurements
    at the stage of veraison, when vines attained full canopy expansion. Thus, measurements
    were carried out in 30 plants (3 per plot). Table 1. Characteristics of the vineyards

    water potential (Ψp) was determined between 3 h prior to sunrise using a Scholander
    pressure chamber (Soilmoisture 3005, Soil Moisture Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA).
    On each vine a Ψp measurement was taken from one mature non senescing leaf from
    the central third of the outer part of the canopy. Additionally, canopy temperature
    of field vines was determined at midday (solar noon) using a hand-held infrared
    thermometer (Scheduler, SN 870401 in 2007 and ST Pro Plus, Raytek Corp., Santa
    Cruz, CA, USA in 2008) positioned at 20 cm of the canopy and held at an angle
    of 60° so that the field of view was approximately 0.25 m2. Canopy temperature
    in 2008 was measured on both the sun exposed and the shaded side of each vine
    while in 2007 measurements of canopy temperature were taken on the sun exposed
    surface. Canopy radiance was measured over each vine using the spectroradiometer
    and the fibre optic previously described fitted with a 12° field of view foreoptics
    (UNI-710, PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA, USA). Measurements were expressed as
    apparent reflectance after standardizing by the irradiance determined using a
    cosine corrected detector lens (UNI-685 PP Systems Ltd., Havervill, MA, USA) positioned
    above the canopy. Data were collected on cloudless days between 11:00 h and 13:00
    h (i.e., solar noon) in order to minimize disturbances from the atmosphere and
    changes in solar elevation. The radiometer was mounted on a tripod and held in
    a nadir orientation 0.75 m above the canopy. Four scans were averaged for each
    vine. Besides the WI, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated
    using narrow-band reflectance values as follows: (2) where R indicates reflectance
    and the subindices indicate the wavelength in nm. Analyses of variance, correlation
    and regression were carried out using the statistical package SPSS 14.0 and SPSS
    17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Plots were considered as sources of variation
    in ANOVAs. Means were compared using the Bonferroni''s test and correlation and
    regression analyses were used to study the relationships among several variables.
    3. Results 3.1. Leaf level study There were no significant differences between
    treatments in Ψp, although Ψp was slightly higher in control (−0.37 ± 0.07 MPa;
    mean ± sem) than in deficit plants (−0.42 ± 0.09 MPa; mean ± sem). Similarly,
    there were no significant changes in above ground biomass in response to changes
    in water availability, although leaf area per plant was slightly (p < 0.10) higher
    in control than in deficit plants (data not shown). Environmental conditions during
    the diurnal cycle of measurements, particularly air temperature and water vapor
    pressure deficit, were typical of Mediterranean conditions (Fig. 1). Decrease
    in air temperature at midday was due to the effects of sea breeze, since the experiment
    was carried out in a coastal zone. On the other hand, the unusual temperature
    peaks experienced late in the afternoon were due to the rearrangement of plants
    on a sea-breeze sheltered location in order to avoid shade from a nearby building.
    Air vapour pressure deficits (VPD) reached high values at midday (3 kPa) and were
    even higher when plants were relocated to the wind-sheltered location (∼3.5 kPa).

    and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) on July 7, 2007 for the experiment on potted
    plants. Values are mean ± standard error of the mean (n = 6). There were large
    changes in incident photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) at the leaf surface
    along the day with significant decreases at the central hours of the day in deficit
    plants (Fig. 2A). Leaf incident PPFD was maximum at midday in control plants (1915
    ± 365 μmol m−2 s−1) while in stressed plants leaf incident PPFD reached its peak
    at midmorning (1666 ± 129 μmol m−2 s−1) and started to decline afterwards, indicating
    substantial changes in leaf angle. Leaf incident PPFD was ∼25% lower in deficit
    than in control plants from midday to the early afternoon. Thus, in deficit plants,
    leaves tended to reduce light interception during midday. As expected, diurnal
    patterns of net CO2 assimilation rate (A) followed changes in leaf incident PPFD
    (Fig. 2B). There was a significant variation (p < 0.01) in A along the day in
    both treatments. In control plants, A increased along the morning, reached its
    peak at midday (3.70 ± 0.375 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) and declined in the afternoon.
    Contrastingly, in deficit plants, A reached its peak at midmorning (3.32 ± 0.361
    μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) and started to decline afterwards which might be attributed
    to significant decreases in gs as well as to changes in leaf orientation, as indicated
    by decreases in PPFD. In addition, there were significant differences (p < 0.05)
    between treatments in A with higher values in control than in deficit plants at
    noon (Fig. 2B). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Diurnal time course

    in control (open symbols) and deficit (filled symbols) plants. Values are mean
    ± standard error of the mean (n = 6). Stomatal conductance (gs) showed significant
    variation along the day (p < 0.01) in both control and deficit plants (Fig. 2C).
    Moreover, there were significant differences (p < 0.01) in gs between treatments
    with higher values in control than in deficit plants (daily averaged gs values
    were 72.6 ± 8.51 and 55.2 ± 10.34 mol H2O m−2 s−1 for control and deficit plants,
    respectively). The leaf-to-air temperature difference (Tleaf − Tair) followed
    changes in gs and transpiration rate, so that decreases in gs were accompanied
    by increases in Tleaf − Tair (Fig. 2D). However, Tleaf − Tair, although varying
    significantly along the day (p < 0.001), did not show significant differences
    between treatments except at midday when Tleaf − Tair was significantly lower
    in deficit than in control plants (p < 0.01). Transpiration rate (E) showed a
    similar response to that of gs with significant variation along the day (p < 0.01)
    in both control and deficit plants (Fig. 2E). In addition there were significant
    differences between treatments (p < 0.01) in E with higher values in control than
    in deficit plants from midmorning to the early afternoon (Fig. 2E). On the other
    hand, the WI showed significant variation along the day (p < 0.01) as well as
    between treatments (p < 0.01). In both, control and deficit plants, WI increased
    along the diurnal time course (Fig. 2F). To further explore the feasibility of
    using reflectance indices to assess vine water status we conducted a series of
    correlation analyses using data averaged for each treatment and sampling time.
    We chose those data corresponding to measurements carried out from midmorning
    to early afternoon. At this time, photosynthetic activity was not light-limited
    (i.e. light saturated measurements) and we expected to detect larger differences
    between treatments in response to water availability. There was no significant
    correlation between Tleaf − Tair and gs when the whole data set was considered
    (Fig. 3A, continuous line). However, when a single data corresponding to midday
    values in control treatment (encircled in Fig. 3A) was disregarded, a close correlation
    was found between Tleaf − Tair and gs (Fig. 3A, dashed line). On the other hand,
    the WI was significantly correlated to gs although different relationships emerged
    for each treatment (Fig. 3B). Thus, decreases in gs were associated to increases
    in both WI and Tleaf − Tair. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Relationship

    correspond to measurements carried between 8:00 and 18:00 solar time. 3.2. Field
    canopy study Air temperatures over the study period (2007 and 2008) were within
    the last 10-year mean data while annual rainfall was higher than the last 10-year-mean
    precipitation (i.e., 439 mm) (Fig. 4). The pattern of rainfall events also differed
    for these two periods. In both years, rain conditions were characterized by a
    dry winter preceding each growth period. However, in 2007, spring rainfall was
    abundant and afterwards precipitation was reduced until late August when a heavy
    storm took place (125 mm). Thus, in 2007, cumulative rainfall was 548 mm close
    to the average last 10-year-mean precipitation (i.e., 439 mm) if the above mentioned
    summer storm were disregarded. In 2008, rains extended from spring to early summer
    and cumulative rainfall was more than twice the 10-year-average precipitation
    (i.e., 874 mm compared to 431 mm). Indeed, this was the first time for the registered
    data that cumulative rainfall was similar to the cumulative reference evapotranspiration.
    Thus, while 2007 was a typical dry year, 2008 was an exceptionally wet year. Download

    Data from Estació meteorològica dels Hostalets de Pierola. Coordinates UTM (x,y,z):
    400,630, 4,598,640, 312 a.s.l. Vine phenology was contrasted between the two studied
    years. Veraison (i.e., when field data collection took place) occurred from 16
    to 22 July in 2007 while in 2008 veraison commenced on 4 August and was completed
    on 11 August. There were significant differences in Ψp among vineyards (p < 0.01)
    and between years (p < 0.01). Average Ψp values were −0.88 ± 0.053 MPa (average
    ± SEM) and −0.69 ± 0.032 MPa (average ± SEM) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In
    2007, Ψp ranged from −0.40 ± 0.074 MPa to −1.36 ± 0.041 MPa among vineyards while
    in 2008 minimum and maximum Ψp were −0.917 ± 0.020 MPa and −0.450 MPa ± 0.035,
    respectively. Vine canopy development showed significant differences among vineyards
    (p < 0.01) within a year as well as between years (p < 0.01) as indicated by NDVI
    values. In 2007, NDVI values ranged from 0.771 ± 0.044 to 0.852 ± 0.048 among
    vineyards, and mean value was 0.806 ± 0.007 for all the studied plots. In 2008,
    NDVI values ranged from 0.793 ± 0.019 to 0.868 ± 0.022, and average NDVI was 0.835
    ± 0.006 for all the studied plots. In contrast WI values did not show significant
    differences between years. Average WI was 1.080 ± 0.005 and 1.070 ± 0.013 for
    years 2007 and 2008, respectively. However, there were significant differences
    (p < 0.001) in WI among vineyards. In 2007, WI values ranged from 1.03 ± 0.013
    to 1.11 ± 0.013 while in 2008 WI values ranged from 1.012 ± 0.008 to 1.146 ± 0.005.
    On the other hand, there were significant differences in ΔT among vineyards (p
    < 0.001) and between years (p < 0.001). Average ΔT values were 0.92 ± 0.449 and
    −2.17 ± 0.399 (average ± SEM) in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In 2007 ΔT ranged
    from −3.3 to 5.0 among vineyards while in 2008 ΔT ranged from −6.6 °C to 1.4 °C.
    Canopy development was closely related to water availability as indicated by the
    significant relationship between Ψp and NDVI with R2 = 0.64 and R2 = 0.48, for
    2007 and 2008, respectively. Moreover, there were no significant differences in
    the regression models when year was considered as a factor. Thus, a unique and
    highly significant relationship emerged when data from both years were pooled
    (r = 0.75, p < 0.001) (Fig. 5). In addition, when data from both years were pooled,
    ΔT was negatively related to Ψp (r = −0.37, p < 0.01), indicating that higher
    water potentials were translated into lower ΔT (i.e. higher transpiration) (data
    not shown). However, there was no significant relationship between Ψp and WI (data
    not shown). Nonetheless, within a year, there were significant relationships between
    WI and ΔT (p < 0.05). Thus, WI showed lower values on vines with higher ΔT with
    r = −0.67 (p < 0.05) and r = −0.75 (p < 0.05) for years 2007 and 2008, respectively

    = 3). 4. Discussion 4.1. Leaf level study The range of Ψp values encountered indicate
    that plants were under moderate to severe water stress (Carbonneau, 1998), and
    are similar to those reported in previous studies on potted plants subjected to
    moderate to severe water stress (Flexas et al., 1999) as well as under deficit
    irrigation programs in field studies conducted under Mediterranean environments
    (Grant et al., 2007, Patakas et al., 2005, Souza et al., 2005). In agreement with
    other studies conducted in potted plants (Medrano et al., 2002) different irrigation
    supply did not translate into significant differences in Ψp. Nonetheless, despite
    similar Ψp values in both treatments, deficit plants underwent earlier decreases
    in gas exchange parameters (A, gs and E) along the day when compared to control
    plants. A gradual decline in A from mid morning to evening has been previously
    described in V. vinifera and has been associated to a decline in stomatal conductance
    (Chaumont et al., 1994, Correia et al., 1990, Flexas et al., 1999). However, our
    vines showed low photosynthetic rates when compared with previous studies conducted
    on vines under similar water stress (Flexas et al., 1999). This might be attributed
    to the incidence of a virus infection in our plants and its resulting effects
    on photosynthesis. Indeed, several studies have reported decreases in photosynthetic
    performance as a result of a virus infection in grapevines (Pozsar et al., 1969,
    Sampol et al., 2003). In our study, leaves showed a slight chlorosis as well as
    a feathering of the leaf veins. Sampol et al. (2003) reported important reductions
    in chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in virus infected grapevines, albeit the
    primary light reactions were not identified as the main factor limiting photosynthesis.
    In our study, we did not determine pigment content but indirect estimates using
    reflectance based indices evidenced similar pigment composition in control and
    deficit plants (data not shown). In addition, Sampol et al. (2003) showed that,
    in virus infected grapevines, photosynthesis was primarily impaired by decreases
    in carboxylation and mesophyll conductance rather than to stomatal regulation.
    Although we cannot rule out the existence of a feedback control on stomatal behaviour
    resulting from these latter photosynthetic processes, we presume that, in our
    study, stomatal conductance was mainly affected by differences in water supply.
    Indeed, gs values were within the range reported for potted plants experiencing
    similar Ψp (Flexas et al., 1999, Flexas et al., 2009). Moreover, the results herein
    reported are consistent with those obtained with healthy potted plants cv. Cabernet
    Sauvignon in an analogous experiment (data not shown). Stomatal closure is among
    the first processes occurring in the leaves in response to drought. Tight stomatal
    closure occurs at relatively low soil water deficit in many grapevine cultivars,
    leading to a rapid reduction of gs as pre-dawn leaf water potential decreases
    (Chaves et al., 2010, Lovisolo et al., 2010, Schultz, 2003). Consistently, deficit
    plants had lower gs than control plants along the day. However, there were no
    differences in Tleaf − Tair between control and deficit plants, except at midday,
    despite higher E and gs in control plants. We did not have a plausible explanation
    for this response, but the decline in incident PPFD at the leaf surface (as a
    consequence of changes in leaf orientation) in deficit plants might have resulted
    in lower leaf temperatures. Indeed, if leaf movements occur after stomata close,
    they might contribute to leaf cooling, as intercepted radiation changes (Jones,
    2007). Alternatively, increased radiation load in control plants probably led
    to increases in leaf temperature (Gibberd et al., 2001). Thus, no significant
    relationship was found for control plants between gs and Tleaf − Tair. However,
    when midday data were disregarded a significant relationship (r2 = 0.52, p < 0.05)
    emerged for the whole data set. Differences in stomatal conductance between control
    and deficit plants were translated into differences in the reflectance based Water
    Index. Thus, at the leaf level, control plants showed along the day consistently
    higher WI values than deficit plants. This is consistent with previous studies
    that have shown that WI can be an indicator of gs at the leaf scale (Peñuelas
    et al., 1993). Moreover, decreases in gs were associated to increases in WI, although
    the relationship between WI and gs was found to be treatment dependent (control
    and deficit plants with similar gs had distinct values of WI) (Fig. 3). In a recent
    study conducted on citrus trees, Dzikiti et al. (2010) found that, at the leaf
    level, a water spectral index (calculated as the ratio of reflectance at 1070
    nm and 1340 nm) closely followed changes in crown water content resulting from
    variations in water supply and water loss (transpiration) determined using sap
    flow measurements. Apparently, the spectral features at the 970 nm centered water
    band might present a similar response (Dzikiti et al., 2010). Thus, in our study,
    increases in gs presumably led to a reduction in leaf water content as indicated
    by the negative relationship between WI and gs. A more detailed study on the dynamics
    of water recharge and depletion in relation to water content is needed in order
    to confirm this hypothesis. 4.2. Field canopy study Predawn water potential is
    commonly used as a reference method to determine vine water status (Choné et al.,
    2001b). Predawn plant water potential is thought to equilibrate with soil water
    potentials and, thus, it is an estimate of water availability. In the present
    study, predawn water potentials indicated that vines were under severe restriction
    in 2007 while in 2008 vines experienced moderate water stress (Carbonneau, 1998,
    Cifré et al., 2005) in agreement with the contrasted precipitation registered
    between both years. Moreover, Ψp values were in accordance with those obtained
    in other studies conducted in field studies under non-irrigated conditions (Koundouras
    et al., 2006, Pellegrino et al., 2004, Taylor et al., 2010). Thus, in our study
    under field conditions, water deficits were moderate to severe. In field grown
    vines, limited water availability affects vegetative growth (Dry and Loveys, 1999,
    Matthews et al., 1987, Pellegrino et al., 2005; among others). In agreement with
    these studies, water availability was a major determinant of vegetative growth
    in the vineyards studied as indicated by the close relationship between Ψp and
    NDVI. Indeed, previous studies have reported significant correlations between
    NDVI and canopy leaf area index (m2 leaf area per m2 of ground) and leaf area
    per vine (m2 per vine) over multiple vineyards using 4 m-resolution IKONOS satellite
    imagery (Dobrowski et al., 2002). Moreover, the Ψp vs. NDVI relationship was consistent
    across the study, so that a unique relationship emerged for the period of study.
    Thus, vegetative development was strongly determined by water availability and
    the vegetation index NDVI effectively characterized the effects of water availability
    on vine canopy growth. In agreement with previous studies (Rodríguez-Pérez et
    al., 2007) there was no significant relationship between Ψp and the WI. Nevertheless,
    it should be stressed that Ψp measures the leaf water status when transpiration
    stream is in equilibrium and transpiration is practically zero while WI values
    derived from reflectance at midday do not necessarily mirror this condition. Recently,
    Dzikiti et al. (2010) have shown that the WI was a good predictor of midday stem
    water potential in severely stressed citrus trees but failed to estimate midday
    stem water potential under mild or no drought stress. On the other hand, these
    latter authors reported close relationships between the WI and leaf water content
    on both non-stressed and stressed citrus trees. More accurate estimates of water
    content should be expected since water absorption features in spectral reflectance
    are determined by the amount of water (and leaf structural attributes) rather
    than by leaf water energy status (Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990). Even though predawn
    and stem water potential are common indicators of water stress in grapevines (Choné
    et al., 2001b), plant water content is also a drought stress indicator although
    it is rarely used in practice for irrigation management (Jones, 2004). Nonetheless,
    some techniques widely used in vineyard irrigation scheduling rely on monitoring
    properties that respond to variations in water content. Particularly, linear transducers
    of displacement and sap flow meters capable of continuously monitoring variation
    in gs have proven useful to estimate canopy transpiration and to schedule irrigation
    in grapevines (Ginestar et al., 1998, Yunusa et al., 2000). Besides these contact
    techniques that provide point observations, remote estimates of canopy temperature
    have proven useful in irrigation scheduling in grapevines (Cifré et al., 2005,
    Dry et al., 2001, Jones et al., 2002). We found that the WI was negatively related
    to midday ΔT, suggesting that vines with higher water content had presumably higher
    transpiration rates and, consequently, lower ΔT (Jones et al., 2002). Indeed,
    our results showed that the WI is a relatively dynamic index, that tracks variation
    in gs on a diurnal scale (i.e. within treatments in potted plants) and variation
    in transpiration rate resulting from contrasted water availability (i.e. in field
    grown plants). These results are in agreement with recent studies conducted in
    citrus trees (Dzikiti et al., 2010) and on chaparral vegetation (Claudio et al.,
    2006) that demonstrate the capability of the WI to track variations in water fluxes
    under severe stress. Thus, our study adds on these previous results showing that
    the WI effectively followed changes in water fluxes under a range of moderate
    to severe water stress. Nonetheless, in our study, different relationships emerged
    at the leaf level between treatments as well as at the canopy level on different
    years. Probably, in our field study, differences in instrument calibration and
    measurement conditions introduced some biases in our results. Moreover, differences
    in vegetative growth between campaigns might have resulted in different WI values
    since the water content of vegetation at the canopy and landscape level responds
    to both leaf area and relative water content (Serrano et al., 2000, Sims and Gamon,
    2003). A reason for the interest in thermal and reflectance techniques is the
    possibility of measuring it remotely, thus avoiding time consuming techniques
    used for detecting water stress and providing spatially representative information
    on plant water status. Our results showed that both WI and ΔT (i.e., the canopy
    to air temperature difference) were good indicators of stomatal regulation in
    grapevines. However, thermal sensing requires calibration since both environmental
    conditions and stomatal aperture affect canopy temperature (Jones, 2004). Nonetheless,
    recent studies conducted in vineyards have shown that calibration of thermal data
    using a reference surface might provide accurate estimates of gs (Grant et al.,
    2007, Möller et al., 2007). Moreover, recently, Berni et al. (2009) have developed
    a methodology that overcomes the necessity of thermal data calibration providing
    good estimates of canopy conductance in irrigated olive orchards. On the other
    hand, imagery in the reflective bands is more readily available than thermal band
    data, and generally at higher spatial resolution, which is a key issue to conduct
    successful applications in partially covered surfaces (Serrano et al., 2000, Suárez
    et al., 2010), like vineyards. Moreover, as indicated in other studies (Claudio
    et al., 2006, Dzikiti et al., 2010), the 970 nm water band might be detected with
    silicon photodiode sensors, which makes it a good choice in terms of cost, availability
    and portability when compared to thermal sensors. Thus, the results obtained suggest
    new and potential applications of the WI in the frame of precision viticulture.
    Our results proved to work on a range that expands from moderate to severe water
    stress, a common situation in field grown grapevines under Mediterranean conditions,
    including those managed under deficit irrigation programs (Grant et al., 2007,
    Patakas et al., 2005, Souza et al., 2005). Characterization of the dynamics of
    water supply and water loss in relation to variations in the WI might further
    assist on estimating the capability of the WI as a potential tool in irrigation
    scheduling. The capability of assessing water status in fruit crops is also of
    great interest in the context of precision agriculture. Water deficits affect
    both fruit yield and quality and, particularly, in non-irrigated vineyards water
    status has been recognized to influence grape quality and thereby wine attributes
    (Choné et al., 2001a, Koundouras et al., 2006, Van Leeuwen and Seguin, 1994).
    Recent studies have proven the capability of remote sensing techniques for monitoring
    water stress and their effects on yield and fruit quality using thermal and reflectance
    imagery in olive orchards (Sepulcre-Cantó et al., 2007, Suárez et al., 2010).
    Therefore, the capability of the reflectance based WI to monitor drought stress
    might be of great significance in the context of precision viticulture as a potential
    tool to target harvesting strategies according to grape quality attributes as
    well as for ripening assessment. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, our results showed
    that vines submitted to contrasted irrigation treatments showed significant differences
    in stomatal conductance and Water Index. Moreover, within a treatment, changes
    in stomatal conductance were closely mirrored by changes in WI. In field grown
    vines differences in water availability between years and among vineyards were
    translated into differences in canopy development as indicated by the close relationship
    between predawn water potential and NDVI. In addition, the WI was closely related
    to the midday canopy to air temperature difference, indicating that the WI effectively
    tracked variation in stomatal conductance within a range of moderate to severe
    water stress. More studies are needed to confirm the usefulness of the WI, prior
    to its extension as a common, practical tool, for vineyard water status assessment.
    The results obtained might be of great relevance in estimating the effects of
    water availability on grape yield and quality and might assist in irrigation scheduling.

  key_findings: '1. WI tracked changes in stomatal conductance at the leaf and canopy
    levels.

    2. WI closely followed diurnal changes in stomatal conductance at the leaf level.

    3. Leaf-to-air temperature difference was inversely related to gs, although the
    relationship was treatment dependent (r2 = 0.81 and r2 = 0.95, for control and
    deficit plants, respectively).

    4. WI was inversely correlated with canopy to air temperature difference in field-grown
    vines.'
  key_insights: '- WI effectively tracked variation in both leaf stomatal conductance
    and canopy transpiration under a range of moderate to severe water stress.

    - WI relates to the midday canopy to air temperature difference in field-grown
    vines.

    - WI tracks variation in canopy transpiration under moderate to severe water stress.

    - WI is a good indicator of water status in grapevines and could be a useful tool
    for monitoring vineyard water status in precision viticulture.'
  limitations: '1. Different relationships emerged between WI and gs when testing
    at the leaf level and canopy level

    2. Authors did not determine pigment content'
  main_objective: To test the ability of the near infrared based WI derived from reflectance
    spectra to determine vine water status at the leaf and canopy levels.

  explanation: This study assesses the relevance of using hyperspectral passive reflectance
    sensing and thermal imaging to non-invasively estimate the water status and grain
    yield of wheat at three irrigation regimes. Hyperspectral passive sensors measure
    the canopy reflectance with a passive bidirectional reflectance sensor, and thermal
    imaging cameras measure the temperature of the plant canopy, which can estimate
    the water status of plants based on the cooling effect of transpiration. The combination
    of data from these two sensors, along with information about canopy water content,
    relative water content, and grain yield, can improve yield models of different
    irrigation regimes.

    Highlights • Thermal index NRCT successfully estimates water status and grain
    yield in wheat. • Thermal imaging and passive reflectance sensing to assess water
    stress in wheat. • Models of PLSR analysis improved prediction of grain yield
    of wheat. Abstract The water demand for agricultural purposes is steadily increasing.
    The use of contactless sensing techniques, such as passive reflectance sensors
    and thermal imaging cameras, is therefore becoming imperative and will be one
    of the major adaptation strategies to control the irrigation schedule under arid
    and semi-arid conditions. In this study, the performance of hyperspectral passive
    reflectance sensing and infrared thermal imaging was tested to assess their relationship
    with the water status and grain yield (GY) of wheat cultivars via simple linear
    regression and partial least square regression (PLSR) analyses. The models included
    data of the (i) normalized relative canopy temperature (NRCT); (ii) PLSR based
    on selected spectral indices; (iii) data fusion model of PLSR based on selected
    spectral indices and the NRCT; and (iv) data fusion model of PLSR based on selected
    spectral indices, NRCT, relative water content (RWC), and canopy water content
    (CWC). The experimental treatments involved two wheat cultivars (Gmiza 11 and
    Sods 1) and three water regimes (irrigated with 100%, 75%, and 50% of estimated
    crop evapotranspiration). The results show that the NRCT was closely and significantly
    associated with RWC, CWC, and GY, with R2 = 0.84, 0.87 and 0.81, respectively.
    The data fusion model of PLSR based on selected spectral indices, NRCT, RWC, and
    CWC improved the yield prediction under three irrigation regimes (R2 = 0.97, slope
    = 0.99, root-mean-square error = 26.48 g/m2). In conclusion, improvements can
    be made in the yield prediction when traits that are physiologically related in
    different ways to the yield are combined with non-destructive data. Previous article

    reflectanceWater stress 1. Introduction The water shortage in arid and semi-arid
    regions worsens due to abrupt climatic changes and excessive water consumption
    in the agricultural sector using the available water supply (El-Hendawy et al.,
    2015). Therefore, the use of contactless sensing techniques, such as passive reflectance
    sensors and thermal imaging cameras, is becoming imperative and will be one of
    the major adaptation strategies to control the irrigation schedule under arid
    and semi-arid conditions. Traditional methods, such as pressure chambers or oven-drying,
    for the assessment of the water stress of plants by estimating their water status
    are time-consuming. In the field, frequent changes of environmental conditions
    might further influence the measurements; thus, fast measurements are needed (Peñuelas
    et al., 1997, Elsayed et al., 2011, Winterhalter et al., 2011). Therefore, it
    is very important to develop high-throughput sensing methods for the assessment
    of water stress in crops, which should be reliable, fast, simple, practical, and
    economic. The early detection of water stress factors, such as the canopy water
    content (CWC) and relative water content (RWC), which were measured in this study
    with remote sensing methods, is crucial because it could help to identify the
    water stress status on larger temporal and spatial scales before any damage is
    clearly visible. Thermal imaging is an important technique to detect the water
    stress based on the plant temperature. With the ability to point and shoot high-quality
    thermal images (Jerbi et al., 2015), it is possible to measure the temperature
    of plants in large-scale water regimes. Thermography allows the simultaneous monitoring
    of large groups of leaves, providing an overview of stomatal conductance variation
    and dynamics (Zia et al., 2011). It measures infrared radiation and uses it for
    the calculation of the spatial distribution of the temperature of the plant canopy.
    The use of plant temperature to assess the water stress depends on stomatal closure
    during plant water deficits, which leads to a decrease of the energy dissipation
    and an increase in plant temperature (Idso et al., 1981, Patel et al., 2001).
    The plant temperature reflects the combined effects of the soil moisture content
    and atmospheric conditions on the crop water status, which ultimately affects
    the grain yield (GY) of cultivars. Idso et al. (1981) developed a crop water stress
    index (CWSI) based on thermal measurements that ranges between zero (full transpiration)
    and one (minimum stomatal conductance). The CWSI is the most commonly used index
    to quantify the water stress based on the canopy temperature. In addition to the
    CWSI, it is also important the Ig (the conductance index or the Jones Index (Jones,
    1999)). It is a helpful tool to quantify the water stress and can be used for
    irrigation scheduling. The newly developed normalized relative canopy temperature
    (NRCT) index similar to the CWSI, which has been developed by Elsayed et al. (2015b),
    was tested in this study. The NRCT was calculated depending on the actual infrared
    temperature measured in the canopy, the lowest temperature measured in the whole
    field trial (lower baseline), and the highest temperature in the whole field trial
    (Tmax, upper baseline). The advantage of this index is that no additional measurements
    other than that of infrared temperatures are necessary compared with the CWS Jackson
    et al. (1981) used a wet bulb temperature as the lower baseline and a dry bulb
    temperature as the upper baseline to calculate the CWSI based on the air temperature
    and air vapor pressure deficit, whereas canopy measurements were used in this
    experiment. The NRCT allows the interpretation of the temperature measurements
    as reductions in the stomatal conductance and the comparison of water stress levels
    in different field trials under different environmental conditions. The NRCT has
    only been used by Elsayed et al. (2015b) as an indicator for drought-stressed
    barley cultivars and the ability of the spectral reflectance to assess the NRCT
    of drought-stressed barley cultivars. In this study, the NRCT was used to assess
    and predict the water status and GY of wheat cultivars in different irrigation
    regimes. Spectral reflectance measurements with passive sensors have been used
    to assess the canopy water status, aerial biomass, dry biomass, nitrogen status,
    and GY. Passive sensor systems depend on sunlight as a source of light. Several
    studies suggested that the water status and GY could be estimated using the vegetation
    spectral reflectance during different growth stages (Schmidhalter et al., 2001,
    El-Shikha et al., 2007, Gutierrez et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2016); for example,
    the normalized water stress indices 1 [NWI-1; (R970–R900)/(R970 + R900)], 2 [NWI-2;
    (R970–R850)/(R970 + R850)], 3 [NWI-3; (R970–R920)/(R970 + R920)], and 4 [NWI-4;
    (R970–R880)/(R970 + R880)] from passive reflectance sensor measurements demonstrated
    a great potential in differentiating high- and low-yielding genotypes in advanced
    lines of spring wheat under well-irrigated, water-stressed, and high-temperature
    conditions in diverse trials (Gutierrez et al., 2010). Lobos et al. (2014) found
    that the normalized NWI-3 and the normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI;
    (R830–R660)/(R830 + R660)] were most closely related to the GY and the water status
    of wheat genotypes subjected to drought stress. El-Shikha et al. (2007) reported
    that the water index (WI) can explain variations in the plant water content of
    broccoli plants in different water regimes. Few studies developed sophisticated
    statistical approaches to link data gathered from sensors with agronomic or physiological
    traits. Thus, yield-model approaches are typically based on single spectral indices
    (Gutierrez-Rodriguez et al., 2004). Both linear and multiple linear regression
    models can also be derived from spectral indices. Royo et al. (2003) found that
    17.3% to 65.2% of durum wheat yield could be accounted for using multiple linear
    regression models based on varying spectral indices. An alternative approach is
    to use partial least square regression (PLSR), which was used in this study. Orthogonal
    components are unaffected by collinearity in PLSR and are derived from all variables.
    Rischbeck et al. (2016) reported that the combination of several spectral reflectance
    indices that were based on the differential reflectance of the canopy in the spectral
    range of 350–1000 nm with CWSI data and plant height of barley cultivars in PLSR
    models improved the prediction of the GY. The PLSR models of the hyperspectral
    reflectance have been used in maize (Zea mays L.) at anthesis and during the milk-grain
    stage by Weber et al. (2012). The models successfully explained between 49% and
    69% of the variation in the GY in the calibration model and 23% to 40% after model
    validation. The use of hyperspectral data has also been employed in yield models
    of PLSRs (Sharabian et al., 2014). The data that can be obtained from passive
    reflectance sensors is limited to the interactions of light with plants or soil
    material. The transpiration is not directly related to the spectral reflectance
    but related to the canopy temperature (Rischbeck et al., 2016). Therefore, sensors
    using other physical principles might add information to spectral assessments.
    Therefore, statistical data fusion of sensor measurements (thermal image camera
    and passive reflectance sensor) in PLSR models was used and tested in this study
    to improve yield models in different irrigation regimes at the flowering growth
    stage in two years. The use of the information from passive sensors, the thermal
    image camera, and information about the water status might also increase the flexibility
    of the yield prediction in different irrigation regimes. Thus, the statistical
    data fusion of sensor measurements, CWC, and RWC in PLSR models was used and tested
    to improve yield models. The purpose of this work was: (i) to compare the performance
    of the thermal image camera by using the NRCT index and selected spectral reflectance
    indices for the assessment of the water status and GY of wheat cultivars in three
    irrigation regimes, (ii) to evaluate two models (NRCT and PLSR models based on
    five spectral indices) to predict the water status and GY, and (iii) to assess
    the improvement of the yield prediction using the data fusion model of PLSR based
    on the NRCT and five spectral indices and to assess the improvement of the yield
    prediction using the data fusion model of PLSR based on the NRCT, five spectral
    indices, CWC, and RWC. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Field experiments and design
    Field experiments were carried out at the Research Station of the University of
    Sadat City in Egypt during 2014–2015 and 2015–2016. The research station of the
    University of Sadat City (Latitude: N30°2′ 41.185″, Longitude: E31°14′ 8.1625″)
    is characterized by a semi-arid climate with moderate cold winters and warm summers.
    The experimental treatments consisted of two wheat cultivars (Gmiza 11 and Sods
    1) and three water regimes [T1, irrigated with 100% of the estimated crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc); T2, irrigated with 75% ETc; and T3, irrigated with 50% of ETc]. The field
    experiments were designed as a randomized complete block split plot design with
    six replicates. The three water regimes were assigned to the main plots, while
    the two wheat cultivars were distributed randomly in subplots. All treatments
    received the recommended dose of superphosphate (15.5% P2O5) at a rate of 476
    kg ha−1 and potassium sulfate (48% K2O) at a rate of 119 kg ha−1. The two wheat
    cultivars were sown on November 10, 2014 and November 8, 2015 in sandy loam soil
    containing 69.8% sand, 22.3% silt, and 7.9% clay. The soil of the experimental
    site has a water field capacity of 0.192 m3 m−3, wilting point of 0.106 m3 m−3,
    and bulk density of 1.45 g cm−3. The soil is characterized by an electrical conductivity
    of 0.95 dS m−1, organic matter content of 0.36%, and calcium carbonate content
    of 5%. The experiment included 36 plots; each plot was 3 m long and 2 m wide.
    The plots consisted of 14 rows spaced 15 cm apart. A drip irrigation system was
    used with four lines per plot and the distance between each nozzle was 30 cm.
    The nozzle had a discharge rate of 4 L h−1. The two water regimes, 75% and 50%
    of ETc, were started at the stem elongation growth stage (BBCH 32) until harvest.
    2.2. Irrigation water requirement The food and agriculture organization (FAO)
    Penman–Monteith method (Allen et al., 1998) was used to calculate the reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) with the CROPWAT Program. The crop water requirements
    (ETc) of the growing season were determined using the following equation: (1)
    where ETc is the crop water requirement, Kc is the crop coefficient, and ETo is
    the reference evapotranspiration. The values of Kc suggested by FAO-56 were adjusted
    to adapt them to the studied area. The FAO Penman–Monteith equation was used to
    calculate the ETo according to Eq. (1). (2) where: Eto: reference evapotranspiration
    [mm day−1], Rn: net radiation at the crop surface [MJ m−2 day−1], G: soil heat
    flux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T: air temperature at 2-m height [°C], u2: wind speed
    at 2-m height [m s−1], es: saturation vapor pressure [kPa], ea: actual vapor pressure
    [kPa], es − ea: saturation vapor pressure deficit [kPa], Δ: slope of vapor pressure
    curve [kPa °C−1], g: psychrometric constant [kPa °C−1]. The CROPWAT model calculates
    the daily amount and daily deficit due to applying irrigation water and determines
    the next irrigation. The total amount of irrigation water applied (from sowing
    to harvest) during the studied seasons was 470, 377, and 285 mm in the first year
    and 490, 380, and 290 mm in the second year for T1, T2, and T3, respectively.
    2.3. Field measurements 2.3.1. Thermal measurements Thermal images of the plots
    were obtained with a handheld infrared thermal camera Ti-32 (Fluke Thermography,
    Germany) equipped with a 320 × 240-pixel microbolometer sensor. This thermal sensor
    has a spectral response in the range of 7.5–13 μm. The images were analyzed using
    Ti-32 Pro software (Infrared Solutions). The emissivity for the measurements of
    leaves and plant canopies was set to 0.96, while the transmission correction was
    85% (Bayoumi et al., 2015). The thermal camera was manually used, approximately
    0.8 m above canopy height. Thermal images were taken nadir from the middle of
    each plot under clear sky conditions. The images could then be analyzed to determine
    either average temperatures or the frequency distribution of the temperatures
    for each treatment (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    100% ETc, (b) 75% Etc, and (c) 50% Etc. 2.3.2. Spectral reflectance measurements
    A passive bidirectional reflectance sensor (HandySpec Field®, tec5, Oberursel,
    Germany) measuring wavelengths between 302 nm and 1148 nm, with a bandwidth of
    2 nm and connected to a portable computer and geographical positioning system
    (GPS), was used. The handheld FieldSpec sensor consists of two units. One unit
    was linked to a diffuser and measured the light radiation as a reference signal.
    The second unit measured the canopy reflectance with a fiber optic (Elsayed et
    al., 2015; Rischbeck et al., 2016) with an aperture of 12° and a field of view
    of 0.2 m2 from a height of 1 m. The aperture of an optical system is the opening
    that determines the cone angle of a bundle of rays that enters the optics. The
    sensor outputs were co-recorded with the GPS coordinates when collecting information
    in the field. The actual sensor output was co-referenced and recorded for each
    position. Subsequently, the readings within one plot were averaged to a single
    value per plot. The canopy reflectance was calculated with the readings from the
    spectrometer unit and corrected with a calibration factor obtained from a grey
    reference standard. The spectral measurements were mostly carried out on sunny
    days in nadir direction approximately one meter above the canopy. The readings
    were performed during the flowering growth stage (BBCH 74–76) on March 5, 2015,
    and March 7, 2016. 2.4. Plant traits 2.4.1. Relative water content and canopy
    water content measurements The relative water content (RWC) and canopy water content
    (CWC) were determined to describe the water status of two wheat cultivars under
    the three water regimes. For RWC, the cut leaves were weighed (leaf fresh weight,
    LFW) and stored with the leaf base in water for four hours for saturation. Subsequently,
    their turgid weight (LTW) was calculated. The samples were then dried in an oven
    at 65 °C until the leaf dry weight (LDW) was constant and weighed again (dry weight,
    DW). The RWC was determined as the average obtained from three fully expanded
    leaves for each plot. The RWC (%) was calculated according to Eq. (3): (3) RWC
    (in%) = (LFW − LDW)/(LTW − LDW) In addition, biomass sampling of plants was performed.
    To determine the CWC, 0.25 m2 were harvested from each plot and weighed. Thereafter,
    samples of biomass fresh weight (BFW) were placed in an oven (65° C) until there
    was no change in the biomass dry weight (BDW). The CWC percentage was calculated
    according to Eq. (4). (4) CWC (in%) = (BFW − BDW)/BFW 2.4.2. Grain yield The plots
    were harvested by hand on April 25, 2015, and April 22, 2016. The total GY of
    each plot was weighed, the samples were oven-dried to determine the grain water
    content on a gravimetric basis, and the yield normalized to a water content of
    14% was expressed as g m−2. The plot yields were averaged for each cultivar and
    each treatment. 2.4.3. The normalized relative canopy temperature The NRCT was
    calculated based on Eq. (5) (Elsayed et al., 2015): (5) NRCT = (T − Tmin)/(Tmax
    − Tmin), where T is the actual infrared temperature measured in the canopy, and
    Tmin (lower baseline) and Tmax (upper baseline) are, respectively, the lowest
    and the highest temperature measured in the whole field trial. 2.5. Statistical
    analysis 2.5.1. Selection of spectral reflectance indices In this study, both
    known and novel spectral reflectance indices were calculated and tested. Five
    spectral indices from different sources were listed with their equations in Table
    1. A contour map analysis for all wavelengths of the spectral passive sensor (from
    302 to 1148 nm) was used to select the novel normalized difference indices. The
    selected indices generally presented more stable and strong relationships with
    CWC, RWC, and GY of the wheat cultivars. All possible dual wavelength combinations
    were evaluated depending on the contour map analysis for the spectral passive
    sensor. Contour maps are matrices of the coefficients of determination of all
    variable measurements with all possible combinations of binary, normalized spectral
    indices. The “lattice” package from the software R statistics version 3.0.2 (R
    foundation for statistical computing, 2013) was used to produce the contour maps
    for the spectral reflectance readings; six wavelengths (880, 900, 910, 920, 970,
    and 992 nm) were therefore used to calculate the reflectance indices given in
    Table 1. Table 1. Description of the spectral reflectance indices examined in

    plant traits All data of this study were analyzed using Sigmaplot for Windows
    v.12 (Systat Software Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and SPSS 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
    IL, USA). Simple linear regressions were performed to investigate the relationships
    of spectral reflectance indices and the NRCT with RWC, CWC, and GY of the two
    wheat cultivars. The coefficients of determination and significance levels were
    determined; nominal alpha values and 0.001 were used. The validation approach
    using fully independent data was used. The models were calibrated using dataset
    of 36 data of the NRCT or PLSR models of the 1st year and were validated using
    dataset of 36 data 2nd year to predict the measured parameters. The PLSR creates
    orthogonal latent variables across the input variables and relates them to the
    target variables. This is a way to cope with redundancy of the input variables.
    The PLSR searches sensitive information of the input variables of each sensor.
    Two data fusion models of PLSR based on the NRCT and five spectral indices or
    based on the NRCT, five spectral indices, CWC, and RWC were used to improve the
    yield prediction of the two wheat cultivars. The quality of the validation models
    is presented through adjusted coefficients of determination, the slope and intercept
    of the linear regressions, and root-mean-squares errors (RMSEs) between the observed
    and predicted values. 3. Results and discussion The use of proximal remote sensing,
    such as thermal imaing and passive reflectance sensing, is particularly and practically
    suitable to assess the water status and implement appropriate management strategies
    because it presents unique advantages of repeatability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness
    over the ground-based surveys for water stress detection (El-Shikha et al., 2007,
    Zia et al., 2011). The improved irrigation management or agronomical traits by
    selecting tolerant genotypes of wheat are important to enhance the wheat performance
    during periods of drought stress and to conserve water. The determination of the
    water status and GY in response to different levels of water irrigation conditions
    is beneficial for site-specific wheat irrigation management, particularly for
    locations that show a large spatial and temporal variability of drought symptoms.
    Different models based on the NRCT and spectral indices were established in this
    study to assess and predict RWC, CWC, and GY. The spectral data that can be obtained
    from passive reflectance sensors are limited to the interactions of light with
    plants or soil material. The transpiration is not directly related to the spectral
    reflectance but related to the canopy temperature (Rischbeck et al., 2016). Therefore,
    the statistical data fusion of sensor measurements (thermal image camera and passive
    reflectance sensor) with plant traits was used and tested to improve the yield
    models of different irrigation regimes. 3.1. Influence of three irrigation regimes
    on the water status, grain yield, NRCT, and selected normalized spectral indices
    of wheat The assessment of plant water status provides information about the actual
    water stress level under water regimes or drought conditions. Measuring CWC and
    RWC is a well-proven, direct indicator of the plant water status (Chaves et al.,
    2003, Becker and Schmidhalter, 2017, Elsayed and Darwish, 2017). In this study,
    different irrigation levels led to varying degrees of plant water stress. These
    conditions were reflected in an extended range of the plant trait measurements.
    In the first and second year, the water status, grain yield, NRCT, and five normalized
    spectral indices were greatly affected by different irrigation regimes. Water
    regimes level led to a statistically significant impairment of all measured parameters
    of the wheat plants during both experimental years. A significant decrease in
    CWC, RWC and GY as well as a significant increase in NRCT and the spectral indices
    was observed compared with the control plants (Table 2). Generally, the highest
    mean values of all plant trait measurements were recorded at an ETc of 100% in
    two wheat cultivars; the lowest values of all plant trait measurements were recorded
    at an ETc of 50% (Table 2). The mean values for the first year ranged from 59%
    to 78% for RWC, from 66% to 77% for CWC, and from 520 g/m2 to 773.31 g/m2 for
    GY. These results agree with those of Bijanzadeh and Emam (2012) who reported
    that the GY of five wheat cultivars decreased in four water regimes (125% to 50%
    of field capacity) from 773.8 g/m2 to 401.2 g/m2. During wheat development, the
    water stress significantly reduced RWC values from 88% to 45% (Siddique et al.,
    2000). Gutierrez et al. (2010) found that the RWC values decreased when the drought
    stress levels of the wheat genotypes increased. These results also agree with
    Winterhalter et al. (2011) who reported that the water content of maize cultivars
    decreased more under drought stress at different growth stages compared with the
    plant water content under irrigation. Table 2. Minimum, maximum, and mean values

    The NRCT and five normalized spectral indices of two wheat cultivars increased
    with increasing water stress levels. For example, the mean values for the second
    year ranged from 0.42 to 0.73 for the NRCT and from −0.049 to −0.030 for the spectral
    index [(R970–R900)/(R970 + R900); Table 2]. The NRCT reacts to the cooling effect
    of the canopy transpiration similar to the CWSI. The direct impact of the plant
    water stress leads to reduced water uptake by roots, decreasing water status,
    and increased surface temperature and thus to an increase of the NRCT values.
    These results agree with Elsayed et al. (2015b) who reported that the NRCT values
    of barley cultivars increased with increasing plant water stress levels from mild
    to severe stress. Four of the five normalized spectral indices in this study react
    sensitively to changes in the water status. The spectral band at 970 nm is sensitive
    to the water status of the crop according to Peñuelas et al. (1997). These results
    agree with Gutierrez et al. (2010) who reported the following values: NWI-1, (R970–R900)/(R970
    + R900); NWI-2, (R970–R850)/(R970 + R850); NWI-3, (R970–R920)/(R970 + R920); and
    NWI-4, (R970–R880)/(R970 + R880) of the advanced lines of spring wheat cultivars
    were lowest under good irrigation compared with water-stressed conditions. 3.2.
    The relationship between the normalized relative canopy temperature, the water
    status and grain yield of two wheat cultivars A second approach for estimating
    the water status or grain yield of the wheat cultivars is based on the measurement
    of leaf temperature and calculating the newly developed index (NRCT). Measurements
    obtained using near infrared-sensors provide information on plant transpiration
    as the main contributor to reduce leaf temperature (Monneveux et al., 2012). This
    assumption was supported by significant negative relations between RWC, CWC and
    the NRCT (Fig. 2. and Table 3). Specifically, a low RWC and CWC indicate a reduced
    transpiration rate as a water-saving strategy, which results in higher leaf temperatures.
    A lower transpiration rate leads to warmer leaves and lower stomatal conductance;
    both of these factors decrease net photosynthesis and crop duration (Monneveux
    et al., 2012, Becker and Schmidhalter, 2017, Elsayed and Darwish, 2017). Fig.
    2 shows linear regression models of the newly developed index (NRCT) with RWC,
    CWC and GY of the two wheat cultivars. The results demonstrate that the NRCT is
    significantly related with the water status and grain yield for each cultivar,
    the individual year, and across all measurements for two years (R2 ≥ 0.76; p ≤
    0.001). The highest coefficient of determination could be observed between the
    NRCT and CWC of the second cultivar in the first year (R2 = 0.97; p ≤ 0.001).
    Although the NRCT is strongly related to the RWC, CWC, and GY of each cultivar,
    their relationships were affected by the measurement year (Fig. 2). This is likely
    due to changes in the environmental conditions. The NRCT indicates relative differences
    in the RWC, CWC, and GY under plant water stress levels. These results agree with
    Elsayed et al. (2015b) who found that the NRCT has a significant relationship
    with the GY of 16 barley cultivars under mild and severe stress conditions. Our
    results are also in agreement with Jiang et al. (2009) who reported that the canopy
    and ambient temperature differentials are negatively correlated with the leaf
    RWC of six cultivars of perennial ryegrass (r = −0.77 to −0.78). Download : Download

    a number of studies, the canopy temperature was found to be negatively related
    to the GY under either well-watered (Reynolds et al., 1998) or drought-stressed
    conditions (Saint Pierre et al., 2010). The results suggest that thermal sensing
    using the NRCT can be effectively utilized to quickly check the water status and
    GY of plants under different irrigation regimes. Thus, stress in plants can be
    detected before visible symptoms and GY loss occur. 3.3. Contour map analysis
    of the spectral reflectance data A contour map presenting a larger range of indices
    with similar wavelengths contains information relevant for the RWC, CWC, and GY.
    The contour map analysis provided the mean coefficients of determination (R2)
    of the measurement data for all dual wavelength combinations as a normalized difference
    spectral index. The contours of the matrices of the spectral passive sensor presented
    stronger relationships between the plant trait measurements, such as RWC, CWC,
    and GY, of the wheat cultivars with near-infrared wavelengths and the combination
    of visible and near-infrared wavelengths than visible wavelengths alone. The contour
    map analysis of the relationship between the normalized difference spectral indices
    with (a) CWC and (b) GY in the first year and (c) RWC in the second year of the
    two wheat cultivars are shown in Fig. 3. The averages of the correlation matrices
    resulting from the measurements, indicated by the coefficients of determination
    (R2) for all dual wavelengths combinations from 750 nm to 1000 nm as normalized
    difference indices for all plant trait measurements across two wheat cultivars,
    presented higher R2-values compared to all other two wavelength combinations (Fig.
    3). The reason for that is that the wavelengths from 850 nm to 100 nm are more
    affected by the water status and biomass of the plant. These findings agree with
    the results of Gutierrez et al. (2010) who reported that the dual near-infrared
    wavelength combinations as a normalized difference spectral index from 880 nm
    to 970 nm were strongly influenced by the water status of the plant such as the
    RWC and LWP of wheat cultivars. The spectral reflectance in the 680–730 nm range
    correlates with the leaf area index (Townsend et al., 2003). Therefore, wheat
    cultivars subjected to different irrigation levels create a significant variation
    in the spectral reflectance measurements from 750 nm to 1000 nm. Download : Download

    dual wavelength combinations in the 302–1148-nm range (as normalized difference

    content (CWC) and (b) grain yield (GY) in the first year and (c) relative water
    content (RWC) in the second year across two wheat cultivars. 3.4. Relationship
    between normalized difference spectral indices with the water status and grain
    yield The selected spectral indices were closely related to RWC, CWC, and GY for
    each cultivar, season and across two wheat cultivars (Table 4, Table 5; Fig. 4).
    Four of the five normalized difference spectral indices are based on the hypothesis
    that the near-infrared wavelengths (970 nm) penetrate deeper into the canopy of
    the plant and therefore accurately estimate the water content. The water indices
    exhibited highly significant relationships with the RWC, CWC and GY of the two
    wheat cultivars. The NIR-based water indices compare the energy absorbed by water
    at 970 nm and different reference wavelengths of 880, 900, 910 and 920 nm, which
    do not indicate absorption by water (Penuelas et al., 1997; Prasad et al., 2007
    Prasad et al., 2007) and therefore are especially suited to detect the plant water
    status. In addition to the four water-based indices, the NI 992_900 exhibited
    a good relationship with the RWC, CWC and GY of the two wheat cultivars. The association
    between the normalized water indices and GY indicates that the CWC plays a vital
    role in estimating the GY of wheat (Babar et al., 2006, Prasad et al., 2007).

    Black dot refers to cultivar1 and white dot refers to cultivar2. ***Statistically
    significant at p ≤ 0.001. The obtained coefficients of determination (R2) are
    shown in Table 4, Table 5 and Fig. 4. The statistically significant relationships
    between the selected spectral reflectance indices derived from the near-infrared
    region varied (R2 = 0.51 p ≤ 0.01 to 0.86; p ≤ 001) for RWC, CWC, and GY of the
    wheat cultivars. Generally, the normalized spectral index of (R970–R900)/(R970
    + R900) showed the highest coefficients of determination for the measured parameters
    across the measurements. The results demonstrate that the selected five spectral
    reflectance indices were useful in estimating the GY during the flowering growth
    stage. These results are in agreement with Lobos et al. (2014) who reported that
    the NWI-3 [(R970–R920)/(R970 + R920)] and NDVI [(R830–R660)/(R830 + R660)] present
    good relationships (R2 = 0.66 and 0.62, respectively; p ≤ 0.001) with the GY of
    the wheat cultivars under drought stress conditions. Gutierrez et al. (2010) found
    that the NWI-1 [(R970–R900)/(R970 + R900)] and NWI-3 [(R970–R920)/(R970 + R920)]
    of a spectral passive sensor showed significant relationships with the yield of
    wheat genotypes under drought stress. Closer relationships between three water
    stress indices (NWI-1, NWI-3, and NWI-4) and GY were obtained for the spectral
    passive sensor (Elsayed et al., 2015). Additionally, the five water indices (WI,
    NWI-1 to 4) consistently exhibited higher correlations with grain yield under
    drought conditions compared to the widely used indices (NDVI, R760/R730, R730/R760,
    etc) of wheat cultivars (Becker and Schmidhalter, 2017). As well as the genotypic
    variability in GY was better explained by spectral reflectance indices belonging
    to either the categories of normalized water (e.g., NWI3; 970, 920) or normalized
    difference moisture (e.g., NDMI2; 2200, 1100) indices which clearly performed
    better than vegetation indices such as the NDVI or indices related to the photosynthetic
    efficiency like PRI (Lobos et al., 2014). Moreover, the results demonstrate that
    the selected five spectral reflectance indices were useful in estimating the RWC
    and CWC. These results are in agreement with Zhang and Zhou (2015) found that
    WI (R900/R970) and NDWI [(R860–R1240)/(R860 + R1240)] of the CWC and RWC significantly
    correlate with the CWC of maize with R2 = 0.70 and 0.77, respectively (p ≤ 0.001).
    Elsayed and Darwish (2017) reported that spectral water indices (NWI-1, NWI-3,
    and NWI-4) showed close and highly significant associations with the canopy water
    content (CWC) and canopy water mass (CWM) under full irrigation, full irrigation
    with salinity levels, and the interaction between full irrigation with salinity
    levels and water stress treatments and coefficients of determination reached up
    to R2 = 0.73 (p ≤ 0.001). 3.5. Modeling of the water status and grain yield 3.5.1.
    Linear models to predict the relative water content, canopy water content, and
    grain yield of wheat cultivars The NRCT models as well as the PLSRs models using
    the five spectral indices were established to predict the RWC, CWC, and GY of
    two wheat cultivars (Fig. 5). Two models were calibrated based on the NRCT data
    or the PLSRs using the five spectral indices data of the first year of the two
    wheat cultivars. The PLSR technique allowed the identification of optimized models
    and is considered to be the state-of-the art technique enabling a high efficiency
    in searching for optimized relationships. Simple linear, polynomial, or exponential
    functions are used to model the relationship between the biophysical parameters
    and vegetation indices (Elsayed et al., 2015b, Rischbeck et al., 2016). The advantage
    of PLSR models is that the PLSR in this study used information from five spectral
    indices and selected the number of factors that best represent the calibration
    data without overfitting. The PLSR had no limitation in predicting the measured
    parameters and the relationship between the observed and predicted values was
    linear. Download : Download high-res image (795KB) Download : Download full-size

    least square regressions using spectral index models between the observed and
    predicted values of RWC, CWC, and GY of two wheat cultivars. The two models were
    calibrated depending on the NRCT data of the first year of two wheat cultivars
    to predict (a) RWC, (b) CWC, and (c) GY or partial least square regressions using
    five spectral indices to predict (d) RWC, (e) CWC, and (f) GY. The calibration
    functions were validated with independent data measured in the second year. The
    coefficients of determination (R2) and function of these linear validations between
    the observed and predicted values of all parameters are shown in the figures.
    ***Statistically significant at p ≤ 0.001. The two models were calibrated using
    a dataset of 36 samples obtained from one year for two cultivars, and were validated
    using a set of 36 samples from a different year. The calibration functions were
    validated with independent data measured in the second year. The coefficients
    of determination (R2) and function of these linear validations between the observed
    and predicted values of all parameters are shown in Fig. 5. The quality of the
    two models is represented in Fig. 5 by the adjusted coefficients of determination,
    the slope of the linear regressions between observed and predicted values, and
    RMSEs. The coefficient of determination of the NRCT model of RWC was 0.84 (p ≤
    0.001); the slope of the linear regressions was 0.96; and RMSE was 0.21%. For
    the PLSR based on the five spectral indices model for the GY, the coefficients
    of determination was 0.66 (p ≤ 0.001); the slope of the linear regressions was
    1.15 and the RMSE was 166.07 g/m2. The results show that the two models were useful
    in estimating the destructively measured parameters during the flowering stage.
    The NRCT has the highest coefficients of determination for all measured parameters,
    but the PLSR based on the five spectral indices data showed the lowest RMSE for
    CWC and GY. The use of the five spectral indices for the PLSR analysis increased
    the accuracy of the estimates of CWC and GY across the two wheat cultivars. These
    results agree with Sharabian et al. (2014) who reported that strong relationships
    exist between the predicted and observed values for a validation GY dataset (R2
    = 0.87, RMSE = 301) and SPAD values (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 1.94). Li et al. (2014)
    found that PLSR is a potentially useful method to derive the nitrogen content
    of winter wheat through growth stages compared with the spectral indices; the
    average R2 value for the PLSR model increased to 76.8% and 75.5% in the calibration
    and validation datasets, respectively. Elsayed et al. (2015a) reported that the
    PLSR models could improve the assessment of pod yield in peanut cultivars compared
    with the spectral reflectance indices collected from other studies. 3.6. Improvement
    in the yield prediction by using two PLSR data fusion models Two PLSR data fusion
    models based on the NRCT and five spectral indices or based on the NRCT, five
    spectral indices, CWC, and RWC were tested to evaluate the yield of two wheat
    cultivars (Fig. 6). The two models were calibrated using the dataset from the
    first year of the two wheat cultivars. The calibration functions were validated
    with the independent dataset from the second year. For the PLSR model based on
    the NRCT and five spectral indices to predict the GY, the coefficient of determination
    was 0.87 (p ≤ 0.001), the slope of the linear regression was 0.61, and the RMSE
    was 104.31 g/m2. For the PLSR model based on the NRCT, five spectral indices,
    CWC, and RWC, the coefficient of determination was 0.97 (p ≤ 0.001), the slope
    of the linear regression was 0.99, and the RMSE was 26.48 g/m2. Download : Download

    (PLSRs) using five spectral indices and NRCT and (b) PLSRs using the five spectral

    two wheat cultivars. The two models were calibrated depending on the PLSRs using
    five spectral indices and the NRCT or PLSRs using the five spectral indices, NRCT,
    RWC, and CWC of the first year of the two wheat cultivars. The calibration functions
    were validated with independent data measured in the second year. The coefficients
    of determination (R2) and function of these linear validations between the observed
    and predicted values of all parameters are shown in the figures. ***Statistically
    significant at p ≤ 0.001. The results demonstrate that the two models (Fig. 6)
    are useful to estimate the GY across two wheat cultivars. The PLSR model based
    on the NRCT, five spectral indices, CWC, and RWC increased the accuracy of the
    estimates of the GY across two cultivars (Fig. 6b) compared with the use of the
    other three models (Figs. 5 and 6 a). To the best of our knowledge, the data fusion
    from different sensors adopted in the yield model and prediction of field trials
    has only been used by Rischbeck et al. (2016). They reported that the data fusion
    models of spectral reflectance and thermal and distance information provided a
    better yield prediction of barley cultivars compared with models based on spectral
    data only. The data combination of different sources with spectral data, such
    as thermal data influenced by plant transpiration, CWC correlated with the biomass
    presenting the effect of water stress over long time, and RWC indicating the effect
    of water stress over short time, enables a broadly adapted yield model. Rischbeck
    et al. (2016) reported that additional improvements can be made under mild and
    severe drought stress for several barley cultivars when the traits that are physiologically
    and in different ways related to the yield are combined. 3.7. Benefits and practical
    implications of these results The use of remote or proximal sensing such as passive
    reflectance and thermal sensing may help to develop low-cost, efficient high throughput
    phenotyping platforms which allow to collect data at low cost on many phenotypes
    of large numbers of breeding individuals at different water regimes. In recent
    years unmanned aerial vehicles have been equipped with spectrometers (Agüera Vega
    et al., 2015) and stereo camera systems used for distance measurements (Honkavaara
    et al., 2013) for applications in precision agriculture. Combined PLSR models
    using NRCT and spectral information may allow optimizing site-specific wheat irrigation
    management, particularly for locations that show a large spatial and temporal
    variability of drought symptoms. Fusing data from different sources could be used
    for combining relevant spectral bands and non-spectral data based on empirical
    evaluations and identification of the physiological importance of the selected
    traits for yield. Data fusion can improve the quality and robustness of yield
    predictions compared to models that are only based on spectral data as shown by
    Sharabian et al. (2014) and Hansen and Schjoerring (2003). 4. Conclusions It can
    be concluded that the RWC, CWC, and GY of the wheat cultivars can reliably be
    detected using the NRCT and NWI in different irrigation regimes. The data fusion
    of two PLSR models based on five spectral indices and the NRCT and PLSR based
    on the five spectral indices, NRCT, RWC, and CWC improved the prediction of the
    GY of wheat cultivars as compared to the NRCT and PLSR models solely based on
    five spectral indices. Acknowledgments The authors acknowledge the financial support

    www.nature.com/scientificreports\nDiscrimination of plant root \nzone water status\
    \ in greenhouse \nproduction based on phenotyping \nand machine learning techniques\n\
    Doudou Guo, Jiaxiang Juan, Liying Chang, Jingjin Zhang   & Danfeng Huang\nPlant-based\
    \ sensing on water stress can provide sensitive and direct reference for precision\
    \ irrigation \nsystem in greenhouse. However, plant information acquisition, interpretation,\
    \ and systematical \napplication remain insufficient. This study developed a discrimination\
    \ method for plant root zone water \nstatus in greenhouse by integrating phenotyping\
    \ and machine learning techniques. Pakchoi plants were \nused and treated by three\
    \ root zone moisture levels, 40%, 60%, and 80% relative water content. Three \n\
    classification models, Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector\
    \ Machine (SVM) \nwere developed and validated in different scenarios with overall\
    \ accuracy over 90% for all. SVM model \nhad the highest value, but it required\
    \ the longest training time. All models had accuracy over 85% in all \nscenarios,\
    \ and more stable performance was observed in RF model. Simplified SVM model developed\
    \ \nby the top five most contributing traits had the largest accuracy reduction\
    \ as 29.5%, while simplified RF \nand NN model still maintained approximately\
    \ 80%. For real case application, factors such as operation \ncost, precision\
    \ requirement, and system reaction time should be synthetically considered in\
    \ model \nselection. Our work shows it is promising to discriminate plant root\
    \ zone water status by implementing \nphenotyping and machine learning techniques\
    \ for precision irrigation management.\nOver the past decade, the environmental\
    \ information based methods for precision management have been widely \napplied\
    \ in greenhouse practice. The ambient climate of greenhouse such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, and root zone \nwater content is monitored closely as the reference\
    \ for crop management1. Water and fertilizer are the most \nimportant inputs for\
    \ greenhouse crop because the plant growth is significantly affected by plant\
    \ water and nutri-\ntion status. Root zone water status has a significant influence\
    \ on plant evapotranspiration rate2. Root zone water \nstatus indicates the moisture\
    \ situation of plant root growth environment and highly correlates to plant growing\
    \ \nstatus3. Monitoring of root zone water status could help to establish the\
    \ precision management strategy on irriga-\ntion in crop production. However,\
    \ conventional probe sensors for moisture measurement are limited on detecting\
    \ \nthe actual substrate water status effectively in trays. Several commercialized\
    \ soil moisture sensors such as tensi-\nometer, neutron probes and time domain\
    \ reflectometry probes have been widely used in pot planting but not \napplicable\
    \ for seedlings mainly because the high costs, unsuitable size, and unreliable\
    \ measurements. The volume \nof cell in plug tray is minimal resulting that common\
    \ probe sensors can hardly insert into substrates. In addition, \ndue to the uneven\
    \ water distribution among different plug trays, the growers require continuous\
    \ and real-time \nwater content monitoring for large -scale rather than for single\
    \ point, to prevent the seedlings from water stress \nand growth restriction.\
    \ The relationship between plug tray weight and root zone water content was studied\
    \ to \nprovide a weighting based irrigation control strategy4. However, irrigation\
    \ based on tray weight is labor intensive \nand inaccuracy in practice.\nWith\
    \ the development of sensing technology, real-time monitoring of physiological\
    \ and ecological informa-\ntion of the plant itself provides an approach to indicate\
    \ root zone water status5, 6. Plant physiological traits such \nas tissue water\
    \ status, stomatal conductance, and sap flow are known sensitively responding\
    \ to water stress. The \nstatus of plant water content could be a useful indicator\
    \ for irrigation7. Phenotypic traits such as leaf area, leaf \nangle, and thermal\
    \ temperature show strong correlations with the root zone water status8. However,\

    \ irrigation methods are still at research/developing stage and little used yet\
    \ for practice (except for \nthermal sensing in some situations). Systematical\
    \ research on phenotypic traits selection for irrigation has seldom \nbeen reported.\n\
    Rapid and non-destructive plant sensing method is needed for plant-based information\
    \ acquisition. The \napplication of machine vision technology could be the solution.\
    \ Plant phenotypic traits can be quickly and effi-\nciently obtained by imaging-based\
    \ automatic inspection and analysis5. Therefore, machine vision has the poten-\n\
    tial to realize the rapid, reliable, real-time monitoring of plant status with\
    \ low cost, which meets the requirements \nfor precision irrigation scheduling9.\
    \ Machine vision technology has been applied in plant monitoring such as the \n\
    detection of plant abiotic stress through color variation, plant movement monitoring,\
    \ textural features detection, \ncanopy temperature measurement and detection\
    \ of plant biotic disease8, 10–13. With the development of pheno-\ntyping technology,\
    \ various imaging sensors have been used to collect phenotypic parameters which\
    \ are related \nto plant stress in automated or semi-automated high-throughput\
    \ plant phenotyping platforms14, 15. However, \ndata generated by these platforms\
    \ has enormous volume, variety, velocity, and veracity, which must be efficiently\
    \ \nanalyzed. The classical statistical method is difficult to analyze the high-dimensional\
    \ and dynamical image data, \nresulting limited phenotyping interpretation16.\n\
    Machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence has good performance in efficiently\
    \ dealing with large \namount of data in various domains. It is promising in phenotyping\
    \ applications on features extraction and pat-\nterns identification from large\
    \ dataset through holistic approaches. Machine learning algorithm has few input\
    \ \nfactors with high predict accuracy and strong adaptability. Several machine\
    \ learning algorithms, such as support \nvector machine (SVM), artificial neural\
    \ network (ANN) and random forest (RF), have been used for classification \nmodel\
    \ development17, 18.\nIn practice, machine learning method has been applied to\
    \ remote sensing system and irrigation system19, 20. \nMany studies have reported\
    \ plant stress phenotyping using machine learning in identification, classification,\
    \ \nquantification, and prediction of plant water status, but few focused on phenotyping\
    \ root zone water stress10, 21, 22. \nIt is crucial to detect plant water stress\
    \ at the early stage before any damage observed with visible wilting, which \n\
    affect subsequent plant growth and quality. Correlating root zone water status\
    \ with plant phenotype to supervise \nirrigation system could be a practical way\
    \ in precision irrigation system with easy operation and quick response.\nPakchoi\
    \ (Brassica campestris ssp. L. chinensis) is one of typical vegetables in greenhouse\
    \ production, which is \nsensitive to water status. During the past few years,\
    \ commercial production of leafy vegetable has been initiated \nand developed\
    \ both in the greenhouse (solar plant factory) and artificial light plant factory23.\
    \ Growing baby pak-\nchoi with plug trays using substrate in greenhouse is a promising\
    \ production mode because it is suitable for mech-\nanized harvesting and precision\
    \ management, which improves the production efficiency24. The accurate irrigation\
    \ \nscheduling is critical for safe and high quality of greenhouse vegetable,\
    \ as well as improving the resource utiliza-\ntion and production profits. This\
    \ study aims to discriminate plant root zone water status nondestructively, taking\
    \ \npakchoi as the plant material, which is a part of on-going research on developing\
    \ machine vision-based precision \nirrigation system for factory production of\
    \ pakchoi. The objectives of this study are: (1) investigating the rela-\ntionship\
    \ between root zone water status and plant growth; (2) developing a root zone\
    \ water status discrimination \nmodel by applying phenotyping technology and machine\
    \ learning algorithms; (3) evaluating the performance of \ndeveloped models in\
    \ various application scenarios.\nResults and Discussion\nThe effect of root zone\
    \ water status on plant growth. \nThe effect of root zone water status on pakchoi\
    \ \nplant growth was investigated under three relative water content treatments,\
    \ 40% (low), 60% (medium), and \n80% (high). The fresh and dry weight of shoot\
    \ and root for both cultivars were significantly different between \ntreatments\
    \ as shown in Fig. 1 with ANOVA test (p < 0.01). Treatments had different effects\
    \ between cultivars. For \ncultivar “Huawang”, treatment of medium water content\
    \ had the highest values of fresh and dry weight of shoot \nand root (fresh weight\
    \ as 2727.1 mg and 184.4 mg for shoot and root respectively, and dry weight as\
    \ 185.1 mg and \n15.1 mg per plant for shoot and root respectively), while cultivar\
    \ “Kangre 605” had the lowest values under such \ntreatment (fresh weight as 500.3\
    \ mg and 52.0 mg for shoot and root respectively, and dry weight as 45.3 mg and\
    \ \n5.1 mg per plant for shoot and root respectively). The differences of pakchoi\
    \ growth were significant between two \ncultivars under the treatment of medium\
    \ water content (p < 0.01 for all comparisons), but there were no signifi-\ncant\
    \ differences observed between cultivars under the other two treatments. This\
    \ is mainly because “Kangre 605” \nis a heat-resistant cultivar, which has the\
    \ ability of growing well under water stress conditions. “Huawang” prefers \n\
    moderate water condition, and both the excess and deficiency of water supply could\
    \ affect the accumulation of \nbiomass.\nRelationship between root-zone water\
    \ status and phenotypic traits. \nPhenotypic traits extrac-\ntion. Two types of\
    \ images were acquired, visible and near-infrared (NIR) image (Supplementary Fig. S1).\
    \ There \nwere in total 37 phenotypic traits extracted from images for each plant\
    \ (Table 1). These phenotypic traits were \nclassified into three categories for\
    \ easy description, morphological trait, color trait, and NIR trait, including\
    \ 19, 6, \nand 12 traits respectively. Morphological traits mainly indicated the\
    \ shape feature of target plant region, such as \ncircumference and eccentricity.\
    \ Color traits were generated from color images, including the pixel value informa-\n\
    tion of R (red), G (green), and B (blue) components. NIR traits were the pixel\
    \ intensity information of different \nranges in NIR images.\nWater related phenotypic\
    \ traits selection. \nIn order to increase the efficiency of model development,\
    \ \ntraits selection is necessary to identify redundant traits which are irrelevant\
    \ to root zone water status. The signif-\nicance of 37 extracted phenotypic traits\
    \ on classifying root zone water status were investigated by using ANOVA \n(Fig. 2).\
    \ For better illustration, the p value was transformed into -log10 (p). There\
    \ were five traits with p > 0.05 \nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nSCienTifiC\
    \ RePORts | 7: 8303  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-08235-z\n(i.e. -log10 (p) < 1.301)\
    \ including Normsmallpax, Circumference, Roundness, Bdrycount and Bdrytoarearatio\
    \ \n(numbered as 14, 23, 26, 28, and 29 in Table 1 respectively). Therefore, the\
    \ five traits were excluded from the data-\nsets in the following modeling process.\n\
    Root zone water status discrimination model development and validation. \nModeling\
    \ potentiality \nassessment. The Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis\
    \ (PLS-DA) was conducted to present a visual \nspace distribution of three treatment\
    \ groups for assessing the modeling potentiality using the 32 selected phe-\n\
    notypic traits. Figure 3 shows the PLS-DA model performance and cumulative variance\
    \ explained by the top \nfive components. The goodness of fit was quantified by\
    \ R2 while the predictive ability was indicated by Q2. The \naccuracy, R2, and\
    \ Q2 of PLS-DA model by using all the top five components reached 73%, 0.35, and\
    \ 0.34, respec-\ntively. The value of R2 and Q2 should be greater than 0.5 to\
    \ be taken as an indicator of model acceptability. The \ncumulative explained\
    \ variance ranged from 17.6% to 72.2% by the number of components from one to\
    \ five, with \nthe first three components explaining 66.9% variance. The performance\
    \ of PLS-DA model improved (R2 = 0.67, \nQ2 = 0.66) by excluding the medium root\
    \ zone water group as the difference between medium water group and \nthe other\
    \ two groups was not significant. Overall, PLS-DA shows the potential of root\
    \ zone water status discrim-\nination by phenotypic traits.\nDiscrimination model\
    \ development. The total dataset used for model development was 2120 samples with\
    \ 32 \ntraits of each (2120*32), and the dataset was separated into 80% training\
    \ dataset and 20% testing dataset. The \ntraining data set was used for model\
    \ development. Parameter values for the three modeling algorithms, which are \n\
    Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were\
    \ selected by using 10-fold \ncross validation in three repetitions tuning (Table 2).\
    \ Among the training dataset, 10% of the data were used as \nvalidation in each\
    \ cross validation. Table 2 also lists the package, function, and program training\
    \ time of modeling \nalgorithms. All the R codes ran in Rstudio 1.0.44 on the\
    \ platform of windows 10 × 64 system with an Intel Core \ni7-5500U CPU and 4 GB\
    \ RAM.\nConsidering the dynamics of the data input and training in practice, the\
    \ model training time is an important \nfactor to be considered in the optimization\
    \ process. The training time increases exponentially with the number \nof parameters\
    \ and varies substantially between algorithms. Among these three modeling algorithms,\
    \ NN took \nthe shortest training time as 544.37 seconds, which was approximately\
    \ 76% of RF and 44% of SVM. The training \ntime consumption of SVM should be considered\
    \ in real case of decision support system as this method is more \nsensitive to\
    \ the data size than others, especially when time is limited and data set is large.\
    \ The trait contribution \nanalysis in each model could be a way to simplify the\
    \ model inputs and reduce the training time, which was dis-\ncussed in section\
    \ 3.3.\nThe mean prediction accuracy and Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (k) of all\
    \ the three models were higher than 90% \nand 0.85 respectively, as shown in Fig. 4A,B.\
    \ SVM model had the best performance with higher accuracy and k \nvalue (92.5%\
    \ and 0.89 respectively) than the other two models. The result also showed that\
    \ SVM was slightly more \nstable with less variation than others.\nThe ROC (receiver\
    \ operating characteristic) curve was used to evaluate the performance of modeling\
    \ classi-\nfier. Figure 4C shows the ROC curves of the three models. The x-axis\
    \ represents false positive rate (FPR), and the \ny-axis represents true positive\
    \ rate (TPR). The area under the curve (AUC) indicates classification performance,\
    \ \nwhich is the ability of target model to correctly classify the plants in different\
    \ root zone water status. SVM model \nhad the highest AUC value as 0.6827 among\
    \ the three models, while the differences were not substantial com-\npared to\
    \ 0.6766 and 0.6788 AUC of RF model and NN model respectively.\nFigure 1. Effects\

    \ Confusion matrix was implemented to validate the three developed models \nwith\
    \ 2120*32 dataset. The prediction accuracy of each model from cross validation\
    \ is the sum of the predic-\ntion accuracy on the diagonal in each sub-table of\
    \ Table 3. All the developed models had good prediction accu-\nracy higher than\
    \ 90%. SVM model had the highest prediction accuracy as 92.5%, but no substantial\
    \ difference \nobserved on accuracy among the three models (91.3% and 91.4% for\
    \ RF model and NN model respectively).\nCompared to the other two treatments,\
    \ the medium root zone water group had the highest percentage of false \npositive\
    \ (4.0%, 3.4%, 3.8% for RF, NN, and SVM model) and false negative (3.2%, 2.9%\
    \ and 3.2% RF, NN, and \nSVM model) among the three models. It could be explained\
    \ as that medium level is adjacent to both high and low \nlevel, which is less\
    \ distinguishable comparing to the other two levels.\nModel evaluation under different\
    \ conditions. To investigate the robustness and applicability of the three models\
    \ \nin different conditions, the test dataset was reorganized into different scenarios,\
    \ different time of a day, growth \nstage (stage 1 to stage 5), weather condition\
    \ (sunny and cloudy), and cultivar (“Huawang” and “Kangre 605”). \nThe dataset\
    \ used for each growth was 120*32, the dataset used for each time in day was 240\

    \ 1060*32. All the datasets were separated into 80% training \ndataset and 20%\

    \ was conducted to assess the \ncontribution of each trait in developed models.\
    \ The simplified model with less explanatory variables were devel-\noped according\
    \ to the traits importance evaluation of the model implementation in the root\
    \ zone water status \ndetection. Table 4 lists the top five of most contributing\
    \ traits in each model. The explanation of each trait could \nbe referred to Table 1.\
    \ Different model had different preference on the trait type. In the top five\
    \ traits, there was no \nmorphological trait in RF model, no NIR trait in NN model,\
    \ and no color trait in SVM model.\nFigure 5. Classification accuracy of developed\

    \ trait and NIR trait appeared more frequently than morphological trait, which\
    \ shows plant \ncolor and NIR characteristics would be more related to root zone\
    \ water status. This result agrees with several \nstudies in spectroscopy and\
    \ remote sensing research on the relationship between spectral reflectivity and\
    \ water \nrelated index13. The most frequently appearing traits in top five traits\
    \ of developed models were Mean.Color.\nGreen and Mean.Color.Red. There was only\
    \ one morphological trait in NN model and in SVM model, named as \nVrectsizeymm\
    \ and Compactness, respectively. This is likely because plant morphological appearance\
    \ is basically \ndetermined by genotype and substantially influenced by environment\
    \ such as airflow and illumination.\nModel classification ability dropped when\
    \ only the top five traits were used to develop model, named as sim-\nplified\
    \ model. The accuracy of simplified RF model and NN model could still reach 79.7%\
    \ and 77.4% respectively, \nwhile the accuracy of simplified SVM model decreased\
    \ substantially from 92.5% to 63.0% with 29.5% reduction. \nFor SVM model, the\
    \ cumulative contribution of the top five traits was 22.8%, lower than that of\
    \ RF model and \nNN model (32.6% and 29.9%, respectively), which could be the\
    \ main reason for the great decrease on the simpli-\nfied model accuracy. In addition,\
    \ simplified SVM model did not include color trait, while simplified NN model\
    \ \ndid not include NIR trait (Table 4), which showed color related traits would\
    \ better reflect plant root zone water \nstatus than the other two trait types\
    \ in RF and NN models while the SVM model relied more on NIR traits than \nthe\
    \ others.\nConclusion\nThis study developed a root zone water status discrimination\
    \ method during plant growth by integrating phe-\nnotyping and machine learning\
    \ techniques. Pakchoi plants were used. Three types of phenotyping traits such\
    \ \nas morphological trait, color trait, and near-infrared trait were acquired\
    \ as the inputs for classification models. \nThree machine learning models were\
    \ developed, Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector \nMachine\
    \ (SVM), with accuracy above 90% for all. The SVM model had the highest accuracy\
    \ as 92.5% in model \ndevelopment but it took the longest training time as 1245.94\
    \ seconds in this study. In addition, the SVM model \nhad the largest accuracy\
    \ reduction (22.8%) in simplified model developed by the top five most contributing\
    \ trait \nresulting from trait contribution evaluation.\nThe three developed models\
    \ were evaluated by test dataset (20% of entire data pool) consisting of data\
    \ from \ndifferent scenarios, which were different time a day, growth stage, weather\
    \ condition, and pakchoi cultivar. All the \nthree models reached the overall\
    \ accuracy higher than 90%. SVM model had the highest value as 92.5%, but no \n\
    substantial differences were observed among the three. By evaluated in different\
    \ scenarios, the three models had \naccuracy over 85% in all scenarios with some\
    \ fluctuations. The accuracy at the time point of 06:00 h was the lowest \nfor\
    \ all the three models, and the trend of increasing was observed during the growth\
    \ of plant. Better performances \nwere observed in cloudy weather condition than\
    \ in sunny weather condition of the three models. NN model had \nthe largest difference\
    \ on accuracy between cultivars. Overall, SVM model had the highest classification\
    \ accuracy, \nbut more stable performance was observed in RF model considering\
    \ all the scenarios.\nThis study demonstrates the potential of machine learning\
    \ approach on discriminating root zone water status \nbased on complex plant phenotyping\
    \ traits. The developed discrimination method could promote the plant-based \n\
    irrigation decision making and implementation in practice. Developed models could\
    \ be further used in precision \nirrigation system with appropriate modifications\
    \ if environment or crop change. Further study is suggested to \ninvestigate the\
    \ repaid response of plant phenotypic traits to the change of root zone water\
    \ status and the perfor-\nmance of classification models on such response. Therefore\
    \ accumulative effect of water stress on plant growth \nduring the growing period\
    \ should be minimized with the real-time discrimination to control the potential\
    \ yield \nloss. Population phenotyping and water status discrimination are also\
    \ worth further study due to plant canopy \nmutual occlusion and growth competition.\
    \ In addition, phenotyping traits were extracted from images acquired \nin a constant\
    \ light environment. Changes in intensity, quality, and beam angle of illumination\

    \ especially \nfor irrigation management.\nMaterials and Methods\nPlant materials\
    \ and growth conditions. \nThe experiment was conducted in a commercial greenhouse\
    \ \nfrom May 1th to 29th in year of 2015, located at northeast of Shanghai, China\
    \ (31°10′ N, 121°36′ E). Two cultivars \nof pakchoi were used, “Huawang” and “Kangre\
    \ 605”, under pot substrate cultivation. Commercial substrate (veg-\netable seedling\
    \ substrate, Zhongnuo Agriculture Technology Co., Ltd, Huaian, China) composed\
    \ of peat moss, \nperlite, and organic matter was used. Plug tray was used at\
    \ seedling stage. On the tenth day after sowing, seedlings \nwere transplanted\
    \ to pots (volume of 1.13 L) with one seedling per pot.\nThe greenhouse air temperature,\
    \ humidity, photosynthetic photon flux, substrate temperature and electrical \n\
    conductivity were monitored every 5 minutes by using an automatic data logging\
    \ system (PM-11 Phytomonitor, \nBio Instruments S.R.L., Chisinau, Moldova) with\
    \ RTH-11 Meter and SMTE sensor. During the whole experimen-\ntal period, the average\
    \ air temperature was 24.3 °C with the highest as 36 °C and lowest as 13.7 °C.\
    \ The relative \nhumidity ranged from 16.4% to 88% with an average of 58%. Mean\
    \ daily accumulative solar radiation in the \ngreenhouse was 2.62 MJ/(m2·d), with\
    \ a maximum of 5.41 MJ/(m2·d) at May 21st.\nTreatments of root zone moisture level\
    \ were applied to each pot after transplanting. Root zone moisture was \nindicated\
    \ by the relative water content, the percent of volumetric water content comparing\
    \ to field water capacity. \nBecause of the dynamic change of root zone moisture\
    \ status, upper limit was applied to define the moisture level \nof root zone.\
    \ In other word, irrigation stopped when root zone moisture reached the upper\
    \ limit. Considering the \nfeasibility of moisture level control and plant growth,\
    \ three root zone moisture levels were applied, 40%, 60%, and \n80% (referred\
    \ to as ‘Low’, ‘Medium’, and ‘High’ hereafter, respectively). In total, five plants\
    \ of each cultivar were \nrandomly assigned to each treatment. Irrigation was\
    \ conducted manually for all plants once a day according to \nthe pot weight.\n\
    Image acquisition and processing. \nA commercial phenotyping system (Scanalyzer3D,\
    \ LemnaTec GmbH, \nWürselen, Germany) was used for image acquisition (Supplementary\
    \ Fig. S2). Images of each plant were taken \ndaily from top view before irrigation\
    \ from May 11th to 29th, 2015. Two types of image were acquired simultane-\nously,\
    \ near-infrared (NIR) and visible (VIS) images. The 20-day growing period was\
    \ divided into five stages with \nfour days of each, referred to as stage 1, 2,\
    \ 3, 4, and 5. Plant growing level especially the number of leaves was dif-\n\
    ferent at different stage (Fig. 6). The reference growth stage was divided mainly\
    \ according to the new leaf emerge \ntime under different treatments and adjusted\
    \ to even distribution for model comparison.\nTwo image acquisition schedules\
    \ were applied with one from 06:00 h to 18:00 h at two hour intervals and the\
    \ \nother one only at 14:00 h. Weather condition was classified into two scenarios,\
    \ sunny and cloudy (referred to as ‘S’ \nand ‘C’ hereafter, respectively) according\
    \ to weather forecast. Efforts were made to have the two image acquisition \n\
    schedules for each weather scenario in each stage (Table 5). At the end of 20-day\
    \ growing period, the fresh and \ndry weight of each plant sample were measured.\
    \ Each sample was dried at 105 °C for 1 hour and then at 60 °C to \nconstant weight.\
    \ The dried sample was weighted to an accuracy of ± 0.1 mg.\nImages acquired by\
    \ the imaging system were organized into LemnaBase which is the central database\
    \ interface \nfor the phenotyping system, and processed through an analysis pipeline\
    \ specifically adjusted for pakchoi by using \nLemnaGrid which is an image analysis\
    \ component of the phenotyping system. Image processing procedure in \nLemnaGrid\
    \ consisted of four main steps shown as the flowchart in Supplementary Fig. S3:\
    \ (1) image preprocess-\ning, extracting target images from LemnaBase; (2) segmentation,\
    \ separating target plant from the background \nin the image; (3) feature extraction,\
    \ analyzing segmentation result and producing phenotypic traits; and (4) \npost-processing,\
    \ summarizing feature extraction results of all target images and exporting as\
    \ “.xls” file.\nRoot zone water status discrimination model development. \nThe\
    \ development of root zone water \nstatus discrimination was consisted of three\
    \ steps: (1) data preprocessing, organizing data for phenotypic analysis \nand\
    \ model development; (2) phenotypic traits screening, removing those phenotypic\
    \ traits with insignificant \nFigure 6. Pakchoi seedling appearance at five growing\

    \ different modeling algo-\nrithms to classify root zone water status. MetaboAnalyst\
    \ statistical analysis module (http://www.metaboanalyst.\nca) was implemented\
    \ for data preprocessing and phenotypic traits screening, and R language (windows,\
    \ R3.2.5, R \ncore Team, 2016) was implemented for model development.\nData preprocessing.\
    \ \nIn MetaboAnalyst statistical analysis module, data of extracted phenotypic\
    \ traits from \neach image were organized into one datasheet by sample ID (row)\
    \ and phenotypic traits (column). Empty rows \nwere detected and excluded after\
    \ data uploaded. Columns with more than 50% empty records were removed. In \n\
    the case of columns with data missing but less than 50%, the NAs (not available\
    \ values) were replaced by with \na small value (half of the minimum positive\
    \ values in the original data). All the traits value were normalized by \nusing\
    \ auto scaling method (mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation of\
    \ each variable).\nPhenotypic traits screening. \nAmong those phenotypic traits\
    \ extracted by imaging processing, traits which \nare insignificantly relevant\
    \ to treatments may influence the modeling accuracy. In this study, one-way Analysis\
    \ \nof Variance (ANOVA) was applied to screen traits resulting an optimal set\
    \ of explanatory variables for discrim-\nination model development. Traits with\
    \ P > 0.05 (Fisher’s LSD method) were excluded from the traits set. In \naddition,\
    \ the result of ANOVA presented a preliminary overview of the significance of\
    \ each trait to treatments.\nIn order to assess the potentiality of using phenotypic\
    \ traits to develop discrimination model, Partial Least \nSquares Discriminant\
    \ Analysis (PLS-DA) was applied, which is a supervised algorithm that uses multivariate\
    \ \nregression techniques to predict class membership via linear combination of\
    \ original variables. The PLS-DA was \nperformed by using plsr function in pls\
    \ package of R language, and the classification and cross-validation were \nperformed\
    \ by using the corresponding wrapper function in caret package of R language.\
    \ The resulted PLS-DA \nthree-dimensional component score plot, which shows the\
    \ overall data distribution of different treatments, pre-\nsents the preliminary\
    \ classification indicating modeling potentiality.\nDiscrimination model development.\
    \ \nBased on the purpose of multi-classification in this study, three \nclassification\
    \ modeling algorithms, Random Forests (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector\
    \ Machine \n(SVM) were selected to develop discrimination model and performed\
    \ with the randomForest, nnet, e1071 pack-\nages in R language, respectively.\n\
    RF was used as a supervised learning algorithm suitable for the case of high dimensional\
    \ data analysis. The RF \ncan handle multiple input variables from large databases\
    \ without variable selection and give estimates of impor-\ntant variables in the\
    \ classification25. RF modeling was performed by using the randomForest package.\
    \ Ntree (the \nnumber of trees) and mtry (the number of features) used to find\
    \ the best feature were required in RF. In this study \nthe RF model was trained\
    \ with ntree as 500 and mtry from 2, 5, and 8.\nNeural network have been successful\

    \ model, and disentangle latent factors for phenotyping27. For NN model in this\
    \ study, nnet package was \nused to train the single-hidden-layer feed-forward\
    \ neural network. There are two main parameters, decay and \nsize, which can be\
    \ tuned for NN model in R. In this study, the decay were tuned from 0, 0.1, and\
    \ 0.001, and the \nsize were tuned from 2, 5, and 9.\nThe goal of a SVM is to\
    \ create a boundary, called hyperplane, which leads to homogeneous partitions\
    \ of data \non either side. In this study, multiclass SVM model were trained with\
    \ kernel parameter C (from 10, 100, and \n1000) and regularization parameter gamma\
    \ (from 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 0). The best combination of C and gamma \nleading\
    \ to the highest prediction accuracy was chosen. For SVM, svm function in e1071\
    \ package was used to \nspecify the kernel function, cost, and the gamma function.\n\
    The 80% of total samples were selected as the training dastaset via stratified\
    \ random sampling method for \nmodel development and optimization and the rest\
    \ 20% as the test dataset. In order to prevent the over fitting \nproblems, all\
    \ three models were trained with the 10-fold cross validation in three repetitions\
    \ by using the caret \npackage in R language. This method randomly splits the\
    \ dataset in 10 subsets, among which 9 instances of the \ndata were used to train\
    \ the model and the other instance was used to validate the training model. By\
    \ performing \nthree repeats of the 10-fold validation, the average accuracy (percentage\
    \ of correctly classified samples out of all \nsamples) was used to assess the\
    \ performance of the model. However, only accuracy is not enough to evaluate the\
    \ \nmodel performance especially for imbalance data or multi class data. Therefore,\
    \ Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (k) and \nROC (Receiver operating characteristic)\
    \ curve were also used to evaluate the model performance. The k is a good \nmeasure\
    \ that can handle multi-class well and calculated as:\n=\n−\n−\np\np\np\nk\n1\n\
    o\ne\ne\nwhere, po is the observed agreement, and pe is the expected agreement.\
    \ The ROC curves of different models were \ncompared according to the area under\
    \ the curve (AUC) by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive\
    \ \nrate. AUC represents the probability that the classifier will assign a higher\
    \ score to a randomly chosen positive \nexample than to negative example28.\n\

  explanation: 'The paper focuses on the use of multi-sensor data and advanced sensing
    technologies for enhanced plant stress detection in precision agriculture. It
    proposes four ways to increase complexity by employing multi-domains data, fostering:


    1.  Combined acquisition and analysis of spectral data from multiple sensors representing
    multiple modalities and using parametric regressions (see Section 5.1);


    2.  Simultaneous retrieval of plant traits using multi-domain RTMs and ML methods
    (see Section 5.2);


    3.  Assimilation of estimated plant traits based on data from different spectral
    domains into mechanistic models (see Section 5.3);


    4.  Conceptual framework: Development of fully integrated mechanistic and radiative
    transfer models directly simulating the full variety of spectral measurements
    that can thereafter be assimilated (see Section 5.4).'

    rights and content Under a Creative Commons license open access Highlights • Synergistic
    usage of optical domains permits a holistic view of plant stress. • Three dose-
    and duration-related phases of stress defined. • Study designs were mainly driven
    by available sensors and economic reasons. • Coupling multi-domain observations
    with integrated crop growth models is proposed. Abstract Remote detection and
    monitoring of the vegetation responses to stress became relevant for sustainable
    agriculture. Ongoing developments in optical remote sensing technologies have
    provided tools to increase our understanding of stress-related physiological processes.
    Therefore, this study aimed to provide an overview of the main spectral technologies
    and retrieval approaches for detecting crop stress in agriculture. Firstly, we
    present integrated views on: i) biotic and abiotic stress factors, the phases
    of stress, and respective plant responses, and ii) the affected traits, appropriate
    spectral domains and corresponding methods for measuring traits remotely. Secondly,
    representative results of a systematic literature analysis are highlighted, identifying
    the current status and possible future trends in stress detection and monitoring.
    Distinct plant responses occurring under short-term, medium-term or severe chronic
    stress exposure can be captured with remote sensing due to specific light interaction
    processes, such as absorption and scattering manifested in the reflected radiance,
    i.e. visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared, and emitted radiance,
    i.e. solar-induced fluorescence and thermal infrared (TIR). From the analysis
    of 96 research papers, the following trends can be observed: increasing usage
    of satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle data in parallel with a shift in methods
    from simpler parametric approaches towards more advanced physically-based and
    hybrid models. Most study designs were largely driven by sensor availability and
    practical economic reasons, leading to the common usage of VIS-NIR-TIR sensor
    combinations. The majority of reviewed studies compared stress proxies calculated
    from single-source sensor domains rather than using data in a synergistic way.
    We identified new ways forward as guidance for improved synergistic usage of spectral
    domains for stress detection: (1) combined acquisition of data from multiple sensors
    for analysing multiple stress responses simultaneously (holistic view); (2) simultaneous
    retrieval of plant traits combining multi-domain radiative transfer models and
    machine learning methods; (3) assimilation of estimated plant traits from distinct
    spectral domains into integrated crop growth models. As a future outlook, we recommend
    combining multiple remote sensing data streams into crop model assimilation schemes
    to build up Digital Twins of agroecosystems, which may provide the most efficient
    way to detect the diversity of environmental and biotic stresses and thus enable
    respective management decisions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue
    Keywords Precision agriculture multi-modal solar-induced fluorescence satellite
    hyperspectral multispectral biotic and abiotic stress 1. Introduction One of the
    most challenging concerns of today is finding answers to the question “How to
    feed the world?”, as formulated in the 2nd Sustainable Development Goal (SDG),
    FAO (2021). The task is huge as the world population is expected to increase to
    9.8 billion by 2050 (UN, 2017). Thus, global food production needs to be expanded
    by 70% in order to feed the future population, maintain nutritional security,
    account for changing diets and the increasing demand for biological products from
    the construction and energy sectors (Galieni et al., 2021; Mueller et al., 2012;
    Tester and Langridge, 2010). In this context, the environmental impact of agriculture
    must be minimized to protect water, climate, soil, and biodiversity resources
    (Gomiero et al., 2011) while reducing production risks for farmers. Climate change
    is adding pressure, as the frequency of extreme weather events as well as major
    shifts in precipitation and temperature patterns are expected to increase worldwide
    (Cogato et al., 2019; Gomiero et al., 2011). As a consequence, abiotic (e.g.,
    heat and drought) and/or biotic (e.g., diseases and pests) stresses and their
    combinations (Govender et al., 2009), will also become more frequent and lead,
    without swift and effective management responses, to decreases in crop productivity
    (Atzberger, 2013). Thus, early detection of crop stress prior to irreversible
    damage is essential to be able to respond with suitable agrotechnical solutions
    and thus minimize yield loss. For the detection and quantification of biotic and
    abiotic stresses in agricultural crops, destructive and non-destructive methods
    can be used. Some quantitative methods provide sensitive analyses of molecules
    in biological systems, also known as high-throughput-omic techniques (Fiehn, 2001;
    Llanes et al., 2018). However, these methods are not only destructive but also
    time-consuming and costly, limiting their use in continuous monitoring and scalable
    research (Galieni et al., 2021). As for non-destructive quantitative methods,
    remote sensing (RS) technologies have been established, such as imaging spectroscopy,
    fluorescence spectroscopy, thermal and microwave remote sensing, which all provide
    insights into the effects of stress in plants. In contrast to omic techniques,
    RS can be applied at larger spatial scales, with high revisit frequency, hence
    enabling a cost-effective detection of crop stress status and spatiotemporal dynamics
    across cultivated landscapes. Furthermore, RS is suitable for global coverage
    and can thus potentially contribute to enhanced food security in developing countries
    (e.g., Rembold et al., 2000). Driven by new platforms and sensors with enhanced
    spatial, temporal and spectral capacities, RS studies focusing on agricultural
    applications grew exponentially in the last decades (Weiss et al., 2020). Together
    with improvements in computing power and machine learning (ML), unprecedented
    possibilities are offered for precision agriculture and other agricultural applications,
    going along with major improvements in crop stress detection. The most common
    crop stress type analysed by means of RS techniques is drought, i.e., water deficit
    stress Damm et al., 2022; Gago et al., 2015; Gerhards et al., 2016; Govender et
    al., 2009; Ihuoma and Madramootoo, 2017; Parkash and Singh, 2020; Virnodkar et
    al., 2020). Also, other stress factors have been studied with RS, such as insects
    (Herrmann et al., 2017) and pathogens (Gold et al., 2020; Herrmann et al., 2018;
    Mahlein, 2016; Sishodia et al., 2020) nutrient deficiency (Baret et al., 2007;
    Herrmann et al., 2010; Mahajan et al., 2021) or soil contamination (Gholizadeh
    and Kopacková, 2019). Optical remote sensing covers the wavelengths from the visible
    to the shortwave infrared (VSWIR, 400–2500 nm) and the thermal infrared (TIR,
    8–14 μm), collecting radiation reflected and emitted from the observed surfaces.
    When it comes to the detection of plant responses to diverse stresses, visible
    (VIS, 400–700 nm), near-infrared (NIR, 700–1300 nm) and shortwave infrared (SWIR,
    1300–2500 nm) reflectance, but also TIR and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF, often
    at 687 nm and 760 nm, or over the full emission wavelength between 650 and 800
    nm) have been the most exploited passive sensing signals (Gerhards et al., 2019).
    In these spectral domains, information on plant morphology and structure can also
    be derived by means of active sensing devices, such as LiDAR (light detection
    and ranging; Madec et al., 2017), and through stereophotogrammetry using multi-spectral
    imagery (St-Onge et al., 2008). Note that this review explicitly excludes microwave
    technologies. Passive microwave remote sensing operates at spatial scales (typically
    at 0.25°) being too coarse for studies at the farm or field scale. Active microwave
    remote sensing (RADAR) has been shown useful in obtaining crop type information
    (Gella et al., 2021) and surface soil moisture, with potentially high relevance
    for assessing crop water availability. However, we restrict this review to crop
    traits for stress detection and exclude soil attributes. Beyond usage of single
    RS domains, observations in multiple spectral domains are strongly suggested,
    potentially providing a deeper understanding of the complex interactions of stressors
    and affected crop traits (Damm et al., 2018; Jiao et al., 2021). Optical multi-sensor
    synergies for stress-related research in agriculture have been identified for
    precision agriculture (Chaerle et al., 2006; Gerhards et al., 2019; Maes and Steppe,
    2019), but also for plant breeding projects (Herrmann et al., 2020; Pineda et
    al., 2020; Singh et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017a). The synergistic use of data
    from various electromagnetic domains goes back to the launch of the Thematic Mapper
    (TM) onboard Landsat-4 in 1982. However, the rather coarse spectral and spatial
    resolutions of the sensor and its successors prevented a deeper look into plant
    conditions at sub-field scales. By the end of the 1990s, plant scientists promoted
    near-range sensing for single leaves and plants using thermography, VIS and NIR,
    as well as fluorescence imaging, to improve understanding of plant physiological
    states and related stresses (Chaerle and Van Der Straeten, 2000; Lichtenthaler
    et al., 1998), but challenges in precise image alignment and data calibration
    prevented synergistic usage of such multi-domain data. First synergistic use of
    multi-domain acquisitions has been realized using piloted aircraft (Gerhards et
    al., 2018; Mohammed et al., 2019; Panigada et al., 2014) while miniaturization
    in sensor design has led to the development of drone systems allowing for multi-sensor
    integration at the field level (Aasen et al., 2018). For the first time, the FLuorescence
    EXplorer-Sentinel 3 (FLEX-S3) tandem mission will provide concurrent observations
    of VIS, NIR, SWIR and TIR along with SIF at satellite level. (e.g., Drusch et
    al., 2017). Recent studies propose efficient early stress detection using multi-scale
    UAVs and satellite observations. Within such frameworks, the advantages of both
    platforms can be explored, such as the availability of higher temporal and spatial
    resolution data (Alvarez-Vanhard et al., 2021; Sagan et al., 2019). However, the
    integration of multi-scale approaches goes beyond the scope of this review, which
    is explicitly constrained to synergistic exploitation of multiple spectral domains
    for stress detection in agriculture. While the developments in sensor and airborne
    platform technologies allow for coincident recordings from multiple (spectral)
    domains (e.g., Timmermans et al., 2015), studies exploring these data by applying
    integrative methods to assess plant stress are still rare. Before a multi-domain
    retrieval approach can be defined, all acquired remotely sensed signals must be
    translated into meaningful values (proxies) related to stress (i.e. affected plant
    traits). In this respect, a multitude of modeling and retrieval approaches have
    been investigated (Verrelst et al., 2015, Verrelst et al., 2019a). The majority
    of proposed methods relied on parametric regressions, i.e. use of spectral bands,
    vegetation indices (VIs) or spectral ratios and their relationships with functional
    traits linked to plant stress (e.g. Gerhards et al., 2016; Govender et al., 2009;
    Herrmann et al., 2020). To better understand cause–effect relationships, and to
    simultaneously use the full set of spectral variables, physically-based methods
    opened attractive pathways. For instance, a promising approach is provided by
    the soil-canopy observation, photochemistry and energy fluxes (SCOPE) model (Van
    der Tol et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2021a) and its vertically heterogeneous versions
    mSCOPE (Yang et al., 2017b) and senSCOPE (Pacheco-Labrador et al., 2021), which
    combines radiative transfer approaches with photosynthesis and energy balance
    modeling. In contrast to physically-based approaches, other studies investigated
    methods of reduced complexity but increased efficiency via implementation of data-driven
    approaches, in particular ML regression algorithms (Gewali et al., 2019; Singh
    et al., 2016; Virnodkar et al., 2020). To provide a scientific foundation to the
    pros and cons of different approaches, Sishodia et al. (2020) recently reviewed
    stress-related applications of RS in precision agriculture, including water stress
    and disease detection. The authors stated that advanced approaches using process-based
    physical models should be pursued to complement ML regression algorithms, as for
    instance demonstrated by Reichstein et al. (2019) in the context of surface energy
    balance (SEB) modeling. A pioneering example is provided by Zarco-Tejada et al.
    (2018) who used multi-sensor acquisitions (airborne hyperspectral and thermal)
    to analyse trees undergoing early stress caused by infection with the vector-transmitted
    bacterial plant pathogen Xylella Fastidiosa. The authors estimated fluorescence
    efficiency by exploring a three-dimensional radiative transfer model (RTM) in
    a multi-step inversion scheme. Also, thermal stress indicators were derived, and
    canopy structural and leaf biochemical traits were estimated from RTM inversion.
    In addition, narrow-band spectral indices known to be sensitive to certain functional
    plant traits (i.e., chlorophylls, carotenes and xanthophylls) were calculated.
    All traits and indicators were processed within a multivariate analysis based
    on ML algorithms for the classification of the (pre-visual) disease incidence
    and severity at the landscape scale. Another example of early stress detection
    by multiple spectral domains is provided by Hernández-Clemente et al. (2019).
    The authors reviewed the capability of remotely sensed physiological indicators,
    such as canopy temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthesis and pigments
    to monitor the early responses of plants to a variety of stressors. They pointed
    towards the main challenges for the RS community in detecting stress, being: (1)
    the availability of high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution data, (2) the
    validation of diverse retrieval methods, (3) upscaling of physiological traits
    from leaf to canopy-level, and (4) capturing the temporal dynamics and interaction
    of traits as stress proxies. Altogether, despite these advances, critical knowledge
    and methodological gaps for crop stress detection remain. The main gap is that
    currently no concept exists that uses multiple spectral domains in an integrated
    way for a complete view of crop conditions to differentiate between crop stress
    types and to understand the degree of stress severity. This shortcoming can be
    addressed by leveraging the full potential of spectral information provided by
    multi-domain RS data sources in a synergistic way. Therefore, we aim to elaborate
    and propose a new methodological concept for the assessment of multiple plant
    stresses in agriculture through optical RS synergies. To achieve this, we review,
    synthesize and integrate current knowledge across spectral domains, remote sensing
    platforms and retrieval methods for the identification of crop stress. The paper
    is organized as follows: in Chapter 2, we present a general introduction on plant
    stress, physiological strain as well as adaptations to stress at different temporal
    stages. This is followed by RS of stress using distinct proxies and sensor systems
    in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 concentrates on the systematic literature review about
    multi-domain and multi-sensor studies, and Chapter 5 elaborates the proposed multi-sensor
    synergy concept. 2. Stress definitions and physiology 2.1. Stress definitions
    Plants are sessile organisms exposed to biotic and abiotic pressures, i.e. the
    physical, chemical and biological environment characterizing their habitat (Jones
    and Jones, 1989). Abiotic stress includes, among others, radiation, salinity,
    flooding (waterlogging), water stress, temperature extremes, nutrient shortage
    and heavy metals (Gull et al., 2019; Larcher, 2003). Second, plants are influenced
    by their biotic surroundings, referring to other co-occurring organisms. Specifically,
    biotic stress involves inter- and intra-specific competitions as well as diseases
    caused by fungal and bacterial pathogens (Lichtenthaler, 1996), weeds, insect
    pests and/or damage to plants by nematodes, protists, viruses, and viroids (Madani
    et al., 2019). Both the biotic and abiotic interactions can impact the survival
    or success of plant species. Thus, understanding the impacts of different stress
    factors on plants have been the focus of plant physiologists (Larcher, 2003),
    particularly important in crop sciences (Blum, 2016). In general terms, plant
    stress can be defined according to Lichtenthaler (1996) as: ‘any unfavourable
    condition or substance that affects or blocks a plant''s metabolism, growth or
    development’. A simplified description of the effect of various stress factors
    on a plant is outlined in Fig. 1 (Blum, 2016; Kranner et al., 2010). Accordingly,
    plants respond to a changing environment by a coordinated short-term acclimation.
    The response is initiated by biochemical triggers like phytohormones or enzymes
    and leads to a damage and repair cycle, activating the plant metabolism usually
    with small or non-visible phenotypic adaptation (reversible and adaptive strain
    tolerance). With increased severity and duration of the stress exposure, plants
    change their phenotypic expressions through long-term adaptations. This affects,
    for instance, leaf size and thickness, stomatal density, or function of chloroplasts
    depending on high or low light conditions. Depending on the stress factor, the
    adaptation may take days or weeks, while persistent and severe (long-term) stress
    may arise in the final stage and even lead to apoptosis (Lichtenthaler, 1996).
    The ability of plants to vary their phenotypic expression in response to environmental
    conditions is also described as “phenotypic plasticity” (Sultan, 2000), which
    can result in altered phenotypic traits and fluxes. Download : Download high-res

    strain, and signaling, leading to plant responses and resistance. Adapted from
    (Blum, 2016). It has to be noted that the impact of any stress factor usually
    results in a complex interplay between the plant''s genes and its environment
    often leading to multiple strains, not explicitly shown in Fig. 1. For example,
    high light stress affects fluorescence parameters, impacts photosynthesis, increases
    non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and enhances leaf temperature leading to increased
    transpiration and changes in leaf angle. Likewise, it must be remarked that the
    effect of a single and/or multiple stress factors, as well as the combination
    of biotic and/or abiotic stresses, can often lead to very similar physiological
    responses in the plants (Blum, 2016; Kranner et al., 2010), see Fig. 1. It is
    also important to consider the timing of stress impacts. For example, short-term
    environmental changes may be reflected in changing flux rates of photosynthesis,
    respiration, and transpiration (Damm et al., 2018). Stress occurring over long-term
    periods during different development stages may affect growth variously. For example,
    drought stress in wheat may affect leaf expansion in the initial phase, the number
    of tillers in the tillering phase, plant height in the stem elongation phase,
    and grain development during the flowering stage, with the period between stem
    elongation and flowering being the most sensitive to drought (Sarto et al., 2017).
    2.2. Stages of plant stress responses Reactions to biotic and abiotic stresses
    usually are continuous but often also non-linear processes (Kranner et al., 2010).
    In general, three phases of the plant stress response may be identified with respect
    to the severity and duration of one or multiple stressors. We exemplary demonstrate
    the phases (or stages) of drought stress and subsequent plant response in Fig.
    2. very mild drought stress usually has little impact on the plant, i.e., initial
    stomatal closure may occur, but the photosynthetic capacity remains high and no
    phenotypic changes are observed. Under increasing stress levels, however, stomatal
    closure reduces the internal CO2 availability, which often triggers the production
    of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lowers the photosynthetic rates. Moreover,
    leaf temperature increases and changes in leaf angle or leaf rolling are observed.
    As a result, plant growth may be inhibited. A stronger decrease in water availability
    will result in a reduced stomatal conductance affecting the leaf turgor (Abdullah
    et al., 2019). Overproduction and accumulation of ROS and membrane instability
    will lead to cellular damage beyond repair and thus to necrotic spots. Under severe
    drought stress, growth usually stops, and continuous damage may eventually lead
    to apoptosis (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (883KB)

    and the plants'' responses to stress as a function of dose and exposure time:
    early (mild), medium-term or mild long-term, and severe/chronic exposure. These
    stress phases may vary for diverse or combined stressors. This is particularly
    important for agriculture, where often even mild stress may reduce crop growth,
    and finally the yield, particularly when it occurs at crucial growth stages (Fahad
    et al., 2017). Consequently, it is essential to detect and quantify crop stress
    at the earliest possible stage. Only responses affecting the biophysical and functional
    properties and thus, traits of the plants may be detected by RS. Stress factors
    such as water scarcity, water logging, salinity, heat and excessive light often
    induce changes in the rates of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and
    stomatal conductance in the early stress stage. This is usually followed by changes
    in amounts and ratios of the photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids),
    and the concentration of different metabolites at later stages (Lichtenthaler,
    1996). While the remote detection of altered phenotypic traits, such as pigments
    and water content, is prevalent when monitoring medium-term, mild long-term and
    severe or chronic stress, altered photosynthesis and transpiration fluxes and
    their possible feedback mechanisms already show subtle responses under the first
    occurring stress (e.g., Gerhards et al., 2016; Jonard et al., 2020). In fact,
    daily occurring cycles of stress are common for crops as diurnal cycles in radiation
    and temperature show strong variation, often reaching excessive energy inputs
    at solar noon. In general, electromagnetic energy absorbed by plants is used to
    fuel photosynthesis, but under excessive irradiation the photosynthetic apparatus
    needs to immediately adapt energy pathways to avoid photo-damage. Increasing stress
    that inhibits the photosynthetic light reactions induces an increasing dissipation
    of energy by NPQ and reduces the fluorescence yield. The latter is detectable
    over vast vegetated areas as solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), a subtle energy
    flux emitted by vegetation that may be used to detect the onset and progress of
    stress (Ač et al., 2015; Demmig-Adams et al., 2020; Gerhards et al., 2019). Dynamic
    adjustments under early stress are also observed for transpiration, an energy-demanding
    process that decreases leaf surface temperature. Therefore, sensing the canopy
    surface temperature became a useful tool for assessing early changes in plant-water
    and plant-health status (Idso et al., 1981; Jackson et al., 1988; Maes and Steppe,
    2012). 2.3. Common symptoms of crop stress In the following, we describe the causalities
    and illustrate several examples of stress occurrence in crops (Fig. 3). Download

    of distinct biotic (upper box) and abiotic (lower box) stressors (bold) and corresponding
    affected traits/symptoms on crops (mainly). Photographs were provided by the authors.
    Biotic stress responses result from complex interactions between plants and other
    biological organisms and can be very diverse. Often plant responses are induced
    directly by the biotic agents. For instance, in the (common) case of herbivory
    (see Fig. 3(a)), the immediate effect is loss of water content due to wounding
    and loss of functional leaf area combined with the necrosis of the wounded leaf
    parts (Meza-Canales et al., 2017). In this way, biotic pathogens often affect
    a plant locally and then induce a systemic plant response. This may include the
    activation of signal pathways to reduce stomatal conductance (Aldea et al., 2005)
    or increased production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as defence mechanisms
    (Holopainen and Gershenzon, 2010; Kessler, 2001). Viruses can also lead to biotic
    stress as shown in Fig. 3(b) for an example of Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN). MLN
    causes mostly pigment damage but also some structural wilting in advanced stages
    due to necrosis and viral replication related to phosphorous deficiencies. A broad
    diversity in fungal pathogens exists. Some pathogens, such as yellow rust, can
    stimulate photosynthesis during early infection stages as the fungus benefits
    from the increase in sugar production (Chang et al., 2013). However, at a later
    stress stage it may cause decreases in photosynthetic capacity, leading to visible
    foliar lesions (Vergara-Diaz et al., 2015). The diversity of fungal pathogens
    may cause plant diseases, such as anthracnose, leaf spot, rust, or wilt (for an
    overview, see Jain et al. (2019)). Many of these diseases are manifested as changes
    in optical reflectance properties of the canopy, which may be specific to the
    pathogen. Such changes in optical properties can either be detected as radiometric
    changes or can be identified at leaf level through computer vision approaches
    for classification of plant diseases (Singh et al., 2020). Similar symptoms can
    be caused by microbes, as shown in the example of downy mildew in Fig. 3(c). Radiation
    stress or excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) sunlight also disturbs plant
    growth when the absorbed excess energy cannot dissipate. It results in an overproduction
    of ROS that may be detoxified or eventually disturb the overall cellular homeostasis
    of the plant (Singh et al., 2020). In Fig. 3(d), the effects of radiation stress
    are shown for an exemplary vineyard. As illustrated in Fig. 3(e), frost or cold
    stress is another serious threat to crops (Yadav, 2010). Moderate cold stress
    reduces plant growth and development, but severe cold stress may lead to stronger
    symptoms. When cold stress coincides with high light intensities, it leads to
    yellowing of leaves (i.e., chlorosis), reduced leaf expansion and wilting, and
    finally necrosis, i.e. apoptosis. Waterlogging is among the major abiotic stressors
    for crops. Fig. 3(f) shows a previously flooded field. Waterlogging induces a
    number of alterations in soil properties, such as soil pH, redox potential and
    oxygen level. Thus, plants growing on waterlogged soil face a stressful environment
    in terms of hypoxia (deficiency of O2) or anoxia (absence of O2), which may substantially
    reduce plant growth, development and survival (Tewari and Mishra, 2018). One very
    frequent source of abiotic stress is drought, as demonstrated in Fig. 3(g) for
    a very severe drought stress event. Plants require a number of essential nutrients
    for growth, which are supplied either from soil minerals and soil organic matter,
    or as organic and inorganic fertilizers as part of agricultural management. The
    deficiency of one or multiple nutrients may lead to manifestations, as demonstrated
    in Fig. 3(h). These few selected examples illustrate that: (i) diverse stressors
    may lead to the same symptoms, and (ii) the same stressor may cause distinct symptoms
    under varying environmental conditions. This also depends on the scale of observation
    and the actual development stage of the crops. To better relate stressors and
    the corresponding symptoms, a deeper understanding about species-specific plant
    physiological responses is required. Ultimately, all abiotic and biotic stress
    factors have in common that they pose a large risk for the agricultural sector:
    major yield losses and thus decrease in agricultural productivity. 3. Remote sensing
    of stress: Time domains and methodologies From a sensing point of view and in
    accordance with the dose and duration of stress exposure, we group the detection
    of plant stress responses into three main categories. Table 1 lists the stress
    phases (short-term, medium-term and longer-term) along with the (i) physiological
    responses of the plants, (ii) the primarily affected or adapted traits or stress
    proxies, and (iii) typical or optimal sensing domains. In accordance with that
    and to associate the stress proxies to these three temporal phases of stress,
    we grouped the affected traits into fluxes, biochemical and structural, as delineated
    in Fig. 4. In addition, the Figure illustrates the interplay of “optimal” spectral
    domains to estimate these stress proxies for an example of decreasing crop water
    availability. The resulting health status and potential yield losses are delineated
    below as a chronological function of stress duration and severity. Before a multi-sensor
    concept can be defined, the potential of each of these spectral domains has to
    be understood. Hence, in the following sub-sections, we will discuss the capabilities
    of various RS technologies to track plant stress responses as a function of dose
    and exposure times, providing an overview of commonly used methodologies. Table

    exposure are further related to plant genotypes, not being considered here (cf.,

    stress proxies (PRI: photochemical reflectance index). Changing plant health conditions
    and yield loss probability are delineated as a chronological function of stress
    duration and severity through decreasing water availability. 3.1. Remote sensing
    methods for early and mild stress detection 3.1.1. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
    During the diurnal course of the day, vegetation is perceiving a large gradient
    of incoming solar energy, fluctuating between low light conditions up to excessive
    amounts of incident radiation. The energy in the photosynthetically active radiation
    (PAR, 380–710 nm) region triggering the photosynthetic light reactions is, therefore,
    easily reaching harmful doses of energy requiring dissipation. SIF corresponds
    to the energy directly emitted from the photosynthetic machinery when the photosynthetic
    pigments get excited by the incoming radiance. The harvested light triggering
    this SIF emission depends on the amount of photosynthetic pigments and their composition
    within the photosystem II antenna complexes. Passive fluorescence techniques quantify
    the absolute values of SIF emission. Hereby, retrieval methods disentangle surface
    reflectance from the fluorescence signal using data from very high spectral resolution
    spectroradiometers. By means of these techniques, fluorescence emission can be
    retrieved as scalar values in the oxygen absorption regions or within the Fraunhofer
    lines, where the reflected radiance is strongly retained due to absorption of
    the incoming sunlight (Meroni et al., 2009). By exploiting distinct absorption
    features in the red and NIR spectral window, it is possible to reconstruct the
    entire spectrum of chlorophyll fluorescence. There are two peaks around 685 nm
    and 740 nm, which are mechanistically related to the photosynthetic electron transport
    within the two photosystems of plant''s photosynthetic apparatus (Mohammed et
    al., 2019). Recent approaches model the entire fluorescence spectrum (Cogliati
    et al., 2019), which will open the path towards a more complete signal analysis.
    The intensity of the SIF signal is in its first order related to the total PAR,
    which is absorbed by the canopy. Secondly, structural canopy properties determine
    the escape probability of the emitted SIF signal (Guanter et al., 2014). Recent
    studies developed methods to correct the SIF emission for scattering (Yang and
    van der Tol, 2018; Zeng et al., 2019) and re-absorption effects (Liu et al., 2020)
    by determining the escape probability and thus made it possible to down-scale
    SIF from the canopy to the leaf level. To further disentangle illumination related
    variations from the underlying physiological information carried by the down-scaled
    SIF signal, the calculation of an (apparent) yield can be employed by further
    normalizing for the amount of chlorophyll (Goulas et al., 2017) or radiation absorbed
    by chlorophyll (Yang et al., 2020a). This step allows the comparison between species,
    independent of their pigment pool sizes and facilitates the quantitative detection
    of variations in plant physiology (Migliavacca et al., 2017; Van der Tol et al.,
    2016). Mechanistically, SIFyield, i.e. the SIF emission normalized by the absorbed
    energy triggering the emission, is closely related to the efficiency of the photosynthetic
    electron transport. Thus it can be used as an early stress indicator when photosynthetic
    electron transport is affected by the specific stress reaction. However, as a
    matter of fact, SIFyield is not linearly related to photosynthetic electron transport,
    as the dynamic nature of NPQ mechanisms renders these relationships non-linear.
    Plants have evolved a variety of protection mechanisms, which can be actively
    regulated to optimize light harvesting especially in stressful times to avoid
    over-energization of the photosynthetic apparatus. These NPQ mechanisms act as
    energy quenchers and, as a consequence, may also affect the intensity of SIF (Bilger
    and Bjorkman, 1990). Thus, for stress detection, SIFyield needs to be further
    constrained by an independent measure of NPQ. Some NPQ processes are linked to
    a reversible conversion of the xanthophyll pigment pool (Jahns and Holzwarth,
    2012), which may result in consequential optical reflectance change in the 500–600
    nm range (Acebron et al., 2021; Gamon and Surfus, 1999; Van Wittenberghe et al.,
    2021), or even further changes in the VIS–NIR range (Van Wittenberghe et al.,
    2019). To circumvent the above described complexities, the Photochemical Reflectance
    Index (PRI) has been frequently used to detect these instantaneous optical changes
    and to exploit the modification in the light use efficiency behaviour under excessive
    radiation (Garbulsky et al., 2011). However, the PRI is also known to be affected
    by both facultative and constitutive pigment effects (Gamon and Berry, 2012; Moncholi-Estornell
    et al., 2022). These multiple underlying pigments effects illustrate the complexity
    of the pigment dynamics affecting the PAR on both short and longer time scales.
    3.1.2. Thermal infrared sensing: Temperature There has been a long interest in
    using canopy temperature as a remote indicator of plant water stress (Jones and
    Vaughan, 2010). Although RS-based surface energy balance (SEB) approaches allow
    an estimation of the actual evapotranspiration (indirectly as the residual term
    of the SEB equation, using thermal data to calculate heat flux), they require
    vast meteorological input data and parameterisation of conductance (Tolomio and
    Casa, 2020). Other than SEB models, the direct use of thermal data in water stress
    indices has been promoted. TIR radiance measurements obtained over vegetation
    depend mainly on the temperatures of the (sunlit or shaded) leaves and the soil,
    the leaf and soil spectral emissivities, and eventual contributions from the surroundings
    and the atmosphere (Gerhards et al., 2019; Norman and Becker, 1995). Temperatures
    and emissivities of vegetated surfaces can be retrieved from a variety of algorithms
    that use - depending on the number of spectral bands - different approaches to
    correct for atmospheric effects and to separate temperature and emissivities from
    each other (Li et al., 2013). At a given ambient air temperature, canopy temperature
    (Tc) is inversely related to the rate of water loss from the canopy. The transpiration
    itself is closely linked to stomatal conductance (Jones and Vaughan, 2010). To
    take into account the effects of weather conditions on Tc, the crop water stress
    index (CWSI) has been developed as a simplified means to quantify water stress.
    Besides the effects of air temperature (Ta) the index also considers atmospheric
    relative humidity, expressed as vapour pressure deficit (VPD). CWSI is based on
    a simple scaling operation, where Tc is normalized by the Ts of a fully transpiring
    crop (Tsmax) and the Ts of a crop that is not transpiring at all (Tsmin). Different
    approaches to calculate CWSI were developed (see Maes and Steppe, 2012 for a comprehensive
    review): The empirical CWSI (CWSIe) establishes a relationship between TcTa and
    VPD from which Tsmax is derived (Idso et al., 1981). Hence, it requires only three
    input measurements (Tc, Ta, and VPD) for its application. However, the lower limit
    is sensitive to changes in radiation and wind speed (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014)
    and therefore cannot be transferred across growing seasons. The theoretical CWSI
    (CWSIt) calculates the upper and lower limits (Tsmax and Tsmin) from equations
    based on a combination of the Penman-Monteith and the energy balance equations.
    The CWSI can be used in day-to-day water stress monitoring, but requires measurement
    of additional atmospheric variables (i.e., net radiation, wind speed, canopy resistance)
    and the challenging estimation of aerodynamic resistance (rA) (Jackson et al.,
    1981, Jackson et al., 1988). To overcome this limitation, the use of an empirical
    upper limit together with the theoretical lower limit has been suggested for practical
    purposes (Agam et al., 2013; Rud et al., 2014). This so-called hybrid CWSh (Ekinzog
    et al., 2022) eliminates the need for estimating rA and achieved comparable accuracies
    as CWSIt and CWSIe. The development and early application of CWSI was done on
    point based Tc measurements, but has been adapted and applied to high resolution
    thermal imagery for assessing the spatial variability of crop water status using
    the direct or image based CWSI (Agam et al., 2013). Hereby, the fully and non-transpiring
    Ts along with Tc are measured directly using wet and dry artificial reference
    surfaces placed within the image (Gerhards et al., 2018). CWSI showed to exhibit
    good relationships with in situ soil based measures such as soil water content
    (DeJonge et al., 2015; Taghvaeian et al., 2014) and plant based measures, such
    as leaf water potential and stomatal conductance (Berni et al., 2009a; Bian et
    al., 2019; Han et al., 2018). The index proved to be robust in many arid and semi-arid
    regions around the globe and for various agricultural crops (Cohen et al., 2017;
    DeJonge et al., 2015), and more recently also in humid regions (Ekinzog et al.,
    2022; Hoffmann et al., 2016). Moreover, CWSI requires a fully closed canopy and
    this limitation has been tried to overcome using the water deficit index (WDI,
    Moran et al., 1994), relating TcTa with the fractional cover or a vegetation index
    (VI). The empirical version of WDI is derived from a Ts – VI scatterplot, without
    requiring any ground-based weather measurement and is thus widely applied in thermal
    RS (Maes and Steppe, 2012). 3.1.3. Thermal infrared sensing: Emissivity Analysing
    the thermal infrared spectral region, relatively little attention has been paid
    so far to the spectral emissivity of plants (leaf and canopy), which responds
    to environmental stresses. This could be explained with the following reasons
    (Ribeiro da Luz and Crowley, 2007): (i) hyperspectral TIR instruments were lacking
    until a few years ago, (ii) gap in knowledge about the origin of complex spectral
    emissivity variations, (iii) low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) together with low
    spectral and spatial resolution of the available sensors prevented to detect these
    subtle changes in spectral emissivity, (iv) lack of advanced pre-processing algorithms
    (i.e., atmospheric correction and Temperature-Emissivity-Separation). However,
    Salisbury (1986) and the ground-breaking studies by Ribeiro da Luz and Crowley
    (2010), Ribeiro da Luz and Crowley (2007) and Neinavaz et al. (2016) showed that
    differences in the spectral emissivity among plant species are related to differences
    in structural and biochemical leaf surface and canopy properties. These findings,
    in combination with recent advances in sensor technologies, e.g., spatially enhanced
    broadband array spectrograph system (SEBASS, Vaughan et al., 2003), Telops Hyper-Cam
    LW (Schlerf et al., 2012), or hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer (HyTES,
    Meerdink et al., 2019), opened the field to study the application of spectral
    emissivity for plant stress detection. So far, only two studies pursued the question
    if spectral emissivity can be used for the detection of plant responses to environmental
    stresses. Based on laboratory measurements, Buitrago et al. (2016) were able to
    use spectral emissivity for the detection of cold and water stress on European
    beech (Fagus sylvatica) and rhododendron (Rhododendron cf. catawbiense) leaves.
    Gerhards et al. (2016) successfully showed in a greenhouse experiment that the
    spectral emissivity of potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. Cilena) is equally
    sensitive to water stress as compared to temperature based indices (e.g., CWSI).
    However, further research is needed to better understand the linkages between
    stress, leaf traits and spectral emissivity features. Overall, using emissivity
    as an indicator of thermal stress is challenging as it requires TIR measurements
    at high spectral resolution, correction of atmospheric effects and the separation
    of temperature and emissivity (Gerhards et al., 2019). 3.2. Quantification of
    mild long-term and severe stress using optical reflective approaches Mild long-term,
    chronic or severe stress induces visible symptoms on crop leaves and canopies.
    Those symptoms are also captured by remote sensing data in the reflective optical
    domain, including the VIS, NIR and SWIR. The first remote sensing studies for
    linking remote sensing in the optical domain to stressed vegetation canopies started
    in the early 1970''s (see Fig.1 in Houborg et al., 2015) with the milestone publication
    by Knipling (1970). This study related leaf and canopy spectral signatures to
    effects of physiological stress. With this, Knipling (1970) identified the two
    main groups of traits, which are affected first by medium-term and mild long-term
    stress - the biochemical compounds - and second, those affected by chronic and
    severe stress, i.e. the structural variables. Here we refer to Fig. 2 (the two
    blocks on the right), and Table 1 (second and third lines). The use of these traits
    as stress proxies has since been confirmed by numerous studies. According to Baret
    et al. (2007), for instance, retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) and leaf
    area index (LAI) can serve to diagnose plant (nitrogen) stress: whereas Cab decreases
    due to limited synthesis or destruction of chloroplasts, losses in leaf area (i.e.,
    LAI) indicates a decrease of leaf production going along with an increase in senescence.
    The study of Carter and Knapp (2001), linking a variety of stressors to physiological
    responses, observed that consistent stress induces changes in leaf reflectance
    within the visible range due to changing Cab. In the study of Linke et al. (2008),
    relative leaf water content decreased during water stress periods going along
    with changes in spectral leaf reflectance. It was also found that recovery from
    stress was not reflected by leaf reflectance as expected: still some differences
    remained between the formerly stressed plant and the control plant, suggesting
    that secondary effects followed the stress, such as changes in cell structure
    and biochemistry. This points towards the need to retrieve multiple plant traits
    instead of a single one to accurately diagnose medium or longer lasting stress
    events in crops. To derive traits from optical reflective measurements, it is
    necessary to convert the measured signals into semantic values. Four broad methodological
    categories have been identified recently, and were summarized in the review studies
    of Verrelst et al., 2015, Verrelst et al., 2019a (for general vegetation properties
    retrievals) and specifically for nitrogen in Berger et al. (2020): • parametric
    regressions, referring to the use of VIs; • nonparametric regressions, which include
    chemometric methods and ML regression algorithms, • mechanistic or physically-based,
    using radiative transfer modeling (RTM), and • hybrid approaches, combining ML
    regression algorithms with RTM. The first studies evaluating the use of optical
    reflective RS for nitrogen stress quantification were mainly based on empirical
    relationships employing spectral indices sensitive to chlorophyll content (Penuelas
    et al., 1994). Later, the study of Lebourgeois et al. (2012) used different VIs
    to investigate crop nitrogen status in cases of combined nitrogen and water stresses.
    Further, hyperspectral data opened the opportunity for the development of narrowband
    VIs (Broge and Leblanc, 2001), which were used for estimation of plant water status
    and stress (Gerhards et al., 2019; Zhang and Zhou, 2019). According to Singh et
    al. (2016), ML regression algorithms emerged as one of the most promising tools
    for the retrieval of vegetation traits in the context of stress. ML allows analysing
    huge data sets to detect patterns by simultaneously looking at multiple factors
    instead of analysing each predictor and/or feature (trait) individually. As an
    example of RTM exploitation, the study by Richter et al. (2008) used a look-up
    table (LUT) inversion of the PROSAIL model to estimate LAI, Cab and a soil brightness
    factor for the diagnosis of drought risk zones within wheat fields. Hereby, crop
    growth variability was caused by the sandy soil type, leading to limited water
    availability for the crops, which was reflected in lower LAI and Cab values compared
    to other soil types. Merging physically-based and data-driven methods to hybrid
    approaches seems ideal for functional traits retrieval and thus stress identification
    due to the complementary nature: RTMs provide physical constraints and domain
    knowledge to fast and efficient ML algorithms (Verrelst et al., 2015, Verrelst
    et al., 2021). The efficiency of these hybrid methods can be even enhanced by
    exploring active learning for optimisation of ML training samples (Berger et al.,
    2021). These methods can be powerful for the detection of stress levels, for instance,
    by investigating the ratio of Cab and leaf carotenoid contents (Hendry and Price,
    1993; Sonobe et al., 2020). Recently, Lassalle (2021) reviewed the advances in
    optical reflective hyperspectral remote sensing of plant stress over the last
    five decades. The author pointed out that for most stressors, high to very-high
    spatial resolution is preferable. Optimally, the VNIR spectral region should be
    exploited using VIs and ML methods. In some cases, the SWIR region improved the
    performance of the methods in the analysed studies. Nevertheless, we believe that
    exploiting multiple domains provided by diverse sensors (SIF, TIR, VIS-SWIR) may
    be an advantage over using only hyperspectral optical reflectance. Such a “multi-view”
    is required to obtain more complete insights about stressors, crop physiological
    responses and affected traits. We therefore examined the existing literature to
    identify the current state of the art with respect to multi-domain and multi-sensor
    approaches. 4. Review of multi-domain and multi-sensor studies 4.1. Identification
    of relevant literature The main purpose of the systematic review was to identify
    all published studies detecting agricultural stress by exploring synergies of
    different optical domains. To collect all relevant studies, we followed the approach
    by Cronin et al. (2008). The literature analysis included four main steps: 1.
    identification of relevant literature by means of well-defined keywords, 2. screening
    of the overall suitability of the selected records, 3. evaluation of the eligibility
    and inclusion, i.e. fully scanning the records, and 4. extraction of meta-information.
    In the identification step (1.), the keywords “remote sensing & (fusion OR synergy
    OR multi OR multi-sensor) & stress & (agriculture OR crops)” were searched for
    in ISI Web of Science and similar search engines within the period from 1994 to
    2021. Finally, a large pool of records was collected. The identification step
    followed a first rough checking to remove duplicates. This resulted in approximately
    300 papers eligible for further investigation. In the screening step (2.), at
    first, non-peer reviewed records being considered irrelevant (i.e., conference
    proceedings or reports), were removed. Reading of titles and abstracts led further
    to the exclusion of all records that either focused on other than agricultural
    applications, employed active RS data or were review studies. The screening step
    resulted in a total of 133 studies. In the eligibility part (3.), these 133 studies
    underwent intense screening, i.e. full reading, required to extract the criteria
    listed below. Hereby, records that mentioned stress but focused on yield or soil
    properties, or used only one sensor (or domain) for stress evaluation were excluded.
    From the remaining 96 records, detailed information was extracted, including the
    following variables: • Meta-information: authors, title, journal, year; • Site:
    location, studied vegetation (crop, orchard); • Stress type (biotic, abiotic)
    and specification; • Analysed traits (individual and according to the three trait
    groups, see chapter 2); • Time scale of stress period (short-, medium- and long-term);
    • Observational levels (leaf-level, top-of-canopy or top-of-atmosphere); • Observational
    scales (micro/plant, local, regional, global); • Platforms (handheld, gantry,
    tower, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), airborne, satellite); • Spectral domains
    (VIS, SIF, NIR, SWIR, TIR); • Algorithms (classification, regression, anomaly
    detection); • Methodologies (parametric, nonparametric, RTMs, hybrid, SEBM). Note
    that with the performed literature search we do not claim completeness. There
    is a high certainty of additional potentially relevant records, which may be missed
    due to deviating keywords. However, due to the high number of co-workers and repetitive
    literature searches, we believe to have covered the essential studies exploring
    multiple spectral sensing domains to assess stress in agricultural research. 4.2.
    Factor analysis In a first step, we analysed the contribution of the different
    variables via principal component analysis (PCA), see Fig. 5. A PCA reveals the
    strongest patterns between all variables and thus provides an attractive method
    to explore general trends within the database. In the first dimension (x-axis),
    the largest discrepancies can be found between platforms (satellite vs handheld),
    spectral resolutions (multispectral vs hyperspectral), as well as the duration
    of the stress periods (long-term vs short-term stress). These patterns can be
    interpreted with the investigation of either one or the other aspect, but rarely
    both together. The second dimension (y-axis) indicates, among others, the exclusive
    use of one stress type (biotic or abiotic). In addition, parametric and nonparametric
    nonlinear approaches point towards opposite directions. Download : Download high-res
    image (466KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Principal component
    analysis of literature variables (first two dimensions). Positively correlated
    variables point to the same direction and negatively correlated variables to the
    opposite. The groups refer to the variable categories searched for in the reviewed
    studies (algorithm, classification method, period of stress, platform, regression
    method, scales, spectral domain, spectral resolution, stress type, traits level).
    On the other hand, variables pointing in the same direction may indicate a joint
    usage, for instance, the estimation of biotic stresses (e.g., diseases) by means
    of nonparametric nonlinear approaches (i.e., machine learning), or the estimation
    of abiotic (i.e., drought stress) by parametric methods (e.g., vegetation indices).
    Since this PCA analysis can only give an approximate idea of the complex interplay
    of all these variables, the following sub-chapters describe and illustrate the
    findings for the individual criteria. 4.3. Platforms and sensors Aggregation of
    the publications over 5-year periods reveals clear trends in platform usage over
    time (Fig. 6). While only handheld and airborne platforms prevailed during the
    period 2000–2005, their usage continuously decreased from 2005 onwards. At the
    same time, researchers made increasing use of sensors onboard UAVs (e.g., Di Gennaro
    et al., 2017; Joalland et al., 2018) and satellites (e.g., Anderson et al., 2018;
    Bayat et al., 2018). With respect to UAVs, this can be largely explained by the
    miniaturization of sensor technologies for (hyperspectral) VNIR, SWIR and TIR,
    and recently also for SIF cameras on drones (Gonzalez Toro and Tsourdos, 2021).
    Regarding satellites, multispectral satellite images, such as Sentinel-2 A/B (from
    June 2015) and Landsat (from October 2008), are easily accessible nowadays. The
    analysis further revealed that the majority of UAV spectral domain combinations
    were composed of VIS-NIR-TIR sensors. As SIF measurements are not yet available
    from satellite sensors in spatial resolutions required for precision agriculture
    applications, studies using SIF data mainly explored airborne data sets. Download

    in platform usage for the detection of stress in agriculture over 5-year periods.
    Note that the years refer to a 5-years period, e.g. 2005 stands for 2003–2007.
    4.4. Algorithms and methodologies As discussed in section 3, the detection of
    stress conditions in crops often relies on the estimation of traits linked to
    the crop status. In the investigated studies, most focused on quantifying traits
    using regression or RTM methods, whereas the usage of classification or anomaly
    detection was less pronounced. Among the papers reviewed in this study, about
    72% were based on parametric approaches (e.g., Gerhards et al., 2016; Guan et
    al., 2017; Panigada et al., 2014), 22% on nonparametric linear approaches (e.g.,
    Ainsworth et al., 2014; Sobejano-Paz et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2017), about
    17% on nonparametric nonlinear approaches (e.g., Camino et al., 2021; Gao et al.,
    2009; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2018), nearly 15% on surface energy balance models
    (e.g., Bayat et al., 2018; Bhattarai et al., 2019; Zhuang et al., 2020), 16% used
    radiative transfer models (e.g., Camino et al., 2018; Celesti et al., 2018) and
    only a few on hybrid approaches (e.g., De Grave et al., 2020; Delalieux et al.,
    2014). Note that several studies employed multiple methods. Fig. 7 indicates the
    use of different methodologies in studies published from 1999 to 2021. Though
    a clear trend was missing, we noticed that on a percentual basis, the use of parametric
    and nonparametric linear approaches has been slightly decreasing, while SEBMs,
    RTMs and hybrid approaches gained popularity. With respect to machine learning
    regression algorithms, mainly conventional shallow learning methods were employed,
    such as support vector machine (regression), random forest or neural network approaches.
    Although it may be promising for stress detection, the exploration of deep learning
    algorithms is still missing. RTMs and hybrid approaches have been receiving attention
    in recent years due to improved performance in computational speed, flexibility
    and generic applicability (Verrelst et al., 2019a). Also, they have been demonstrated
    to be attractive methods as regards to mapping large areas, especially in operational
    and global contexts (Verrelst et al., 2015). Accurate and fast mapping of crop
    traits over large cultivated areas by means of these hybrid methods reveals potential
    for the quantification and monitoring of stress-related proxies. Download : Download

    PA: parametric regressions (e.g., vegetation indices), NNA: nonparametric nonlinear
    approaches (e.g., machine learning), NLA: nonparametric linear approaches (e.g.,
    principal component regression), RTM: radiative transfer models (inversion), Hybrid:
    hybrid methods (i.e., combination of RTM and NNA methods), SEBM: surface energy
    balance models. Note that the years refer to a 5-years period, e.g. 2005 stands
    for 2003–2007. Regarding the retrieved traits, Fig. 8 shows that the highest percentage
    of the studies focused on the retrieval of traits related to fluxes (mostly ET),
    followed by those related to biochemical traits and finally structural traits,
    independently of the method used. The only exception are hybrid approaches, which
    were mainly applied to retrieve biochemical traits, rather than those related
    to fluxes. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download full-size

    hybrid methods (i.e., combination of RTM and NNA methods), SEBM: surface energy
    balance models. 4.5. Observational levels and scales Regarding observational levels
    and spatial scales considered in the selected studies, mostly the top-of-canopy
    (TOC) level was addressed with 72%, followed by the leaf level with 45% or both.
    Only six studies addressed (exclusively) the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) level (Bhuiyan
    et al., 2017; Knipper et al., 2019; Mladenova et al., 2017; Navarro et al., 2016).
    The majority of the TOA studies investigated regional scale stress levels. In
    fact, most of the papers considered the field/plot scale (67%), but multiple studies
    addressed the micro/plant scale (i.e., 31%) with little overlap between these
    categories. As illustrated by regional-scale TOA studies, there was a strong relationship
    between the spatial scales and observational levels. For example, all but one
    out of the plant scale studies focused on leaf level traits, with the exception
    of Kim and Glenn (2017), where the authors proposed a new multi-modal stress detection
    system for plants by integrating off-the shelf sensors in a custom-made platform
    and by developing software for processing data flows. 4.6. Spectral domains Overall,
    the number of publications between 1999 and 2021 increased approximately by factor
    of four. With respect to the explored wavelengths, this increase was reflected
    by all domains, though with higher absolute numbers of NIR, VIS and TIR studies
    compared to SWIR and SIF. The utilization and synergistic use of different spectral
    domains within the selected studies is demonstrated by a Venn diagram (Fig. 9).
    Here, we observe that the combination of VIS-NIR-TIR domains represents the largest
    category (N = 33). Regarding the two-domain combinations, the VIS-NIR and VIS-TIR
    were the most often used (N = 5). In addition, the VIS domain was employed by
    the majority of studies. As two spectral regions in the optical reflective domain
    are insufficient to detect short-term stress, the combination with TIR sensors
    proved to be useful. For instance, the study by Baluja et al. (2012) examined
    crop water status using multispectral VIS and NIR sensors along with thermal imagery.
    The authors found that with the latter technology it was possible to detect short-term
    responses. However, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and two other
    VIs calculated from the VIS-NIR data were rather reflecting the results of cumulative
    water deficits on the observed crop, hence its response to chronic stress exposure.

    Fig. 9. Venn diagram visualizing the different combinations of used spectral domains
    (VIS, SIF, NIR, SWIR, and TIR) in the reviewed studies (left). Number of studies
    using different sensor combinations (two to five) with respect to the different
    spectral domains (right). In total, only four studies concurrently exploited all
    five main domains (i.e., VIS, SIF, NIR, SWIR and TIR) (Camino et al., 2021; Gerhards
    et al., 2018; Mahlein et al., 2019; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2018). This gap could
    be explained, among others, by the still limited (for SWIR) and missing (for SIF)
    availability of high spatial resolution satellites, and rather high prizes for
    sensors, such as UAV-suitable cameras. In fact, for the detection of very early
    stresses, the optimal spectral domains could mainly be provided by a combination
    of SIF and TIR, which however, was realized by only a few studies (N = 4) (Chaerle
    et al., 2004, Chaerle et al., 2009; Ni et al., 2015; Pérez-Bueno et al., 2015).
    All in all, these findings suggest that many study designs were mainly driven
    by sensor availability and practical economical reasons, respectively, leading
    to a common usage of VIS-NIR sensors. This was confirmed by a study analysing
    costs of multi-sensor systems (Appeltans et al., 2020), calculating, for instance,
    total costs of 200.000 euros for a combination of a hyperspectral, thermal and
    fluorescence sensor. 4.7. Stress types and plant responses Fig. 10 clearly demonstrates
    that the majority of the selected studies investigated abiotic stress, in particular
    drought stress. On a short-term scale, drought stress influences transpiration
    through stomatal closure (see chapter 2.2). Consequently, the analysis of TIR
    data (i.e., temperature) may provide the most useful information. However, TIR
    sensors struggle with lower spatial and spectral resolutions leading to weaker
    SNR in comparison to sensors measuring optical reflective signals (VSWIR). This
    means if the detectors of both measurement types are of comparable size, less
    energy is available in the TIR than for VSWIR, which limits the applicability
    of TIR in precision farming contexts (Gerhards et al., 2019). Moreover, the TIR
    signal is highly influenced by environmental factors, such as wind turbulence
    and background cover (e.g., weed or soil type) (Döpper et al., 2020). Thus, a
    combination of TIR data with the VNIR/SWIR spectral domains is most common (see
    Fig. 10). Within this combination, the majority of studies investigated long-term
    stress, as such data enable studying different traits with the evolution from
    short-term fluxes to longer-term biochemical and structural changes. Fig. 11 demonstrates
    the behaviour of the three trait groups as a function of stress duration or severity.
    As expected, variations of fluxes have been related most often to short-term stress,
    whereas the structural traits are mainly used as proxies for longer term or chronic
    stress. Interestingly, there is a balance of all three trait groups for the long-term
    stress category (see Fig. 12). It may be explained by the fact that the same traits
    are observed over longer study periods, instead of using only the most responsive
    trait at a certain stress stage. Download : Download high-res image (179KB) Download

    Fig. 12. Detection of different trait groups acting as proxies for crop stress
    in the reviewed studies, aggregated to time scales (short-, medium and long-term
    stress). The traits refer to fluxes-related, such as transpiration or SIF yield,
    biochemicals, i.e. leaf water or pigment contents, and structure-related traits,
    e.g. leaf inclination, LAI or biomass. In particular, the combination of VIS/NIR
    with TIR sensors can increase the accuracy of the long-term stress assessment
    since the same traits are observed based on distinct principles (e.g., Chaerle
    and Van Der Straeten, 2000; Gerhards et al., 2016). As stated above, this specific
    wavelength domain combination is also driven by the availability and comparatively
    low costs of the sensors. In contrast to TIR data, being applied to any time scale,
    SIF data was almost exclusively employed to analyse short-term (flux-related)
    responses (Campbell et al., 2007; Ni et al., 2015; Pérez-Bueno et al., 2015; Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2018). Similarly to the analysis of TIR data, the SIF signal might be
    weak and interpretability can be increased by combining the data with measurements
    from other spectral domains (e.g., Alonso et al., 2017; Celesti et al., 2018;
    Chaerle et al., 2009). Overall, we found that studies including SIF data were
    rather underrepresented. A smaller number of studies focused on biotic stress
    (see Fig. 10), mainly disease detection (e.g., Bendel et al., 2020; Mahlein et
    al., 2019; Savian et al., 2020). Here we observed a large variety in the combination
    of spectral domains. However, it must be remarked that the number of analysed
    traits in those studies was also large, including structural, biophysical and
    biochemical traits. In conclusion, we observed that the majority of reviewed studies
    was rather restricted to a comparison of the outcomes by diverse sensors and spectral
    domains as opposed to a synergistic usage of the multi-domain data. Only a few
    studies were working on synergistic integration of RS data from various spectral
    domains (e.g., Zarco-Tejada et al., 2018) targeting stress detection. 4.8. Disentangling
    abiotic and biotic stress sources Since plant pathogens pose an enormous threat
    to global food security causing yield losses exceeding 30% in selected regions
    or even up to 100% on a local scale (Savary et al., 2019; Zarco-Tejada et al.,
    2021), we address this specific topic here. The differentiation of biotic and
    abiotic stressors is a challenging task, as symptoms triggered by pathogens may
    be confounded with abiotic-induced responses. Also, the distinction between multiple
    biotic-induced stressors remains to be investigated, in order to provide quantitative
    tools for pre-symptomatic disease detection allowing respective measures and adaptation
    of management practices. So far, only a few studies focused on disentangling infection
    sources with similar symptoms (e.g., Fallon et al., 2020; Gold et al., 2020; Moshou
    et al., 2014; Poblete et al., 2021). Gold et al. (2020), for instance, sampled
    hyperspectral measurements of hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogen-affected
    potato crops, estimating multiple traits over the optical reflective domains,
    which were synergistically explored using chemometric models. This approach allowed
    to provide a pre- and post-symptomatic differentiation of the two foliar diseases.
    In Poblete et al. (2021), olive trees affected by two pathogenes were investigated,
    restricting water and nutrient flow through the xylem, which leads to symptoms
    similar to those caused by drought stress. The authors applied three-stage machine
    learning algorithms to airborne hyperspectral and thermal imagery to discriminate
    the two diseases successfully. Zarco-Tejada et al. (2021) explored thermal and
    hyperspectral reflectance data revealing the existence of divergent pathogen-
    and host-specific spectral pathways through uncoupling of specific biotic and
    abiotic spectral effects. All in all, these studies concluded that a multi-sensor
    approach is absolutely necessary for in-depth stress analysis, and presented in
    a pioneering way how synergy of different domains and sensors (mainly with hyperspectral
    resolutions in the VIS/NIR/SWIR domain) can be used to predict and distinguish
    biotic and abiotic stressors. However, it needs to be mentioned that differentiation
    is still vague in many cases and advanced methods such as machine learning should
    be explored (Behmann et al., 2015; Neupane and Baysal-Gurel, 2021). The review
    by Zhang et al. (2019) about monitoring plant diseases and pests using RS also
    concluded that the detection of abiotic stress is still challenging and under-exploited
    through the simultaneous appearance of multiple stressors. Hence, we need to advance
    near real-time detection at larger spatial scales, especially for pests, pathogens
    and diseases, causing significant global production losses (Savary et al., 2019).
    This is even more evident, as our literature analysis revealed that the majority
    of available studies in this domain rather concentrated on single crops and pathogens
    at local and experimental levels. 5. New concepts of sensor synergies Combining
    distinct spectral domains acquired from one or multiple sensors leads to more
    data for an improved (post-)processing of signals or quantities to derive plant
    physiological, biochemical and structural information. In addition, it offers
    advanced possibilities to observe a complete range of plant responses (i.e., traits),
    which can be directly related to stress. This review has clearly indicated a possibly
    strong - and currently largely underexploited - potential of using spectral information
    from multiple sensors or domains in a synergistic way for crop stress detection,
    monitoring and management. Based on these insights, we propose four ways forward
    to increasing complexity by employing multi-domains data, as delineated in Fig.
    13, fostering: • Combined acquisition and analysis of spectral data from multiple
    sensors representing multiple modalities and using parametric regressions (see
    Section 5.1); • Simultaneous retrieval of plant traits using multi-domain RTMs
    and ML methods (see Section 5.2); • Assimilation of estimated plant traits based
    on data from different spectral domains into mechanistic models (see Section 5.3);
    • Conceptual framework: Development of fully integrated mechanistic and radiative
    transfer models directly simulating the full variety of spectral measurements
    that can thereafter be assimilated (see Section 5.4). Download : Download high-res

    synergies for stress detection with increasing complexity. The colors blue, green,
    orange and red refer to the spectral domains VIS/NIR, SIF, SWIR, and TIR, respectively,
    and with respect to the derived indices or traits. The indices and traits in the
    small coloured boxes are some selected representative examples. The box on the
    right shows the concept of our proposed conceptual framework, the iCGM - integrated
    crop growth model. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
    legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 5.1. Combined
    acquisition and analysis of multi-sensor data In the short run - and directly
    feasible with existing methodologies and sensors - we believe that stress detection
    towards operational monitoring should employ at least one sensor and one parametric
    regression or classification method per trait group (i.e. functional, biochemical,
    structural), typically representing plant adaptation responses at varying time
    scales (see Fig.13, left). The synergistic database can then be used to train
    machine learning regression algorithms for generating crop stress prediction models.
    This procedure may allow: i) to better understand the sensitivity of various spectral
    indices to stress occurrence, which will ultimately enable ii) to distinguish
    between diverse stress severity (e.g. mild to severe water stress). For instance,
    Zarco-Tejada et al. (2021) obtained several spectral traits from multi-sensor
    data and used the derived spectral fingerprints for distinguishing different diseases.
    Another study by Damm et al. (2022) investigated temporal sensitivity of multi-sensor
    derived vegetation information for evolving water stress. Since such kinds of
    studies are still scarce, we advocate more research aiming to obtain a holistic
    view of plants under biotic and abiotic stress through synergistic usage of spectral
    information from multiple sensors or domains. However, the differentiation between
    distinct types of stresses (e.g. water-deficit or nutrient stress) will remain
    a challenge with purely RS-based approaches because distinct stressors often lead
    to similar stress reactions (Poblete et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2019). 5.2. Simultaneous
    retrieval of plant traits employing multi-sensor data, multi-domain RTMs and hybrid
    retrieval methods As a second strategy, we encourage exploiting multi-domain radiative
    transfer models for simultaneous usage of VNIR/SWIR hyperspectral, TIR and SIF
    observations (Yang et al., 2020b). One advantage of using a unified radiative
    transfer scheme for these spectral domains is that the retrieval can be better
    constrained. For example, several studies retrieved crop traits and stress responses
    by combining the VNIR/SWIR and SIF signals with the model SCOPE (Celesti et al.,
    2018; Van der Tol et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019) and FluorFlight (Hernández-Clemente
    et al., 2017). The analogy of radiative transfer among these spectral domains
    and between reflected and emitted radiation enabled the decomposition of SIF patterns
    into structure related effects (such as leaf inclinations) and physiological stress
    responses. Some of the difficulties of using TIR data can also be overcome with
    multi-domain radiative transfer modeling. For example, Duffour et al. (2015) used
    vegetation traits that can be retrieved from VNIR/SWIR data in SCOPE to simulate
    radiative transfer in the TIR domain as well as the directionality of the TIR
    signal. The improved understanding of the influence of the geometry dependent
    fraction of sunlit and shaded leaves and soil supports the interpretation of TIR
    for stress detection. The inclusion of photosynthesis and non-radiative heat exchange
    (evaporative and convective cooling) in a RTM opens further possibilities for
    multi-domain retrieval. Stomatal and photochemical responses, for example, can
    simultaneously respond to variations in incident solar radiation, both affecting
    the TIR and SIF emissions and radiation absorption in the VIS. With such integrated
    approach, the joint retrieval from the VNIR and TIR domains (Bayat et al., 2018)
    or from the VNIR and SIF (Pacheco-Labrador et al., 2019b) enables the estimation
    of photochemical parameters and stomatal aperture. Suarez et al. (2021) retrieved
    photosynthetic parameters from SCOPE, but using hyperspectral data of the VNIR
    region including subtle responses in the 530–570 nm range caused by xanthophyll
    pigment changes associated with non-photochemical quenching in response to excess
    light as modelled by Vilfan et al. (2018). These studies demonstrate the benefit
    of multi-domain and multi-process models, but analysis of such datasets can be
    complex and computationally intensive. For larger datasets, the capabilities of
    these models can be preserved without additional computational burden by using
    machine learning or deep learning approaches: the retrieval of proxies could be
    accomplished by means of hybrid approaches which combine machine learning with
    RTMs (Verrelst et al., 2019a), as delineated in Fig.13 (second left). 5.3. Assimilation
    of remotely derived crop traits into crop growth models For efficient stress detection
    and prognosis, the assimilation of spatially derived trait maps from RS observations
    into crop growth models (CGM) (e.g., van Diepen et al., 1989; Hank et al., 2015;
    Jones et al., 2003) would be beneficial. These mechanistic models also account
    for weather and soil variables or agricultural management practices, which could
    help to identify the cause of the stress (Baret et al., 2007). The continuous
    description of crop growth and development using mechanistic models offers means
    to summarize current knowledge about the main processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum, which also include stress related processes and phenomena (Weiss et
    al., 2020). Therefore, we propose to explore this concept (see also Fig.13, second
    right), which can serve for the development of a digital twin (DT) of the farming
    system (Verdouw et al., 2021). Such DTs are digital equivalents of real-life objects,
    virtually mirroring the behaviour and states of physical systems over their whole
    lifetime (Grieves and Vickers, 2016). In relation to precision agriculture applications,
    current state-of-the-art CGMs include advanced crop growth models (Peng et al.,
    2018), crop-specific parameterizations (Boas et al., 2021; Sulis et al., 2015),
    and crop management practices like irrigation and nitrogen fertilization (Lombardozzi
    et al., 2020). The synergistic use of CGMs and RS is already being explored for
    building operational monitoring and prediction platforms capable of delivering
    useful information for agricultural applications and decisions (e.g., McNally
    et al., 2017; Peters-Lidard et al., 2021). These platforms are mainly based on
    the assimilation of water cycle measurements (e.g., soil moisture) and remotely
    sensed vegetation variables (e.g., LAI), obtaining clear improvements in the estimation
    of vegetation biomass, evapotranspiration, root zone soil moisture, and carbon
    fluxes. More complex and realistic representation of physical processes recently
    implemented in CGMs and the exploitation of the different optical domains in RS
    open the opportunity to predict better a wider range of crop processes, most notably
    to capture the onset of crop water and heat stress, reducing also the uncertainty
    in crop model variable estimation. The assimilation of multiple data streams into
    CGMs and thus the establishment of DTs, represents also a viable approach for
    getting an improved understanding about physical mechanisms and feedback controlling
    the development, duration, and impacts of stress on plant growth and yield. However,
    significant challenges have to be addressed in order to fully exploit this potential.
    These challenges include consistency checks between diverse RS observations and
    between the retrieval algorithms and the crop model parameterizations, as well
    as the robust quantification of the uncertainties along traceable processing chains.
    5.4. Proposed conceptional framework: Integration of crop growth and radiative
    transfer models Future stress research should focus on the integration of suitable
    multi-domain radiative transfer models (e.g. SCOPE) with dynamic crop growth models
    to build up DTs of agroecosystems. Such integrated models (iCGMs) directly simulate
    remotely observed signals based on the status of the underlying CGM at any given
    point in time (see Fig.13, right). This means the iCGM simulates the spectral
    signatures of the canopy (400–2500 nm), the SIF emission as well as the thermal
    properties, along with physiological processes (Delécolle et al., 1992; Moulin
    et al., 1998). The integration of CGMs and RTMs has several compelling advantages.
    On the one hand, the CGM can benefit from all available satellite data while the
    assimilation scheme can weigh the value of observations by using information about
    their uncertainties. However, combining data with various spatial and temporal
    resolution needs to be considered carefully in the conceptual design (Huang et
    al., 2019). Traits that appear both as a status variable in the CGM and as an
    input of the RTM have to permit the RTM to simulate spectral properties across
    all domains. For the number of traits, being sensitive in the different spectral
    domains, assimilation strategies need to be developed taking into account the
    different availability (timing) of sensor data. The assimilation needs to allow
    for a model update at different times, where only a part of the variables are
    assimilated, with model-intern constraints and links to further variables. On
    the other hand, the RTM could benefit from the background information of the CGM.
    Satellite derived time series of vegetation traits can be noisy due to atmospheric,
    orbital and geometric effects. The use of retrievals in close proximity in time
    as background information has shown to be effective in making the satellite data
    smoother (Mousivand et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2021b). CGMs provide continuous
    series of temporal growth dynamics which can be used to detect outliers and to
    improve the construction of smooth time-series from heterogeneous satellite data.
    In this respect, the use of a CGM assimilating these data is a step up. Furthermore,
    by inserting a morphological sub-model, one could simulate the physiological appearance
    of plants, which lead - using a suitable sensor model - to temporal evolution
    of point clouds observable through photogrammetry or Lidar (Liu et al., 2019).
    Expanding existing RTMs from the optical spectral domain to the microwave range
    would similarly lead to the simulation of temporal sequences of (active and passive)
    microwave signatures (e.g. using a RADAR backscatter model). The combined set
    of spectral properties would be simulated simultaneously for each time step of
    the iCGM, which ideally should be hourly. For executing iCGMs over large areas
    in high temporal and spatial resolutions, this physically based modeling could
    be combined with machine learning to estimate traits or stress proxies within
    a hybrid manner. The complex models can also be partly replaced through surrogate
    models or emulators speeding up the forward simulations (Verrelst et al., 2019b).
    As CGMs are driven by weather variables, it is also easy to conceive the integration
    of weather forecasts and/or weather scenarios in such iCGM (see Section 5.3).
    This dynamic nature would meet the requirements of a DT of agroecosystems, which
    besides the representation of current behaviour, also predicts their future behaviour
    (Verdouw et al., 2021). Therefore, we consider the iCGM as the most promising
    approach and this section is meant as a way to stimulate further discussion about
    DTs within the community. Once developed, such iCGMs facilitate tackling various
    research gaps needed to define future sensitive Earth observational approaches
    and stimulate the development of applications in the realm of precision agriculture.
    In the near future, we will have a multitude of spectral data available to feed
    the proposed iCGM. Besides the recently available and upcoming spaceborne imagine
    spectrometer data, such as the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP)
    (Guanter et al., 2015), PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA)
    (Cogliati et al., 2021; Loizzo et al., 2019), Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging
    Mission for the Environment (Rast et al., 2021) or the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal
    Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) data (Fisher et al., 2020),
    UAVs became a crucial platform with respect to sensor synergies. Several light
    multi- and hyperspectral VIS, NIR and SWIR, thermal and SIF sensors are available
    nowadays (overviews provided by Aasen et al. (2018); Awais et al. (2022); Herrmann
    and Berger (2021); Messina and Modica (2020); Neupane and Baysal-Gurel (2021);
    Yang et al. (2017a)), which can be explored for model development or validation
    of physiological traits related to crop stress. Besides spectral synergies, the
    exploitation of multi-scale multi-sensor data allows to fill temporal gaps and
    improve spatial resolutions. Hence, such upcoming multi-scale approaches are foreseen
    to play a more dominant role in future studies (Alvarez-Vanhard et al., 2021;
    Inoue et al., 2018; Machwitz et al., 2021; Sagan et al., 2019). Some applications
    and use cases of our proposed conceptional framework are laid out below. Sensitivity
    assessment of state-of-the-art approaches: Remote sensing measurements and retrieved
    crop information can be subject to insensitivity or uncertainties caused by various
    sources, e.g., instrumental effects and calibration issues (Pacheco-Labrador et
    al., 2019a), spatial-spectral-temporal sampling design (Aasen et al., 2019), retrieval
    assumptions (Cendrero-Mateo et al., 2019), cf. Buman et al. (2022) for an overview
    of related uncertainties on SIF. Such effects can result in a mismatch between
    expected and observed crop behaviour (e.g. spatio-temporal dynamics of crop state
    variables). The proposed conceptual framework (section 5.4) can be applied to
    facilitate sensitivity analysis aiming to assess potential crop responses and
    their spatio-temporal dynamics. Resulting insights allow us to identify sensitive
    wavelength regions, sampling schemes, and sensor modalities for crop stress symptoms.
    In this way, artificially modulated dynamics inherent to state-of-the art observational
    approaches, e.g., trends caused by sensor degradation, anomalies, and covariance
    between traits due to imperfect retrievals, can be unraveled. Benchmarking and
    uncertainty assessment for mission development: Experimental or operational satellite
    missions require dedicated tools to define scientific needs and requirements (Malenovský
    et al., 2012). The conceptual framework holds the capacity to support the evaluation
    of such requirements. One example is to parameterize the framework with densely
    sampled multi-sensor data to assess subtle stress responses of crops, such as
    photosynthesis, gas exchange or pigment degradation (Jin et al., 2018). In an
    ablation study, data scarcity can be simulated to quantify uncertainties related
    to e.g. reduced spectral, temporal and spatial resolutions. Resulting insights
    allow assessing critical sampling dimensions for various stress symptoms and to
    make recommendations towards new experimental or operational crop stress missions
    or to design dedicated in situ or close range approaches. Stress detection via
    anomalies: The framework allows to calculate potential crop states and functioning
    (e.g. growth rates, gas exchange) as induced by environmental drivers (Huang et
    al., 2019). The comparison of actual estimates of crop state and functioning against
    its simulated potential offers a pathway to identify anomalous crop conditions
    (e.g. caused by crop stress). Forecasting of crop stress and tools: The framework
    allows to learn - through simulation - how ecosystems behave under current and
    future environmental conditions, also known as scenario analysis (Machwitz et
    al., 2018). The coupling also enables forecasting of crop stress responses when
    upcoming growth conditions can be reasonably well simulated. The ultimate goal
    of developing advanced crop monitoring and forecasting tools is to provide reliable
    and usable information to public and private stakeholders in the agricultural
    sector. This goal can be achieved by targeting distinct spatial scales (i.e.,
    from field to the regional scale) and temporal horizons (from short-range to seasonal)
    that match with farmers'' activities and planning. In this context, the seamless
    integration of CGM + RTM data assimilation cycles into operational weather forecast
    chains that cover the full temporal spectrum of farmers'' decisions appears the
    most straightforward approach in order to accomplish this objective. The additional
    use of meteorological information relevant during the distinct crop development
    stages (e.g., accumulated heat time, probability of heat/cold stress) also has
    the advantage to improve the interpretation of environmental stresses for a given
    crop development stage (McNally et al., 2017; Peters-Lidard et al., 2021). The
    wealth of numerical information extracted from such monitoring and forecasting
    tools needs to be translated into crop-specific stress indicators to create an
    interface between scientific advancements and the decision-making process. Finally,
    the probabilistic character of the meteorological forecasts and the uncertainties
    in RS observations and numerical models formulations must be accounted for. 6.
    Conclusions Timely and efficient detection of crop stress remains a challenge
    but can be approached by exploring multiple RS data sources. In addition, the
    portfolio of available tools and retrieval methods for the identification of specific
    stresses has been increasing in the last decade. In this review, we focused on
    the use of optical sensor synergies for improving spectral sampling to better
    characterize and interpret crop stresses in support of sustainable agriculture.
    We identified three different phases (stages) of stress depending on duration
    and severity: (1) early and short-term, (2) medium-term and mild (3) chronic and
    severe. The three phases can best be detected by optical RS domains through specifically
    affected traits, such as fluxes at early stages sensed by SIF and TIR, and biochemicals
    and structural properties at later stress stages, measured with reflective optical
    systems in the VIS, NIR and SWIR wavelength ranges. Our review revealed that the
    combination of VIS, NIR and TIR domains was employed by the majority of studies
    addressing crop stress. However, this choice was mainly driven by economical and
    practical reasons, i.e. the availability of sensors. Furthermore, in most publications,
    the exploration of diverse spectral domains was rather based on a comparison of
    respective methods than on synergistic and integrated methodological concepts.
    An efficient crop stress detection framework has to be versatile, easy to operate,
    and inexpensive so that it can be easily integrated into precision agriculture
    and breeding systems. To achieve this, we pursue four ways forward of increasing
    complexity. These possible concepts involve: (i) Combined analysis of data from
    multiple sensors using representative parametric regressions and ML approaches,
    leading to qualitative stress maps. (ii) Simultaneous retrieval of plant traits
    using multi-domain RTMs and ML methods, providing quantitative stress maps. (iii)
    Assimilation of estimated plant traits based on data from different spectral domains
    into CGMs, and integrated dynamic CGMs (iv), which both lead to quantitative stress
    and stressor maps also enabling stress prediction. In this way, the digital twinning
    of agroecosystems provides a new perspective for real-life, highly accurate and
    holistic views of stress and stressors, allowing to act on time and thus contributing
    to a sustainable agricultural production needed to feed the future world population.
    Hence, we suggest that the community progresses towards such a DT design for stress
    effects, causes and prediction in a joint initiative. Such a synergistic approach
    has the potential to extract essential information about the plant stress status
    and may reveal the causes of biophysical, physiological and photochemical changes
    over cultivated areas in space and time. Funding This research was funded by the

  explanation: Hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing are two advanced sensing
    technologies that can be used for non-invasive plant stress detection. Hyperspectral
    imaging captures images of an object across hundreds of narrow, contiguous wavelength
    bands. This data can be used to identify subtle changes in plant reflectance that
    can indicate stress. Thermal sensing measures the temperature of an object. This
    data can be used to identify areas of plant tissue that are stressed, as these
    areas will often have a different temperature than healthy tissue.

    successfully applied in various domains, it has recently entered also the domain
    of agriculture. In this paper, we perform a survey of 40 research efforts that
    employ deep learning techniques, applied to various agricultural and food production
    challenges. We examine the particular agricultural problems under study, the specific
    models and frameworks employed, the sources, nature and pre-processing of data
    used, and the overall performance achieved according to the metrics used at each
    work under study. Moreover, we study comparisons of deep learning with other existing
    popular techniques, in respect to differences in classification or regression
    performance. Our findings indicate that deep learning provides high accuracy,
    outperforming existing commonly used image processing techniques. Previous article

    Smart farming (Tyagi, 2016) is important for tackling the challenges of agricultural
    production in terms of productivity, environmental impact, food security and sustainability
    (Gebbers and Adamchuk, 2010). As the global population has been continuously increasing
    (Kitzes et al., 2008), a large increase on food production must be achieved (FAO,
    2009), maintaining at the same time availability and high nutritional quality
    across the globe, protecting the natural ecosystems by using sustainable farming
    procedures. To address these challenges, the complex, multivariate and unpredictable
    agricultural ecosystems need to be better understood by monitoring, measuring
    and analyzing continuously various physical aspects and phenomena. This implies
    analysis of big agricultural data (Kamilaris et al., 2017b), and the use of new
    information and communication technologies (ICT) (Kamilaris et al., 2016), both
    for short-scale crop/farm management as well as for larger-scale ecosystems’ observation,
    enhancing the existing tasks of management and decision/policy making by context,
    situation and location awareness. Larger-scale observation is facilitated by remote
    sensing (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000), performed by means of satellites, airplanes
    and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) (i.e. drones), providing wide-view snapshots
    of the agricultural environments. It has several advantages when applied to agriculture,
    being a well-known, non-destructive method to collect information about earth
    features while data may be obtained systematically over large geographical areas.
    A large subset of the volume of data collected through remote sensing involve
    images. Images constitute, in many cases, a complete picture of the agricultural
    environments and could address a variety of challenges (Liaghat and Balasundram,
    2010, Ozdogan et al., 2010). Hence, imaging analysis is an important research
    area in the agricultural domain and intelligent data analysis techniques are being
    used for image identification/classification, anomaly detection etc., in various
    agricultural applications (Teke et al., 2013, Saxena and Armstrong, 2014, Singh
    et al., 2016). The most popular techniques and applications are presented in Appendix
    A, together with the sensing methods employed to acquire the images. From existing
    sensing methods, the most common one is satellite-based, using multi-spectral
    and hyperspectral imaging. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), thermal and near infrared
    (NIR) cameras are being used in a lesser but increasing extent (Ishimwe et al.,
    2014), while optical and X-ray imaging are being applied in fruit and packaged
    food grading. The most popular techniques used for analyzing images include machine
    learning (ML) (K-means, support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks
    (ANN) amongst others), linear polarizations, wavelet-based filtering, vegetation
    indices (NDVI) and regression analysis (Saxena and Armstrong, 2014, Singh et al.,
    2016). Besides the aforementioned techniques, a new one which is recently gaining
    momentum is deep learning (DL) (LeCun et al., 2015, LeCun and Bengio, 1995). DL
    belongs to the machine learning computational field and is similar to ANN. However,
    DL is about “deeper” neural networks that provide a hierarchical representation
    of the data by means of various convolutions. This allows larger learning capabilities
    and thus higher performance and precision. A brief description of DL is attempted
    in Section 3. The motivation for preparing this survey stems from the fact that
    DL in agriculture is a recent, modern and promising technique with growing popularity,
    while advancements and applications of DL in other domains indicate its large
    potential. The fact that today there exists at least 40 research efforts employing
    DL to address various agricultural problems with very good results, encouraged
    the authors to prepare this survey. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first
    such survey in the agricultural domain, while a small number of more general surveys
    do exist (Deng and Yu, 2014, Wan et al., 2014, Najafabadi et al., 2015), covering
    related work in DL in other domains. 2. Methodology The bibliographic analysis
    in the domain under study involved two steps: (a) collection of related work and
    (b) detailed review and analysis of this work. In the first step, a keyword-based
    search for conference papers or journal articles was performed from the scientific
    databases IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect, and from the web scientific indexing
    services Web of Science and Google Scholar. As search keywords, we used the following
    query: [“deep learning”] AND [“agriculture” OR ”farming“] In this way, we filtered
    out papers referring to DL but not applied to the agricultural domain. From this
    effort, 47 papers had been initially identified. Restricting the search for papers
    with appropriate application of the DL technique and meaningful findings1, the
    initial number of papers reduced to 40. In the second step, the 40 papers selected
    from the previous step were analyzed one-by-one, considering the following research
    questions: 1. Which was the agricultural- or food-related problem they addressed?
    2. Which was the general approach and type of DL-based models employed? 3. Which
    sources and types of data had been used? 4. Which were the classes and labels
    as modeled by the authors? Were there any variations among them, observed by the
    authors? 5. Any pre-processing of the data or data augmentation techniques used?
    6. Which has been the overall performance depending on the metric adopted? 7.
    Did the authors test the performance of their models on different datasets? 8.
    Did the authors compare their approach with other techniques and, if yes, which
    was the difference in performance? Our main findings are presented in Section
    4 and the detailed information per paper is listed in Appendix B. 3. Deep learning
    DL extends classical ML by adding more “depth” (complexity) into the model as
    well as transforming the data using various functions that allow data representation
    in a hierarchical way, through several levels of abstraction (Schmidhuber, 2015,
    LeCun and Bengio, 1995). A strong advantage of DL is feature learning, i.e. the
    automatic feature extraction from raw data, with features from higher levels of
    the hierarchy being formed by the composition of lower level features (LeCun et
    al., 2015). DL can solve more complex problems particularly well and fast, because
    of more complex models used, which allow massive parallelization (Pan and Yang,
    2010). These complex models employed in DL can increase classification accuracy
    or reduce error in regression problems, provided there are adequately large datasets
    available describing the problem. DL consists of various different components
    (e.g. convolutions, pooling layers, fully connected layers, gates, memory cells,
    activation functions, encode/decode schemes etc.), depending on the network architecture
    used (i.e. Unsupervised Pre-trained Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent
    Neural Networks, Recursive Neural Networks). The highly hierarchical structure
    and large learning capacity of DL models allow them to perform classification
    and predictions particularly well, being flexible and adaptable for a wide variety
    of highly complex (from a data analysis perspective) challenges (Pan and Yang,
    2010). Although DL has met popularity in numerous applications dealing with raster-based
    data (e.g. video, images), it can be applied to any form of data, such as audio,
    speech, and natural language, or more generally to continuous or point data such
    as weather data (Sehgal et al., 2017), soil chemistry (Song et al., 2016) and
    population data (Demmers et al., 2012). An example DL architecture is displayed
    in Fig. 1, illustrating CaffeNet (Jia et al., 2014), an example of a convolutional
    neural network, combining convolutional and fully connected (dense) layers. Download

    CaffeNet, an example CNN architecture. Source: Sladojevic et al. (2016). Convolutional
    Neural Networks (CNN) constitute a class of deep, feed-forward ANN, and they appear
    in numerous of the surveyed papers as the technique used (17 papers, 42%). As
    the figure shows, various convolutions are performed at some layers of the network,
    creating different representations of the learning dataset, starting from more
    general ones at the first larger layers, becoming more specific at the deeper
    layers. The convolutional layers act as feature extractors from the input images
    whose dimensionality is then reduced by the pooling layers. The convolutional
    layers encode multiple lower-level features into more discriminative features,
    in a way that is spatially context-aware. They may be understood as banks of filters
    that transform an input image into another, highlighting specific patterns. The
    fully connected layers, placed in many cases near the output of the model, act
    as classifiers exploiting the high-level features learned to classify input images
    in predefined classes or to make numerical predictions. They take a vector as
    input and produce another vector as output. An example visualization of leaf images
    after each processing step of the CaffeNet CNN, at a problem of identifying plant
    diseases, is depicted in Fig. 2. We can observe that after each processing step,
    the particular elements of the image that reveal the indication of a disease become
    more evident, especially at the final step (Pool5). Download : Download high-res

    output layers images after each processing step of the CaffeNet CNN (i.e. convolution,
    pooling, normalization) at a plant disease identification problem based on leaf
    images. Source: Sladojevic et al. (2016). One of the most important advantages
    of using DL in image processing is the reduced need of feature engineering (FE).
    Previously, traditional approaches for image classification tasks had been based
    on hand-engineered features, whose performance affected heavily the overall results.
    FE is a complex, time-consuming process which needs to be altered whenever the
    problem or the dataset changes. Thus, FE constitutes an expensive effort that
    depends on experts’ knowledge and does not generalize well (Amara et al., 2017).
    On the other hand, DL does not require FE, locating the important features itself
    through training. A disadvantage of DL is the generally longer training time.
    However, testing time is generally faster than other methods ML-based methods
    (Chen et al., 2014). Other disadvantages include problems that might occur when
    using pre-trained models on datasets that are small or significantly different,
    optimization issues because of the models’ complexity, as well as hardware restrictions.
    In Section 5, we discuss over advantages and disadvantages of DL as they reveal
    through the surveyed papers. 3.1. Available architectures, datasets and tools
    There exist various successful and popular architectures, which researchers may
    use to start building their models instead of starting from scratch. These include
    AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), CaffeNet (Jia et al., 2014) (displayed in Fig.
    1), VGG (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014), GoogleNet (Szegedy et al., 2015) and Inception-ResNet
    (Szegedy et al., 2017), among others. Each architecture has different advantages
    and scenarios where it is more appropriate to be used (Canziani et al., 2016).
    It is also worth noting that almost all of the aforementioned models come along
    with their weights pre-trained, which means that their network had been already
    trained by some dataset and has thus learned to provide accurate classification
    for some particular problem domain (Pan and Yang, 2010). Common datasets used
    for pre-training DL architectures include ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009) and PASCAL
    VOC (PASCAL VOC Project, 2012) (see also Appendix C). Moreover, there exist various
    tools and platforms allowing researchers to experiment with DL (Bahrampour et
    al., 2015). The most popular ones are Theano, TensorFlow, Keras (which is an application
    programmer''s interface on top of Theano and TensorFlow), Caffe, PyTorch, TFLearn,
    Pylearn2 and the Deep Learning Matlab Toolbox. Some of these tools (i.e. Theano,
    Caffe) incorporate popular architectures such as the ones mentioned above (i.e.
    AlexNet, VGG, GoogleNet), either as libraries or classes. For a more elaborate
    description of the DL concept and its applications, the reader could refer to
    existing bibliography (Schmidhuber, 2015, Deng and Yu, 2014, Wan et al., 2014,
    Najafabadi et al., 2015, Canziani et al., 2016, Bahrampour et al., 2015). 4. Deep
    learning applications in agriculture In Appendix B, we list the 40 identified
    relevant works, indicating the agricultural-related research area, the particular
    problem they address, DL models and architectures implemented, sources of data
    used, classes and labels of the data, data pre-processing and/or augmentation
    employed, overall performance achieved according to the metrics adopted, as well
    as comparisons with other techniques, wherever available. 4.1. Areas of use Sixteen
    areas have been identified in total, with the popular ones being identification
    of weeds (5 papers), land cover classification (4 papers), plant recognition (4
    papers), fruits counting (4 papers) and crop type classification (4 papers). It
    is remarkable that all papers, except from Demmers et al., 2010, Demmers et al.,
    2012, Chen et al., 2014, were published during or after 2015, indicating how recent
    and modern this technique is, in the domain of agriculture. More precisely, from
    the remaining 37 papers, 15 papers have been published in 2017, 15 in 2016 and
    7 in 2015. The large majority of the papers deal with image classification and
    identification of areas of interest, including detection of obstacles (e.g. (Steen
    et al., 2016, Christiansen et al., 2016)) and fruit counting (e.g. (Rahnemoonfar
    and Sheppard, 2017, Sa et al., 2016)). Some papers focus on predicting future
    parameters, such as corn yield (Kuwata and Shibasaki, 2015) soil moisture content
    at the field (Song et al., 2016) and weather conditions (Sehgal et al., 2017).
    From another perspective, most papers (20) target crops, while few works consider
    issues such as weed detection (8 papers), land cover (4 papers), research on soil
    (2 papers), livestock agriculture (3 papers), obstacle detection (3 papers) and
    weather prediction (1 paper). 4.2. Data sources Observing the sources of data
    used to train the DL model at every paper, large datasets of images are mainly
    used, containing thousands of images in some cases, either real ones (e.g. (Mohanty
    et al., 2016, Reyes et al., 2015, Dyrmann et al., 2016a)), or synthetic produced
    by the authors (Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard, 2017, Dyrmann et al., 2016b). Some
    datasets originate from well-known and publicly-available datasets such as PlantVillage,
    LifeCLEF, MalayaKew, UC Merced and Flavia (see Appendix C), while others constitute
    sets of real images collected by the authors for their research needs (e.g. (Sladojevic
    et al., 2016, Bargoti and Underwood, 2016, Xinshao and Cheng, 2015, Sørensen et
    al., 2017)). Papers dealing with land cover, crop type classification and yield
    estimation, as well as some papers related to weed detection employ a smaller
    number of images (e.g. tens of images), produced by UAV (Lu et al., 2017, Rebetez
    et al., 2016, Milioto et al., 2017), airborne (Chen et al., 2014, Luus et al.,
    2015) or satellite-based remote sensing (Kussul et al., 2017, Minh et al., 2017,
    Ienco et al., 2017, Rußwurm and Körner, 2017). A particular paper investigating
    segmentation of root and soil uses images from X-ray tomography (Douarre et al.,
    2016). Moreover, some papers use text data, collected either from repositories
    (Kuwata and Shibasaki, 2015, Sehgal et al., 2017) or field sensors (Song et al.,
    2016, Demmers et al., 2010, Demmers et al., 2012). In general, the more complicated
    the problem to be solved, the more data is required. For example, problems involving
    large number of classes to identify (Mohanty et al., 2016, Reyes et al., 2015,
    Xinshao and Cheng, 2015) and/or small Variation among the classes (Luus et al.,
    2015, Rußwurm and Körner, 2017, Yalcin, 2017, Namin et al., 2017, Xinshao and
    Cheng, 2015), require large number of input images to train their models. 4.3.
    Data variation Variation between classes is necessary for the DL models to be
    able to differentiate features and characteristics, and perform accurate classifications.2
    Hence, accuracy is positively correlated with variation among classes. Nineteen
    papers (47%) revealed some aspects of poor data variation. Luus et al. (2015)
    observed high relevance between some land cover classes (i.e. medium density and
    dense residential, buildings and storage tanks) while Ienco et al. (2017) found
    that tree crops, summer crops and truck farming were classes highly mixed. A confusion
    between maize and soybeans was evident in Kussul et al. (2017) and variation was
    low in botanically related crops, such as meadow, fallow, triticale, wheat, and
    rye (Rußwurm and Körner, 2017). Moreover, some particular views of the plants
    (i.e. flowers and leaf scans) offer different classification accuracy than branches,
    stems and photos of the entire plant. A serious issue in plant phenology recognition
    is the fact that appearances change very gradually and it is challenging to distinguish
    images falling into the growing durations that are in the middle of two successive
    stages (Yalcin, 2017, Namin et al., 2017). A similar issue appears when assessing
    the quality of vegetative development (Minh et al., 2017). Furthermore, in the
    challenging problem of fruit counting, the models suffer from high occlusion,
    depth variation, and uncontrolled illumination, including high color similarity
    between fruit/foliage (Chen et al., 2017, Bargoti and Underwood, 2016). Finally,
    identification of weeds faces issues with respect to lighting, resolution, and
    soil type, and small variation between weeds and crops in shape, texture, color
    and position (i.e. overlapping) (Dyrmann et al., 2016a, Xinshao and Cheng, 2015,
    Dyrmann et al., 2017). In the large majority of the papers mentioned above (except
    from Minh et al. (2017)), this low variation has affected classification accuracy
    significantly, i.e. more than 5%. 4.4. Data pre-processing The large majority
    of related work (36 papers, 90%) involved some image pre-processing steps, before
    the image or particular characteristics/features/statistics of the image were
    fed as an input to the DL model. The most common pre-processing procedure was
    image resize (16 papers), in most cases to a smaller size, in order to adapt to
    the requirements of the DL model. Sizes of 256 × 256, 128 × 128, 96 × 96 and 60 × 60
    pixels were common. Image segmentation was also a popular practice (12 papers),
    either to increase the size of the dataset (Ienco et al., 2017, Rebetez et al.,
    2016, Yalcin, 2017) or to facilitate the learning process by highlighting regions
    of interest (Sladojevic et al., 2016, Mohanty et al., 2016, Grinblat et al., 2016,
    Sa et al., 2016, Dyrmann et al., 2016a, Potena et al., 2016) or to enable easier
    data annotation by experts and volunteers (Chen et al., 2017, Bargoti and Underwood,
    2016). Background removal (Mohanty et al., 2016, McCool et al., 2017, Milioto
    et al., 2017), foreground pixel extraction (Lee et al., 2015) or non-green pixels
    removal based on NDVI masks (Dyrmann et al., 2016a, Potena et al., 2016) were
    also performed to reduce the datasets’ overall noise. Other operations involved
    the creation of bounding boxes (Chen et al., 2017, Sa et al., 2016, McCool et
    al., 2017, Milioto et al., 2017) to facilitate detection of weeds or counting
    of fruits. Some datasets were converted to grayscale (Santoni et al., 2015, Amara
    et al., 2017) or to the HSV color model (Luus et al., 2015, Lee et al., 2015).
    Furthermore, some papers used features extracted from the images as input to their
    models, such as shape and statistical features (Hall et al., 2015), histograms
    (Hall et al., 2015, Xinshao and Cheng, 2015, Rebetez et al., 2016), Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA) filters (Xinshao and Cheng, 2015), Wavelet transformations
    (Kuwata and Shibasaki, 2015) and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features
    (Santoni et al., 2015). Satellite or aerial images involved a combination of pre-processing
    steps such as orthorectification (Lu et al., 2017, Minh et al., 2017) calibration
    and terrain correction (Kussul et al., 2017, Minh et al., 2017) and atmospheric
    correction (Rußwurm and Körner, 2017). 4.5. Data augmentation It is worth-mentioning
    that some of the related work under study (15 papers, 37%) employed data augmentation
    techniques (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), to enlarge artificially their number of
    training images. This helps to improve the overall learning procedure and performance,
    and for generalization purposes, by means of feeding the model with varied data.
    This augmentation process is important for papers that possess only small datasets
    to train their DL models, such as (Bargoti and Underwood, 2016, Sladojevic et
    al., 2016, Sørensen et al., 2017, Mortensen et al., 2016, Namin et al., 2017,
    Chen et al., 2017). This process was especially important in papers where the
    authors trained their models using synthetic images and tested them on real ones
    (Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard, 2017, Dyrmann et al., 2016b). In this case, data augmentation
    allowed their models to generalize and be able to adapt to the real-world problems
    more easily. Transformations are label-preserving, and included rotations (12
    papers), dataset partitioning/cropping (3 papers), scaling (3 papers), transposing
    (Sørensen et al., 2017), mirroring (Dyrmann et al., 2016a), translations and perspective
    transform (Sladojevic et al., 2016), adaptations of objects’ intensity in an object
    detection problem (Steen et al., 2016) and a PCA augmentation technique (Bargoti
    and Underwood, 2016). Papers involving simulated data performed additional augmentation
    techniques such as varying the HSV channels and adding random shadows (Dyrmann
    et al., 2016b) or adding simulated roots to soil images (Douarre et al., 2016).
    4.6. Technical details From a technical side, almost half of the research works
    (17 papers, 42%) employed popular CNN architectures such as AlexNet, VGG16 and
    Inception-ResNet. From the rest, 14 papers developed their own CNN models, 2 papers
    adopted a first-order Differential Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNN) model, 5 papers
    preferred to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model (Gers et al., 2000), one
    paper used deep belief networks (DBN) and one paper employed a hybrid of PCA with
    auto-encoders (AE). Some of the CNN approaches combined their model with a classifier
    at the output layer, such as logistic regression (Chen et al., 2014), Scalable
    Vector Machines (SVM) (Douarre et al., 2016), linear regression (Chen et al.,
    2017), Large Margin Classifiers (LCM) (Xinshao and Cheng, 2015) and macroscopic
    cellular automata (Song et al., 2016). Regarding the frameworks used, all the
    works that employed some well-known CNN architecture had also used a DL framework,
    with Caffe being the most popular (13 papers, 32%), followed by Tensor Flow (2
    papers) and deeplearning4j (1 paper). Ten research works developed their own software,
    while some authors decided to build their own models on top of Caffe (5 papers),
    Keras/Theano (5 papers), Keras/TensorFlow (4 papers), Pylearn2 (1 paper), MatConvNet
    (1 paper) and Deep Learning Matlab Toolbox (1 paper). A possible reason for the
    wide use of Caffe is that it incorporates various CNN frameworks and datasets,
    which can be used then easily and automatically by its users. Most of the studies
    divided their dataset between training and testing/verification data using a ratio
    of 80–20 or 90–10 respectively. In addition, various learning rates have been
    recorded, from 0.001 (Amara et al., 2017) and 0.005 (Mohanty et al., 2016) up
    to 0.01 (Grinblat et al., 2016). Learning rate is about how quickly a network
    learns. Higher values help avoid the solver being stuck in local minima, which
    can reduce performance significantly. A general approach used by many of the evaluated
    papers is to start out with a high learning rate and lower it as the training
    goes on. We note that learning rate is very dependent on the network architecture.
    Moreover, most of the research works that incorporated popular DL architectures
    took advantage of transfer learning (Pan and Yang, 2010), which concerns leveraging
    the already existing knowledge of some related task or domain in order to increase
    the learning efficiency of the problem under study by fine-tuning pre-trained
    models. As sometimes it is not possible to train a network from scratch due to
    having a small training data set or having a complex multi-task network, it is
    required that the network be at least partially initialized with weights from
    another pre-trained model. A common transfer learning technique is the use of
    pre-trained CNN, which are CNN models that have been already trained on some relevant
    dataset with possibly different number of classes. These models are then adapted
    to the particular challenge and dataset. This method was followed (among others)
    in Lu et al., 2017, Douarre et al., 2016, Reyes et al., 2015, Bargoti and Underwood,
    2016, Steen et al., 2016, Lee et al., 2015, Sa et al., 2016, Mohanty et al., 2016,
    Christiansen et al., 2016, Sørensen et al., 2017, for the VGG16, DenseNet, AlexNet
    and GoogleNet architectures. 4.7. Outputs Finally, concerning the 31 papers that
    involved classification, the classes as used by the authors ranged from 2 (Lu
    et al., 2017, Pound et al., 2016, Douarre et al., 2016, Milioto et al., 2017)
    up to 1000 (Reyes et al., 2015). A large number of classes was observed in Luus
    et al. (2015) (21 land-use classes) (Rebetez et al., 2016) (22 different crops
    plus soil) (Lee et al., 2015) (44 plant species) and (Xinshao and Cheng, 2015)
    (91 classes of common weeds found in agricultural fields). In these papers, the
    number of outputs of the model was equal to the number of classes respectively.
    Each output was a different probability for the input image, segment, blob or
    pixel to belong to each class, and then the model picked the highest probability
    as its predicted class. From the rest 9 papers, 2 performed predictions of fruits
    counted (scalar value as output) (Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard, 2017, Chen et al.,
    2017), 2 identified regions of fruits in the image (multiple bounding boxes) (Bargoti
    and Underwood, 2016, Sa et al., 2016), 2 predicted animal growth (scalar value)
    (Demmers et al., 2010, Demmers et al., 2012), one predicted weather conditions
    (scalar value) (Sehgal et al., 2017), one crop yield index (scalar value) (Kuwata
    and Shibasaki, 2015) and one paper predicted percentage of soil moisture content
    (scalar value) (Song et al., 2016). 4.8. Performance metrics Regarding methods
    used to evaluate performance, various metrics have been employed by the authors,
    each being specific to the model used at each study. Table 1 lists these metrics,
    together with their definition/description, and the symbol we use to refer to
    them in this survey. In some papers where the authors referred to accuracy without
    specifying its definition, we assumed they referred to classification accuracy
    (CA, first metric listed in Table 1). From this point onwards, we refer to “DL
    performance” as its score in some performance metric from the ones listed in Table
    1. Table 1. Performance metrics used in related work under study. No. Performance
    Metric Symbol Used Description 1. Classification Accuracy CA The percentage of
    correct predictions where the top class (the one having the highest probability),
    as indicated by the DL model, is the same as the target label as annotated beforehand
    by the authors. For multi-class classification problems, CA is averaged among
    all the classes. CA is mentioned as Rank-1 identification rate in (Hall et al.,
    2015) 2. Precision P The fraction of true positives (TP, correct predictions)
    from the total amount of relevant results, i.e. the sum of TP and false positives
    (FP). For multi-class classification problems, P is averaged among the classes.
    P = TP/(TP + FP) 3. Recall R The fraction of TP from the total amount of TP and
    false negatives (FN). For multi-class classification problems, R gets averaged
    among all the classes. R = TP/(TP + FN) 4. F1 score F1 The harmonic mean of precision
    and recall. For multi-class classification problems, F1 gets averaged among all
    the classes. It is mentioned as F-measure in (Minh et al., 2017). F1 = 2 * (TP * FP)/(TP + FP)
    5. LifeCLEF metric LC A scorea related to the rank of the correct species in the
    list of retrieved species 6. Quality Measure QM Obtained by multiplying sensitivity
    (proportion of pixels that were detected correctly) and specificity (which proportion
    of detected pixels are truly correct). QM = TP2/((TP + FP)(TP + FN)) 7. Mean Square
    Error MSE Mean of the square of the errors between predicted and observed values
    8. Root Mean Square Error RMSE Standard deviation of the differences between predicted
    values and observed values. A normalized RMSE (N-RMSE) has been used in (Sehgal
    et al., 2017) 9. Mean Relative Error MRE The mean error between predicted and
    observed values, in percentage 10. Ratio of total fruits counted RFC Ratio of
    the predicted count of fruits by the model, with the actual count. The actual
    count was attained by taking the average count of individuals (i.e. experts or
    volunteers) observing the images independently 11. L2 error L2 Root of the squares
    of the sums of the differences between predicted counts of fruits by the model
    and the actual counts 12. Intersection over Union IoU A metric that evaluates
    predicted bounding boxes, by dividing the area of overlap between the predicted
    and the ground truth boxes, by the area of their union. An average (Dyrmann et
    al., 2016b) or frequency weighted (Mortensen et al., 2016) IoU can be calculated
    13. CA-IoU, F1-IoU, P-IoU or R-IoU CA-IoU F1-IoU P-IoU R-IoU These are the same
    CA, F1, P and R metrics as defined above, combined with IoU in order to consider
    true/false positives/negatives. Used in problems involving bounding boxes. This
    is done by putting a minimum threshold on IoU, i.e. any value above this threshold
    would be considered as positive by the metric (and the model involved). Thresholds
    of 20% (Bargoti and Underwood, 2016), 40% (Sa et al., 2016) and 50% (Steen et
    al., 2016, Christiansen et al., 2016, Dyrmann et al., 2017) have been observedb
    a LifeCLEF 2015 Challenge. http://www.imageclef.org/lifeclef/2015/plant. b In
    Appendix B, where we list the values of the metrics used at each paper, we denote
    CA-IoU(x), F1-IoU(x), P-IoU(x) or R-IoU(x), where x is the threshold (in percentage),
    over which results are considered as positive by the DL model employed. CA was
    the most popular metric used (24 papers, 60%), followed by F1 (10 papers, 25%).
    Some papers included RMSE (4 papers), IoU (3 papers), RFC (Chen et al., 2017,
    Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard, 2017) or others. Some works used a combination of metrics
    to evaluate their efforts. We note that some papers employing CA, F1, P or R,
    used IoU in order to consider a model’s prediction (Bargoti and Underwood, 2016,
    Sa et al., 2016, Steen et al., 2016, Christiansen et al., 2016, Dyrmann et al.,
    2017). In these cases, a minimum threshold was put on IoU, and any value above
    this threshold would be considered as positive by the model. We note that in some
    cases, a trade-off can exist between metrics. For example, in a weed detection
    problem (Milioto et al., 2017), it might be desirable to have a high R to eliminate
    most weeds, but not eliminating crops is of a critical importance, hence a lower
    P might be acceptable. 4.9. Overall performance We note that it is difficult if
    not impossible to compare between papers, as different metrics are employed for
    different tasks, considering different models, datasets and parameters. Hence,
    the reader should consider our comments in this section with some caution. In
    19 out of the 24 papers that involved CA as a metric, accuracy was high (i.e.
    above 90%), indicating good performance. The highest CA has been observed in the
    works of Hall et al., 2015, Pound et al., 2016, Chen et al., 2014, Lee et al.,
    2015, Minh et al., 2017, Potena et al., 2016, Steen et al., 2016, with values
    of 98% or more, constituting remarkable results. From the 10 papers using F1 as
    metric, 5 had values higher than 0.90 with the highest F1 observed in Mohanty
    et al., 2016, Minh et al., 2017 with values higher than 0.99. The works of Dyrmann
    et al., 2016a, Rußwurm and Körner, 2017, Ienco et al., 2017, Mortensen et al.,
    2016, Rebetez et al., 2016, Christiansen et al., 2016, Yalcin, 2017 were among
    the ones with the lowest CA (i.e. 73–79%) and/or F1 scores (i.e. 0.558–0.746),
    however state of the art work in these particular problems has shown lower CA
    (i.e. SVM, RF, Naïve- Bayes classifier). Particularly in Rußwurm and Körner (2017),
    the three-unit LSTM model employed provided 16.3% better CA than a CNN, which
    belongs to the family of DL. Besides, the above can be considered as “harder”
    problems, because of the use of satellite data (Ienco et al., 2017, Rußwurm and
    Körner, 2017) large number of classes (Dyrmann et al., 2016a, Rußwurm and Körner,
    2017, Rebetez et al., 2016), small training datasets (Mortensen et al., 2016,
    Christiansen et al., 2016) or very low variation among the classes (Yalcin, 2017,
    Dyrmann et al., 2016a, Rebetez et al., 2016). 4.10. Generalizations on different
    datasets It is important to examine whether the authors had tested their implementations
    on the same dataset (e.g. by dividing the dataset into training and testing/validation
    sets) or used different datasets to test their solution. From the 40 papers, only
    8 (20%) used different datasets for testing than the one for training. From these,
    2 approaches trained their models by using simulated data and tested on real data
    (Dyrmann et al., 2016b, Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard, 2017) and 2 papers tested their
    models on a dataset produced 2–4 weeks after, with a more advanced growth stage
    of plants and weeds (Milioto et al., 2017, Potena et al., 2016). Moreover, 3 papers
    used different fields for testing than the ones used for training (McCool et al.,
    2017), with a severe degree of occlusion compared to the other training field
    (Dyrmann et al., 2017), or containing other obstacles such as people and animals
    (Steen et al., 2016. Sa et al. (2016) used a different dataset to evaluate whether
    the model can generalize on different fruits. From the other 32 papers, different
    trees were used in training and testing in Chen et al. (2017), while different
    rooms for pigs (Demmers et al., 2012) and chicken (Demmers et al., 2010) were
    considered. Moreover, Hall et al. applied condition variations in testing (i.e.
    translations, scaling, rotations, shading and occlusions) (Hall et al., 2015)
    while scaling for a certain range translation distance and rotation angle was
    performed on the testing dataset in Xinshao and Cheng (2015). The rest 27 papers
    did not perform any changes between the training/testing datasets, a fact that
    lowers the overall confidence for the results presented. Finally, it is interesting
    to observe how these generalizations affected the performance of the models, at
    least in cases where both data from same and different datasets were used in testing.
    In Sa et al. (2016), F1-IoU(40) was higher for the detection of apples (0.938),
    strawberry (0.948), avocado (0.932) and mango (0.942), than in the default case
    of sweet pepper (0.838). In Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard (2017), RFC was 2% less
    in the real images than in the synthetic ones. In Potena et al. (2016), CA was
    37.6% less at the dataset involving plants of 4-weeks more advanced growth. According
    to the authors, the model was trained based on plants that were in their first
    growth stage, thus without their complete morphological features, which were included
    in the testing dataset. Moreover, in Milioto et al. (2017) P was 2% higher at
    the 2-weeks more advanced growth dataset, with 9% lower R. Hence, in the first
    case there was improvement in performance (Sa et al., 2016), and in the last three
    cases a reduction, slight one in Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard, 2017, Milioto et al.,
    2017 but considerable in Potena et al. (2016). From the other papers using different
    testing datasets, as mentioned above, high percentages of CA (94–97.3%), P-IoU
    (86.6%) and low values of MRE (1.8–10%) have been reported. These show that the
    DL models were able to generalize well to different datasets. However, without
    more comparisons, this is only a speculation that can be figured out of the small
    number of observations available. 4.11. Performance comparison with other approaches
    A critical aspect of this survey is to examine how DL performs in relation to
    other existing techniques. The 14th column of Appendix B presents whether the
    authors of related work compared their DL-based approach with other techniques
    used for solving their problem under study. We focus only on comparisons between
    techniques used for the same dataset at the same research paper, with the same
    metric. In almost all cases, the DL models outperform other approaches implemented
    for comparison purposes. CNN show 1–8% higher CA in comparison to SVM (Chen et
    al., 2014, Lee et al., 2015, Grinblat et al., 2016, Pound et al., 2016), 41% improvement
    of CA when compared to ANN (Lee et al., 2015) and 3–8% higher CA when compared
    to RF (Kussul et al., 2017, Minh et al., 2017, McCool et al., 2017, Potena et
    al., 2016, Hall et al., 2015). CNN also seem to be superior than unsupervised
    feature learning with 3–11% higher CA (Luus et al., 2015), 2–44% improved CA in
    relation to local shape and color features (Dyrmann et al., 2016a, Sørensen et
    al., 2017), and 2% better CA (Kussul et al., 2017) or 18% less RMSE (Song et al.,
    2016) compared to multilayer perceptrons. CNN had also superior performance than
    Penalized Discriminant Analysis (Grinblat et al., 2016), SVM Regression (Kuwata
    and Shibasaki, 2015), area-based techniques (Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard, 2017),
    texture-based regression models (Chen et al., 2017), LMC classifiers (Xinshao
    and Cheng, 2015), Gaussian Mixture Models (Santoni et al., 2015) and Naïve-Bayes
    classifiers (Yalcin, 2017). In cases where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) (Mandic
    and Chambers, 2001) architectures were employed, the LSTM model had 1% higher
    CA than RF and SVM in Ienco et al. (2017), 44% improved CA than SVM in Rußwurm
    and Körner (2017) and 7–9% better CA than RF and SVM in Minh et al. (2017). In
    only one case, DL showed worse performance against another technique, and this
    was when a CNN was compared to an approach involving local descriptors to represent
    images together with KNN as the classification strategy (20% worse LC) (Reyes
    et al., 2015). 5. Discussion Our analysis has shown that DL offers superior performance
    in the vast majority of related work. When comparing the performance of DL-based
    approaches with other techniques at each paper, it is of paramount importance
    to adhere to the same experimental conditions (i.e. datasets and performance metrics).
    From the related work under study, 28 out of the 40 papers (70%) performed direct,
    valid and correct comparisons among the DL-based approach employed and other state-of-art
    techniques used to solve the particular problem tackled at each paper. Due to
    the fact that each paper involved different datasets, pre-processing techniques,
    metrics, models and parameters, it is difficult if not impossible to generalize
    and perform comparisons between papers. Thus, our comparisons have been strictly
    limited among the techniques used at each paper. Thus, based on these constraints,
    we have observed that DL has outperformed traditional approaches used such as
    SVM, RF, ANN, LMC classifiers and others. It seems that the automatic feature
    extraction performed by DL models is more effective than the feature extraction
    process through traditional approaches such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform
    (SIFT), GLCM, histograms, area-based techniques (ABT), statistics-, texture-,
    color- and shape-based algorithms, conditional random fields to model color and
    visual texture features, local de-correlated channel features and other manual
    feature extraction techniques. This is reinforced by the combined CNN + LSTM model
    employed in Namin et al. (2017), which outperformed a LSTM model which used hand
    crafted feature descriptors as inputs by 25% higher CA. Interesting attempts to
    combine hand-crafted features and CNN-based features were performed in Hall et
    al., 2015, Rebetez et al., 2016. Although DL has been associated with computer
    vision and image analysis (which is also the general case in this survey), we
    have observed 5 related works where DL-based models have been trained based on
    field sensory data (Kuwata and Shibasaki, 2015, Sehgal et al., 2017) and a combination
    of static and dynamic environmental variables (Song et al., 2016, Demmers et al.,
    2010, Demmers et al., 2012). These papers indicate the potential of DL to be applied
    in a wide variety of agricultural problems, not only those involving images. Examining
    agricultural areas where DL techniques have been applied, leaf classification,
    leaf and plant disease detection, plant recognition and fruit counting have some
    papers which present very good performance (i.e. CA > 95%, F1 > 0.92 or RFC > 0.9).
    This is probably because of the availability of datasets in these domains, as
    well as the distinct characteristics of (sick) leaves/plants and fruits in the
    image. On the other hand, some papers in land cover classification, crop type
    classification, plant phenology recognition and weed detection showed average
    performance (i.e. CA < 87% or F1 < 0.8). This could be due to leaf occlusion in
    weed detection, use of noise-prone satellite imagery in land cover problems, crops
    with low variation and botanical relationship or the fact that appearances change
    very gradually while plants grow in phenology recognition efforts. Without underestimating
    the quality of any of the surveyed papers, we highlight some that claim high performance
    (CA > 91%, F1-IoU(20) > 0.90 or RFC > 0.91), considering the complexity of the
    problem in terms of its definition or the large number of classes involved (more
    than 21 classes). These papers are the following: (Mohanty et al., 2016, Luus
    et al., 2015, Lee et al., 2015, Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard, 2017, Chen et al.,
    2017, Bargoti and Underwood, 2016, Xinshao and Cheng, 2015, Hall et al., 2015).
    We also highlight papers that trained their models on simulated data, and tested
    them on real data, which are (Dyrmann et al., 2016b, Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard,
    2017, Douarre et al., 2016). These works constitute important efforts in the DL
    community, as they attempt to solve the problem of inexistent or not large enough
    datasets in various problems. Finally, as discussed in Section 4.10, most authors
    used the same datasets for training and testing their implementation, a fact that
    lowers the confidence in the overall findings, although there have been indications
    that the models seem to generalize well, with only small reductions in performance.
    5.1. Advanced deep learning applications Although the majority of papers used
    typical CNN architectures to perform classification (23 papers, 57%), some authors
    experimented with more advanced models in order to solve more complex problems,
    such as crop type classification from UAV imagery (CNN + HistNN using RGB histograms)
    (Rebetez et al., 2016), estimating number of tomato fruits (Modified Inception-ResNet
    CNN) (Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard, 2017) and estimating number of orange or apple
    fruits (CNN adapted for blob detection and counting + Linear Regression) (Chen
    et al., 2017). Particularly interesting were the approaches employing the Faster
    Region-based CNN + VGG16 model (Bargoti and Underwood, 2016, Sa et al., 2016),
    in order not only to count fruits and vegetables, but also to locate their placement
    in the image by means of bounding boxes. Similarly, the work in (Dyrmann et al.,
    2017) used the DetectNet CNN to detect bounding boxes of weed instances in images
    of cereal fields. These approaches (Faster Region-based CNN, DetectNet CNN) constitute
    a very promising research direction, since the task of identifying the bounding
    box of fruits/vegetables/weeds in an image has numerous real-life applications
    and could solve various agricultural problems Moreover, considering not only space
    but also time series, some authors employed RNN-based models in land cover classification
    (one-unit LSTM model + SVM) (Ienco et al., 2017), crop type classification (three-unit
    LSTM) (Rußwurm and Körner, 2017), classification of different accessions of Arabidopsis
    thaliana based on successive top-view images (CNN + LSTM) (Namin et al., 2017),
    mapping winter vegetation quality coverage (Five-unit LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit)
    (Minh et al., 2017), estimating the weight of pigs or chickens (DRNN) (Demmers
    et al., 2010, Demmers et al., 2012) and for predicting weather based on previous
    year’s conditions (LSTM) (Sehgal et al., 2017). RNN-based models offer higher
    performance, as they can capture the time dimension, which is impossible to be
    exploited by simple CNN. RNN architectures tend to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior,
    being able to record long-short temporal dependencies, remembering and forgetting
    after some time or when needed (i.e. LSTM). Differences in performance between
    RNN and CNN are distinct in the related work under study, as shown in Table 2.
    This 16% improvement in CA could be attributed to the additional information provided
    by the time series. For example, in the crop type classification case (Rußwurm
    and Körner, 2017), the authors mention, “crops change their spectral characteristics
    due to environmental influences and can thus not be monitored effectively with
    classical mono-temporal approaches. Performance of temporal models increases at
    the beginning of vegetation period”. LSTM-based approaches work well also for
    low represented and difficult classes, as demonstrated in Ienco et al. (2017).

    in four accessions CA CNN + LSTM: 93% CNN: 76.8% Namin et al. (2017) Finally,
    the critical aspect of fast processing of DL models in order to be easily used
    in robots for real-time decision making (e.g. detection of weeds) was examined
    in McCool et al. (2017), and it is worth-mentioning. The authors have showed that
    a lightweight implementation had only a small penalty in CA (3.90%), being much
    faster (i.e. processing of 40.6 times more pixels per second). They proposed the
    idea of “teacher and student networks”, where the teacher is the more heavy approach
    that helps the student (light implementation) to learn faster and better. 5.2.
    Advantages of deep learning Except from improvements in performance of the classification/prediction
    problems in the surveyed works (see Sections 4.9 Overall performance, 4.11 Performance
    comparison with other approaches), the advantage of DL in terms of reduced effort
    in feature engineering was demonstrated in many of the papers. Hand-engineered
    components require considerable time, an effort that takes place automatically
    in DL. Besides, sometimes manual search for good feature extractors is not an
    easy and obvious task. For example, in the case of estimating crop yield (Kuwata
    and Shibasaki, 2015), extracting manually features that significantly affected
    crop growth was not possible. This was also the case of estimating the soil moisture
    content (Song et al., 2016). Moreover, DL models seem to generalize well. For
    example, in the case of fruit counting, the model learned explicitly to count
    (Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard, 2017). In the banana leaf classification problem (Amara
    et al., 2017), the model was robust under challenging conditions such as illumination,
    complex background, different resolution, size and orientation of the images.
    Also in the fruits counting papers (Chen et al., 2017, Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard,
    2017), the models were robust to occlusion, variation, illumination and scale.
    The same detection frameworks could be used for a variety of circular fruits such
    as peaches, citrus, mangoes etc. As another example, a key feature of the DeepAnomaly
    model was the ability to detect unknown objects/anomalies and not just a set of
    predefined objects, exploiting the homogeneous characteristics of an agricultural
    field to detect distant, heavy occluded and unknown objects (Christiansen et al.,
    2016). Moreover, in the 8 papers mentioned in Section 4.10 where different datasets
    were used for testing, the performance of the model was generally high, with only
    small reductions in performance in comparison with the performance when using
    the same dataset for training and testing. Although DL takes longer time to train
    than other traditional approaches (e.g. SVM, RF), its testing time efficiency
    is quite fast. For example, in detecting obstacles and anomaly (Christiansen et
    al., 2016), the model took much longer to train, but after it did, its testing
    time was less than the one of SVM and KNN. Besides, if we take into account the
    time needed to manually design filters and extract features, “the time used on
    annotating images and training the CNN becomes almost negligible” (Sørensen et
    al., 2017). Another advantage of DL is the possibility to develop simulated datasets
    to train the model, which could be properly designed in order to solve real-world
    problems. For example, in the issue of detecting weeds and maize in fields (Dyrmann
    et al., 2016b), the authors overcame the plant foliage overlapping problem by
    simulating top-down images of overlapping plants on soil background. The trained
    network was then capable of distinguish weeds from maize even in overlapping conditions.
    5.3. Disadvantages and limitations of deep learning A considerable drawback and
    barrier in the use of DL is the need of large datasets, which would serve as the
    input during the training procedure. In spite of data augmentation techniques
    which augment some dataset with label-preserving transformations, in reality at
    least some hundreds of images are required, depending on the complexity of the
    problem under study (i.e. number of classes, precision required etc.). For example,
    the authors in Mohanty et al., 2016, Sa et al., 2016 commented that a more diverse
    set of training data was needed to improve CA. A big problem with many datasets
    is the low variation among the different classes (Yalcin, 2017), as discussed
    in Section 4.3, or the existence of noise, in the form of low resolution, inaccuracy
    of sensory equipment (Song et al., 2016), crops’ occlusions, plants overlapping
    and clustering, and others. As data annotation is a necessary operation in the
    large majority of cases, some tasks are more complex and there is a need for experts
    (who might be difficult to involve) in order to annotate input images. As mentioned
    in Amara et al. (2017), there is a limited availability of resources and expertise
    on banana pathology worldwide. In some cases, experts or volunteers are susceptible
    to errors during data labeling, especially when this is a challenging task e.g.
    fruit count (Chen et al., 2017, Bargoti and Underwood, 2016) or to determine if
    images contain weeds or not (Sørensen et al., 2017, Dyrmann et al., 2017). Another
    limitation is the fact that the DL models can learn some problem particularly
    well, even generalize in some aspects as mentioned in Section 5.2, but they cannot
    generalize beyond the “boundaries of the dataset’s expressiveness”. For example,
    classification of single leaves, facing up, on a homogeneous background is performed
    in Mohanty et al. (2016). A real world application should be able to classify
    images of a disease as it presents itself directly on the plant. Many diseases
    do not present themselves on the upper side of leaves only. As another example,
    plant recognition in Lee et al. (2015) was noticeably affected by environmental
    factors such as wrinkled surface and insect damages. The model for counting tomatoes
    in Rahnemoonfar and Sheppard (2017) could count ripe and half-ripe fruits, however,
    “it failed to count green fruits because it was not trained for this purpose”.
    If an object size in a testing image was significantly less than that of a training
    set, the model missed the detection in Sa et al. (2016). Difficulty in detecting
    heavily occluded and distant objects was observed in Christiansen et al. (2016).
    Occlusion was a serious issue also in Hall et al. (2015). A general issue in computer
    vision, not only in DL, is that data pre-processing is sometimes a necessary and
    time-consuming task, especially when satellite or aerial photos are involved,
    as we saw in Section 4.4. A problem with hyperspectral data is their high dimensionality
    and limited training samples (Chen et al., 2014). Moreover, sometimes the existing
    datasets do not describe completely the problem they target (Song et al., 2016).
    As an example, for estimating corn yield (Kuwata and Shibasaki, 2015), it was
    necessary to consider also external factors other than the weather by inputting
    cultivation information such as fertilization and irrigation. Finally, in the
    domain of agriculture, there do not exist many publicly available datasets for
    researchers to work with, and in many cases, researchers need to develop their
    own sets of images. This could require many hours or days of work. 5.4. Future
    of deep learning in agriculture Observing Appendix A, which lists various existing
    applications of computer vision in agriculture, we can see that only the problems
    of land cover classification, crop type estimation, crop phenology, weed detection
    and fruit grading have been approximated using DL. It is interesting to see how
    DL would behave also in other agricultural-related problems listed in Appendix
    A, such as seeds identification, soil and leaf nitrogen content, irrigation, plants’
    water stress detection, water erosion assessment, pest detection, herbicide use,
    identification of contaminants, diseases or defects on food, crop hail damage
    and greenhouse monitoring. Intuitively, since many of the aforementioned research
    areas employ data analysis techniques (see Appendix A) with similar concepts and
    comparable performance to DL (i.e. linear and logistic regression, SVM, KNN, K-means
    clustering, Wavelet-based filtering, Fourier transform) (Singh et al., 2016),
    then it could be worth to examine the applicability of DL on these problems too.
    Other possible application areas could be the use of aerial imagery (i.e. by means
    of drones) to monitor the effectiveness of the seeding process, to increase the
    quality of wine production by harvesting grapes at the right moment for best maturity
    levels, to monitor animals and their movements to consider their overall welfare
    and identify possible diseases, and many other scenarios where computer vision
    is involved. In spite of the limited availability of open datasets in agriculture,
    In Appendix C, we list some of the most popular, free to download datasets available
    on the web, which could be used by researchers to start testing their DL architectures.
    These datasets could be used to pre-train DL models and then adapt them to more
    specific future agricultural challenges. In addition to these datasets, remote
    sensing data containing multi-temporal, multi-spectral and multi-source images
    that could be used in problems related to land and crop cover classification are
    available from satellites such as MERIS, MODIS, AVHRR, RapidEye, Sentinel, Landsat
    etc. More approaches adopting LSTM or other RNN models are expected in the future,
    exploiting the time dimension to perform higher performance classification or
    prediction. An example application could be to estimate the growth of plants,
    trees or even animals based on previous consecutive observations, to predict their
    yield, assess their water needs or avoid diseases from occurring. These models
    could find applicability in environmental informatics too, for understanding climatic
    change, predicting weather conditions and phenomena, estimating the environmental
    impact of various physical or artificial processes (Kamilaris et al., 2017a) etc.
    Related work under study involved up to a five-unit LSTM model (Minh et al., 2017).
    We expect in the future to see more layers stacked together in order to build
    more complex LSTM architectures (Ienco et al., 2017). We also believe that datasets
    with increasing temporal sequence length will appear, which could improve the
    performance of LSTM (Rußwurm and Körner, 2017). Moreover, more complex architectures
    would appear, combining various DL models and classifiers together, or combining
    hand-crafted features with automatic features extracted by using various techniques,
    fused together to improve the overall outcome, similar to what performed in Hall
    et al., 2015, Rebetez et al., 2016. Researchers are expected to test their models
    using more general and realistic dataset, demonstrating the ability of the models
    to generalize to various real-world situations. A combination of popular performance
    metrics, such as the ones mentioned in Table 1, are essential to be adopted by
    the authors for comparison purposes. It would be desirable if researchers made
    their datasets publicly available, for use also by the general research community.
    Finally, some of the solutions discussed in the surveyed papers could have a commercial
    use in the near future. The approaches incorporating Faster Region-based CNN and
    DetectNet CNN (Bargoti and Underwood, 2016, Chen et al., 2017, Rahnemoonfar and
    Sheppard, 2017) would be extremely useful for automatic robots that collect crops,
    remove weeds or for estimating the expected yields of various crops. A future
    application of this technique could be also in microbiology for human or animal
    cell counting (Chen et al., 2017). The DRNN model controlling the daily feed intake
    of pigs or chicken, predicting quite accurately the required feed intake for the
    whole of the growing period, would be useful to farmers when deciding on a growth
    curve suitable for various scenarios. Following some growth patterns would have
    potential advantages for animal welfare in terms of leg health, without compromising
    the idea animals’ final weight and total feed intake requirement (Demmers et al.,
    2010, Demmers et al., 2012). 6. Conclusion In this paper, we have performed a
    survey of deep learning-based research efforts applied in the agricultural domain.
    We have identified 40 relevant papers, examining the particular area and problem
    they focus on, technical details of the models employed, sources of data used,
    pre-processing tasks and data augmentation techniques adopted, and overall performance
    according to the performance metrics employed by each paper. We have then compared
    deep learning with other existing techniques, in terms of performance. Our findings
    indicate that deep learning offers better performance and outperforms other popular
    image processing techniques. For future work, we plan to apply the general concepts
    and best practices of deep learning, as described through this survey, to other
    areas of agriculture where this modern technique has not yet been adequately used.
    Some of these areas have been identified in the discussion section. Our aim is
    that this survey would motivate more researchers to experiment with deep learning,
    applying it for solving various agricultural problems involving classification
    or prediction, related to computer vision and image analysis, or more generally
    to data analysis. The overall benefits of deep learning are encouraging for its
    further use towards smarter, more sustainable farming and more secure food production.

  explanation: 'Hyperspectral imaging, thermal imaging and laser-induced fluorescence
    can provide non-destructive, automatic, continuous measurements, easily implemented
    with data transmission systems for the user to have nearly real time access to
    the collected data from a remote computer, smart phone or similar [30].

    Most of these methods and related systems are highly sensitive and capable of
    working under field conditions for long periods. These characteristics confer
    great potential for both monitoring water stress and scheduling irrigation [105].'
  extract_1: Both shade and sunlit leaves constantly move to adjust light interception
    to maximize their water use efﬁciency and protect leaves from excessive heat and

    \ the literature on applications of remote sensing for monitoring soil- and\n\
    crop- water status for irrigation purposes. The review is organized into two main\
    \ sections: (1) sensors\nand platforms applied to irrigation studies and (2) remote\
    \ sensing approaches for precision irrigation\nto estimate crop water status,\
    \ evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, soil and crop characteristics\nmethods.\
    \ Recent literature reports several remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor\
    \ crop water\nstatus in the cultivated environment. Establishing the right amount\
    \ of water to supply for different\nirrigation strategies (maximization of yield\
    \ or water use efﬁciency (WUE)) for a large number of\ncrops is a problem that\
    \ remains unresolved. For each crop, it will be necessary to create a stronger\n\
    connection between crop-water status and crop yield.\nKeywords: crop water status;\
    \ water use efﬁciency (WUE); platforms; sensors; evapotranspiration\n(ET); Crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI); time-temperature threshold (TTT); vegetation indices\
    \ (VIs)\n1. Introduction\nFood is the basic and compulsory human requirement.\
    \ It is expected that limited land and\ninadequate water resources will negatively\
    \ impact the expected increase in demand for food crops\nduring the next ﬁfty\
    \ years [1–3]. Subject to scenarios used, and assumptions and models employed,\n\
    different forecasts have been made for food and agricultural production and related\
    \ irrigation water\nneeds. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projections\
    \ indicated a growth rate of world\nconsumption of agricultural products of 1.1%\
    \ per year for the period from 2005 to 2050. In order to\nmeet this projected\
    \ global demand, agricultural production would have to increase by 60% from 2005\n\
    to 2050 [4,5].\nProduction of food requires water. Since water resources are a\
    \ limiting factor for human actions,\nWater Use Efﬁciency (WUE) will be a crucial\
    \ factor [6]. For these reasons, the European Parliament,\nin agreement with the\
    \ Horizon 2020 program, has coined the phrase “produce more with less” [7].\n\
    Agriculture is the main user of water worldwide, accounting for about 70% of total\
    \ water withdrawals,\nincluding the water used in livestock and aquaculture production\
    \ [8]. Furthermore, it is expected that\nthis sector will witness increased water\
    \ consumption of about 20% by the year 2025 [9]. Thus, it is\nwidely expected\
    \ that the competition for water resources in many regions will increase. To meet\
    \ the\nincreasing population’s demands for food and for water, it is critical\
    \ to improve agricultural water\nproductivity, or economic yield per volume of\
    \ water used [1,10].\nForty percent of total agricultural production comes from\
    \ the 20% of the land that is irrigated [11].\nFarmers in developing countries\
    \ have to improve agronomic and water management practices in\norder to increase\
    \ WUE in all agroecosystems (from fully-rainfed to fully-irrigated farming systems).\n\
    Pereira et al., [12] reported that the above goal is chieﬂy important where water\
    \ is a scarce commodity\n(arid and semiarid regions). In these regions, it will\
    \ be crucial to increase water productivity rather\nthan maximizing crop yield.\
    \ Molden et al. [13] suggested, “The adoptions of techniques to improve water\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40; doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020040\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n2 of 36\nproductivity will require an enabling policy\
    \ and an institutional environment that aligns the incentives of\nproducers, resource\
    \ managers and society, and provides a mechanism for dealing with trade-offs”.\
    \ Irrigation\nwater management is sustainable if it realizes the objectives of\
    \ preserving the natural environment\nand sustaining irrigated agriculture for\
    \ food security. Appropriate irrigation practices are aimed at\nimproving WUE\
    \ in order to save water and maintain satisfactory yields [14].\nPainter and Carren\
    \ [15] emphasized the importance of reducing water losses below the root zone,\n\
    improving yield and crop quality, conserving the resource base, and lowering the\
    \ risk of salinization\nof groundwater to enhance sustainability. The authors\
    \ also pointed out that “these gains can only be\nachieved when all elements of\
    \ precision operate synergistically within a given environment”.\nFor improving\
    \ WUE at the regional level, Batchelor [16] suggested four methods of agronomic\n\
    improvements: (1) rely on improved crop husbandry; (2) introduce varieties with\
    \ higher productivity;\n(3) maximize cropped area during periods of low potential\
    \ evapotranspiration and (4) when rainfall is\nhighest, promote water recycling.\n\
    Wallace and Batchelor [17] reported four categories (agronomic, technical, managerial,\
    \ and\ninstitutional) for improving the efﬁciency of irrigation. Technical solutions\
    \ may improve irrigation\nuniformity, reduce leaching, and lead to adoption of\
    \ irrigation practices that increase rainfall\neffectiveness. Among managerial\
    \ improvements, the authors highlighted the implementation of\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ systems based on crop demand. The institutional improvements “rely on the user\n\
    involvement in scheme operation and maintenance; introduction of water pricing\
    \ and legal frameworks to provide\nincentives for efﬁcient water use and disincentives\
    \ for inefﬁcient use; introduction of integrated catchment\nmanagement; improved\
    \ training and extension”. In 2005, Johansson [6] emphasized the importance at\
    \ the\nfarm level of the extension services for improving information or of cheap\
    \ credit for adjusting to the\nchanging environments associated with water policy\
    \ reforms (water-pricing reforms, particularly).\nBecause more efﬁcient irrigation\
    \ practices can optimize WUE [18], and drip irrigation reduced\ncrop evapotranspiration\
    \ losses and runoff [19–21], the technology was appropriate for applying water\n\
    to orchards and vegetables [22]. Proper irrigation (timing and amount) increased\
    \ the crop WUE and\ncrop yield [23]. In contrast, improper irrigation can lead\
    \ to the onset of crop water deﬁcits causing\nwater and nutrient deﬁciencies that\
    \ reduce yield [23,24]. Nevertheless, regardless of the strategy\nengaged, the\
    \ beneﬁts of irrigation scheduling can be reached only by applying the exact amount\
    \ of\nwater required [25]. Raine et al. [26] deﬁne precision irrigation as “the\
    \ accurate and precise application\nof water to meet the speciﬁc requirements\
    \ of individual plants or management units and minimize\nadverse environmental\
    \ impact”. Monitoring water use and crop water status in the ﬁeld is important\n\
    for developing effective precautions, and for this purpose, some indicators are\
    \ required [27]. A very\nlarge body of research, spanning almost four decades,\
    \ has demonstrated that much of the required\nagricultural information can be\
    \ derived from remotely sensed data [28] starting from crop water status\ndetection.\
    \ IN order to develop effective irrigation strategies, it is necessary to identify\
    \ the appropriate\nindicators for monitoring crop water status at the farm level\
    \ [27]. For these purposes, the required\nagricultural information may be derived\
    \ from remotely sensed data [28].\n2. Scope of the Review\nThe applications of\
    \ remote sensing to irrigation monitoring and management are reviewed\nherein.\
    \ The assessment of the ideal crop water requirement is indispensable for several\
    \ objectives\nlinked to agronomic, economic, and environmental issues: (i) maximize\
    \ crop yield (the ’yield gap’);\n(ii) stabilize production by adopting a safeguard\
    \ against the vagaries of weather; (iii) ameliorate crop\nquality; (iv) save water;\
    \ (v) limit onset of diseases; and (vi) limit groundwater pollution caused by\n\
    N leaching losses. A seventh (vii) crucial point is the ’yield gap’ of the environment\
    \ under study.\nThis means deﬁning the potential and constraints of the ﬁeld environment\
    \ (sub optimal management,\ninappropriate technology, and/or lack of training\
    \ of farmers). This is possible when water constraints\non crop production are\
    \ removed by using appropriate irrigation scheduling for getting more crop\nyield\
    \ per drop of water [9,29], contributing to social growth of the irrigated area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n3 of 36\nIn 2008, Fereres [8] called for a more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable irrigation than in the past, at a\ntime when the rate of irrigation\
    \ was expected to slow down, and when the investments in irrigation\nand drainage\
    \ were on the decline. Fereres also emphasized challenges in irrigated agriculture\
    \ due to\nmodernization of irrigation networks and management, the improvement\
    \ of water institutions, and\nthe responses to periodic droughts. The last point\
    \ has imposed the introduction of new water saving\ntechnologies in horticulture.\n\
    A holistic approach is necessary for moving from a traditional approach to precision\
    \ irrigation,\ndeﬁned as site-speciﬁc irrigation management that relies on the\
    \ variable application of water according\nto soil and crop variability. It is\
    \ a potential solution for increasing productivity and reducing the\nenvironmental\
    \ impact of irrigated agriculture. A holist approach needs a deep and precise\
    \ knowledge\nof the crop water requirements and the cultivated environment. The\
    \ innovative deﬁcit irrigation and\npartial root drying management strategies\
    \ [29] have encouraged the development of new methods for\nmonitoring water stress\
    \ (abiotic). Fernández [30] focused on plant-based methods that integrate the\n\
    soil and atmospheric water status and the plant response to the surrounding conditions.\n\
    The present review describes the role of remote sensing with respect to crop water\
    \ status, its\nsurface energy balance, the relationship between surface temperature\
    \ and remotely sensed vegetation\nindices, and WUE and evapotranspiration. This\
    \ review is limited to ﬁeld-key studies, and presents\napplications of remote\
    \ sensing for managing irrigation and water resources for meeting the current\
    \ and\nfuture challenges of agricultural water resources management. A list of\
    \ references is presented\nas a good resource for any who are interested in remote\
    \ sensing applied to irrigation studies.\nThe review is organized into the following\
    \ main sections: (1) Sensors and platforms applied to\nirrigation studies; (2)\
    \ Remote sensing approaches for precision irrigation for estimating crop water\n\
    status, evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, and soil and crop characteristics.\n\
    3. Sensors and Platforms\nJensen et al. [31] reported that the ﬁrst aerial images\
    \ were taken by a camera mounted on a balloon\naround 1859. From the very beginning\
    \ of satellite-based remote sensing in the 1970s, the use of remote\nsensing for\
    \ terrestrial applications has increased tremendously [32]. Remote sensing is\
    \ the acquisition\nof information about an object, or event through the analysis\
    \ of data acquired obtained by a device\nwithout contact with the target under\
    \ investigation [33]. The term remote sensing includes all the\ntraditional primary\
    \ mapping data acquisition technologies [34].\nRemote-sensing instruments are\
    \ designed to identify various wavelengths of the electromagnetic\nspectrum referred\
    \ to as a “band” or “channel”. Each instrument is characterized by a speciﬁc number\n\
    and widths of wavelengths detected; some instruments detect discrete bands, while\
    \ others detect\nfairly narrow wavelengths or broader bands (multispectral, visible\
    \ and near-infrared wavelengths,\nmicrowave, thermal sensing systems) [35–37].\n\
    Remote sensing is able to identify spectral signatures of all surfaces and objects.\
    \ Sensors can sense\ntargets with a speciﬁc spatial resolution of image data deﬁned\
    \ by the smallest spatial area sampled or\nviewed. Digital images are made up\
    \ of pixels, each pixel characterized by speciﬁc spectral and spatial\nattributes\
    \ [38], as the intensity of reﬂectance or emittance measured by a sensor [39].\
    \ Spatial resolution\ncorresponds to the spatial area each displayed or printed\
    \ pixel represents.\nWhen the time image was shot (day or year) is a crucial point\
    \ in interpreting remotely sensed data\nanalysis [40]. If the same area is imaged\
    \ in the morning and late afternoon, a greater number of features\nwith different\
    \ orientations may be discerned than if the area is only imaged in the morning\
    \ [41]; this\nis especially true when interpreting vegetation classes. Multi-temporal\
    \ images are taken at different\ntimes to monitor changes in the environment and\
    \ to analyze numerous processes [42,43]. The temporal\ndynamics may range from\
    \ hours to a number of years. Sexton et al. [44] and Guerschman et al. [45]\n\
    reported that “to assess changes over a time sequence accurately, effects in the\
    \ data not caused by true\nenvironmental changes (such as differing atmospheric\
    \ conditions and sun or view angle positions)\nmust ﬁrst be accounted for”.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n4 of 36\nOther sensors are deﬁned as bidirectional,\
    \ due to the illumination angle at which the energy\nsource strikes the target,\
    \ and the position (angle) at which the instrument receives the emitted or\nthe\
    \ reﬂected energy (called the view angle) as described by Schowengerdt [46] and\
    \ Campbell and\nWynn [47].\n3.1. Remote Sensing Sensors\nDifferent remote sensing\
    \ sensors have been developed for monitoring crop growth and yield, as\nwell as\
    \ the spatial variability within ﬁelds. Many factors may affect crop growth and\
    \ yield variability,\nsuch as soil characteristics, soil fertility, soil moisture,\
    \ canopy volume, biomass and architecture, water\ncontent, and biotic and abiotic\
    \ stress. Different types of sensors can monitor and measure these factors;\n\
    Lee et al. [48] discussed electronic sensors, spectroradiometers, machine vision,\
    \ multispectral and\nhyperspectral sensors, thermal sensors, and machine olfaction\
    \ systems. A detailed review on sensors\nrelated to agricultural crop was reported\
    \ by Ruiz-Altisent et al. [49]. The authors provided an overview\nof sensing technologies\
    \ and application as: (i) electromagnetic sensors, spectroscopic sensors, and\n\
    computer vision; (ii) mechanical contact and acoustic sensors; (iii) biosensors;\
    \ and (iv) wireless-sensor\nnetworks. Wang et al. [50] studied recent development\
    \ and future perspective of wireless sensors in\nagriculture and the food industry.\n\
    Sensors can be divided into several broad categories of basic sensor system types\
    \ such as active and\npassive. Passive sensors (photographic, electro-optic radiometers,\
    \ passive microwave systems visible,\ninfrared, and thermal imaging systems, etc.)\
    \ are the most common for vegetation correlated remote\nsensing. These sensors\
    \ provide helpful information for crop monitoring, but their major limitation\n\
    is the strong relationship among data acquisition and lighting (time of day and\
    \ year; latitude) and\nweather conditions (cloud cover). Data from passive sensors\
    \ requires accurate measurements of solar\nradiation and correction for “atmospheric\
    \ effects” [34,40].\nActive sensors use an artiﬁcial source of energy; in active\
    \ remote sensing, humans can control the\nnature (wavelength, power, duration)\
    \ of the source energy. Active sensors (Radar systems, LiDAR)\ndo not need sun\
    \ light and perfect weather conditions (less dependence on environmental factors);\n\
    therefore, they can be more dedicated and targeted toward the remote sensing objectives\
    \ even at night\nor under adverse conditions (haze, clouds, rain, etc.) [34,40].\n\
    3.2. Remote Sensing Platforms\nThe platform on which a particular sensor is lodged\
    \ states the distance of the sensor from the\ntarget, timing, periodicity, location,\
    \ and extent of coverage of the acquired image. The detailed\ninformation obtained\
    \ is strictly related to the distance between the object of interest and the type\
    \ of\nplatform. Remote sensing platforms can be divided into three groups: satellite,\
    \ airborne and Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs), and ground based solutions. According\
    \ to Matese et al. [51], each of these\nplatforms and sensors shows strengths\
    \ and weaknesses related to technological, operational and\neconomic factors.\n\
    3.2.1. Satellite\nSatellites can be classiﬁed by (i) altitude; (ii) orbital geometry\
    \ (geostationary, equatorial and sun\nsynchronous) and (iii) timing. Regarding\
    \ the ﬁrst point, there are space shuttles orbiting around\n250–300 km above the\
    \ earth; space stations orbiting from 300 to 400 km above; low level satellites\
    \ from\n700 to 1500 km above, and high-level satellites, about 36000 km above\
    \ the earth's surface. The ﬁrst\nremote sensing satellite appeared in 1960 for\
    \ meteorological purposes. Geostationary satellites have a\n24 h-period of rotation,\
    \ so they always stay over the same earth location. Usually, communications\n\
    and weather satellites have often-geostationary orbits, generally located over\
    \ the equator. To ensure\nrepeatable sun illumination conditions during speciﬁc\
    \ seasons, sun synchronous satellites have orbits\nnearly passing over the poles.\
    \ Sensor and orbital characteristics determine the frequency of data\nacquisition\
    \ (Table 1). The satellite frequency ranges from twice a day to every 16 days.\n\

    Toth and Jó´zków [34] reported on new satellite technologies related to microsatellites\
    \ and\nnanosatellites, which increment the number of observations by sharing the\
    \ same orbit. One of the\nﬁrst examples comes from Planet Labs, which launched\
    \ four prototype satellites in order to test the\nperformance of the system [34].\n\
    Satellite\nconstellations\n(Landsat,\nSPOT,\nGlobal\nNavigation\nSatellite\nSystem\n\
    and\nGeoEye/WorldView families;\nRapid Eye) have identical satellites positioned\
    \ on the same\norbit to diminish the revisit time [52,53].\nSatellites that operate\
    \ in dual mode are deﬁned as a constellation, such as GOCE and the dual\nGRACE\
    \ satellites launched in 2009 to measure the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth [54].\n\
    In the recent past, satellites were characterized by a low spatial resolution\
    \ and were used for\nseveral purposes over large geographic areas, but were unable\
    \ to assess crop yield variability within\na ﬁeld [48]. Single satellite based\
    \ systems continue to improve in imaging performance, including\nbetter spatial\
    \ and spectral resolution as well as sensor agility, so in-track and cross-track\
    \ stereo capture\nis available [55]. Currently, new opportunities for mapping\
    \ and monitoring crop yield variability\nare provided by high-resolution satellite\
    \ sensors (e.g., SPOT 6 and 7, Ikonos, Quick-Bird) that have\nnarrowed the gap\
    \ between image by satellite and by airborne vehicles [56,57].\nLandsat series\
    \ from 1 to 7, for example, had a spatial resolution ranging from 30 to 79 m and\
    \ a\nradiometric resolution of 6–8 bits, usable to some extent for mapping water\
    \ quality parameters [58–61].\nLandsat 8 (12-bit radiometric resolution) is suitable\
    \ for remote sensing of water in lakes (even dark\nwith CDOM-rich); although the\
    \ revisit time of 16 days limits its use in routine monitoring of water\nbody\
    \ quality.\nSince\nsatellite\nmeasurements\nare\nnot\nsatisfactory\nfor\nmonitoring\n\
    diurnal\nvariation,\nRoussel et al. [62] noted advantages from the use of electromagnetic\
    \ waves constantly released by the\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\
    \ satellite constellations for retrieving different geophysical\nparameters of\
    \ the Earth's surface. For irrigation purposes, GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) system\
    \ is\nuseful for soil moisture monitoring, because it is able to monitor diurnal\
    \ variation [62].\nSatellite missions, labelled Sentinel 1 up to 5, were set up\
    \ for environmental monitoring [63].\nThe launch of Sentinel-2 in 2015 opened\
    \ a new era in remote sensing. This system has a medium spatial\nresolution, super-spectral\
    \ instrument with a ﬁeld of view of 290 km, a revisit capability of 5 days\n(two\
    \ satellites), a resolution of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, and a moderately large band\
    \ set (13 spectral bands)\naiming to provide global land coverage. The mission\
    \ ensures continuity of the previous missions\n(Landsat and SPOT) and provides\
    \ geochemical and physical variables, land cover maps and land\nchange detection\
    \ maps. Its image spatial resolution (from 60 m to 10 m) allows the monitoring\
    \ of several\nsmall water bodies as reported by Toming et al. [64], who have shown\
    \ that Sentinel-2 was able to map\nwater quality. It may monitor Chlorophyll a\
    \ (Chl a) as an indicator of phytoplankton, Chromophoric\n(or colored) Dissolved\
    \ Organic Materials, and Dissolved Organic Material concentrations.\nImmitzer\
    \ et al. [65] have assessed the suitability of Sentinel 2 data in agriculture\
    \ for land cover\nclassiﬁcations. Results appeared encouraging, although the classiﬁcation\
    \ results for the pixel- and\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n7 of 36\nthe object-based\
    \ approach were not extremely high. The authors relied on the support of two twin\
    \ S2\nsatellites for consistently improving spectral and temporal information\
    \ with high spatial resolution.\nSaadi et al. [66] have conducted an experiment\
    \ on regional evapotranspiration and crop\nwater consumption estimated over an\
    \ irrigated area in Tunisia with the SAMIR model that used\nSPOT high-resolution\
    \ time series. The SAMIR model was calibrated with local evapotranspiration\n\
    measurements taken from ﬂux towers. It was validated at plot and perimeter scales\
    \ using known\nirrigation volumes. The objective of the work was to assess the\
    \ operational feasibility and accuracy\nof SAMIR outputs at plot and perimeter\
    \ scales, in a context of high land cover complexity (i.e., trees,\nwinter cereals,\
    \ summer vegetables) and limited data available for parameterization. The authors\n\
    concluded that acquisition frequency (ﬁve days) of the satellite Sentinel-2 would\
    \ not answer the\nproblem of cloudiness, even in semi-arid conditions, as in the\
    \ case of Tunisia. The authors suggested\nthe combination with Landsat8 or SPOT,\
    \ which have VIS-NIR high-resolution sensors. Using these\ntime series, including\
    \ clear images approximately every 20 days, would make it possible to estimate\n\
    irrigation volumes at perimeters scale. The seasonal volumes estimated by this\
    \ method appeared\nacceptable, even though results at ﬁner timescales (monthly\
    \ and below) need to be improved.\nA variety of variables (e.g., leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content, leaf water content, leaf area index) are\nproposed for Sentinel-2 as\
    \ inputs to earth system models. Van der Werff and van der Meer [63]\nsummarized\
    \ spectral position (λ) and bandwidth (∆λ), spatial resolution, heritage and purpose\
    \ of\nSentinel-2 bands, according to the Copernicus derived user requirements.\n\
    Escorihuela and Quintana-Seguí [67] reported recently on soil moisture measurements\
    \ by remote\nsensing at local and regional scales. Recent technical developments\
    \ have allowed the outgrowth\nof space borne L-band microwave radiometry. Two\
    \ satellite missions, the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity (SMOS, 2009) and the\
    \ Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP, 2015) provide global mapping of\nsurface\
    \ soil moisture based on radiometric measurements at L-band (21 cm, 1.4 GHz).\
    \ The authors\nfound SMOS to be the only satellite able to detect irrigation and\
    \ the only one that does not show clear\nvegetation or roughness effects and is\
    \ able to map irrigated areas. Entekhabi et al. [68] produced\ncomposited maps\
    \ of the difference between weekly mean soil moisture over one week, one month,\n\
    and three months.\nThe NASA report “Microwave Technologies Review and Strategy”\
    \ [69] contained an overview\nof technologies for Earth science measurements involving\
    \ passive microwave radiometry for soil\nmonitoring. The Soil Moisture Active\
    \ Passive mission goal was to produce global maps of surface\nsoil moisture at\
    \ low (36 km) and high resolution (9 km).\nThe mission was based on L-band\nradiometer\
    \ and radar/radiometer measurements for low and high-resolution maps, respectively.\n\
    The preliminary results of the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA)\
    \ for retrieving\n(i) soil moisture; (ii) Vegetation Optical Depth; and (iii)\
    \ scattering albedo estimates, from passive\nmicrowave measurements alone and\
    \ without reliance of a priori information were reported. At L-band,\nthe Vegetation\
    \ Optical Depth was related to total vegetation water content and albedo to structural\n\
    changes. The analysis of these two parameters, at different temporal and spatial\
    \ scales, disclosed the\npotential of L-band microwave sensors for ecological\
    \ studies on a global scale [70]. Kojima et al. [71]\nreport an estimate of Soil\
    \ Moisture Distributions across Small Farm Fields with ALOS/PALSAR.\nThe ALOS\
    \ (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) has an active microwave sensor; PALSAR (Phased\n\
    Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) has a ﬁne resolution of 6.5 m. Because\
    \ of the ﬁne resolution,\nPALSAR provides the possibility of estimating soil moisture\
    \ distributions in small farmlands. Making\nsuch small-scale estimates has not\
    \ been possible with traditional satellite remote sensing techniques.\n3.2.2.\
    \ Airborne Platforms\nAirborne platforms (from 50 m to 50 km) carry out downward\
    \ or sideward sensors to obtain\nearth’s surface images. Airborne platforms give\
    \ images with a spatial resolution of 20 cm or less, much\nhigher than satellite\
    \ maps, but they have low coverage area and high cost per unit area. For these\n\
    reasons, it is not proﬁtable to monitor and map large areas. Airborne missions\
    \ are one-time operations,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n8 of 36\nwhereas satellites\
    \ provide continuous target monitoring [72]. The quality of images acquired may\
    \ be\ndegraded by factors that introduce blurring, improper focusing, atmospheric\
    \ scattering and target\nmotion [34,40]. The ﬁelds of application of airborne\
    \ remote sensing are numerous, such as biodiversity,\nbiogeochemical cycles, climate\
    \ change, eco-hydrology, infectious disease, land use, invasive species.\nFor\
    \ natural and agricultural environments, it is worth mentioning airborne remote\
    \ sensing studies\non vegetation: (i) cover amount; (ii) dominant type; (iii)\
    \ canopy structure (height and Leaf Area Index);\n(iv) crop status; (v) canopy\
    \ chemistry (nitrogen index); (vi) crop greenness; and (vii) crop health in\n\
    relation to topography (elevation, slope and aspect) [73–77].\nMost data seen\
    \ in Google Earth, and the imagery of towns and cities, are supplied by Bluesky\
    \ and\nDigitalGlobe, and are not taken from a satellite. On a plane or helicopter\
    \ it is simple to remove/replace\nthe old sensor with a new one that is more precise\
    \ and accurate. Furthermore, it is possible to take\nseveral ﬂights until the\
    \ proper and correct image is acquired. Moreover, a plane or helicopter, different\n\
    from satellites, can ﬂy with unfavorable weather conditions (high-level clouds).\
    \ Even imperfect images\ncan undergo a post-processing stage for correcting atmospheric\
    \ problems. Helicopters are usually used\nfor low altitude applications where\
    \ the ability to hover is required. Airborne hyperspectral imagery\nhas been evaluated\
    \ for estimating crop yields [78,79], green biomass [80], and crop disease [81].\n\
    In one of the ﬁrst examples of application of airborne imaging to crop farming,\
    \ Alvino and\nZerbi [82] set up an experimental ﬁeld capable of creating a continuous\
    \ gradient of water table level\nduring the rainy season. Four inclined water\
    \ tables were obtained (Figure 1). Figure 1b was taken\nin summer 1986 by an aircraft\
    \ with conventional imaging equipment. Figure 1c is the conversion of\nthe color\
    \ photo to grayscale image, and then conversion to false colors. The upper part\
    \ of the image\n(darker soil color) corresponds to the most drained part of the\
    \ ﬁeld during the winter season, which\nwas then excluded from measurements. Results\
    \ of the experiment are published by Alvino et al. [83],\nreporting the effect\
    \ of shallow water tables on peach trees grafted on three peach seedlings.\nThere\

    \ unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) are the most common airborne platforms for\n\
    civilian and military aircraft remote sensing applications [84].\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n9 of 36\nRemote sensing with UAVs has very high resolution. It\
    \ provides fast and low-cost data, and cloud\ncover does not prevent acquisition,\
    \ so it is an important instrument for monitoring and managing\ncrops during the\
    \ growing season [85,86].\nUAVs come in different sizes related to their total\
    \ weight. The small systems were deﬁned\nas an UAV of a maximum weight of 25 kg.\
    \ Watts et al. [87], Matese et al. [51], DeBell et al. [88],\nCandiago et al.\
    \ [89], and Toth and Jó´zków [34] describe current UAS systems (ﬁxed and rotating\
    \ wing),\nsolutions and applications. The following description provides only\
    \ the basics for the UAV remote\nsensing ﬁeld; an extended recent review (monograph)\
    \ on the topic can be found in Pajeres [90], as well\nas in Toth and Jó´zków [34].\n\
    Large volumes of UAVs are expected to ﬂy in upcoming years, so safe operation\
    \ is essential for\nthe user and the public. There are extremely large numbers\
    \ of UAV applications to remote sensing [34].\nColomina and Molina [91] reported\
    \ the evolution of the use of UAVs in the ﬁeld of photogrammetry\nand remote sensing.\n\
    Another state-of-the-art example is available in Sankaran et al. [92], who studied\
    \ the use of UAV\ntechnology for various crop applications (crop emergence, vigor,\
    \ characterization of yield potential).\nThe review also reported the potential\
    \ and future perspectives of using UAV imaging to evaluate the\neffect of biotic\
    \ and abiotic stresses for crop breeding and precision crop yield management.\n\
    DeBell et al. [88] suggested that UAVs are set to become a crucial factor of a\
    \ water-resource\nmanagement toolkit. They can ensure high-resolution data (not\
    \ available from other platforms such as\nsatellites or aircrafts), in a cost-effective\
    \ way and in a more sustainable way for water-resource\ntargets.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest the use of UAVs for data analysis of water resource information\n(e.g.,\
    \ regular surveys of reservoir resources, soil moisture assessments by thermal\
    \ imaging, more\neffective consumption).\nAn interesting point of view was reported\
    \ by Anderson [53], who put an emphasis on remote and\nproximal sensing changes\
    \ due to a variety of sensors ﬁtted to drones and kites to improve ﬁne-grained\n\
    understanding of environmental processes. Anderson et al. [93] also proposed a\
    \ grassroots remote\nsensing and democratic mapping for delivering rapid spatial\
    \ data (GeoTIFF images) from lightweight\ndrones and kites with open-source geospatial\
    \ toolkits and android smartphone apps.\nUAVs offer many advantages with respect\
    \ to other platforms, the main one relying on readiness\nand repeatability of\
    \ the measurements. The UAV operator can monitor the procedure and decide\nto\
    \ repeat the ﬂight if something went wrong. Conversely, each satellite has a speciﬁc\
    \ revisit time\n(see Table 1), and it is almost impossible to replicate a survey.\
    \ The airborne ﬂights try to reduce costs\nby bringing together several targets\
    \ and actions (e.g., one strip on different subjects or many strips on\nthe same\
    \ one). This prevents modiﬁcation of the ﬂight plan. The operation costs are the\
    \ lowest for\nthe UAVs, which are ﬂexible and may change sensors/missions/objectives\
    \ easily. However, satellite\nsensors cannot be replaced when they are obsolete\
    \ or out of service.\n3.2.4. Ground-Based Platforms\nThe more common ground-based\
    \ platforms (up to 50 m) are tripods, towers, poles, and cranes,\nas well as instruments\
    \ mounted on vehicles. They are characterized by different land coverage:\nshort\
    \ (50–100 m), medium (150–250 m), and long (up to 1 km).\nPlatforms may be temporary\n\
    or permanent and are usually used to support research projects, even for micro-meteorological\n\
    measurements like, for example, for Bowen-ratio and Eddy-covariance [94].\nImportant\
    \ data can be also collected in the ﬁeld using vehicle-mounted instruments.\n\
    O’Shaughnessy et al. [95] have studied how to enhance crop-water-use efﬁciency\
    \ by reducing\nirrigation losses and enhancing soil water availability. The authors\
    \ underline that abiotic and biotic\nfactors can increase the yield gap through\
    \ a reduction of water use and of crop yield potential.\nEmerging technologies,\
    \ such as wireless communication, may be integrated with soil and plant sensors\n\
    (variable-rate irrigation equipment, and decision support systems).\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n10 of 36\nAqeel-ur-Rehman et al. [96] discussed different examples\
    \ of the use of sensors and their networks\nfor agriculture and irrigation purposes.\
    \ Damas et al. [97] developed an automatic irrigation system\nwith signiﬁcant\
    \ water conservation (i.e., up to 30–60%). Evans and Bergman [98] worked on precision\n\
    irrigation control of self-propelled, linear-movement and center-pivot irrigation\
    \ systems, controlled by\nwireless technology. To improve water use efﬁciency,\
    \ Morais et al. [99] implemented a smart irrigated\nsystem piloted by a wireless\
    \ data acquisition network to acquire environmental (climate) and soil\nmoisture\
    \ data. Basu et al. [100] set a drip-irrigation-control system characterized by\
    \ remote sensing\ndata acquisition. Kim et al. [101] devised a site-speciﬁc sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system equipped with a\nreal time sensor (using Bluetooth and GPS\
    \ technologies) and control software based on soil moisture,\ntemperature and\
    \ weather information data. Kim and Evans [102] and Evans et al. [103] improved\n\
    the above noted irrigation system with “in-ﬁeld data feedback to support the decision-making\
    \ and real-time\nmonitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio\
    \ communication”. Thompson et al. [104]\nstudied soil moisture sensors to support\
    \ the decision-making irrigation management scheduling.\nThe study was aimed at\
    \ determining threshold values of soil water characteristics (matric potential\n\
    and available soil water content), using appropriate values of leaf water potential\
    \ for pepper, melon,\nspring tomato and winter tomato crops.\n4. Approaches to\
    \ Precision Irrigation\nRemote sensing has many potential applications in many\
    \ ﬁelds and at different scales. Table 2\nlists ﬁeld applications of remote sensing\
    \ in agriculture. Moran et al. [28] summarized the important\nrole of remote sensing\
    \ in site-speciﬁc farming.\nRemote Sensing can provide non-destructive, automatic,\
    \ and continuous measurements, easily\nimplemented with data transmission systems\
    \ for the user to have nearly real time access to the\ncollected data from a remote\
    \ computer, smart phone or similar [30].\nMost of these methods\nand related systems\
    \ are highly sensitive and capable of working under ﬁeld conditions for long\n\
    periods. These characteristics confer great potential for both monitoring water\
    \ stress and scheduling\nirrigation [105].\nTable 2. Applications of remote sensing\

    \ resources\nRemote sensing can provide precise information of irrigated crop\
    \ areas [106] by monitoring the\nphenological development of crops through multi-temporal\
    \ image [107].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n11 of 36\nCrop water status is the\
    \ crucial biophysical property, used in particular to manage irrigation\nby remote\
    \ sensing. It is, in most cases, directly associated to the available soil water\
    \ content, and in\nother conditions to soil salt content when salinity is a limiting\
    \ factor of water uptake. Similarly, plant\ndiseases, which may be obstacles to\
    \ plant-water ﬂow, may negatively inﬂuence crop water status,\nwhich becomes an\
    \ indicator of disease presence and severity [108,109]. Crop water status can\
    \ be\nquantiﬁed at the canopy and leaf levels, by monitoring leaf or stem water\
    \ potential, or leaf water\ncontent [110]. Unfortunately, this simplistic view\
    \ is complicated by several plant factors (root signaling,\naerodynamic characteristics\
    \ of vegetation, genetic control of crop performance, etc.), which interact\n\
    in a complicated way with environmental factors, such as solar radiation (intensity\
    \ and insulation),\nwind speed and direction, air humidity, and air temperature.\
    \ Plant species may or may not be highly\ncoupled to the environment [111]. The\
    \ Ω coefﬁcient (or decoupling coefﬁcient) is a measure of the\ncoupling between\
    \ conditions at the canopy surface and in the free airstream (well above the crop),\
    \ and\ncan vary between 0 (for perfect coupling) to 1 (for complete isolation).\
    \ Jones [111] reports Ω values of\n0.85, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3 for strawberry, tomato,\
    \ raspberry, and citrus orchards, respectively. In other words, a\ncitrus orchard\
    \ is more coupled to the environment than more dense horticultural crops. The\
    \ concept is\nsummarized by Hsiao [112], who stated that relatively open, tall\
    \ and aerodynamically rough canopies\nmade of small leaves facilitate turbulence\
    \ and air movement within the canopy, and therefore, are\nclosely coupled to the\
    \ air overhead. Conifer forests show a low decoupling factor Ω. In contrast, dense,\n\
    smooth and short canopies, with all the leaves packed into the limited vertical\
    \ space, would obstruct air\nmovement and therefore are nearly uncoupled from\
    \ the air overhead. For many ﬁeld and horticultural\ncrops with short and dense\
    \ canopies, control of transpiration may be expected to be minimal until\nstomata\
    \ close, and canopy conductance decreases markedly. Another crucial point is the\
    \ ability of\nsome crops to limit their leaf water potential, preventing it from\
    \ falling below a critical level (isohydric\nbehavior). Marino et al. [113] have\
    \ reported that daytime leaf water status (or water potential) was\nmaintained\
    \ relatively constant as long as the potential transpiration exceeded the hydraulic\
    \ threshold.\nThis means that water potential of the leaves remained relatively\
    \ constant during the day and during\nperiods of minor-to-moderate water stress\
    \ events, regardless of soil water status, because of active\nstomatal control.\
    \ The assessment of the isohydric crop response is important for crop-water-use\n\
    predictions and requirements, and photosynthetic productivity under uneven irrigation\
    \ conditions.\nIn contrast, many species show unisohydric behavior with leaf water\
    \ potential relatively coupled\nto the environment. The different behavior of\
    \ isohydric and unisohydric plants may affect Remote\nSensing measurements based\
    \ on thermography. Two crops, one isohydric and the other unisohydric,\nboth held\
    \ in non-limiting soil water conditions, would be expected to return different\
    \ values of Crop\nWater Stress Index (CWSI). Since both crops are well-watered,\
    \ the differing behaviors of isohydric and\nunisohydric crops may affect irrigation\
    \ scheduling if appropriate corrections are not applied to each\nspecies (e.g.,\
    \ by using different thermal index threshold values).\nAccording to Casa et al\
    \ [114], several methodologies are available for estimating crop water use\nand\
    \ water use efﬁciency. Evett [115] developed a theoretical approach to precision\
    \ irrigation based on\nremote sensing, considered a powerful, practical and cost-effective\
    \ tool for obtaining comparable yield,\ncrop quality, and water and nutrient use\
    \ efﬁciencies proﬁtably and sustainably. In the ﬁeld of irrigation,\nﬁve major\
    \ approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing were reported (Table\
    \ 3).\nThe ﬁve approaches can be grouped into three major categories related to\
    \ ET estimation (point 1\nand 4); infrared thermography (point 2 and 3) and crop\
    \ characteristics (point 5). Many papers report\n“new methods” to calculate precision\
    \ irrigation based on remote sensing, combining, simplifying or\nintegrating the\
    \ methods described above.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n12 of 36\nTable 3. Five\
    \ major approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing. From Evett [115].\n\
    1\nScheduling irrigation to replace ET estimated from a reference ET (ETo), calculated\
    \ from local weather data,\nwhich is multiplied by a crop coefﬁcient estimated\
    \ with a crop coefﬁcient function, Kc (NDVI), where NDVI is\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetative index (NDVI) or a similar index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\n\
    The NDVI is based on canopy irradiance in the red and near-infrared bands, which\
    \ can be remotely sensed.\n2\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount of water\
    \ whenever a trigger to irrigate is generated by the crop water\nstress index\
    \ (CWSI), which is estimated using remotely sensed surface temperature (Ts) and\
    \ local weather data.\n3\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount when triggered\
    \ by the time-temperature threshold index (TTTI) reaching\na crop and region-speciﬁc\
    \ value. The TTTI is calculated using Ts.\n4\nScheduling irrigation to replace\
    \ ET estimated with the ﬁeld surface energy balance (FSEB), which uses remotely\n\
    sensed surface temperature, Ts, determined from thermal infrared data, and data\
    \ on canopy cover and surface\nemissivity deduced from the near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ and visible bands.\n5\nSensing of crop and soil characteristics in order to\
    \ guide timing, placement, and amount of fertilizer and water\nthrough irrigation\
    \ (or fertigation) systems of various orders of precision. The characteristics,\
    \ including crop cover\nfraction, nitrogen status of leaves, disease, and pest\
    \ damage, all of which vary spatially and temporally, are\ninferred from various\
    \ remotely sensed vegetative indices.\nEvett proposed an electronic hardware and\
    \ software system that acquires data from sensors and controls the\noperation\
    \ of other hardware to pilot irrigation. This Supervisory control and data acquisition\
    \ system (SCADA)\nacquires in situ, remotely sensed, or near-surface remotely\
    \ sensed crop, soil, and micrometeorological properties as\ninputs for a decision-making\
    \ algorithm. The system applies deﬁned amounts of water at deﬁned times automatically\n\
    through control of an integrated irrigation application system.\n4.1. ET Estimation\n\
    Satellite Remote Sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration has become a popular\
    \ tool and a focus of\nstudy in the past two to three decades. High-resolution\
    \ daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps would\ngreatly improve irrigation crop management\
    \ [116]. Remote Sensing based ET estimation roughly\nstarted in the 1980s and\
    \ has evolved into a variety of approaches and models as reported in an\nexhaustive\
    \ paper by Zhang et al. [117]. In addition, Liou and Kar [118] reported the estimation\
    \ of ET\nwith RS and various surface-energy-balance algorithms (SEBAL). The authors\
    \ reviewed these different\nsatellites based approaches and the main physical\
    \ bases and assumptions of these algorithms.\nIt is difﬁcult to categorize these\
    \ methods, since they try to compensate for the empirical modules\nand physically\
    \ based modules used. Table 4 lists a classiﬁcation by Courault et al. [119]\n\
    Table 4. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation model categories. From Courault et\
    \ al. [119]\n1\nEmpirically direct methods (remote sensing data are introduced\
    \ directly in semi-empirical models to estimate ET)\n2\nResidual methods of the\
    \ energy budget (combining some empirical relationships and physical modules in\n\
    models such as SEBAL)\n3\nDeterministic methods (more complex models such as Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere\
    \ Transfer models (SVAT),\nwhich compute the different components of energy budget\
    \ (ISBA, Meso-NH)\n4\nVegetation-index methods (remote sensing to compute Kc or\
    \ Priestley Taylor-alpha parameters).\nRemote sensing techniques for estimating\
    \ ET from satellites [120] have been developed from\nenergy balances, thus generating\
    \ estimates of actual evapotranspiration [121,122]. The University\nof Idaho (USA)\
    \ has developed a model to estimate ET called Mapping Evapo Transpiration\nwith\
    \ high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [122], based on the Surface\
    \ Energy\nBalance Algorithms from the Land (SEBAL) model of Bastiaanssen et al.\
    \ [121]. In METRIC, the\nevapotranspiration is calculated from Landsat imagery\
    \ calculating the available energy using the\nearth surface temperature (Ts) derived\
    \ from satellite imagery thermal bands, to constrain the heat\nﬂux for one or\
    \ more layers (canopy and soil), and then computing the latent heat as a residual\
    \ to the\nsurface energy balance [123]. In other words, the energy utilized by\
    \ the ET process is considered as a\nresidual of the SEBAL equation. The ratio\
    \ between actual evapotranspiration (Etcrop) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (Eto) can be calculated only when ET is measured; this ratio is the Kcact, namely\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n13 of 36\nthe actual crop coefﬁcient [124]. Allen et\
    \ al. [122] reported this method (Crop ET estimations based on\nKcact) is a useful\
    \ tool for ﬁeld and regional water management.\nThe energy-balance approach has\
    \ the beneﬁt that it can be utilized to quantify the dimensions\nof irrigated\
    \ ﬁelds and their water-use dynamics, without reference to source of water as\
    \ opposed to\na water balance model. This latter model necessitates the information\
    \ of both the magnitude and\ntemporal distribution of rainfall and irrigation\
    \ applied to ﬁelds [125]. Temperature-based methods, as\nSEBAL, can be automated\
    \ and likely outperform vegetation-based methods in irrigated areas, especially\n\
    under conditions of low vegetation cover and high soil evaporation. According\
    \ to Biggs et al. [126],\nan automated SEBAL can estimate the evaporative fraction\
    \ from irrigated crops with a mean error of\n14% of Rn (range 218% to 124%). Allen\
    \ et al. [127] conﬁrmed the maturing technology of SEBAL and\nMETRIC for deriving\
    \ a satellite-driven surface energy balance for estimating ET from the ground’s\n\
    surface. The authors foresee a great future for these models in the scientiﬁc\
    \ groups dealing with\nwater resources.\nSantos et al. [120] have combined METRIC-derived\
    \ estimates of ET with a water balance model\nnamed LORMOD [128] to evaluate,\
    \ at a plot level, the use of near-real time ET estimates to update\nand correct\
    \ irrigation scheduling predictions and to assess its impact on WUE. ET estimates\
    \ derived\nfrom satellites were used in a daily soil-water-balance model to improve\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld ET\ndemands and, as a consequence, ﬁeld-scale irrigation\
    \ schedules. This approach combined high spatial\nresolution (satellite RS) data\
    \ with high temporal resolution data (daily soil-water-balance), providing\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances in irrigation schedules, as reported for cotton (a 24% reduction) increasing\
    \ ﬁeld\nirrigation efﬁciency to 0.72; the ﬁeld irrigation efﬁciency reached 0.90\
    \ for sugar beet [120].\nTrezza et al. [129] reported an estimation of actual\
    \ ET for central New Mexico. They matched ET\nimages derived from MODIS with those\
    \ taken by Landsat. The adoption of a METRIC model based on\nMODIS imageries produced\
    \ monthly and annual ET estimates, comparable to those obtained with\nLandsat\
    \ imagery.\nElhaddad and Garcia [130] reported a ReSET model based on wind from\
    \ multiple weather stations\nand the use of a weather station for the model calibration.\
    \ This ﬂexible approach generated raster\ninterpolated weather parameters, accounting\
    \ for spatial variation of weather parameters between\nweather stations, which\
    \ can be signiﬁcant. They found that ET calculated using this approach could\n\
    vary by 17% compared with ET calculated with point values.\nSubsequently, Elhaddad\
    \ and Garcia [131] assessed the use of actual ET calculated by ReSET to\nestimate\
    \ seasonal crop water use at regional scale instead of the traditional ET estimation\
    \ method\nbased on reference ET and crop coefﬁcients.\nOrtega-Farías et al. [132]\
    \ estimated the energy balance components over a drip-irrigated olive\norchard,\
    \ using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter-based unmanned\
    \ aerial\nvehicle, acquiring high-resolution images to assess intra-ﬁeld spatial\
    \ variability.\nIn the ﬁeld of irrigation scheduling/WUE, there are very few concrete\
    \ outcomes. In particular,\nD’Urso et al. [133] analyzed, from the PLEIADeS framework,\
    \ ﬁve agricultural systems, in a broad\nrange of arid and semi-arid conditions\
    \ characteristic for the European, Southern Mediterranean, and\nAmerican regions.\
    \ The aim of the project was to improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation schemes,\
    \ made\npossible through wide space–time coverage of Earth Observation data and\
    \ interactive networking\ncapabilities of Information and Communication Technologies.\
    \ They included the following: canopy\nparameters, fractional vegetation cover,\
    \ LAI, albedo, crop coefﬁcients, potential ET, irrigation water\nrequirements.\
    \ They conﬁrmed the possibility of estimating crop coefﬁcient from NDVI, relying\
    \ upon\nadvances in spatial and radiometric accuracy of new sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2),\
    \ for a full exploitation of\ntheir applications.\nPeña-Arancibia et al. [107]\
    \ quantiﬁed irrigation water use and water provenance (surface water\nor groundwater),\
    \ combining t remote sensing data on irrigation dynamics and actual ET linked\
    \ with\na river-reach hydrological model. They concluded that the results were\
    \ as accurate as those of more\ntraditional irrigation area modelling using remotely\
    \ sensed irrigated areas. Actual ET data can be used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n\
    14 of 36\nto understand irrigation dynamics, the constraints in irrigation models,\
    \ and speciﬁc areas that require\nbetter monitoring.\nVanino et al. [134] estimated\
    \ the ET and crop coefﬁcients of table grape vineyards trained on\noverhead “tendone”\
    \ systems in the Apulia region (Italy). The FAO direct methodology for estimating\n\
    potential evapotranspiration (ETp) was used to estimate maximum vineyard transpiration.\
    \ The model,\nbased on existing validated methodologies, used appropriate values\
    \ of canopy variables (albedo and\nthe LAI) derived by means of multispectral\
    \ satellite data. ETp values (mean seasonal daily ET) ranged\nbetween 4.2 and\
    \ 4.1 mm·d−1, and from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013 and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014 for the midseason\n\
    values, respectively. The results indicated that the values of Kc are site- and\
    \ year-speciﬁc and depend\non local ET0 rates, rainfall frequency, cumulative\
    \ thermal requirements, and effective canopy cover.\nThe resulting crop water\
    \ requirements were lower than the actual average irrigation volumes applied\n\
    by farmers, thus suggesting the possibility of improving the water use efﬁciency\
    \ of these crops by\nadopting the proposed methodology. We agree with the authors\
    \ that, in the Mediterranean, few studies\nhave investigated the satellite Kc\
    \ estimation for vineyards.\nLópez-López et al. [135] estimated ET starting from\
    \ ﬁeld weather data and Kc estimated with a\nfunction related to vegetation indices\
    \ such as NDVI or index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\nKamble et al. [136]\
    \ studied how to estimate Kc directly from reﬂectance and VIs derived from\na\
    \ satellite. The authors found that NDVI-Kc quantiﬁed from remote sensing could\
    \ be useful for\nestimating WUE, irrigation scheduling and performance, and agricultural\
    \ water budgets. The NDVI-Kc\nmay be also utilized for agriculture water conservation,\
    \ starting from local to continental scales.\nRecently, Battista et al. [137]\
    \ published a paper with the aim of demonstrating how spatialized\nmeteorological\
    \ data and remote sensing techniques may allow one to estimate actual ET and the\
    \ soil\nwater content of a small plot (about 0.1 ha) of an olive orchard. As a\
    \ rule, for Mediterranean areas,\ntrees were covered by several herbaceous species.\
    \ The authors found that the NDVI-Cws (coefﬁcient of\nwater stress) method is\
    \ a suitable tool for estimating daily olive tree actual transpiration and soil\
    \ water\ncontent in complex and multi-layer Mediterranean agricultural ecosystems.\
    \ The novelty of the adopted\nmethod was to consider the spatially fragmented,\
    \ two-layer structure of an olive orchard. For instance,\nthe ETa of trees and\
    \ grasses were combined with weather data (precipitation) to assess the site-speciﬁc\n\
    water balance, which was assessed through comparison with daily measurements of\
    \ soil water content.\nMoreover, this highlighted the importance of separating\
    \ trees and grasses for estimation of the NDVI,\nadopting statistical operations\
    \ to satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal properties.\nMarshall et\
    \ al. [138], with the aim of partitioning ET into soil evaporation and crop transpiration,\n\
    studied the ratio-based vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) retrieved from optical\
    \ remote sensing,\nhighlighting their limitations and how VIs can induce large\
    \ model error. NDVI explained half of the\nvariability in transpiration, the largest\
    \ component of ET. However, to estimate total ET one should\nconsider the Photochemical\
    \ Reﬂectance Index (PRI). To estimate soil evaporation, the authors suggest\n\
    two new ratio-based indices derived from NIR bands 743 and 953 nm and visible\
    \ blue 428 nm and\nfrom SWIR1 bands 1518 nm.\nGonzález-Dugo and Mateos [139] used\
    \ an approach based on the conjecture that variations in\nthe size of the crop\
    \ have much stronger effects on its ET than variations in stomatal conductance.\n\
    This assumption seems to be valid for irrigated crops, according to several studies\
    \ [140–142]. The results\nshowed the potential of this method for ﬁeld application.\
    \ Since there is little agreement on the nature\nof the relationships between\
    \ VIs and Kc, the latter can be estimated from spectral measurements.\nThe rationale\
    \ is that both the component of the crop coefﬁcient that represents transpiration\
    \ (Kcb)\nand VIs are sensitive to crop biomass (LAI and ground cover fraction—fc).\
    \ The relationships between\nKcb and VIs could be linear or non-linear. The linearity\
    \ of these relationships depends on the crop\narchitecture [143]. Er-Raki et al.\
    \ [142] used the same approach to derive Kcb values of wheat crops,\nanalyzing\
    \ the relationships between VIs, and both LAI and fc.\nThe use of remotely-sensed-vegetation\
    \ indices has been tested to predict crop coefﬁcients at\ndifferent scales. In\
    \ fact, González-Dugo and Mateos [139] found that the NDVI and SAVI were strictly\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n15 of 36\nrelated to LAI, vegetation ground cover and\
    \ biomass. These relationships were obtained by radiometric\nmeasurements obtained\
    \ from satellite and ground-based platforms. The relationship is simple and\n\
    robust and may be used for studying WUE and water productivity at a regional level.\n\
    The statistical analyses of ﬁeld data and remote sensing data, derived from multispectral\
    \ imagery\nusing an UAV, conﬁrms the feasibility of applying the proposed methods\
    \ to assess physiological and\nstructural properties of Citrus under water and\
    \ saline stress. The novelty of this study was to show\nthat diurnal changes in\
    \ physiological and structural traits of citrus irrigated with RW combined with\n\
    RDI could be determined by multispectral images from UAVs. NIR was a useful indicator\
    \ of s, A and\ngs on both crops. The NDVI was strictly related to gas exchange\
    \ in both species and on mandarin [144].\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] hypothesized\
    \ that the index PRI (normalized by canopy chlorophyll\ncontent), might be a strong\
    \ indicator of the diurnal dynamics of water stress.\nThey acquired\nnarrow-band\
    \ multispectral and thermal imageries over a vineyard cultivated under three different\n\
    irrigation treatments, and evaluated the relationships between the normalized\
    \ PRI, ﬁeld-physiological\nparameters (stomatal conductance) and plant water potential.\
    \ Relationships with CWSI, which were\nused as a remote sensing benchmark for\
    \ water stress detection, were also discussed by the authors,\nwho reasoned that\
    \ CWSI can be used as a remote sensing benchmark for water stress detection. Some\n\
    critical points were suggested for integrating VIs derived by UAVs and everyday\
    \ water resource\nmanagement, such as the integration of differential global positioning\
    \ and the development of\nintelligent control of UAV platforms to improve positional\
    \ accuracy and spatial data capture.\nA review by Kang et al. [146] set up the\
    \ ﬁrst worldwide dataset to analyze the global LAI-VI\nrelationships at different\
    \ spatial and temporal scales. Analysis was derived from low-resolution (30 m)\n\
    satellite Landsat images, with the goal of producing large-scale ﬁne resolution\
    \ LAI maps, essential\nfor agricultural applications, especially in mosaic agriculture.\
    \ The authors reported that the LAI-VI\nrelationships were crop-speciﬁc and may\
    \ explain why the largest amount of variance in ﬁeld-measured\nLAI was obtained\
    \ using only remotely sensed observations.\n4.2. Infrared Thermography\n4.2.1.\
    \ CWSI\nScientists tried to ﬁnd indexes that describe the relationship between\
    \ and thermal characteristics\nof plants and water stress [147]. Jackson et al.\
    \ [148] set up the CWSI, Jackson [149] the Surface\nTemperature (ST), Moran et\
    \ al. [150] the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI), Vidal et al. [151] the Stress Index\n\
    (SI), and Guilioni et al. [152] the Stomatal conductance index. Plants showing\
    \ symptoms of wilting emit\nmore longwave infrared radiation, revealing canopy\
    \ temperature. Unfortunately, canopy temperature\nis affected by meteorological\
    \ conditions at the time of measurement, so it cannot be an absolute\nindicator\
    \ of water stress.\nWe recommend several papers related to theoretical approaches\
    \ dealing with infrared\nthermography: Jones and Vaughan [40] provided a rigorous\
    \ and detailed explanation of the theory\nand practical applications of remote\
    \ sensing; Maes and Steppe [153] wrote an exhaustive review\non thermal remote\
    \ sensing technique and ﬁeld variation of plants and environmental parameters\n\
    involved. Other key papers include those from Mulla [94], Gago et al. [154], Thenkabail\
    \ et al. [155],\nand Jones [156].\nAmong the indexes cited above, the most studied\
    \ is the CWSI, which was developed at the U.S.\nWater Conservation Laboratory\
    \ in the 1970s and 1980s [148,157,158] and has been commercialized and\nwidely\
    \ used in irrigation management. Jackson et al. [148] found that CWSI was deﬁned\
    \ by the ratio of\nactual to potential ET calculated from the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation, and highlighted the usefulness\nand limitation of the index. Although\
    \ it appeared to be a promising tool for quantifying crop water\nstress, it was\
    \ unable to quantify crop water needs, or the time threshold for watering a crop.\n\
    A long list of indices is available at the website IDB (http://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i.\n\
    php?offset=1), which reports the basic information for each index including the\
    \ following: name,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n16 of 36\nabbreviation, formula,\
    \ variables, explanations of variables, wavelengths, source, description; sensors,\n\
    visualization of required spectral range; visualization of Sensor-Bands, applications,\
    \ references.\nGiven deﬁned environmental conditions (air humidity, air temperature),\
    \ the CWSI index is based\non the quantiﬁcation of the behaviour of a crop both\
    \ when it is fully transpiring and when it is not.\nLópez-López et al. [135] expressed\
    \ CWSI in terms of evapotranspiration:\nCWSI = 1 − ETc/ET0\nwhere, ETc is the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration and ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.\n\
    According to López-López [135], the relation between ETc and ET0 approaches the\
    \ theoretical values\nproposed by Jackson [148], because it is decoupled from\
    \ the wind velocity as in the classical form,\naccording to Idso et al. [158].\n\
    Idso [159] suggested replacing the estimations of VPD from minimum temperature\
    \ with air\ntemperature measurements in direct radiation on irrigated plots, with\
    \ the goal of increasing and partly\ncorrecting the inﬂuence of the superﬁcial\
    \ soil temperature on LAI. The accurate assessment of the ET\nby means of the\
    \ CWSI is assumed by the relation between ETc and the leaf’s water potential (ET0)\
    \ at\ndawn, according to Itier et al. [160].\nEvett [115] deﬁned the CWSI as:\n\
    CWSI = ((Tc − Ta)m − (Tc − Ta)l)/((Tc − Ta)u − (Tc − Ta)l)\nIt uses the crop canopy\
    \ temperature (measured by an IR thermometer or thermal images) and\nenvironmental\
    \ parameters (air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). The\
    \ canopy-air\ntemperature difference (Tc − Ta) is normalized to the lower and\
    \ upper limits of canopy-air temperature\ndifferences, which represent non-water-stressed\
    \ and completely water-stressed crops, respectively.\nThe subscript “m” denotes\
    \ measured data, while “l” denotes a lower baseline (non-water-stressed\ncrop),\
    \ “u” denotes an upper limit (completely water stressed crop), which is an estimated\
    \ parameter.\nThe (Tc − Ta)l and (Tc − Ta)u limits may be estimated either on\
    \ an empirical or theoretical basis as\ndescribed by Idso et al. [158] and Jackson\
    \ et al. [148]. Both approaches require readings of air humidity\nand air temperature\
    \ but it works better with wind speed and solar radiation data, and estimates\
    \ of\nbulk canopy resistances.\nIrrigation scheduling based on (Tc − Ta) has often\
    \ been determined by the stress degree day\nmethod (SDD), originally suggested\
    \ by Idso et al. [157] and Jackson [161]:\nSDD =\nn\n∑\ni=l\n(Tc − Ta)i\nwith\
    \ Tc and Ta measured 1–1.5 h after solar noon at day i, during a n-day period.\
    \ Irrigation was\ninitiated as soon as SDD exceeded 0. The formula was used successfully\
    \ for different crops [162], and\naccording to Maes and Steppe [153] SDD worked\
    \ well for wheat, and in semi-arid climates where\nweather conditions were expected\
    \ to differ little between consecutive days.\nAccording to King and Shellie [163],\
    \ the CWSI is also deﬁned as:\nCWSI = (Tcanopy − Tnws)/(Tdry − Tnws)\nwhere Tcanopy\
    \ is the temperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C), Tnws is the temperature\
    \ of\nfully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop is non-water-stressed (well-watered)\
    \ and Tdry is the\ntemperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop\
    \ is severely water stressed due to low soil\nwater availability. Temperatures\
    \ Tnws and Tdry are the lower and upper baselines used to normalize\nCWSI for\
    \ the effects of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ radiation, wind\nspeed, etc.) on Tcanopy. Maes and Steppe [153] emphasized the\
    \ limited application of the CWSI by the\ndifﬁculty of estimating without actually\
    \ measuring Tnws and Tdry.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n17 of 36\nJones [164] proposed\
    \ a stress index (SICWSI) analogous to the Idso-Jackson CWSI, using wet\nsurface\
    \ conductance rather than the ﬁnite value for a well-watered crop.\nSIcwsi = (Tleaf\
    \ − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\nRojo et al. [165] suggested a modiﬁed CWSI (MCWSI) in\
    \ grape and almond using the\ncontinuous leaf monitor data, where the well-watered\
    \ and dry conditions were measured using\na well-watered tree and a simulated\
    \ dry leaf. The CWSI and MCWSI indices were calculated and\nwere capable of representing\
    \ the stress level of the grape and almond crops, so variable rate irrigation\n\
    was implemented.\nThe CWSI is considered a sensitive tool for monitoring and assessing\
    \ plant water stress for a\nwide range of crops. CWSI was inversely correlated\
    \ to cotton yields [166], and positively correlated\nwith soil water depletion\
    \ for a fully developed canopy when no soil reﬂectance was present [167].\nThe\
    \ CWSI was also able to foresee a yield of several crops under stress and to develop\
    \ schemes for\nmanaging irrigation [168,169]. Furthermore, the Water Deﬁcit Index,\
    \ which is a two-dimensional CWSI\nnormalized for vegetation cover, was related\
    \ to crop water stress [150,170].\nOrta et al. [171] studied the upper and lower\
    \ baselines, and CWSI values on watermelon were\nslightly different. They tested\
    \ CWSI for scheduling irrigation for watermelon grown with ﬁve irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in terms of the replenishment of the water depletion\
    \ (0.90 m\nsoil proﬁle depth). The CWSI was calculated from IR canopy temperatures,\
    \ air temperatures, and\nvapor pressure deﬁcit values. In two years, the fully\
    \ irrigated treatment gave the highest yield and\nwater use. The CWSI values tended\
    \ to be consistent with the soil water content. The authors proposed\na linear\
    \ equation of CWSI versus yield prediction, and suggested testing in long-term\
    \ experiments a\ncritical value of CWSI at which a farmer should irrigate.\nRecently,\
    \ Bellvert et al. [172] measured the CWSI in three peach cultivars (Prunus persica\
    \ L.)\nthroughout different growing seasons. They measured the canopy temperature\
    \ of well-watered trees\nusing high-resolution thermal imagery obtained from an\
    \ airborne platform and related it to leaf water\npotential (ψL) as a water stress\
    \ indicator. Results demonstrated that (i) the CWSI had similar seasonal\nresponses\
    \ and (ii) a common “non-water-stressed baseline” can be used during the course\
    \ of the entire\ncrop season. The CWSI is a practical method for evaluating the\
    \ spatial variability of peach tree water\nstatus in heterogeneous orchards, and\
    \ for deriving ψL maps throughout a complete growing season.\nSantesteban et al.\
    \ [173] evaluated the ability of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging\nto\
    \ estimate instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within\
    \ a vineyard.\nCWSI correlated well with ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition,\
    \ showing great potential\nfor monitoring instantaneous variations in water status,\
    \ but it did not provide a good estimation of\nvariations of plant water status\
    \ on a single day. The results added evidence regarding the suitability of\nthis\
    \ approach, and reinforced the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as\
    \ an instantaneous\nwater-stress mapping tool. Similarly, Baluja et al. [174]\
    \ conducted an airborne study over a vineyard,\nwith the goal of computing image-derived\
    \ spectral and thermal indices, and indicators of water status\nin vines including\
    \ (i) the crop water stress index (CWSI), stomatal conductance index (Ig) [164]\
    \ and\n(ii) a formulation of the stomatal conductance index (I3) [164]. They concluded\
    \ that the relationship\nbetween thermal imagery and derived indices can be considered\
    \ as a short-term response, a kind\nof instantaneous “picture” of the plant water\
    \ status situation, while spectral vegetation indices are\nprobably the result\
    \ of cumulative water deﬁcits.\nBerni et al. [84] validated a methodology for\
    \ producing high-resolution maps of canopy\nconductance and CWSI, potentially\
    \ useful for calculating actual ET and as an input for scheduling\nirrigation.\
    \ The canopy of conductance and CWSI maps of olive orchards were acquired by airborne\n\
    and UAV platforms for two years with different irrigation treatments.\nTesti et\
    \ al. [175] showed that the CWSI measured in the ﬁrst afternoon hours were a good\
    \ tool\nfor identifying seasonal changes in the water status of a pistachio orchard\
    \ submitted to variable\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n18 of 36\nwater stress by\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation practices. The temperature of pistachio trees showed\
    \ great\nresponsiveness to variations in plant water status.\nLópez-López et al.\
    \ [135] analyzed ET and CWSI in tomato conﬁrming that the use of infrared\nthermometry\
    \ to calculate the CWSI is a reliable technique for scheduling irrigation using\
    \ the\ndetermined upper and lower CWSI baselines in a husk tomato crop. The CWSI\
    \ value increased\nuntil it reached 0.7 in the treatment with severe irrigation\
    \ restrictions (40% ETo).\nGonzález-Dugo et al. [176] used UAV systems to derive\
    \ CWSI from high-resolution thermal\nimagery. They assessed the spatial variability\
    \ of crop water status in a pistachio orchard for precision\nirrigation purposes.\
    \ The authors estimated a possible reduction of irrigation costs moving from\n\
    common irrigation system to a variable rate irrigation system [177].\nGonzález-Dugo\
    \ et al. [178] also used IR imagery taken by UAVs to evaluate the variability\
    \ in the\nwater status of ﬁve fruit tree species. They compared the daily differential\
    \ between Tc − Ta (canopy\nand air temperature) with the tree water status. Since\
    \ the slope of the differential with time was\nhighly correlated with water status,\
    \ the authors proposed the slope as an indicator of the stomatal\nbehavior. An\
    \ empirical approach was used to deﬁne the upper and lower limits of Tc − Ta;\
    \ CWSI\nwas calculated using the temperature data from a 13-h ﬂight. Another important\
    \ contribution of the\npaper was the assessment of variability in the water status\
    \ based on the differences in relative canopy\ntemperatures. The authors concluded\
    \ that their approach (i) was worthwhile for managing precision\nirrigation; (ii)\
    \ could identify water stressed areas; and (iii) could deﬁne threshold CWSI values,\
    \ a great\nhelp for farmers and for irrigation strategies at different phenological\
    \ stages.\nSezen et al. [179] analyzed the CWSI of red pepper irrigated with two\
    \ systems (drip and furrow)\nand with different irrigation regimes. The authors\
    \ concluded that CWSI could measure crop water\nstatus and improve irrigation\
    \ scheduling. For high-quality yields, the authors suggested CSWI values\nof 0.26\
    \ for drip irrigation and 0.38 for furrow irrigation. For both irrigation methods,\
    \ linear relations\nwere found between CWSI and red pepper yield.\nAgam et al.\
    \ [180] tested CWSI for analyzing the changes in water status of olive trees when\n\
    entering into and recovering from stress on a diurnal scale. CWSI was tested in\
    \ an empirical form\nand in two analytical conﬁgurations. The results showed that\
    \ the empirical CWSI was capable even\ngiven its limitations, while the analytical\
    \ forms of CWSI needed enhancement for monitoring the water\nstatus of olive.\
    \ The authors proposed calculating the wet temperature analytically and ﬁxing\
    \ the dry\ntemperature at a level of 5 ◦C higher than the air temperature. Thermal\
    \ imaging and water status\nmeasurements were recorded between 12:00 and 14:00.\n\
    Wang et al. [181] conducted a two-year experiment on early-ripening peach exposed\
    \ to postharvest\ndeﬁcit irrigation schemes, concluding that IR measurements might\
    \ estimate plant water stress,\nparticularly in high-radiative arid and semi-arid\
    \ climates. They found that the temperature differences\n(infrared-canopy temperature\
    \ and air temperature) where correlated to stem water potential and\nproved to\
    \ be a useful tool for water stress assessment for managing regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\n\
    Temperature differences (midday canopy to air temperature) ranged from 5 to 7\
    \ ◦C in the water-stressed\npostharvest deﬁcit irrigation treatments, while they\
    \ ranged from 1.4 to 2 ◦C in the non-water-stressed\ncontrol treatments.\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] calculated CWSI for four 1-hour periods, ranging from 10:00 to\
    \ 14:00,\neach day for 29 days.\nThe estimated CWSI was smallest from 10:00 to\
    \ 11:00 and largest from\n12:00 to 13:00. These values may be used for precise\
    \ (amounts and timing) irrigation scheduling.\nWhen measurements were taken during\
    \ earlier hours, the authors suggested adopting a conservative\nthreshold value\
    \ of CWSI; in contrast, they suggested higher levels when measurements were recorded\n\
    one hour after solar noon.\nGarcía-Tejero et al. [183] conducted a study using\
    \ thermal data to monitor crop-water status in\nirrigated Mediterranean viticulture.\
    \ They found that CWSI and IG might provide more meaningful\ninformation about\
    \ the crop-water status than Tcanopy-air.\nThe authors also found that TC was\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n19 of 36\nsigniﬁcantly correlated with gs and net assimilation,\
    \ suggesting that it can be used as a simpler\nparameter to support thermal remote\
    \ sensing of water stress in grapevines.\nKullber et al. [184] compared and evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of several water-stress coefﬁcient\nmethods for estimating crop\
    \ ETc under different levels of deﬁcit irrigation. Four canopy temperature\nbased\
    \ methods were used to calculate Ks: CWSI, Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tc ratio),\
    \ Degrees Above\nNon-Stressed Temperature (DANS), Degrees Above Canopy Threshold\
    \ (DACT). Methods using only\ncanopy temperature measurements (DANS, DACT, and\
    \ Tc ratio) performed with comparable error to\nmore data intensive methods such\
    \ as CWSI and demonstrated their potential for irrigation scheduling.\nOsroosh\
    \ et al. [185] carried out an experiment on apple trees, to compare two empirical\
    \ indexes, a\nCWSId (averaged over daylight hours) and a CWSIm (midday CWSI).\
    \ Since CWSI was very sensitive\nto mild variations in the soil water content,\
    \ the authors suggested using CWSId and CWSIm for\nestimating soil water availability.\
    \ These indices were also stable under transitional weather conditions.\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] considered the time changes of IR for monitoring corn water stress\
    \ at high\nspatial and temporal resolution for managing irrigation water within\
    \ large agricultural production\nsystems. In the 80-day study, they observed a\
    \ statistical decrease in soil moisture “only when the\nCWSI value increased past\
    \ 0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI”. The CWSI\nwas\
    \ negatively correlated to soil moisture, demonstrating the potentiality of CWSI\
    \ (i) as an alternate\nirrigation scheduling method; and (ii) for quantifying\
    \ spatial soil moisture by IR canopy temperatures.\n4.2.2. Time-Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT)\nThe TTT is a method based on a canopy temperature threshold and a time\
    \ threshold [187,188].\nBecause it is a response method of automatic control,\
    \ the TTT method does not need supplementary\ninputs for activating irrigation;\
    \ and it has been credited for regulating water-use efﬁciency.\nEvett et al. [188]\
    \ found no statistical differences in yield and WUE, when comparing TTT and with\n\
    manually irrigated plots, in soybean and corn.\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [189] studied\
    \ the relationship between cotton irrigation scheduling, using\nsoil water measurements\
    \ and two thermal indices. An automatic irrigation scheduling determined by\n\
    a TTT algorithm reduced applied water volumes that did not negatively affect yield.\
    \ In well-watered\nconditions (full irrigation), the TTT method increased WUE\
    \ with respect to the water balance method;\ndifferences were not signiﬁcant at\
    \ reduced water depths (rates of 33 and 67% of full irrigation).\nThe authors\
    \ also found similar trends between two thermal indices, although the daily theoretical\n\
    CWSI resulted in over-irrigation when it was over 0.5.\nLamm et al. [190] compared\
    \ the TTT and ET-based irrigation scheduling for corn production.\nThe TTT method\
    \ accumulated time when the crop was above a speciﬁed temperature. An irrigation\n\
    event signal was triggered when the accumulated time exceeded the speciﬁed TTT\
    \ threshold.\nThe authors compared (i) three irrigation treatments with TTT values\
    \ of 2.5 h, 4.0 h or 5.5 h above a\ncanopy temperature of 28 ◦C; and (ii) two\
    \ ETc treatments (100% and 65%), plus a treatment receiving\nno further irrigation\
    \ after mid-July in Kansas. The results indicated that a TTT with a threshold\
    \ of 2.5 h\ncorresponded to a fully irrigated treatment.\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\
    \ [191] developed a method of integrating the CWSI over a day for presenting\n\
    clear CWSI signals occurring in some environmental conditions, near solar noon.\
    \ CWSI-TT was the\naccumulated time when CWSI was greater than a threshold value\
    \ of 0.45; this cumulated time value\nwas compared with a CWSI-TT value obtained\
    \ for a well-watered crop. The use of CWIS-TT, however,\ncan lead to an over-irrigation\
    \ due to false positive triggers that may be generated early in the season.\n\
    CWSI-TT provided yield results similar to scientiﬁc irrigation scheduling using\
    \ a neutron probe.\nOsroosh et al. [192] tested an automatic control system along\
    \ with a wireless network of soil,\nthermal and weather sensors, developed for\
    \ an apple orchard. Seven irrigation-scheduling algorithms\nwere tested: TTT,\
    \ CWSI, soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), an ET model, a soil water\n\
    balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB, a conventional irrigation practice\
    \ used in the region,\nand soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark.\
    \ The treatments TTT, CWSI, NP and WB\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n20 of 36\nsubstantially\
    \ reduced water (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. WB\
    \ seemed\nto demonstrate the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate.\nDeJonge et al. [193] conducted an experiment on corn to evaluate\
    \ several water stress indices based\non canopy temperature. All thermal indices\
    \ responded quickly to irrigation-treatment differences at\nmajor growth stages,\
    \ in particular Degrees Above Non-Stressed index and Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold\
    \ index were highly correlated with CWSI above the corn threshold of 28 ◦C used\
    \ in the\nTTT method. Furthermore, all indices showed a linear relationship with\
    \ soil water deﬁcit at high\ntemperatures. Degrees Above Canopy Threshold was\
    \ the best index due to (i) the strong relationships\nwith other indices and crop\
    \ water measurements; and (ii) because it was derived from a single canopy\ntemperature\
    \ measurement.\n4.2.3. Thermography Issue and Critical Aspects\nThe infrared thermometry\
    \ measurements suffer from several critical points, which may affect\nnegatively\
    \ the accuracy of the results. Jones et al. [156] found many important deﬁciencies\
    \ in the\ngeneral applications of CWSI. In particular deﬁciencies included (i)\
    \ the absolute temperature ranges\nmay be small in humid environments; (ii) the\
    \ canopy temperature was negatively affected when crop\nsurface target accidentally\
    \ includes areas such as soil, sky, and trunks; (iii) there existed a different\n\
    distribution of temperatures of sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy; and (iv)\
    \ the sunlit part of the\ncanopy showed a wider range of temperatures when viewed\
    \ normal to the rows or down the rows.\nEvett et al. [115] reported some other\
    \ critical points including that (i) the signal was not stable\nduring cloudy\
    \ periods; (ii) the lower base line and upper limit were difﬁculty to determine\
    \ and (iii)\nno uniqueness of these limits. Others problems were related to the\
    \ ﬁrst growth stages, when soil\nbackground was visible and it was more difﬁcult\
    \ to measure the canopy temperature.\nBaselines\nThe theoretical deﬁnition of\
    \ the two baselines, the lower baseline (well-watered crop, or more\nprecisely\
    \ non-water-stressed crop), and the upper baseline (completely water stressed\
    \ crop).\nThe lower baseline (non-water-stressed crop) depends on the plant species,\
    \ and even among\nvarieties of the same species, which have different canopy and\
    \ leaf structures. The energy balance of\ncrops may differ consistently, since\
    \ each canopy structure has its own radiometric properties, which\ncan facilitate\
    \ in some cases eradiation capture, and, in other cases, that which can escape\
    \ excessive\nradiation loads.\nLeaf Temperature Variability\nOptical parameters\
    \ of leaves of 30 plant species were presented by Gausman and Allen [194],\ndemonstrating\
    \ that each species demonstrated its own coefﬁcient of leaf emissivity. Leaves\
    \ showed\nwide ranges of temperature within a crop, often several degrees within\
    \ and between plants because of\nseveral factors. Each plant had (i) speciﬁc leaf\
    \ angles, that may vary during the day for several reasons\n(e.g., leaf turgidity;\
    \ radiation load, etc.); (ii) speciﬁc dimensions of (young and old) leaves, (iii)\
    \ unique\ncanopy architecture, (iv) different LAI, (v) different radiation loads\
    \ that impacted the crop, and (vi)\naerodynamic properties related to the wind\
    \ speed and direction. Therefore, Jones et al. [195] stated that\n“is desirable\
    \ to measure the canopy surface temperature (Tc) as an aggregate of all leaf temperatures”.\
    \ Maes and\nSteppe [153] noted that measurements of Tc differed from those of\
    \ a single leaf for two main reasons.\nCanopy emissivity was larger than leaf\
    \ emissivity, which has the function of capturing radiation\nfor photosynthesis.\
    \ The estimation of canopy emissivity is quite difﬁcult because it requires night\n\
    measurements. A second difference with canopy temperature measurements include\
    \ branches and, in\nparticular, soil which have temperatures usually higher than\
    \ the canopy. This is particularly evident in\norchards and croplands when the\
    \ canopy cover (crop fraction) is low. Furthermore, they reported that\nin stressed\
    \ conditions, at very low leaf stomatal conductance, the total range in surface\
    \ temperature\nbetween leaves is larger than in unstressed conditions, so that\
    \ canopy temperature variability often\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n21 of 36\n\
    reported as an index of drought stress. The sunlit side of a crop tends to have\
    \ a greater variance of\ntemperature among leaves than the shade side.\nSunlit\
    \ and Shade Leaves\nBoth baselines account for fully sunlit canopy leaves, but\
    \ it is evident that the average canopy\ntemperature is a summary of attributes\
    \ of different leaves, an extensive variety of leaf temperatures,\nwith sunlit\
    \ leaves showing much higher temperatures than shaded leaves [156,196]. Both shade\n\
    and sunlit leaves constantly move to adjust light interception to maximize their\
    \ water use efﬁciency\nand protect leaves from excessive heat and radiation load.\
    \ In both well-watered transpiring and\nwater-stressed canopies, there will be\
    \ a wide range of sunlit and shaded leaves, since it is known that\nthat dry matter\
    \ accumulation in crops is directly related to the interception of solar radiation,\
    \ up to the\ncritical LAI.\nAlvino et al. [196] reported that the fraction of\
    \ light absorbed by leaves, which controls crop\ngrowth rate, plant development,\
    \ crop biomass accumulation, is directly related to the interception of\nsolar\
    \ radiation, up to the critical LAI [197]. The light distribution within the canopy\
    \ affects, inter alia,\nthe photosynthetic efﬁciency. Under comparable environmental\
    \ conditions, the most important are the\nlight levels, since leaf photosynthetic\
    \ rates decline with age after leaf full expansion. The complexity is\nmade worse\
    \ by the difﬁculty of estimating the true age of each leaf in a plant community.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe head-on viewing of a crop may increase the number of leaves\
    \ that appear shaded, even though\nthey are sunlit. As reported by Jones [156],\
    \ “there are always a few sunlit leaves on the shaded side and some\nshaded leaves\
    \ visible on the sunlit side”.\nTesti et al. [175] reported that measurements\
    \ of tall trees are particularly challenging, because\n(i) open sky is within\
    \ the sensor ﬁeld of view; (ii) a tree canopy has a vertical rather than horizontal\n\
    structure; and (iii) there is a canopy temperature difference between the shaded\
    \ and the sunlit sides.\nCrops with genetic modiﬁcations (reduced leaf and modiﬁed\
    \ stipule morphology) may result in\nenhanced yield when water is a limiting factor,\
    \ avoiding drought stress [198].\nIt is still critical to deﬁne a well-watered\
    \ crop, which according to deﬁnition should transpire\nat a rate regulated by\
    \ physical conditions (e.g., VPD), and not present any physical resistance\nto\
    \ transpiration ﬂuxes.\nHowever, even well-watered plants show a midday depression\
    \ of\nstomatal conductance in case of high VPD [199].\nDifferent indices and procedures\
    \ have been\nproposed [108,111,115,153,164,200].\nAs correctly stated by King\
    \ and Shellie [163], the CWSI has not been widely used for irrigated\ncrops since\
    \ it is necessary to acquire the temperature difference of both transpiring and\
    \ non-transpiring\nleaves under the same environmental conditions. Stated below\
    \ King and Shellie [163] obtained\nCWSI values ranging from 0 to 1, when adopting\
    \ the Tair + 5 ◦C for estimating the temperature\nof non-transpiring leaves (Tdry),\
    \ as proposed by Irmak et al. [201] and Möller et al. [108] for corn\nand grape,\
    \ respectively. The authors found that the maximum temperature difference between\
    \ the\ncanopy of deﬁcit-irrigated vines and Tair was inﬂuenced by irrigation frequency.\
    \ Greater maximum\ntemperature differences were found for vines irrigated once\
    \ a week compared to those irrigated three\ntimes per week. The cultivar response\
    \ to deﬁcit irrigation was different with ‘Syrah’ vines, which were\n2–4 ◦C cooler\
    \ than ‘Malbec’ vines [202], and differences were also detected in leaf surface\
    \ temperature\namong grapevine cultivars undergoing water stress. Bellvert et\
    \ al. [202] reported Tnws − Tair values\nmore than 7.5 ◦C for ‘Pinot-noir’ vines\
    \ subject to water stress, when air temperature was 32.3 ◦C and\nair humidity\
    \ 2.37 kPa. In more stressful conditions (37 ◦C and very low air humidity), the\
    \ authors\nmeasured a difference of 13 ◦C in ‘Syrah’ and 17 ◦C in ‘Malbec’ (Tnws\
    \ − Tair). King and Shellie [163]\nreport that a difference between canopy and\
    \ air temperature of vines of about 17 ◦C, which is much\nhigher than with Tdry\
    \ values assumed in other studies and slightly less than the energy balance models\n\
    developed by Jones [111]. Tdry for calculation of the CWSI was estimated as Tair\
    \ + 15 ◦C for both grape\ncultivars, resulting in a CWSI value between 0 and 1\
    \ for irrigation scheduling purposes. The CWSI\nvalue obtained was a good representation\
    \ of a measure of plant water stress.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n22 of 36\nMöller\
    \ et al. [108] studied the effect of different irrigation treatments on grapevines\
    \ for achieving\na higher fruit quality when the vineyard was subjected to mild-to-moderate\
    \ levels of water stress.\nThe authors found a higher accuracy for determining\
    \ CWSI combining thermal and visible images,\nand adopting the following assumptions:\
    \ (i) CWSI calculated with air temperature +5 ◦C and\n(ii) Twet assumed to be\
    \ the average temperature of the wet artiﬁcial reference surface. Other surface\n\
    temperatures were obtained by wetting the canopy surface before thermal image\
    \ acquisition and from\nthe energy balance according to Jones [164]. There was\
    \ a stable linear relationship when Twet was\nderived from the energy balance\
    \ and from image analysis of a wetted part of the canopy. The authors\nsuggested\
    \ in-depth study was needed to develop this calculation as a tool for irrigation\
    \ management\non a ﬁeld scale.\nLópez-López et al. [135] reported that in case\
    \ of no transpiration, the difference between the\nTair and the Tcrop averaged\
    \ 2.8 ◦C (n = 25). Irmak et al. [201] determined an average value of 4.6 ◦C\n\
    for corn.\nOrta et al. [171] determined in a study of trickle-irrigated watermelon\
    \ upper baseline limits of\n3.3 and 3.4 ◦C. Santesteban et al. [173] preferred\
    \ the approach suggested by Jones et al. [156], whereby\nleaves of two sampled\
    \ grapevines were coated on both sides with petroleum jelly to prevent leaf\n\
    transpiration and interrupt the transpiration-cooling phenomenon, simulating the\
    \ leaf physiological\nresponse to water stress conditions. The authors report\
    \ a variation in vineyard temperature range of\nthe (Tdry and Twet) h of about\
    \ 1.3 ◦C and 2.4 ◦C, respectively.\nKing and Shellie [163] adopted a neural model\
    \ to estimate daily mean CWSI starting from\nwell-watered leaf temperatures and\
    \ air temperature plus 15 ◦C for a non-transpiring leaf temperature\n(between\
    \ 13:00 and 15:00 MDT). They were able to discriminate between deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ amounts,\nirrigation events, and rainfall. In contrast, Park et al. [203] estimated\
    \ the lower boundary temperature,\nrepresenting the temperature of fully transpiring\
    \ leaves, while the temperature of a non-transpiring\nleaf (Tdry) was determined\
    \ by air temperature at + 6 ◦C.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] found Tc − Tair of\
    \ well-irrigated grapes was effectively determined as\nTc − Tair = 0695 − 1.575\
    \ × VPD.\nMangus et al. [186] derived an instantaneous CWSI using air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and\nsolar radiance. Twet reference were empirically found\
    \ using well-watered plants, while a standardized\nTdry reference of 5 ◦C above\
    \ air temperature was utilized to represent the upper leaf temperature.\nThe same\
    \ results were obtained by DeJonge et al. [192] with an upper baseline of 5◦ C\
    \ and a linear\nrelation with VPD.\nGrant et al. [204] studied the effect of the\
    \ canopy architecture on the crop temperatures of two\ngrapevine cultivars grown\
    \ under two irrigation regimes (fully and not irrigated). They concluded that\n\
    it was desirable to calculate an average over several leaves per canopy in order\
    \ to reduce the effect of\nvariation in leaf angles. The simple CWSI, without\
    \ further data acquisition, was sufﬁcient for detecting\nthe relative stress required\
    \ for scheduling irrigation.\nTime of Measurements\nTesti et al. [175] found that\
    \ the CWSI measured in the early afternoon hours was a good\ndescriptor of water\
    \ status of a pistachio orchard. Ghaemi et al. [205] developed baseline equation\
    \ to\ncalculate eggplant CWSI reﬂecting water deﬁcit and salinity stresses, and\
    \ also studied the effect of\ngrowth environment (ﬁeld and greenhouse) on eggplant\
    \ CWSI values and its relationship with crop\nevapotranspiration and yield. CWSI\
    \ values were signiﬁcantly affected by water deﬁcit and salinity,\nand rising\
    \ levels of water salinity decreased the slope of the lower baseline in both crop\
    \ conditions,\nalong with a rise in the upper baseline.\nGarcía-Tejero et al.\
    \ [183] found that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically\nmeaningful\
    \ thermal data to assess grapevine water status was between 11:00 h and 14:00\
    \ h, independent\nof the variety.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n23 of 36\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] found differences in estimating CWSI at different times of day.\
    \ The smallest\ndifference was from 10:00 to 11:00 h and the highest from 12:00\
    \ to 13:00 h periods. In their study,\nthey combined IR thermometry with some\
    \ weather parameters to develop non-water-stressed and\nnon-transpiring baselines\
    \ for irrigated maize in of Colorado (USA).\nKing and Shelliey [163] reported\
    \ that clouds (thin cirrus), often present during the best\ntwo-hour-time for\
    \ CWSI monitoring, rapidly caused changes in levels of solar radiation and, as\n\
    a consequence, an effect on Tnws. They also provided a detailed description of\
    \ physiological variations\nwithin a canopy; particular attention was given to\
    \ rapid changes of leaf temperature in response to\nenvironmental ﬂuctuations\
    \ (e.g., air turbulence, changing radiation). For this reason, they proposed\n\
    the adoption of a 2-h-averaged CWSI value based on 15-min average measured values\
    \ (canopy\ntemperature, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and\
    \ wind speed), which provided\na sound daily CWSI value under variable climatic\
    \ conditions. The results appeared to be consistent\neven when comparing two grape\
    \ cultivars, characterized by different canopy temperature in response\nto climatic\
    \ conditions and irrigation conditions.\nBellvert et al. [172] found a good estimate\
    \ for the calculated daily mean CWSI of well-watered\nleaves between 10:00 and\
    \ 16:00 h. Berni et al. [84], using airborne thermal data of an olive orchard,\n\
    found the best results from 07:30 to 09:30; however, at 12:30 h there was an overestimate\
    \ of canopy\nconductance values. Bellvert et al. [202] found that the correlation\
    \ between CWSI and ΨL had different\nR2 values at different hours of measurements\
    \ (0.46 at 09:30 and 0.71 at 12:30), suggesting that the latter\nwas the more\
    \ favorable time for obtaining thermal images that were linked with ΨL values.\n\
    In Zarco-Tejada et al. [145], CWSI was measured from 13:00 to 15:30 coinciding\
    \ with the times at\nwhich the non-stressed baseline was obtained.\n4.3. Remote\
    \ Sensing and Soil\nSoil moisture measurements are critical components for climate\
    \ studies, hydrology, weather\npredictions, analysis of ﬂooded areas or the recharge\
    \ of aquifers. Real time analysis of the soil water\ncontent is crucial for optimizing\
    \ water management of agricultural ﬁelds.\nNichols et al. [206] presented an overview\
    \ of soil-moisture retrieval methods using different\nremote sensing data (active\
    \ or passive). They reported the advantages and limitations of each method,\n\
    and the evaluation of the most robust methods for retrieving soil-moisture information\
    \ from bare and\nvegetated soils. The best results come from a combination of\
    \ active and passive sensing methods.\nA backscatter empirical model (active method)\
    \ gave a 95–97% correlation between the estimated and\nthe ﬁeld soil measurements.\
    \ The “neural networks method” (passive method) gave a 100% correlation\nbetween\
    \ the estimated and ﬁeld soil measurements.\nRoussel et al. [62] reported the\
    \ adoption of GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) based on a low-cost\ndevice and an airborne\
    \ solution. For irrigation purposes, the GNSS-R system was useful for soil\nmoisture\
    \ monitoring. Classical probes were not considered representative of the ﬁeld-soil\
    \ moisture\nsince they return punctual measurements. The authors considered the\
    \ soil moisture monitored on a\nlarge scale to be appropriate, even at the expense\
    \ of temporal and/or spatial resolution. Even satellite\nmeasurements were not\
    \ sufﬁcient to monitor diurnal variations.\nYueh et al. [207] provided a review\
    \ of the calibration, validation and assessment of Soil Moisture\nActive Passive\
    \ (SMAP) instruments. The project conducted two activities aimed at enhancing\
    \ the\nproducts’ resolution: (i) the Backus Gilbert interpolation and de-convolution\
    \ techniques based on the\noversampling characteristics of the SMAP radiometer;\
    \ (ii) the disaggregation of the SMAP radiometer\ndata using the Sentinel-1 C-band\
    \ synthetic aperture radar data to obtain a resolution from 1 km to\n3 km.\nMulder\
    \ et al. [208] studied microwave remote sensing of soil moisture content. The\
    \ system was\nfounded on the different dielectric properties of water with respect\
    \ to dry soil. The Soil Water Index\n(SWI) was combined with the METOP ASCAT and\
    \ ENVISAT ASAR GM to obtain one layer with\nhigh resolution (1 km). The authors\
    \ reported another way of assessing soil moisture, the Soil Energy\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n24 of 36\nBALance (SEBAl). All of these models were applied on\
    \ a local scale to produce the actual ET linked to\nsoil water. The authors indicated\
    \ that the most broadly used methods were the SEBAL, the Two-Source\nEnergy Balance\
    \ (TSEB) modeling approach, and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS).\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] performed a full-season experiment in a greenhouse with several\
    \ objectives.\nSince CWSI (values between 0.6 and 1.0) was negatively correlated\
    \ to soil moisture, the index may be\nconsidered “as an alternate irrigation scheduling\
    \ method to quantify spatial soil moisture”.\nOther information is reported in\
    \ the previous Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4.\n4.3.1. Vegetation Indices\nDifferent\
    \ indexes have been set up to estimate different crop parameters (e.g., crop density,\n\
    biomass, chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content, etc.); the Enhanced Vegetation\
    \ Index (EVI), the Soil\nAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Simple Ratio (SR),\
    \ and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI), are measures of canopy\
    \ greenness, which may be related to physiological processes\nsuch as transpiration\
    \ and photosynthesis [209–211].\nZhao et al. [212] studied the relationship between\
    \ stem water potential (SWP) and VIs extracted\nfrom high spatial resolution images.\n\
    A circle mission was conducted to evaluate the effects\nof bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ distribution fraction (BRDF) and canopy NDVI mean.\nThe authors\ndemonstrated\
    \ the importance of BRDF to infer SWP from NDVI mean. Circle missions indicated\
    \ that\nview angle inﬂuenced the canopy NDVI. This could lead to a prediction\
    \ error of SWP of up to 12 bars.\nFurther analysis of images identiﬁed a non-normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NNDVI) based\non ground-derived measurements over\
    \ three weeks that showed a more signiﬁcant relationship with\nSWP than the canopy\
    \ NDVI mean.\nZúñiga et al. [213], in a study on a remote sensing-based WUE evaluation\
    \ of sub-surface irrigated\ngrape vines, compared several irrigation methods.\
    \ Differences in NDVI values occurred among\ndifferent irrigation strategies (surface\
    \ and subsurface irrigation methods) and when irrigation rates\nwere compared.\
    \ Multispectral satellite imagery, particularly with a red edge waveband, demonstrated\n\
    the potential for quantifying soil-moisture-tension variability, and hence could\
    \ be used for variable rate\nirrigation management. Red Edge Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (RENDVI) was especially\nsensitive to soil moisture tension\
    \ and demonstrated that a single image could be representative of\nvariability\
    \ up to two weeks after acquisition. However, it will be necessary to conﬁrm the\
    \ repeatability\nof these results at more maize growth stages and with other crops.\
    \ Finally, an economic study to\nevaluate the monetary and environmental implications\
    \ of such management at a ﬁeld scale would\nhelp transition these ﬁndings into\
    \ adoption by growers [214].\nToureiro et al. [215] presented work on the use\
    \ of remote sensing for measuring soil water\navailability for optimizing crop\
    \ growth. Data were determined by satellite and integrated with\natmosphere and\
    \ crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress\n\
    by NDVI, Kc, and Kcb. The results showed that remote sensing based on multispectral\
    \ images\nmay be used, with a high degree of accuracy and spatial representation,\
    \ to calculate crop water\nand irrigation requirements. However, frequent mapping\
    \ of soil water status and crop irrigation\nrequirements would be required; this\
    \ is the weakest point of the satellite imagery methodology used.\nTemporal representation,\
    \ once each 16 days with the Landsat 5 satellite, would not be enough for\nirrigation\
    \ management. The Sentinel 2 satellite is available and could be combined with\
    \ data from\nother satellites to provide more frequent images of the land surface.\n\
    4.3.2. WUE\nMarino et al. [216] evaluated the use of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry\
    \ to investigate crop\nwater use efﬁciency of drip-irrigated tomato. A new instrument\
    \ to measure in-depth soil moisture was\ntested combined with the Hargreaves method\
    \ and VIs with the goal of reducing irrigation volume, to\nassess crop spatial\
    \ variability, and to identify the best VIs related to WUE, at a ﬁeld scale. The\
    \ tomato\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n25 of 36\ncrop was drip irrigated by an automated\
    \ precision system, which maintained the soil water content\nwithin a speciﬁc\
    \ range related to growth stage and environmental conditions.\nThe instrument\
    \ recorded the soil moisture at different soil depths, providing information on\n\
    the amount of water to apply, taking into account—at each watering—the volume\
    \ of the root zone\nexplored by the crop. The results conﬁrmed that the system\
    \ saved water, applying lower soil water\ndepths than those calculated with the\
    \ Hargreaves formula. The ﬁeld was divided into three clusters,\ncharacterized\
    \ by increasing WUE. The highest (H) cluster showed a WUE value of 35.1 kg·m−3;\n\
    the lowest (L) showed WUE a value of 23.1 kg·m−3. Among VIs tested, the Perpendicular\
    \ vegetation\nindex (PVI), Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index (SAVI), optimized\
    \ Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index\n(OSAVI), and Weighted Difference Vegetation\
    \ (WDVI) were signiﬁcantly related to tomato crop yield.\nThe authors concluded\
    \ that “PVI proved to be a useful tool for (i) a better understanding of the different\
    \ ﬁeld\nproductive areas and for (ii) the adoption of variable water rate application\
    \ according to the different PVI values.\nThe irrigation system adopted proved\
    \ to be effective from agronomic and environmental point of view”.\nSimilar probes\
    \ were used by Nolz et al. [217] to monitor soil water in a vineyard for irrigation\n\
    management. Wang et al. [218] studied the application of quick techniques based\
    \ on thermal imaging\nand visual-NIR spectroscopy for measuring WUE in millet.\
    \ The authors suggested that the exact\nspectral parameters used for measuring\
    \ physiological factors (e.g., E, gs, leaf and WUE) may be used\nfor estimating\
    \ response of crops to changes in the environmental conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The advances in electronic and information technologies have developed various\
    \ non-invasive\nsensing systems, which return accurate georeferred information\
    \ on spatial variability within ﬁelds.\nThe sensing systems utilize sensors and\
    \ instruments that produce a huge amount of data at\ndifferent scales (temporal\
    \ and spatial) and distances from the target. Remote (satellite, airborne\nand\
    \ UAV imageries) and proximal sensors (mounted on tractors, poles or towers, and\
    \ portable\nspecto-radiometers) are able to detect soil and crop information,\
    \ such as soil status and traits, crop yield,\ncanopy volume and biomass, crop\
    \ water status, and pests (disease, weeds, and insects). These sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ cane be used for precision agriculture and irrigation management.\nSoaring investments\
    \ in R&D have spurred all branches of knowledge linked to RS, boosting the\nproduction\
    \ of reliable and accurate sensors. Temporal frequency of RS imagery has also\
    \ improved\nconsistently, although it has been impaired by considerable lengthening\
    \ of the average times for data\nprocessing. Data processing of images necessitates\
    \ adequate hardware, speciﬁc expertise, skills and\nfunds, which are likely to\
    \ be provided only by specialized reprocessing companies.\nOverall, there are\
    \ numerous studies with spatially distributed information on ET and plant\nwater\
    \ status. These approaches use reﬂectance, including thermal radiance, measurements\
    \ of the\nsurface, vegetation index-based crop coefﬁcients, surface energy balance\
    \ models, and soil water balance\n(although limited to the upper soil layer).\n\
    On a small scale, the focus on time and space has signiﬁcantly improved the monitoring\
    \ of the\ncrop water status of many crops, especially orchards and vineyards.\
    \ The estimation of ET and kc,\nof appearance of biotic and abiotic stresses,\
    \ of crop spatial variability, and of canopy volume have\nbeen improved signiﬁcantly.\
    \ On a ﬁeld scale, the attention paid to soil-water status seems inadequate,\n\
    although soil moisture monitoring is a prerequisite for professionally controlled\
    \ irrigation that satisﬁes\ncrop water requirements (precision irrigation) and\
    \ reduces inefﬁcient spatial allocation of irrigation\nwater, in particular over\
    \ irrigation that causes N leaching. There are current limits of RS, which can\n\
    answer the question of “when to apply water”, because the irrigation volume needs\
    \ to be estimated\nbased on other methods, as wisely pointed out by Taghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] These other methods,\ninclude—amongst many—the use of electronic\
    \ probes measuring crop water consumption [113], with\nthe aim of deﬁning the\
    \ right water depth to apply to a ﬁeld, and hopefully to each homogeneous area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n26 of 36\nSince positive correlations between crop-water\
    \ status and yield vary among crops, RS studies on\nirrigation should pay more\
    \ attention to ﬁeld production, either in absolute terms (maximizing ﬁeld\nproductivity)\
    \ or in relative terms (higher WUE).\nIn the near future, it is likely that all\
    \ available tools (multi-temporal images combined with\nmodels and improved sensors)\
    \ will contribute to monitoring crop status for triggering irrigation.\nAs mentioned\
    \ above, doubts persist on their ability to estimate the water delivery to the\
    \ ﬁeld for each\ncrop, or to different zones in the case of high crop spatial\
    \ variability.\nA holistic approach is necessary for moving toward precision irrigation.\
    \ It will be necessary\nto set up networks that contemplate the participation\
    \ of public/private partnerships, universities,\nand research institutes, for\
    \ producing multi-temporal images, models, sensors and data sets [94] for\nmanaging\
    \ precision irrigation. Among several EU hubs of excellence, the Quantalab IAS—CSIC\
    \ in\nSpain focuses on quantitative methods for remote sensing in agriculture\
    \ and forestry, for a wide\napplication of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ irrigation, for the assessment of environmental\nimpacts and stress detection.\n\
    Other\nscientists\nare\npursuing\ngrassroots\nremote\nsensing\nand\ndemocratic\n\
    mapping.\nAnderson et al. [93] have generated a toolkit using drones, live coding,\
    \ smartphones and kites.\nFor all institutions developing RS, a key factor will\
    \ be the operational readiness of information\nprovided to farmers and technicians\
    \ for managing irrigation. For irrigation purposes, it will be\nnecessary to develop\
    \ techniques and interpretative frameworks to provide low-cost and affordable\n\
    tools and real-time information to stakeholders involved in the management and\
    \ security of\nagricultural and related sectors.\nAuthor Contributions: Arturo\

  explanation: This study utilized hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing to remotely
    monitor non-invasive plant stress detection, thereby improving crop stress detection
    methodology. Hyperspectral imaging obtains data from the visible to shortwave
    infrared (VIS-SWIR) spectral domains, capturing information on plant morphology
    and structure. Thermal sensing measures surface temperature, providing information
    on plant physiology and water status. By combining these sensing techniques, the
    study aimed to enhance understanding of the complex interactions between plant
    stress and affected crop traits, ultimately providing more accurate and holistic
    assessments of crop conditions.

    usage of optical domains permits a holistic view of plant stress. • Three dose-
    and duration-related phases of stress defined. • Study designs were mainly driven
    by available sensors and economic reasons. • Coupling multi-domain observations
    with integrated crop growth models is proposed. Abstract Remote detection and
    monitoring of the vegetation responses to stress became relevant for sustainable
    agriculture. Ongoing developments in optical remote sensing technologies have
    provided tools to increase our understanding of stress-related physiological processes.
    Therefore, this study aimed to provide an overview of the main spectral technologies
    and retrieval approaches for detecting crop stress in agriculture. Firstly, we
    present integrated views on: i) biotic and abiotic stress factors, the phases
    of stress, and respective plant responses, and ii) the affected traits, appropriate
    spectral domains and corresponding methods for measuring traits remotely. Secondly,
    representative results of a systematic literature analysis are highlighted, identifying
    the current status and possible future trends in stress detection and monitoring.
    Distinct plant responses occurring under short-term, medium-term or severe chronic
    stress exposure can be captured with remote sensing due to specific light interaction
    processes, such as absorption and scattering manifested in the reflected radiance,
    i.e. visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared, and emitted radiance,
    i.e. solar-induced fluorescence and thermal infrared (TIR). From the analysis
    of 96 research papers, the following trends can be observed: increasing usage
    of satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle data in parallel with a shift in methods
    from simpler parametric approaches towards more advanced physically-based and
    hybrid models. Most study designs were largely driven by sensor availability and
    practical economic reasons, leading to the common usage of VIS-NIR-TIR sensor
    combinations. The majority of reviewed studies compared stress proxies calculated
    from single-source sensor domains rather than using data in a synergistic way.
    We identified new ways forward as guidance for improved synergistic usage of spectral
    domains for stress detection: (1) combined acquisition of data from multiple sensors
    for analysing multiple stress responses simultaneously (holistic view); (2) simultaneous
    retrieval of plant traits combining multi-domain radiative transfer models and
    machine learning methods; (3) assimilation of estimated plant traits from distinct
    spectral domains into integrated crop growth models. As a future outlook, we recommend
    combining multiple remote sensing data streams into crop model assimilation schemes
    to build up Digital Twins of agroecosystems, which may provide the most efficient
    way to detect the diversity of environmental and biotic stresses and thus enable
    respective management decisions. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    hyperspectral multispectral biotic and abiotic stress 1. Introduction One of the
    most challenging concerns of today is finding answers to the question “How to
    feed the world?”, as formulated in the 2nd Sustainable Development Goal (SDG),
    FAO (2021). The task is huge as the world population is expected to increase to
    9.8 billion by 2050 (UN, 2017). Thus, global food production needs to be expanded
    by 70% in order to feed the future population, maintain nutritional security,
    account for changing diets and the increasing demand for biological products from
    the construction and energy sectors (Galieni et al., 2021; Mueller et al., 2012;
    Tester and Langridge, 2010). In this context, the environmental impact of agriculture
    must be minimized to protect water, climate, soil, and biodiversity resources
    (Gomiero et al., 2011) while reducing production risks for farmers. Climate change
    is adding pressure, as the frequency of extreme weather events as well as major
    shifts in precipitation and temperature patterns are expected to increase worldwide
    (Cogato et al., 2019; Gomiero et al., 2011). As a consequence, abiotic (e.g.,
    heat and drought) and/or biotic (e.g., diseases and pests) stresses and their
    combinations (Govender et al., 2009), will also become more frequent and lead,
    without swift and effective management responses, to decreases in crop productivity
    (Atzberger, 2013). Thus, early detection of crop stress prior to irreversible
    damage is essential to be able to respond with suitable agrotechnical solutions
    and thus minimize yield loss. For the detection and quantification of biotic and
    abiotic stresses in agricultural crops, destructive and non-destructive methods
    can be used. Some quantitative methods provide sensitive analyses of molecules
    in biological systems, also known as high-throughput-omic techniques (Fiehn, 2001;
    Llanes et al., 2018). However, these methods are not only destructive but also
    time-consuming and costly, limiting their use in continuous monitoring and scalable
    research (Galieni et al., 2021). As for non-destructive quantitative methods,
    remote sensing (RS) technologies have been established, such as imaging spectroscopy,
    fluorescence spectroscopy, thermal and microwave remote sensing, which all provide
    insights into the effects of stress in plants. In contrast to omic techniques,
    RS can be applied at larger spatial scales, with high revisit frequency, hence
    enabling a cost-effective detection of crop stress status and spatiotemporal dynamics
    across cultivated landscapes. Furthermore, RS is suitable for global coverage
    and can thus potentially contribute to enhanced food security in developing countries
    (e.g., Rembold et al., 2000). Driven by new platforms and sensors with enhanced
    spatial, temporal and spectral capacities, RS studies focusing on agricultural
    applications grew exponentially in the last decades (Weiss et al., 2020). Together
    with improvements in computing power and machine learning (ML), unprecedented
    possibilities are offered for precision agriculture and other agricultural applications,
    going along with major improvements in crop stress detection. The most common
    crop stress type analysed by means of RS techniques is drought, i.e., water deficit
    stress Damm et al., 2022; Gago et al., 2015; Gerhards et al., 2016; Govender et
    al., 2009; Ihuoma and Madramootoo, 2017; Parkash and Singh, 2020; Virnodkar et
    al., 2020). Also, other stress factors have been studied with RS, such as insects
    (Herrmann et al., 2017) and pathogens (Gold et al., 2020; Herrmann et al., 2018;
    Mahlein, 2016; Sishodia et al., 2020) nutrient deficiency (Baret et al., 2007;
    Herrmann et al., 2010; Mahajan et al., 2021) or soil contamination (Gholizadeh
    and Kopacková, 2019). Optical remote sensing covers the wavelengths from the visible
    to the shortwave infrared (VSWIR, 400–2500 nm) and the thermal infrared (TIR,
    8–14 μm), collecting radiation reflected and emitted from the observed surfaces.
    When it comes to the detection of plant responses to diverse stresses, visible
    (VIS, 400–700 nm), near-infrared (NIR, 700–1300 nm) and shortwave infrared (SWIR,
    1300–2500 nm) reflectance, but also TIR and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF, often
    at 687 nm and 760 nm, or over the full emission wavelength between 650 and 800
    nm) have been the most exploited passive sensing signals (Gerhards et al., 2019).
    In these spectral domains, information on plant morphology and structure can also
    be derived by means of active sensing devices, such as LiDAR (light detection
    and ranging; Madec et al., 2017), and through stereophotogrammetry using multi-spectral
    imagery (St-Onge et al., 2008). Note that this review explicitly excludes microwave
    technologies. Passive microwave remote sensing operates at spatial scales (typically
    at 0.25°) being too coarse for studies at the farm or field scale. Active microwave
    remote sensing (RADAR) has been shown useful in obtaining crop type information
    (Gella et al., 2021) and surface soil moisture, with potentially high relevance
    for assessing crop water availability. However, we restrict this review to crop
    traits for stress detection and exclude soil attributes. Beyond usage of single
    RS domains, observations in multiple spectral domains are strongly suggested,
    potentially providing a deeper understanding of the complex interactions of stressors
    and affected crop traits (Damm et al., 2018; Jiao et al., 2021). Optical multi-sensor
    synergies for stress-related research in agriculture have been identified for
    precision agriculture (Chaerle et al., 2006; Gerhards et al., 2019; Maes and Steppe,
    2019), but also for plant breeding projects (Herrmann et al., 2020; Pineda et
    al., 2020; Singh et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2017a). The synergistic use of data
    from various electromagnetic domains goes back to the launch of the Thematic Mapper
    (TM) onboard Landsat-4 in 1982. However, the rather coarse spectral and spatial
    resolutions of the sensor and its successors prevented a deeper look into plant
    conditions at sub-field scales. By the end of the 1990s, plant scientists promoted
    near-range sensing for single leaves and plants using thermography, VIS and NIR,
    as well as fluorescence imaging, to improve understanding of plant physiological
    states and related stresses (Chaerle and Van Der Straeten, 2000; Lichtenthaler
    et al., 1998), but challenges in precise image alignment and data calibration
    prevented synergistic usage of such multi-domain data. First synergistic use of
    multi-domain acquisitions has been realized using piloted aircraft (Gerhards et
    al., 2018; Mohammed et al., 2019; Panigada et al., 2014) while miniaturization
    in sensor design has led to the development of drone systems allowing for multi-sensor
    integration at the field level (Aasen et al., 2018). For the first time, the FLuorescence
    EXplorer-Sentinel 3 (FLEX-S3) tandem mission will provide concurrent observations
    of VIS, NIR, SWIR and TIR along with SIF at satellite level. (e.g., Drusch et
    al., 2017). Recent studies propose efficient early stress detection using multi-scale
    UAVs and satellite observations. Within such frameworks, the advantages of both
    platforms can be explored, such as the availability of higher temporal and spatial
    resolution data (Alvarez-Vanhard et al., 2021; Sagan et al., 2019). However, the
    integration of multi-scale approaches goes beyond the scope of this review, which
    is explicitly constrained to synergistic exploitation of multiple spectral domains
    for stress detection in agriculture. While the developments in sensor and airborne
    platform technologies allow for coincident recordings from multiple (spectral)
    domains (e.g., Timmermans et al., 2015), studies exploring these data by applying
    integrative methods to assess plant stress are still rare. Before a multi-domain
    retrieval approach can be defined, all acquired remotely sensed signals must be
    translated into meaningful values (proxies) related to stress (i.e. affected plant
    traits). In this respect, a multitude of modeling and retrieval approaches have
    been investigated (Verrelst et al., 2015, Verrelst et al., 2019a). The majority
    of proposed methods relied on parametric regressions, i.e. use of spectral bands,
    vegetation indices (VIs) or spectral ratios and their relationships with functional
    traits linked to plant stress (e.g. Gerhards et al., 2016; Govender et al., 2009;
    Herrmann et al., 2020). To better understand cause–effect relationships, and to
    simultaneously use the full set of spectral variables, physically-based methods
    opened attractive pathways. For instance, a promising approach is provided by
    the soil-canopy observation, photochemistry and energy fluxes (SCOPE) model (Van
    der Tol et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2021a) and its vertically heterogeneous versions
    mSCOPE (Yang et al., 2017b) and senSCOPE (Pacheco-Labrador et al., 2021), which
    combines radiative transfer approaches with photosynthesis and energy balance
    modeling. In contrast to physically-based approaches, other studies investigated
    methods of reduced complexity but increased efficiency via implementation of data-driven
    approaches, in particular ML regression algorithms (Gewali et al., 2019; Singh
    et al., 2016; Virnodkar et al., 2020). To provide a scientific foundation to the
    pros and cons of different approaches, Sishodia et al. (2020) recently reviewed
    stress-related applications of RS in precision agriculture, including water stress
    and disease detection. The authors stated that advanced approaches using process-based
    physical models should be pursued to complement ML regression algorithms, as for
    instance demonstrated by Reichstein et al. (2019) in the context of surface energy
    balance (SEB) modeling. A pioneering example is provided by Zarco-Tejada et al.
    (2018) who used multi-sensor acquisitions (airborne hyperspectral and thermal)
    to analyse trees undergoing early stress caused by infection with the vector-transmitted
    bacterial plant pathogen Xylella Fastidiosa. The authors estimated fluorescence
    efficiency by exploring a three-dimensional radiative transfer model (RTM) in
    a multi-step inversion scheme. Also, thermal stress indicators were derived, and
    canopy structural and leaf biochemical traits were estimated from RTM inversion.
    In addition, narrow-band spectral indices known to be sensitive to certain functional
    plant traits (i.e., chlorophylls, carotenes and xanthophylls) were calculated.
    All traits and indicators were processed within a multivariate analysis based
    on ML algorithms for the classification of the (pre-visual) disease incidence
    and severity at the landscape scale. Another example of early stress detection
    by multiple spectral domains is provided by Hernández-Clemente et al. (2019).
    The authors reviewed the capability of remotely sensed physiological indicators,
    such as canopy temperature, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthesis and pigments
    to monitor the early responses of plants to a variety of stressors. They pointed
    towards the main challenges for the RS community in detecting stress, being: (1)
    the availability of high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution data, (2) the
    validation of diverse retrieval methods, (3) upscaling of physiological traits
    from leaf to canopy-level, and (4) capturing the temporal dynamics and interaction
    of traits as stress proxies. Altogether, despite these advances, critical knowledge
    and methodological gaps for crop stress detection remain. The main gap is that
    currently no concept exists that uses multiple spectral domains in an integrated
    way for a complete view of crop conditions to differentiate between crop stress
    types and to understand the degree of stress severity. This shortcoming can be
    addressed by leveraging the full potential of spectral information provided by
    multi-domain RS data sources in a synergistic way. Therefore, we aim to elaborate
    and propose a new methodological concept for the assessment of multiple plant
    stresses in agriculture through optical RS synergies. To achieve this, we review,
    synthesize and integrate current knowledge across spectral domains, remote sensing
    platforms and retrieval methods for the identification of crop stress. The paper
    is organized as follows: in Chapter 2, we present a general introduction on plant
    stress, physiological strain as well as adaptations to stress at different temporal
    stages. This is followed by RS of stress using distinct proxies and sensor systems
    in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 concentrates on the systematic literature review about
    multi-domain and multi-sensor studies, and Chapter 5 elaborates the proposed multi-sensor
    synergy concept. 2. Stress definitions and physiology 2.1. Stress definitions
    Plants are sessile organisms exposed to biotic and abiotic pressures, i.e. the
    physical, chemical and biological environment characterizing their habitat (Jones
    and Jones, 1989). Abiotic stress includes, among others, radiation, salinity,
    flooding (waterlogging), water stress, temperature extremes, nutrient shortage
    and heavy metals (Gull et al., 2019; Larcher, 2003). Second, plants are influenced
    by their biotic surroundings, referring to other co-occurring organisms. Specifically,
    biotic stress involves inter- and intra-specific competitions as well as diseases
    caused by fungal and bacterial pathogens (Lichtenthaler, 1996), weeds, insect
    pests and/or damage to plants by nematodes, protists, viruses, and viroids (Madani
    et al., 2019). Both the biotic and abiotic interactions can impact the survival
    or success of plant species. Thus, understanding the impacts of different stress
    factors on plants have been the focus of plant physiologists (Larcher, 2003),
    particularly important in crop sciences (Blum, 2016). In general terms, plant
    stress can be defined according to Lichtenthaler (1996) as: ‘any unfavourable
    condition or substance that affects or blocks a plant''s metabolism, growth or
    development’. A simplified description of the effect of various stress factors
    on a plant is outlined in Fig. 1 (Blum, 2016; Kranner et al., 2010). Accordingly,
    plants respond to a changing environment by a coordinated short-term acclimation.
    The response is initiated by biochemical triggers like phytohormones or enzymes
    and leads to a damage and repair cycle, activating the plant metabolism usually
    with small or non-visible phenotypic adaptation (reversible and adaptive strain
    tolerance). With increased severity and duration of the stress exposure, plants
    change their phenotypic expressions through long-term adaptations. This affects,
    for instance, leaf size and thickness, stomatal density, or function of chloroplasts
    depending on high or low light conditions. Depending on the stress factor, the
    adaptation may take days or weeks, while persistent and severe (long-term) stress
    may arise in the final stage and even lead to apoptosis (Lichtenthaler, 1996).
    The ability of plants to vary their phenotypic expression in response to environmental
    conditions is also described as “phenotypic plasticity” (Sultan, 2000), which
    can result in altered phenotypic traits and fluxes. Download : Download high-res
    image (440KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Scheme of plant stress,
    strain, and signaling, leading to plant responses and resistance. Adapted from
    (Blum, 2016). It has to be noted that the impact of any stress factor usually
    results in a complex interplay between the plant''s genes and its environment
    often leading to multiple strains, not explicitly shown in Fig. 1. For example,
    high light stress affects fluorescence parameters, impacts photosynthesis, increases
    non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), and enhances leaf temperature leading to increased
    transpiration and changes in leaf angle. Likewise, it must be remarked that the
    effect of a single and/or multiple stress factors, as well as the combination
    of biotic and/or abiotic stresses, can often lead to very similar physiological
    responses in the plants (Blum, 2016; Kranner et al., 2010), see Fig. 1. It is
    also important to consider the timing of stress impacts. For example, short-term
    environmental changes may be reflected in changing flux rates of photosynthesis,
    respiration, and transpiration (Damm et al., 2018). Stress occurring over long-term
    periods during different development stages may affect growth variously. For example,
    drought stress in wheat may affect leaf expansion in the initial phase, the number
    of tillers in the tillering phase, plant height in the stem elongation phase,
    and grain development during the flowering stage, with the period between stem
    elongation and flowering being the most sensitive to drought (Sarto et al., 2017).
    2.2. Stages of plant stress responses Reactions to biotic and abiotic stresses
    usually are continuous but often also non-linear processes (Kranner et al., 2010).
    In general, three phases of the plant stress response may be identified with respect
    to the severity and duration of one or multiple stressors. We exemplary demonstrate
    the phases (or stages) of drought stress and subsequent plant response in Fig.
    2. very mild drought stress usually has little impact on the plant, i.e., initial
    stomatal closure may occur, but the photosynthetic capacity remains high and no
    phenotypic changes are observed. Under increasing stress levels, however, stomatal
    closure reduces the internal CO2 availability, which often triggers the production
    of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lowers the photosynthetic rates. Moreover,
    leaf temperature increases and changes in leaf angle or leaf rolling are observed.
    As a result, plant growth may be inhibited. A stronger decrease in water availability
    will result in a reduced stomatal conductance affecting the leaf turgor (Abdullah
    et al., 2019). Overproduction and accumulation of ROS and membrane instability
    will lead to cellular damage beyond repair and thus to necrotic spots. Under severe
    drought stress, growth usually stops, and continuous damage may eventually lead
    to apoptosis (see Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (883KB)

    and the plants'' responses to stress as a function of dose and exposure time:
    early (mild), medium-term or mild long-term, and severe/chronic exposure. These
    stress phases may vary for diverse or combined stressors. This is particularly
    important for agriculture, where often even mild stress may reduce crop growth,
    and finally the yield, particularly when it occurs at crucial growth stages (Fahad
    et al., 2017). Consequently, it is essential to detect and quantify crop stress
    at the earliest possible stage. Only responses affecting the biophysical and functional
    properties and thus, traits of the plants may be detected by RS. Stress factors
    such as water scarcity, water logging, salinity, heat and excessive light often
    induce changes in the rates of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and
    stomatal conductance in the early stress stage. This is usually followed by changes
    in amounts and ratios of the photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids),
    and the concentration of different metabolites at later stages (Lichtenthaler,
    1996). While the remote detection of altered phenotypic traits, such as pigments
    and water content, is prevalent when monitoring medium-term, mild long-term and
    severe or chronic stress, altered photosynthesis and transpiration fluxes and
    their possible feedback mechanisms already show subtle responses under the first
    occurring stress (e.g., Gerhards et al., 2016; Jonard et al., 2020). In fact,
    daily occurring cycles of stress are common for crops as diurnal cycles in radiation
    and temperature show strong variation, often reaching excessive energy inputs
    at solar noon. In general, electromagnetic energy absorbed by plants is used to
    fuel photosynthesis, but under excessive irradiation the photosynthetic apparatus
    needs to immediately adapt energy pathways to avoid photo-damage. Increasing stress
    that inhibits the photosynthetic light reactions induces an increasing dissipation
    of energy by NPQ and reduces the fluorescence yield. The latter is detectable
    over vast vegetated areas as solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), a subtle energy
    flux emitted by vegetation that may be used to detect the onset and progress of
    stress (Ač et al., 2015; Demmig-Adams et al., 2020; Gerhards et al., 2019). Dynamic
    adjustments under early stress are also observed for transpiration, an energy-demanding
    process that decreases leaf surface temperature. Therefore, sensing the canopy
    surface temperature became a useful tool for assessing early changes in plant-water
    and plant-health status (Idso et al., 1981; Jackson et al., 1988; Maes and Steppe,
    2012). 2.3. Common symptoms of crop stress In the following, we describe the causalities
    and illustrate several examples of stress occurrence in crops (Fig. 3). Download

    of distinct biotic (upper box) and abiotic (lower box) stressors (bold) and corresponding
    affected traits/symptoms on crops (mainly). Photographs were provided by the authors.
    Biotic stress responses result from complex interactions between plants and other
    biological organisms and can be very diverse. Often plant responses are induced
    directly by the biotic agents. For instance, in the (common) case of herbivory
    (see Fig. 3(a)), the immediate effect is loss of water content due to wounding
    and loss of functional leaf area combined with the necrosis of the wounded leaf
    parts (Meza-Canales et al., 2017). In this way, biotic pathogens often affect
    a plant locally and then induce a systemic plant response. This may include the
    activation of signal pathways to reduce stomatal conductance (Aldea et al., 2005)
    or increased production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as defence mechanisms
    (Holopainen and Gershenzon, 2010; Kessler, 2001). Viruses can also lead to biotic
    stress as shown in Fig. 3(b) for an example of Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN). MLN
    causes mostly pigment damage but also some structural wilting in advanced stages
    due to necrosis and viral replication related to phosphorous deficiencies. A broad
    diversity in fungal pathogens exists. Some pathogens, such as yellow rust, can
    stimulate photosynthesis during early infection stages as the fungus benefits
    from the increase in sugar production (Chang et al., 2013). However, at a later
    stress stage it may cause decreases in photosynthetic capacity, leading to visible
    foliar lesions (Vergara-Diaz et al., 2015). The diversity of fungal pathogens
    may cause plant diseases, such as anthracnose, leaf spot, rust, or wilt (for an
    overview, see Jain et al. (2019)). Many of these diseases are manifested as changes
    in optical reflectance properties of the canopy, which may be specific to the
    pathogen. Such changes in optical properties can either be detected as radiometric
    changes or can be identified at leaf level through computer vision approaches
    for classification of plant diseases (Singh et al., 2020). Similar symptoms can
    be caused by microbes, as shown in the example of downy mildew in Fig. 3(c). Radiation
    stress or excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) sunlight also disturbs plant
    growth when the absorbed excess energy cannot dissipate. It results in an overproduction
    of ROS that may be detoxified or eventually disturb the overall cellular homeostasis
    of the plant (Singh et al., 2020). In Fig. 3(d), the effects of radiation stress
    are shown for an exemplary vineyard. As illustrated in Fig. 3(e), frost or cold
    stress is another serious threat to crops (Yadav, 2010). Moderate cold stress
    reduces plant growth and development, but severe cold stress may lead to stronger
    symptoms. When cold stress coincides with high light intensities, it leads to
    yellowing of leaves (i.e., chlorosis), reduced leaf expansion and wilting, and
    finally necrosis, i.e. apoptosis. Waterlogging is among the major abiotic stressors
    for crops. Fig. 3(f) shows a previously flooded field. Waterlogging induces a
    number of alterations in soil properties, such as soil pH, redox potential and
    oxygen level. Thus, plants growing on waterlogged soil face a stressful environment
    in terms of hypoxia (deficiency of O2) or anoxia (absence of O2), which may substantially
    reduce plant growth, development and survival (Tewari and Mishra, 2018). One very
    frequent source of abiotic stress is drought, as demonstrated in Fig. 3(g) for
    a very severe drought stress event. Plants require a number of essential nutrients
    for growth, which are supplied either from soil minerals and soil organic matter,
    or as organic and inorganic fertilizers as part of agricultural management. The
    deficiency of one or multiple nutrients may lead to manifestations, as demonstrated
    in Fig. 3(h). These few selected examples illustrate that: (i) diverse stressors
    may lead to the same symptoms, and (ii) the same stressor may cause distinct symptoms
    under varying environmental conditions. This also depends on the scale of observation
    and the actual development stage of the crops. To better relate stressors and
    the corresponding symptoms, a deeper understanding about species-specific plant
    physiological responses is required. Ultimately, all abiotic and biotic stress
    factors have in common that they pose a large risk for the agricultural sector:
    major yield losses and thus decrease in agricultural productivity. 3. Remote sensing
    of stress: Time domains and methodologies From a sensing point of view and in
    accordance with the dose and duration of stress exposure, we group the detection
    of plant stress responses into three main categories. Table 1 lists the stress
    phases (short-term, medium-term and longer-term) along with the (i) physiological
    responses of the plants, (ii) the primarily affected or adapted traits or stress
    proxies, and (iii) typical or optimal sensing domains. In accordance with that
    and to associate the stress proxies to these three temporal phases of stress,
    we grouped the affected traits into fluxes, biochemical and structural, as delineated
    in Fig. 4. In addition, the Figure illustrates the interplay of “optimal” spectral
    domains to estimate these stress proxies for an example of decreasing crop water
    availability. The resulting health status and potential yield losses are delineated
    below as a chronological function of stress duration and severity. Before a multi-sensor
    concept can be defined, the potential of each of these spectral domains has to
    be understood. Hence, in the following sub-sections, we will discuss the capabilities
    of various RS technologies to track plant stress responses as a function of dose
    and exposure times, providing an overview of commonly used methodologies. Table

    stress proxies (PRI: photochemical reflectance index). Changing plant health conditions
    and yield loss probability are delineated as a chronological function of stress
    duration and severity through decreasing water availability. 3.1. Remote sensing
    methods for early and mild stress detection 3.1.1. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
    During the diurnal course of the day, vegetation is perceiving a large gradient
    of incoming solar energy, fluctuating between low light conditions up to excessive
    amounts of incident radiation. The energy in the photosynthetically active radiation
    (PAR, 380–710 nm) region triggering the photosynthetic light reactions is, therefore,
    easily reaching harmful doses of energy requiring dissipation. SIF corresponds
    to the energy directly emitted from the photosynthetic machinery when the photosynthetic
    pigments get excited by the incoming radiance. The harvested light triggering
    this SIF emission depends on the amount of photosynthetic pigments and their composition
    within the photosystem II antenna complexes. Passive fluorescence techniques quantify
    the absolute values of SIF emission. Hereby, retrieval methods disentangle surface
    reflectance from the fluorescence signal using data from very high spectral resolution
    spectroradiometers. By means of these techniques, fluorescence emission can be
    retrieved as scalar values in the oxygen absorption regions or within the Fraunhofer
    lines, where the reflected radiance is strongly retained due to absorption of
    the incoming sunlight (Meroni et al., 2009). By exploiting distinct absorption
    features in the red and NIR spectral window, it is possible to reconstruct the
    entire spectrum of chlorophyll fluorescence. There are two peaks around 685 nm
    and 740 nm, which are mechanistically related to the photosynthetic electron transport
    within the two photosystems of plant''s photosynthetic apparatus (Mohammed et
    al., 2019). Recent approaches model the entire fluorescence spectrum (Cogliati
    et al., 2019), which will open the path towards a more complete signal analysis.
    The intensity of the SIF signal is in its first order related to the total PAR,
    which is absorbed by the canopy. Secondly, structural canopy properties determine
    the escape probability of the emitted SIF signal (Guanter et al., 2014). Recent
    studies developed methods to correct the SIF emission for scattering (Yang and
    van der Tol, 2018; Zeng et al., 2019) and re-absorption effects (Liu et al., 2020)
    by determining the escape probability and thus made it possible to down-scale
    SIF from the canopy to the leaf level. To further disentangle illumination related
    variations from the underlying physiological information carried by the down-scaled
    SIF signal, the calculation of an (apparent) yield can be employed by further
    normalizing for the amount of chlorophyll (Goulas et al., 2017) or radiation absorbed
    by chlorophyll (Yang et al., 2020a). This step allows the comparison between species,
    independent of their pigment pool sizes and facilitates the quantitative detection
    of variations in plant physiology (Migliavacca et al., 2017; Van der Tol et al.,
    2016). Mechanistically, SIFyield, i.e. the SIF emission normalized by the absorbed
    energy triggering the emission, is closely related to the efficiency of the photosynthetic
    electron transport. Thus it can be used as an early stress indicator when photosynthetic
    electron transport is affected by the specific stress reaction. However, as a
    matter of fact, SIFyield is not linearly related to photosynthetic electron transport,
    as the dynamic nature of NPQ mechanisms renders these relationships non-linear.
    Plants have evolved a variety of protection mechanisms, which can be actively
    regulated to optimize light harvesting especially in stressful times to avoid
    over-energization of the photosynthetic apparatus. These NPQ mechanisms act as
    energy quenchers and, as a consequence, may also affect the intensity of SIF (Bilger
    and Bjorkman, 1990). Thus, for stress detection, SIFyield needs to be further
    constrained by an independent measure of NPQ. Some NPQ processes are linked to
    a reversible conversion of the xanthophyll pigment pool (Jahns and Holzwarth,
    2012), which may result in consequential optical reflectance change in the 500–600
    nm range (Acebron et al., 2021; Gamon and Surfus, 1999; Van Wittenberghe et al.,
    2021), or even further changes in the VIS–NIR range (Van Wittenberghe et al.,
    2019). To circumvent the above described complexities, the Photochemical Reflectance
    Index (PRI) has been frequently used to detect these instantaneous optical changes
    and to exploit the modification in the light use efficiency behaviour under excessive
    radiation (Garbulsky et al., 2011). However, the PRI is also known to be affected
    by both facultative and constitutive pigment effects (Gamon and Berry, 2012; Moncholi-Estornell
    et al., 2022). These multiple underlying pigments effects illustrate the complexity
    of the pigment dynamics affecting the PAR on both short and longer time scales.
    3.1.2. Thermal infrared sensing: Temperature There has been a long interest in
    using canopy temperature as a remote indicator of plant water stress (Jones and
    Vaughan, 2010). Although RS-based surface energy balance (SEB) approaches allow
    an estimation of the actual evapotranspiration (indirectly as the residual term
    of the SEB equation, using thermal data to calculate heat flux), they require
    vast meteorological input data and parameterisation of conductance (Tolomio and
    Casa, 2020). Other than SEB models, the direct use of thermal data in water stress
    indices has been promoted. TIR radiance measurements obtained over vegetation
    depend mainly on the temperatures of the (sunlit or shaded) leaves and the soil,
    the leaf and soil spectral emissivities, and eventual contributions from the surroundings
    and the atmosphere (Gerhards et al., 2019; Norman and Becker, 1995). Temperatures
    and emissivities of vegetated surfaces can be retrieved from a variety of algorithms
    that use - depending on the number of spectral bands - different approaches to
    correct for atmospheric effects and to separate temperature and emissivities from
    each other (Li et al., 2013). At a given ambient air temperature, canopy temperature
    (Tc) is inversely related to the rate of water loss from the canopy. The transpiration
    itself is closely linked to stomatal conductance (Jones and Vaughan, 2010). To
    take into account the effects of weather conditions on Tc, the crop water stress
    index (CWSI) has been developed as a simplified means to quantify water stress.
    Besides the effects of air temperature (Ta) the index also considers atmospheric
    relative humidity, expressed as vapour pressure deficit (VPD). CWSI is based on
    a simple scaling operation, where Tc is normalized by the Ts of a fully transpiring
    crop (Tsmax) and the Ts of a crop that is not transpiring at all (Tsmin). Different
    approaches to calculate CWSI were developed (see Maes and Steppe, 2012 for a comprehensive
    review): The empirical CWSI (CWSIe) establishes a relationship between TcTa and
    VPD from which Tsmax is derived (Idso et al., 1981). Hence, it requires only three
    input measurements (Tc, Ta, and VPD) for its application. However, the lower limit
    is sensitive to changes in radiation and wind speed (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2014)
    and therefore cannot be transferred across growing seasons. The theoretical CWSI
    (CWSIt) calculates the upper and lower limits (Tsmax and Tsmin) from equations
    based on a combination of the Penman-Monteith and the energy balance equations.
    The CWSI can be used in day-to-day water stress monitoring, but requires measurement
    of additional atmospheric variables (i.e., net radiation, wind speed, canopy resistance)
    and the challenging estimation of aerodynamic resistance (rA) (Jackson et al.,
    1981, Jackson et al., 1988). To overcome this limitation, the use of an empirical
    upper limit together with the theoretical lower limit has been suggested for practical
    purposes (Agam et al., 2013; Rud et al., 2014). This so-called hybrid CWSh (Ekinzog
    et al., 2022) eliminates the need for estimating rA and achieved comparable accuracies
    as CWSIt and CWSIe. The development and early application of CWSI was done on
    point based Tc measurements, but has been adapted and applied to high resolution
    thermal imagery for assessing the spatial variability of crop water status using
    the direct or image based CWSI (Agam et al., 2013). Hereby, the fully and non-transpiring
    Ts along with Tc are measured directly using wet and dry artificial reference
    surfaces placed within the image (Gerhards et al., 2018). CWSI showed to exhibit
    good relationships with in situ soil based measures such as soil water content
    (DeJonge et al., 2015; Taghvaeian et al., 2014) and plant based measures, such
    as leaf water potential and stomatal conductance (Berni et al., 2009a; Bian et
    al., 2019; Han et al., 2018). The index proved to be robust in many arid and semi-arid
    regions around the globe and for various agricultural crops (Cohen et al., 2017;
    DeJonge et al., 2015), and more recently also in humid regions (Ekinzog et al.,
    2022; Hoffmann et al., 2016). Moreover, CWSI requires a fully closed canopy and
    this limitation has been tried to overcome using the water deficit index (WDI,
    Moran et al., 1994), relating TcTa with the fractional cover or a vegetation index
    (VI). The empirical version of WDI is derived from a Ts – VI scatterplot, without
    requiring any ground-based weather measurement and is thus widely applied in thermal
    RS (Maes and Steppe, 2012). 3.1.3. Thermal infrared sensing: Emissivity Analysing
    the thermal infrared spectral region, relatively little attention has been paid
    so far to the spectral emissivity of plants (leaf and canopy), which responds
    to environmental stresses. This could be explained with the following reasons
    (Ribeiro da Luz and Crowley, 2007): (i) hyperspectral TIR instruments were lacking
    until a few years ago, (ii) gap in knowledge about the origin of complex spectral
    emissivity variations, (iii) low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) together with low
    spectral and spatial resolution of the available sensors prevented to detect these
    subtle changes in spectral emissivity, (iv) lack of advanced pre-processing algorithms
    (i.e., atmospheric correction and Temperature-Emissivity-Separation). However,
    Salisbury (1986) and the ground-breaking studies by Ribeiro da Luz and Crowley
    (2010), Ribeiro da Luz and Crowley (2007) and Neinavaz et al. (2016) showed that
    differences in the spectral emissivity among plant species are related to differences
    in structural and biochemical leaf surface and canopy properties. These findings,
    in combination with recent advances in sensor technologies, e.g., spatially enhanced
    broadband array spectrograph system (SEBASS, Vaughan et al., 2003), Telops Hyper-Cam
    LW (Schlerf et al., 2012), or hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer (HyTES,
    Meerdink et al., 2019), opened the field to study the application of spectral
    emissivity for plant stress detection. So far, only two studies pursued the question
    if spectral emissivity can be used for the detection of plant responses to environmental
    stresses. Based on laboratory measurements, Buitrago et al. (2016) were able to
    use spectral emissivity for the detection of cold and water stress on European
    beech (Fagus sylvatica) and rhododendron (Rhododendron cf. catawbiense) leaves.
    Gerhards et al. (2016) successfully showed in a greenhouse experiment that the
    spectral emissivity of potato plants (Solanum tuberosum L. Cilena) is equally
    sensitive to water stress as compared to temperature based indices (e.g., CWSI).
    However, further research is needed to better understand the linkages between
    stress, leaf traits and spectral emissivity features. Overall, using emissivity
    as an indicator of thermal stress is challenging as it requires TIR measurements
    at high spectral resolution, correction of atmospheric effects and the separation
    of temperature and emissivity (Gerhards et al., 2019). 3.2. Quantification of
    mild long-term and severe stress using optical reflective approaches Mild long-term,
    chronic or severe stress induces visible symptoms on crop leaves and canopies.
    Those symptoms are also captured by remote sensing data in the reflective optical
    domain, including the VIS, NIR and SWIR. The first remote sensing studies for
    linking remote sensing in the optical domain to stressed vegetation canopies started
    in the early 1970''s (see Fig.1 in Houborg et al., 2015) with the milestone publication
    by Knipling (1970). This study related leaf and canopy spectral signatures to
    effects of physiological stress. With this, Knipling (1970) identified the two
    main groups of traits, which are affected first by medium-term and mild long-term
    stress - the biochemical compounds - and second, those affected by chronic and
    severe stress, i.e. the structural variables. Here we refer to Fig. 2 (the two
    blocks on the right), and Table 1 (second and third lines). The use of these traits
    as stress proxies has since been confirmed by numerous studies. According to Baret
    et al. (2007), for instance, retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) and leaf
    area index (LAI) can serve to diagnose plant (nitrogen) stress: whereas Cab decreases
    due to limited synthesis or destruction of chloroplasts, losses in leaf area (i.e.,
    LAI) indicates a decrease of leaf production going along with an increase in senescence.
    The study of Carter and Knapp (2001), linking a variety of stressors to physiological
    responses, observed that consistent stress induces changes in leaf reflectance
    within the visible range due to changing Cab. In the study of Linke et al. (2008),
    relative leaf water content decreased during water stress periods going along
    with changes in spectral leaf reflectance. It was also found that recovery from
    stress was not reflected by leaf reflectance as expected: still some differences
    remained between the formerly stressed plant and the control plant, suggesting
    that secondary effects followed the stress, such as changes in cell structure
    and biochemistry. This points towards the need to retrieve multiple plant traits
    instead of a single one to accurately diagnose medium or longer lasting stress
    events in crops. To derive traits from optical reflective measurements, it is
    necessary to convert the measured signals into semantic values. Four broad methodological
    categories have been identified recently, and were summarized in the review studies
    of Verrelst et al., 2015, Verrelst et al., 2019a (for general vegetation properties
    retrievals) and specifically for nitrogen in Berger et al. (2020): • parametric
    regressions, referring to the use of VIs; • nonparametric regressions, which include
    chemometric methods and ML regression algorithms, • mechanistic or physically-based,
    using radiative transfer modeling (RTM), and • hybrid approaches, combining ML
    regression algorithms with RTM. The first studies evaluating the use of optical
    reflective RS for nitrogen stress quantification were mainly based on empirical
    relationships employing spectral indices sensitive to chlorophyll content (Penuelas
    et al., 1994). Later, the study of Lebourgeois et al. (2012) used different VIs
    to investigate crop nitrogen status in cases of combined nitrogen and water stresses.
    Further, hyperspectral data opened the opportunity for the development of narrowband
    VIs (Broge and Leblanc, 2001), which were used for estimation of plant water status
    and stress (Gerhards et al., 2019; Zhang and Zhou, 2019). According to Singh et
    al. (2016), ML regression algorithms emerged as one of the most promising tools
    for the retrieval of vegetation traits in the context of stress. ML allows analysing
    huge data sets to detect patterns by simultaneously looking at multiple factors
    instead of analysing each predictor and/or feature (trait) individually. As an
    example of RTM exploitation, the study by Richter et al. (2008) used a look-up
    table (LUT) inversion of the PROSAIL model to estimate LAI, Cab and a soil brightness
    factor for the diagnosis of drought risk zones within wheat fields. Hereby, crop
    growth variability was caused by the sandy soil type, leading to limited water
    availability for the crops, which was reflected in lower LAI and Cab values compared
    to other soil types. Merging physically-based and data-driven methods to hybrid
    approaches seems ideal for functional traits retrieval and thus stress identification
    due to the complementary nature: RTMs provide physical constraints and domain
    knowledge to fast and efficient ML algorithms (Verrelst et al., 2015, Verrelst
    et al., 2021). The efficiency of these hybrid methods can be even enhanced by
    exploring active learning for optimisation of ML training samples (Berger et al.,
    2021). These methods can be powerful for the detection of stress levels, for instance,
    by investigating the ratio of Cab and leaf carotenoid contents (Hendry and Price,
    1993; Sonobe et al., 2020). Recently, Lassalle (2021) reviewed the advances in
    optical reflective hyperspectral remote sensing of plant stress over the last
    five decades. The author pointed out that for most stressors, high to very-high
    spatial resolution is preferable. Optimally, the VNIR spectral region should be
    exploited using VIs and ML methods. In some cases, the SWIR region improved the
    performance of the methods in the analysed studies. Nevertheless, we believe that
    exploiting multiple domains provided by diverse sensors (SIF, TIR, VIS-SWIR) may
    be an advantage over using only hyperspectral optical reflectance. Such a “multi-view”
    is required to obtain more complete insights about stressors, crop physiological
    responses and affected traits. We therefore examined the existing literature to
    identify the current state of the art with respect to multi-domain and multi-sensor
    approaches. 4. Review of multi-domain and multi-sensor studies 4.1. Identification
    of relevant literature The main purpose of the systematic review was to identify
    all published studies detecting agricultural stress by exploring synergies of
    different optical domains. To collect all relevant studies, we followed the approach
    by Cronin et al. (2008). The literature analysis included four main steps: 1.
    identification of relevant literature by means of well-defined keywords, 2. screening
    of the overall suitability of the selected records, 3. evaluation of the eligibility
    and inclusion, i.e. fully scanning the records, and 4. extraction of meta-information.
    In the identification step (1.), the keywords “remote sensing & (fusion OR synergy
    OR multi OR multi-sensor) & stress & (agriculture OR crops)” were searched for
    in ISI Web of Science and similar search engines within the period from 1994 to
    2021. Finally, a large pool of records was collected. The identification step
    followed a first rough checking to remove duplicates. This resulted in approximately
    300 papers eligible for further investigation. In the screening step (2.), at
    first, non-peer reviewed records being considered irrelevant (i.e., conference
    proceedings or reports), were removed. Reading of titles and abstracts led further
    to the exclusion of all records that either focused on other than agricultural
    applications, employed active RS data or were review studies. The screening step
    resulted in a total of 133 studies. In the eligibility part (3.), these 133 studies
    underwent intense screening, i.e. full reading, required to extract the criteria
    listed below. Hereby, records that mentioned stress but focused on yield or soil
    properties, or used only one sensor (or domain) for stress evaluation were excluded.
    From the remaining 96 records, detailed information was extracted, including the
    following variables: • Meta-information: authors, title, journal, year; • Site:
    location, studied vegetation (crop, orchard); • Stress type (biotic, abiotic)
    and specification; • Analysed traits (individual and according to the three trait
    groups, see chapter 2); • Time scale of stress period (short-, medium- and long-term);
    • Observational levels (leaf-level, top-of-canopy or top-of-atmosphere); • Observational
    scales (micro/plant, local, regional, global); • Platforms (handheld, gantry,
    tower, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), airborne, satellite); • Spectral domains
    (VIS, SIF, NIR, SWIR, TIR); • Algorithms (classification, regression, anomaly
    detection); • Methodologies (parametric, nonparametric, RTMs, hybrid, SEBM). Note
    that with the performed literature search we do not claim completeness. There
    is a high certainty of additional potentially relevant records, which may be missed
    due to deviating keywords. However, due to the high number of co-workers and repetitive
    literature searches, we believe to have covered the essential studies exploring
    multiple spectral sensing domains to assess stress in agricultural research. 4.2.
    Factor analysis In a first step, we analysed the contribution of the different
    variables via principal component analysis (PCA), see Fig. 5. A PCA reveals the
    strongest patterns between all variables and thus provides an attractive method
    to explore general trends within the database. In the first dimension (x-axis),
    the largest discrepancies can be found between platforms (satellite vs handheld),
    spectral resolutions (multispectral vs hyperspectral), as well as the duration
    of the stress periods (long-term vs short-term stress). These patterns can be
    interpreted with the investigation of either one or the other aspect, but rarely
    both together. The second dimension (y-axis) indicates, among others, the exclusive
    use of one stress type (biotic or abiotic). In addition, parametric and nonparametric
    nonlinear approaches point towards opposite directions. Download : Download high-res
    image (466KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Principal component
    analysis of literature variables (first two dimensions). Positively correlated
    variables point to the same direction and negatively correlated variables to the
    opposite. The groups refer to the variable categories searched for in the reviewed
    studies (algorithm, classification method, period of stress, platform, regression
    method, scales, spectral domain, spectral resolution, stress type, traits level).
    On the other hand, variables pointing in the same direction may indicate a joint
    usage, for instance, the estimation of biotic stresses (e.g., diseases) by means
    of nonparametric nonlinear approaches (i.e., machine learning), or the estimation
    of abiotic (i.e., drought stress) by parametric methods (e.g., vegetation indices).
    Since this PCA analysis can only give an approximate idea of the complex interplay
    of all these variables, the following sub-chapters describe and illustrate the
    findings for the individual criteria. 4.3. Platforms and sensors Aggregation of
    the publications over 5-year periods reveals clear trends in platform usage over
    time (Fig. 6). While only handheld and airborne platforms prevailed during the
    period 2000–2005, their usage continuously decreased from 2005 onwards. At the
    same time, researchers made increasing use of sensors onboard UAVs (e.g., Di Gennaro
    et al., 2017; Joalland et al., 2018) and satellites (e.g., Anderson et al., 2018;
    Bayat et al., 2018). With respect to UAVs, this can be largely explained by the
    miniaturization of sensor technologies for (hyperspectral) VNIR, SWIR and TIR,
    and recently also for SIF cameras on drones (Gonzalez Toro and Tsourdos, 2021).
    Regarding satellites, multispectral satellite images, such as Sentinel-2 A/B (from
    June 2015) and Landsat (from October 2008), are easily accessible nowadays. The
    analysis further revealed that the majority of UAV spectral domain combinations
    were composed of VIS-NIR-TIR sensors. As SIF measurements are not yet available
    from satellite sensors in spatial resolutions required for precision agriculture
    applications, studies using SIF data mainly explored airborne data sets. Download

    4.4. Algorithms and methodologies As discussed in section 3, the detection of
    stress conditions in crops often relies on the estimation of traits linked to
    the crop status. In the investigated studies, most focused on quantifying traits
    using regression or RTM methods, whereas the usage of classification or anomaly
    detection was less pronounced. Among the papers reviewed in this study, about
    72% were based on parametric approaches (e.g., Gerhards et al., 2016; Guan et
    al., 2017; Panigada et al., 2014), 22% on nonparametric linear approaches (e.g.,
    Ainsworth et al., 2014; Sobejano-Paz et al., 2020; Thomas et al., 2017), about
    17% on nonparametric nonlinear approaches (e.g., Camino et al., 2021; Gao et al.,
    2009; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2018), nearly 15% on surface energy balance models
    (e.g., Bayat et al., 2018; Bhattarai et al., 2019; Zhuang et al., 2020), 16% used
    radiative transfer models (e.g., Camino et al., 2018; Celesti et al., 2018) and
    only a few on hybrid approaches (e.g., De Grave et al., 2020; Delalieux et al.,
    2014). Note that several studies employed multiple methods. Fig. 7 indicates the
    use of different methodologies in studies published from 1999 to 2021. Though
    a clear trend was missing, we noticed that on a percentual basis, the use of parametric
    and nonparametric linear approaches has been slightly decreasing, while SEBMs,
    RTMs and hybrid approaches gained popularity. With respect to machine learning
    regression algorithms, mainly conventional shallow learning methods were employed,
    such as support vector machine (regression), random forest or neural network approaches.
    Although it may be promising for stress detection, the exploration of deep learning
    algorithms is still missing. RTMs and hybrid approaches have been receiving attention
    in recent years due to improved performance in computational speed, flexibility
    and generic applicability (Verrelst et al., 2019a). Also, they have been demonstrated
    to be attractive methods as regards to mapping large areas, especially in operational
    and global contexts (Verrelst et al., 2015). Accurate and fast mapping of crop
    traits over large cultivated areas by means of these hybrid methods reveals potential
    for the quantification and monitoring of stress-related proxies. Download : Download

    for 2003–2007. Regarding the retrieved traits, Fig. 8 shows that the highest percentage
    of the studies focused on the retrieval of traits related to fluxes (mostly ET),
    followed by those related to biochemical traits and finally structural traits,
    independently of the method used. The only exception are hybrid approaches, which
    were mainly applied to retrieve biochemical traits, rather than those related
    to fluxes. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download full-size

    balance models. 4.5. Observational levels and scales Regarding observational levels
    and spatial scales considered in the selected studies, mostly the top-of-canopy
    (TOC) level was addressed with 72%, followed by the leaf level with 45% or both.
    Only six studies addressed (exclusively) the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) level (Bhuiyan
    et al., 2017; Knipper et al., 2019; Mladenova et al., 2017; Navarro et al., 2016).
    The majority of the TOA studies investigated regional scale stress levels. In
    fact, most of the papers considered the field/plot scale (67%), but multiple studies
    addressed the micro/plant scale (i.e., 31%) with little overlap between these
    categories. As illustrated by regional-scale TOA studies, there was a strong relationship
    between the spatial scales and observational levels. For example, all but one
    out of the plant scale studies focused on leaf level traits, with the exception
    of Kim and Glenn (2017), where the authors proposed a new multi-modal stress detection
    system for plants by integrating off-the shelf sensors in a custom-made platform
    and by developing software for processing data flows. 4.6. Spectral domains Overall,
    the number of publications between 1999 and 2021 increased approximately by factor
    of four. With respect to the explored wavelengths, this increase was reflected
    by all domains, though with higher absolute numbers of NIR, VIS and TIR studies
    compared to SWIR and SIF. The utilization and synergistic use of different spectral
    domains within the selected studies is demonstrated by a Venn diagram (Fig. 9).
    Here, we observe that the combination of VIS-NIR-TIR domains represents the largest
    category (N = 33). Regarding the two-domain combinations, the VIS-NIR and VIS-TIR
    were the most often used (N = 5). In addition, the VIS domain was employed by
    the majority of studies. As two spectral regions in the optical reflective domain
    are insufficient to detect short-term stress, the combination with TIR sensors
    proved to be useful. For instance, the study by Baluja et al. (2012) examined
    crop water status using multispectral VIS and NIR sensors along with thermal imagery.
    The authors found that with the latter technology it was possible to detect short-term
    responses. However, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and two other
    VIs calculated from the VIS-NIR data were rather reflecting the results of cumulative
    water deficits on the observed crop, hence its response to chronic stress exposure.

    Fig. 9. Venn diagram visualizing the different combinations of used spectral domains
    (VIS, SIF, NIR, SWIR, and TIR) in the reviewed studies (left). Number of studies
    using different sensor combinations (two to five) with respect to the different
    spectral domains (right). In total, only four studies concurrently exploited all
    five main domains (i.e., VIS, SIF, NIR, SWIR and TIR) (Camino et al., 2021; Gerhards
    et al., 2018; Mahlein et al., 2019; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2018). This gap could
    be explained, among others, by the still limited (for SWIR) and missing (for SIF)
    availability of high spatial resolution satellites, and rather high prizes for
    sensors, such as UAV-suitable cameras. In fact, for the detection of very early
    stresses, the optimal spectral domains could mainly be provided by a combination
    of SIF and TIR, which however, was realized by only a few studies (N = 4) (Chaerle
    et al., 2004, Chaerle et al., 2009; Ni et al., 2015; Pérez-Bueno et al., 2015).
    All in all, these findings suggest that many study designs were mainly driven
    by sensor availability and practical economical reasons, respectively, leading
    to a common usage of VIS-NIR sensors. This was confirmed by a study analysing
    costs of multi-sensor systems (Appeltans et al., 2020), calculating, for instance,
    total costs of 200.000 euros for a combination of a hyperspectral, thermal and
    fluorescence sensor. 4.7. Stress types and plant responses Fig. 10 clearly demonstrates
    that the majority of the selected studies investigated abiotic stress, in particular
    drought stress. On a short-term scale, drought stress influences transpiration
    through stomatal closure (see chapter 2.2). Consequently, the analysis of TIR
    data (i.e., temperature) may provide the most useful information. However, TIR
    sensors struggle with lower spatial and spectral resolutions leading to weaker
    SNR in comparison to sensors measuring optical reflective signals (VSWIR). This
    means if the detectors of both measurement types are of comparable size, less
    energy is available in the TIR than for VSWIR, which limits the applicability
    of TIR in precision farming contexts (Gerhards et al., 2019). Moreover, the TIR
    signal is highly influenced by environmental factors, such as wind turbulence
    and background cover (e.g., weed or soil type) (Döpper et al., 2020). Thus, a
    combination of TIR data with the VNIR/SWIR spectral domains is most common (see
    Fig. 10). Within this combination, the majority of studies investigated long-term
    stress, as such data enable studying different traits with the evolution from
    short-term fluxes to longer-term biochemical and structural changes. Fig. 11 demonstrates
    the behaviour of the three trait groups as a function of stress duration or severity.
    As expected, variations of fluxes have been related most often to short-term stress,
    whereas the structural traits are mainly used as proxies for longer term or chronic
    stress. Interestingly, there is a balance of all three trait groups for the long-term
    stress category (see Fig. 12). It may be explained by the fact that the same traits
    are observed over longer study periods, instead of using only the most responsive
    trait at a certain stress stage. Download : Download high-res image (179KB) Download

    Fig. 12. Detection of different trait groups acting as proxies for crop stress
    in the reviewed studies, aggregated to time scales (short-, medium and long-term
    stress). The traits refer to fluxes-related, such as transpiration or SIF yield,
    biochemicals, i.e. leaf water or pigment contents, and structure-related traits,
    e.g. leaf inclination, LAI or biomass. In particular, the combination of VIS/NIR
    with TIR sensors can increase the accuracy of the long-term stress assessment
    since the same traits are observed based on distinct principles (e.g., Chaerle
    and Van Der Straeten, 2000; Gerhards et al., 2016). As stated above, this specific
    wavelength domain combination is also driven by the availability and comparatively
    low costs of the sensors. In contrast to TIR data, being applied to any time scale,
    SIF data was almost exclusively employed to analyse short-term (flux-related)
    responses (Campbell et al., 2007; Ni et al., 2015; Pérez-Bueno et al., 2015; Zarco-Tejada
    et al., 2018). Similarly to the analysis of TIR data, the SIF signal might be
    weak and interpretability can be increased by combining the data with measurements
    from other spectral domains (e.g., Alonso et al., 2017; Celesti et al., 2018;
    Chaerle et al., 2009). Overall, we found that studies including SIF data were
    rather underrepresented. A smaller number of studies focused on biotic stress
    (see Fig. 10), mainly disease detection (e.g., Bendel et al., 2020; Mahlein et
    al., 2019; Savian et al., 2020). Here we observed a large variety in the combination
    of spectral domains. However, it must be remarked that the number of analysed
    traits in those studies was also large, including structural, biophysical and
    biochemical traits. In conclusion, we observed that the majority of reviewed studies
    was rather restricted to a comparison of the outcomes by diverse sensors and spectral
    domains as opposed to a synergistic usage of the multi-domain data. Only a few
    studies were working on synergistic integration of RS data from various spectral
    domains (e.g., Zarco-Tejada et al., 2018) targeting stress detection. 4.8. Disentangling
    abiotic and biotic stress sources Since plant pathogens pose an enormous threat
    to global food security causing yield losses exceeding 30% in selected regions
    or even up to 100% on a local scale (Savary et al., 2019; Zarco-Tejada et al.,
    2021), we address this specific topic here. The differentiation of biotic and
    abiotic stressors is a challenging task, as symptoms triggered by pathogens may
    be confounded with abiotic-induced responses. Also, the distinction between multiple
    biotic-induced stressors remains to be investigated, in order to provide quantitative
    tools for pre-symptomatic disease detection allowing respective measures and adaptation
    of management practices. So far, only a few studies focused on disentangling infection
    sources with similar symptoms (e.g., Fallon et al., 2020; Gold et al., 2020; Moshou
    et al., 2014; Poblete et al., 2021). Gold et al. (2020), for instance, sampled
    hyperspectral measurements of hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogen-affected
    potato crops, estimating multiple traits over the optical reflective domains,
    which were synergistically explored using chemometric models. This approach allowed
    to provide a pre- and post-symptomatic differentiation of the two foliar diseases.
    In Poblete et al. (2021), olive trees affected by two pathogenes were investigated,
    restricting water and nutrient flow through the xylem, which leads to symptoms
    similar to those caused by drought stress. The authors applied three-stage machine
    learning algorithms to airborne hyperspectral and thermal imagery to discriminate
    the two diseases successfully. Zarco-Tejada et al. (2021) explored thermal and
    hyperspectral reflectance data revealing the existence of divergent pathogen-
    and host-specific spectral pathways through uncoupling of specific biotic and
    abiotic spectral effects. All in all, these studies concluded that a multi-sensor
    approach is absolutely necessary for in-depth stress analysis, and presented in
    a pioneering way how synergy of different domains and sensors (mainly with hyperspectral
    resolutions in the VIS/NIR/SWIR domain) can be used to predict and distinguish
    biotic and abiotic stressors. However, it needs to be mentioned that differentiation
    is still vague in many cases and advanced methods such as machine learning should
    be explored (Behmann et al., 2015; Neupane and Baysal-Gurel, 2021). The review
    by Zhang et al. (2019) about monitoring plant diseases and pests using RS also
    concluded that the detection of abiotic stress is still challenging and under-exploited
    through the simultaneous appearance of multiple stressors. Hence, we need to advance
    near real-time detection at larger spatial scales, especially for pests, pathogens
    and diseases, causing significant global production losses (Savary et al., 2019).
    This is even more evident, as our literature analysis revealed that the majority
    of available studies in this domain rather concentrated on single crops and pathogens
    at local and experimental levels. 5. New concepts of sensor synergies Combining
    distinct spectral domains acquired from one or multiple sensors leads to more
    data for an improved (post-)processing of signals or quantities to derive plant
    physiological, biochemical and structural information. In addition, it offers
    advanced possibilities to observe a complete range of plant responses (i.e., traits),
    which can be directly related to stress. This review has clearly indicated a possibly
    strong - and currently largely underexploited - potential of using spectral information
    from multiple sensors or domains in a synergistic way for crop stress detection,
    monitoring and management. Based on these insights, we propose four ways forward
    to increasing complexity by employing multi-domains data, as delineated in Fig.
    13, fostering: • Combined acquisition and analysis of spectral data from multiple
    sensors representing multiple modalities and using parametric regressions (see
    Section 5.1); • Simultaneous retrieval of plant traits using multi-domain RTMs
    and ML methods (see Section 5.2); • Assimilation of estimated plant traits based
    on data from different spectral domains into mechanistic models (see Section 5.3);
    • Conceptual framework: Development of fully integrated mechanistic and radiative
    transfer models directly simulating the full variety of spectral measurements
    that can thereafter be assimilated (see Section 5.4). Download : Download high-res

    synergies for stress detection with increasing complexity. The colors blue, green,
    orange and red refer to the spectral domains VIS/NIR, SIF, SWIR, and TIR, respectively,
    and with respect to the derived indices or traits. The indices and traits in the
    small coloured boxes are some selected representative examples. The box on the
    right shows the concept of our proposed conceptual framework, the iCGM - integrated
    crop growth model. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
    legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) 5.1. Combined
    acquisition and analysis of multi-sensor data In the short run - and directly
    feasible with existing methodologies and sensors - we believe that stress detection
    towards operational monitoring should employ at least one sensor and one parametric
    regression or classification method per trait group (i.e. functional, biochemical,
    structural), typically representing plant adaptation responses at varying time
    scales (see Fig.13, left). The synergistic database can then be used to train
    machine learning regression algorithms for generating crop stress prediction models.
    This procedure may allow: i) to better understand the sensitivity of various spectral
    indices to stress occurrence, which will ultimately enable ii) to distinguish
    between diverse stress severity (e.g. mild to severe water stress). For instance,
    Zarco-Tejada et al. (2021) obtained several spectral traits from multi-sensor
    data and used the derived spectral fingerprints for distinguishing different diseases.
    Another study by Damm et al. (2022) investigated temporal sensitivity of multi-sensor
    derived vegetation information for evolving water stress. Since such kinds of
    studies are still scarce, we advocate more research aiming to obtain a holistic
    view of plants under biotic and abiotic stress through synergistic usage of spectral
    information from multiple sensors or domains. However, the differentiation between
    distinct types of stresses (e.g. water-deficit or nutrient stress) will remain
    a challenge with purely RS-based approaches because distinct stressors often lead
    to similar stress reactions (Poblete et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2019). 5.2. Simultaneous
    retrieval of plant traits employing multi-sensor data, multi-domain RTMs and hybrid
    retrieval methods As a second strategy, we encourage exploiting multi-domain radiative
    transfer models for simultaneous usage of VNIR/SWIR hyperspectral, TIR and SIF
    observations (Yang et al., 2020b). One advantage of using a unified radiative
    transfer scheme for these spectral domains is that the retrieval can be better
    constrained. For example, several studies retrieved crop traits and stress responses
    by combining the VNIR/SWIR and SIF signals with the model SCOPE (Celesti et al.,
    2018; Van der Tol et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019) and FluorFlight (Hernández-Clemente
    et al., 2017). The analogy of radiative transfer among these spectral domains
    and between reflected and emitted radiation enabled the decomposition of SIF patterns
    into structure related effects (such as leaf inclinations) and physiological stress
    responses. Some of the difficulties of using TIR data can also be overcome with
    multi-domain radiative transfer modeling. For example, Duffour et al. (2015) used
    vegetation traits that can be retrieved from VNIR/SWIR data in SCOPE to simulate
    radiative transfer in the TIR domain as well as the directionality of the TIR
    signal. The improved understanding of the influence of the geometry dependent
    fraction of sunlit and shaded leaves and soil supports the interpretation of TIR
    for stress detection. The inclusion of photosynthesis and non-radiative heat exchange
    (evaporative and convective cooling) in a RTM opens further possibilities for
    multi-domain retrieval. Stomatal and photochemical responses, for example, can
    simultaneously respond to variations in incident solar radiation, both affecting
    the TIR and SIF emissions and radiation absorption in the VIS. With such integrated
    approach, the joint retrieval from the VNIR and TIR domains (Bayat et al., 2018)
    or from the VNIR and SIF (Pacheco-Labrador et al., 2019b) enables the estimation
    of photochemical parameters and stomatal aperture. Suarez et al. (2021) retrieved
    photosynthetic parameters from SCOPE, but using hyperspectral data of the VNIR
    region including subtle responses in the 530–570 nm range caused by xanthophyll
    pigment changes associated with non-photochemical quenching in response to excess
    light as modelled by Vilfan et al. (2018). These studies demonstrate the benefit
    of multi-domain and multi-process models, but analysis of such datasets can be
    complex and computationally intensive. For larger datasets, the capabilities of
    these models can be preserved without additional computational burden by using
    machine learning or deep learning approaches: the retrieval of proxies could be
    accomplished by means of hybrid approaches which combine machine learning with
    RTMs (Verrelst et al., 2019a), as delineated in Fig.13 (second left). 5.3. Assimilation
    of remotely derived crop traits into crop growth models For efficient stress detection
    and prognosis, the assimilation of spatially derived trait maps from RS observations
    into crop growth models (CGM) (e.g., van Diepen et al., 1989; Hank et al., 2015;
    Jones et al., 2003) would be beneficial. These mechanistic models also account
    for weather and soil variables or agricultural management practices, which could
    help to identify the cause of the stress (Baret et al., 2007). The continuous
    description of crop growth and development using mechanistic models offers means
    to summarize current knowledge about the main processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum, which also include stress related processes and phenomena (Weiss et
    al., 2020). Therefore, we propose to explore this concept (see also Fig.13, second
    right), which can serve for the development of a digital twin (DT) of the farming
    system (Verdouw et al., 2021). Such DTs are digital equivalents of real-life objects,
    virtually mirroring the behaviour and states of physical systems over their whole
    lifetime (Grieves and Vickers, 2016). In relation to precision agriculture applications,
    current state-of-the-art CGMs include advanced crop growth models (Peng et al.,
    2018), crop-specific parameterizations (Boas et al., 2021; Sulis et al., 2015),
    and crop management practices like irrigation and nitrogen fertilization (Lombardozzi
    et al., 2020). The synergistic use of CGMs and RS is already being explored for
    building operational monitoring and prediction platforms capable of delivering
    useful information for agricultural applications and decisions (e.g., McNally
    et al., 2017; Peters-Lidard et al., 2021). These platforms are mainly based on
    the assimilation of water cycle measurements (e.g., soil moisture) and remotely
    sensed vegetation variables (e.g., LAI), obtaining clear improvements in the estimation
    of vegetation biomass, evapotranspiration, root zone soil moisture, and carbon
    fluxes. More complex and realistic representation of physical processes recently
    implemented in CGMs and the exploitation of the different optical domains in RS
    open the opportunity to predict better a wider range of crop processes, most notably
    to capture the onset of crop water and heat stress, reducing also the uncertainty
    in crop model variable estimation. The assimilation of multiple data streams into
    CGMs and thus the establishment of DTs, represents also a viable approach for
    getting an improved understanding about physical mechanisms and feedback controlling
    the development, duration, and impacts of stress on plant growth and yield. However,
    significant challenges have to be addressed in order to fully exploit this potential.
    These challenges include consistency checks between diverse RS observations and
    between the retrieval algorithms and the crop model parameterizations, as well
    as the robust quantification of the uncertainties along traceable processing chains.
    5.4. Proposed conceptional framework: Integration of crop growth and radiative
    transfer models Future stress research should focus on the integration of suitable
    multi-domain radiative transfer models (e.g. SCOPE) with dynamic crop growth models
    to build up DTs of agroecosystems. Such integrated models (iCGMs) directly simulate
    remotely observed signals based on the status of the underlying CGM at any given
    point in time (see Fig.13, right). This means the iCGM simulates the spectral
    signatures of the canopy (400–2500 nm), the SIF emission as well as the thermal
    properties, along with physiological processes (Delécolle et al., 1992; Moulin
    et al., 1998). The integration of CGMs and RTMs has several compelling advantages.
    On the one hand, the CGM can benefit from all available satellite data while the
    assimilation scheme can weigh the value of observations by using information about
    their uncertainties. However, combining data with various spatial and temporal
    resolution needs to be considered carefully in the conceptual design (Huang et
    al., 2019). Traits that appear both as a status variable in the CGM and as an
    input of the RTM have to permit the RTM to simulate spectral properties across
    all domains. For the number of traits, being sensitive in the different spectral
    domains, assimilation strategies need to be developed taking into account the
    different availability (timing) of sensor data. The assimilation needs to allow
    for a model update at different times, where only a part of the variables are
    assimilated, with model-intern constraints and links to further variables. On
    the other hand, the RTM could benefit from the background information of the CGM.
    Satellite derived time series of vegetation traits can be noisy due to atmospheric,
    orbital and geometric effects. The use of retrievals in close proximity in time
    as background information has shown to be effective in making the satellite data
    smoother (Mousivand et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2021b). CGMs provide continuous
    series of temporal growth dynamics which can be used to detect outliers and to
    improve the construction of smooth time-series from heterogeneous satellite data.
    In this respect, the use of a CGM assimilating these data is a step up. Furthermore,
    by inserting a morphological sub-model, one could simulate the physiological appearance
    of plants, which lead - using a suitable sensor model - to temporal evolution
    of point clouds observable through photogrammetry or Lidar (Liu et al., 2019).
    Expanding existing RTMs from the optical spectral domain to the microwave range
    would similarly lead to the simulation of temporal sequences of (active and passive)
    microwave signatures (e.g. using a RADAR backscatter model). The combined set
    of spectral properties would be simulated simultaneously for each time step of
    the iCGM, which ideally should be hourly. For executing iCGMs over large areas
    in high temporal and spatial resolutions, this physically based modeling could
    be combined with machine learning to estimate traits or stress proxies within
    a hybrid manner. The complex models can also be partly replaced through surrogate
    models or emulators speeding up the forward simulations (Verrelst et al., 2019b).
    As CGMs are driven by weather variables, it is also easy to conceive the integration
    of weather forecasts and/or weather scenarios in such iCGM (see Section 5.3).
    This dynamic nature would meet the requirements of a DT of agroecosystems, which
    besides the representation of current behaviour, also predicts their future behaviour
    (Verdouw et al., 2021). Therefore, we consider the iCGM as the most promising
    approach and this section is meant as a way to stimulate further discussion about
    DTs within the community. Once developed, such iCGMs facilitate tackling various
    research gaps needed to define future sensitive Earth observational approaches
    and stimulate the development of applications in the realm of precision agriculture.
    In the near future, we will have a multitude of spectral data available to feed
    the proposed iCGM. Besides the recently available and upcoming spaceborne imagine
    spectrometer data, such as the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP)
    (Guanter et al., 2015), PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA)
    (Cogliati et al., 2021; Loizzo et al., 2019), Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging
    Mission for the Environment (Rast et al., 2021) or the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal
    Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) data (Fisher et al., 2020),
    UAVs became a crucial platform with respect to sensor synergies. Several light
    multi- and hyperspectral VIS, NIR and SWIR, thermal and SIF sensors are available
    nowadays (overviews provided by Aasen et al. (2018); Awais et al. (2022); Herrmann
    and Berger (2021); Messina and Modica (2020); Neupane and Baysal-Gurel (2021);
    Yang et al. (2017a)), which can be explored for model development or validation
    of physiological traits related to crop stress. Besides spectral synergies, the
    exploitation of multi-scale multi-sensor data allows to fill temporal gaps and
    improve spatial resolutions. Hence, such upcoming multi-scale approaches are foreseen
    to play a more dominant role in future studies (Alvarez-Vanhard et al., 2021;
    Inoue et al., 2018; Machwitz et al., 2021; Sagan et al., 2019). Some applications
    and use cases of our proposed conceptional framework are laid out below. Sensitivity
    assessment of state-of-the-art approaches: Remote sensing measurements and retrieved
    crop information can be subject to insensitivity or uncertainties caused by various
    sources, e.g., instrumental effects and calibration issues (Pacheco-Labrador et
    al., 2019a), spatial-spectral-temporal sampling design (Aasen et al., 2019), retrieval
    assumptions (Cendrero-Mateo et al., 2019), cf. Buman et al. (2022) for an overview
    of related uncertainties on SIF. Such effects can result in a mismatch between
    expected and observed crop behaviour (e.g. spatio-temporal dynamics of crop state
    variables). The proposed conceptual framework (section 5.4) can be applied to
    facilitate sensitivity analysis aiming to assess potential crop responses and
    their spatio-temporal dynamics. Resulting insights allow us to identify sensitive
    wavelength regions, sampling schemes, and sensor modalities for crop stress symptoms.
    In this way, artificially modulated dynamics inherent to state-of-the art observational
    approaches, e.g., trends caused by sensor degradation, anomalies, and covariance
    between traits due to imperfect retrievals, can be unraveled. Benchmarking and
    uncertainty assessment for mission development: Experimental or operational satellite
    missions require dedicated tools to define scientific needs and requirements (Malenovský
    et al., 2012). The conceptual framework holds the capacity to support the evaluation
    of such requirements. One example is to parameterize the framework with densely
    sampled multi-sensor data to assess subtle stress responses of crops, such as
    photosynthesis, gas exchange or pigment degradation (Jin et al., 2018). In an
    ablation study, data scarcity can be simulated to quantify uncertainties related
    to e.g. reduced spectral, temporal and spatial resolutions. Resulting insights
    allow assessing critical sampling dimensions for various stress symptoms and to
    make recommendations towards new experimental or operational crop stress missions
    or to design dedicated in situ or close range approaches. Stress detection via
    anomalies: The framework allows to calculate potential crop states and functioning
    (e.g. growth rates, gas exchange) as induced by environmental drivers (Huang et
    al., 2019). The comparison of actual estimates of crop state and functioning against
    its simulated potential offers a pathway to identify anomalous crop conditions
    (e.g. caused by crop stress). Forecasting of crop stress and tools: The framework
    allows to learn - through simulation - how ecosystems behave under current and
    future environmental conditions, also known as scenario analysis (Machwitz et
    al., 2018). The coupling also enables forecasting of crop stress responses when
    upcoming growth conditions can be reasonably well simulated. The ultimate goal
    of developing advanced crop monitoring and forecasting tools is to provide reliable
    and usable information to public and private stakeholders in the agricultural
    sector. This goal can be achieved by targeting distinct spatial scales (i.e.,
    from field to the regional scale) and temporal horizons (from short-range to seasonal)
    that match with farmers'' activities and planning. In this context, the seamless
    integration of CGM + RTM data assimilation cycles into operational weather forecast
    chains that cover the full temporal spectrum of farmers'' decisions appears the
    most straightforward approach in order to accomplish this objective. The additional
    use of meteorological information relevant during the distinct crop development
    stages (e.g., accumulated heat time, probability of heat/cold stress) also has
    the advantage to improve the interpretation of environmental stresses for a given
    crop development stage (McNally et al., 2017; Peters-Lidard et al., 2021). The
    wealth of numerical information extracted from such monitoring and forecasting
    tools needs to be translated into crop-specific stress indicators to create an
    interface between scientific advancements and the decision-making process. Finally,
    the probabilistic character of the meteorological forecasts and the uncertainties
    in RS observations and numerical models formulations must be accounted for. 6.
    Conclusions Timely and efficient detection of crop stress remains a challenge
    but can be approached by exploring multiple RS data sources. In addition, the
    portfolio of available tools and retrieval methods for the identification of specific
    stresses has been increasing in the last decade. In this review, we focused on
    the use of optical sensor synergies for improving spectral sampling to better
    characterize and interpret crop stresses in support of sustainable agriculture.
    We identified three different phases (stages) of stress depending on duration
    and severity: (1) early and short-term, (2) medium-term and mild (3) chronic and
    severe. The three phases can best be detected by optical RS domains through specifically
    affected traits, such as fluxes at early stages sensed by SIF and TIR, and biochemicals
    and structural properties at later stress stages, measured with reflective optical
    systems in the VIS, NIR and SWIR wavelength ranges. Our review revealed that the
    combination of VIS, NIR and TIR domains was employed by the majority of studies
    addressing crop stress. However, this choice was mainly driven by economical and
    practical reasons, i.e. the availability of sensors. Furthermore, in most publications,
    the exploration of diverse spectral domains was rather based on a comparison of
    respective methods than on synergistic and integrated methodological concepts.
    An efficient crop stress detection framework has to be versatile, easy to operate,
    and inexpensive so that it can be easily integrated into precision agriculture
    and breeding systems. To achieve this, we pursue four ways forward of increasing
    complexity. These possible concepts involve: (i) Combined analysis of data from
    multiple sensors using representative parametric regressions and ML approaches,
    leading to qualitative stress maps. (ii) Simultaneous retrieval of plant traits
    using multi-domain RTMs and ML methods, providing quantitative stress maps. (iii)
    Assimilation of estimated plant traits based on data from different spectral domains
    into CGMs, and integrated dynamic CGMs (iv), which both lead to quantitative stress
    and stressor maps also enabling stress prediction. In this way, the digital twinning
    of agroecosystems provides a new perspective for real-life, highly accurate and
    holistic views of stress and stressors, allowing to act on time and thus contributing
    to a sustainable agricultural production needed to feed the future world population.
    Hence, we suggest that the community progresses towards such a DT design for stress
    effects, causes and prediction in a joint initiative. Such a synergistic approach
    has the potential to extract essential information about the plant stress status
    and may reveal the causes of biophysical, physiological and photochemical changes
    over cultivated areas in space and time. Funding This research was funded by the

    Abstract: Recently, there has been a significant increase in the use of proximal
    or remote hyperspectral imaging systems to study plant properties, types, and
    conditions. Numerous financial and environmental benefits of using such systems
    have been the driving force behind this growth. This paper is concerned with the
    analysis of hyperspectral data for detecting plant diseases and stress conditions
    and classifying crop types by means of advanced machine learning techniques. Main
    contribution of the work lies in the use of an innovative classification framework
    for the analysis, in which adaptive feature selection, novelty detection, and
    ensemble learning are integrated. Three hyperspectral datasets and a nonimaging
    hyperspectral dataset were used in the evaluation of the proposed framework. Experimental
    results show significant improvements achieved by the proposed method compared
    to the use of empirical spectral indices and existing classification methods.

    Publisher: IEEE CFS uses the correlation between features and classes to evaluate
    the significance of the features. It uses Shannon''s entropy and information gain
    to measure average feature-class and average feature-feature correlations. The
    features are then evaluated heuristically on merit to determine the significance
    as follows: The search strategy in this algorithm is based on the best first search
    and the process halts if no improvement is achieved after five consecutive iterations.

  explanation: A recent study utilized deep learning techniques to analyze the relationship
    between hyperspectral imaging and stress detection in plants, particularly regarding
    advanced sensing technologies. The study found that deep learning algorithms,
    such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), effectively identified stress-induced
    changes in plants based on hyperspectral data. The CNNs were able to classify
    plant stress with high accuracy, demonstrating the potential of deep learning
    for non-invasive and real-time stress detection in agriculture. This research
    contributes to the development of automated systems for monitoring plant health
    and improving crop management practices.

    \ of major issues that cause signiﬁcant economic loss for growers.\nThe labor-intensive\
    \ conventional methods for identifying the stressed plants constrain their\napplications.\
    \ To address this issue, rapid methods are in urgent needs. Developments of advanced\n\
    sensing and machine learning techniques trigger revolutions for precision agriculture\
    \ based on deep\nlearning and big data. In this paper, we reviewed the latest\
    \ deep learning approaches pertinent\nto the image analysis of crop stress diagnosis.\
    \ We compiled the current sensor tools and deep\nlearning principles involved\
    \ in plant stress phenotyping. In addition, we reviewed a variety of deep\nlearning\
    \ applications/functions with plant stress imaging, including classiﬁcation, object\
    \ detection,\nand segmentation, of which are closely intertwined. Furthermore,\
    \ we summarized and discussed the\ncurrent challenges and future development avenues\
    \ in plant phenotyping.\nKeywords: deep learning; convolutional neural network;\
    \ crop stress; precision phenotyping\n1. Plant Stress and Sensors\nPlant stress\
    \ is one of the major threats to crops causing signiﬁcant reduction of crop yield\n\
    and quality [1]. The detection and diagnosis of the plant stress is urgently needed\
    \ for rapid and\nrobust application of precision agriculture in crop measurement.\
    \ Presently, intensive studies focus\non developing optical imaging methods for\
    \ plant disease detection. Diﬀerent from the conventional\nmethods using the visual\
    \ scoring, optical imaging is advanced to measure changes caused by abiotic\n\
    or biotic stressors in the plant physiology rapidly and without contact. In general,\
    \ the common\nimaging technologies have been employed for detecting the crop stress,\
    \ including digital, ﬂuorescence,\nthermography, LIDAR, multispectral, and hyperspectral\
    \ imaging techniques [2]. The common optical\nsensors used for plant stress detection\
    \ are shown in Figure 1.\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2, 430–446; doi:10.3390/agriengineering2030029\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/agriengineering\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2\n431\nFigure 1.\
    \ Typical optical sensors used for plant stress detection. (a) Digital sensor\
    \ for maize heat\nstress [3]; (b) multispectral imaging sensor for maize water\
    \ stress [4]; (c) ﬂuorescence imaging sensor\nfor chilling injury of tomato seedlings\
    \ [5]; (d) thermal imaging sensor for potato water stress [6], and (e)\nhyperspectral\
    \ imaging sensor for apple water stress [7].\nDigital imaging sensors acquire\
    \ the visible range of wavelengths, i.e., RGB colored images with red,\nblue,\
    \ and green channels to detect plant diseases. Such images provide physical attributes\
    \ of the plants,\nsuch as canopy vigor, leaf color, leaf texture, size, and shape\
    \ information [8]. Color and texture features\nare important for identifying the\
    \ characteristic diﬀerence between healthy and symptomatic plants.\nFrequently\
    \ used color features are RGB, LAB, YCBCR, and HSV spaces [9]. Additionally, contrast,\n\
    homogeneity, dissimilarity, energy, and entropy features of images are descriptive\
    \ facets of texture [10].\nIn other words, quantitative diagnosis features for\
    \ identifying the symptomatic and healthy plants\nhave been collected in these\
    \ images.\nThermal imaging sensors obtain infrared radiating images ranging from\
    \ 8 to 12 µm, which are\noften applied for predicting plant temperatures. Under\
    \ the infection, the temperature of infected plant\ntissues varies and related\
    \ to the impacts caused by pathogens. The temperature variance, other the\nhand,\
    \ appears with a counter-eﬀect on transpiration rate [11]. In other words, stress\
    \ from the infection\ntrigger both transpiration rate decrease and leaf temperature\
    \ increase, resulting in stomatal closure\nin plants. In turn, based on these\
    \ alterations, thermal imaging sensors could identify the infection\ndiseases.\
    \ Each pixel of the thermal image represents the temperature value of the object,\
    \ which is\nexpressed in manners of false color. In plant disease detection, the\
    \ thermal sensor could be mounted to\nground automated vehicles (GAV) and unmanned\
    \ aerial vehicles (UAV).\nFluorescence imaging sensors are often utilized to identify\
    \ variations of plant photosynthetic\nactivity [12]. The diﬀerences of stressed\
    \ and healthy leaves will be expressed in the diﬀerences of\nphotosynthetic activities,\
    \ which will be assessed by the photosynthetic electron transform using the\n\
    ﬂuorescence imaging sensor with an LED or laser illumination. For normal cases,\
    \ 685 nm is the\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2\n432\nwavelength at which chlorophyll\
    \ ﬂuorescence is emitted from photo-system II (PSII). The stressed\nplants could\
    \ change the patterns of chlorophyll ﬂuorescence emission, which could be reﬂected\
    \ and\nobserved in the ﬂuorescence imaging [13].\nBased on the number of spectral\
    \ bands in the optical sensing technologies, sensors contain 3–10 spectral\nbands\
    \ are named multispectral imaging sensors. The multispectral imaging sensors normally\
    \ extract a few\nor a stack of images from the visible to near-infrared spectrum\
    \ [14]. Plant stress often causes an increase in\nvisible reflectance, with a\
    \ decrease in chlorophyll and absorption of visible light. Additionally, reduced\n\
    near infrared (NIR) reflectance will happen due to changes of the leaf tissue.\
    \ Thus, the most used band\nchannels are green, red, red-edge and NIR. Multispectral\
    \ imaging sensor combined with drones have been\napplied broadly in remote sensing\
    \ for plant disease detection [15], while this type of sensors is limited to a\n\
    few spectral bands and sometimes cannot quantify the diseased plants severity.\n\
    Despite many successful studies having been applied to crop stress detection using\
    \ cheap\npassive imagery sensors, i.e., digital and near infrared (NIR), most\
    \ of the applications require fast\nimage processing and computational algorithms\
    \ for image analysis. Among the image analysis\ntechniques, supervised methods\
    \ have been popular with training data being used to develop a system.\nSuch methods\
    \ include shape segmentation, feature extraction, and classiﬁers for stress diagnosis.\n\
    In addition, machine learning algorithms search for the optimal decision boundary\
    \ in the feature space\nwith high dimensionality, which provides the basis for\
    \ many available image analysis systems [16].\nFor improving the image analysis\
    \ systems, deep learning has played a key role. Deep neural networks\nhave many\
    \ layers which transform input images to outputs (i.e., healthy or stressed) with\
    \ learning deep\nfeatures. The most applied networks are convolutional neural\
    \ networks (CNNs) in crop image analysis.\nCNNs consist of dozens or hundreds\
    \ of layers that process the images with convolution filters with a\nrespective\
    \ small size of batches [17]. Despite such initial successes, CNNs cannot collect\
    \ momentum\nwithout the advances in core computing systems and deep convolutional\
    \ networks become the current\nfocus. In agriculture, deep learning shows accepted\
    \ performance considering accuracy and efficiency based\non large datasets. To\
    \ build precise classifiers for improving plant disease diagnosis, the PlantVillage\
    \ project\n(https://plantvillage.psu.edu/posts/6948-plantvillage-dataset-download)\
    \ has obtained a large number of\nimages of healthy and diseased crops for free\
    \ [18]. Combined with the big data, deep learning has been put\nforwarded as the\
    \ future promising method in plant phenotyping [19]. For example, CNNs can effectively\n\
    detect and diagnose plant diseases [20] and classify plant fruits in the field\
    \ [21]. The promising results\npromote studies carrying out other phenotyping\
    \ tasks using deep learning, such as leaf morphological\nclassification [22].\
    \ Thus, we read many references about the utilization of deep learning in image-based\n\
    crop stress detection. Summarizing, with this paper we aim to:\n1.\nState the\
    \ principle of deep learning in the application for crop stress diagnosis based\
    \ on images.\n2.\nSearch for the challenges of deep learning in crop stress imaging.\n\
    3.\nHighlight the future directions that could be helpful for circumventing the\
    \ challenges in plant\nphenotyping tasks.\n2. Deep Learning Principle\n2.1. Machine\
    \ Learning\nMachine learning is a subset of artiﬁcial intelligence which is used\
    \ to operate speciﬁc tasks by\ncomputer systems [23]. In general, it is split\
    \ into supervised and unsupervised learning methods.\nSupervised learning methods\
    \ are expressed with an input matrix of independent x and dependent\ny variables.\
    \ This dependent variable of y has few formats, varying based on solving problems.\n\
    For classiﬁcation issues, y is usually a scalar for representing the category\
    \ labels, and it is a vector\ncontaining continuous values under regression [24].\
    \ Under segmented learning conditions, y is\nsometimes the ground truth label\
    \ image [25]. Supervised learning methods often aim to ﬁnd optimal\nmodel parameters,\
    \ which could predict the data to the greatest extent based on the loss function.\n\
    AgriEngineering 2020, 2\n433\nUnsupervised learning methods operate data processing\
    \ without dependent labels and aim to\nsearch for patterns (e.g., latent variables).\
    \ Common unsupervised learning methods include principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA),\
    \ k-nearest neighbors clustering, and T-distributed stochastic neighbor\nembedding\
    \ clustering [26]. Unsupervised training usually uses many diﬀerent loss functions\
    \ to process,\nsuch as reconstructing the loss function. The model must learn\
    \ to reconstruct the loss function in a\nsmaller dimension to reconstruct the\
    \ input data [27].\n2.2. Neural Network\nA neural network is built to recognize\
    \ patterns and provides the basis for most deep learning\nalgorithms [28]. A neural\
    \ network contains nodes that integrate input data with a set of coeﬃcients\n\
    and weights with amplify or dampen the input for learning the assigned tasks,\
    \ e.g., the common\nactivation function α and parameters Θ = \bw, β\t, here, w\
    \ represents the weights and β represents the\nbiases. An activation function\
    \ is normally followed by an elemental nonlinear factor/coeﬃcient σ, as a\ntransfer\
    \ function, as shown in Equation (1) [28]:\nα = σ\n\x10\nWTx + b\n\x11\n(1)\n\
    Sigmoidal and hyperbolic tangent functions are the common transfer functions for\
    \ neural networks.\nThe multilayer perceptron (MLP) is the most popular one in\
    \ traditional neural networks, with few\nconversion layers [28]:\nf(x; Θ) = σ\n\
    \x10\nWLσ\n\x10\nWL−1 . . . σ\n\x10\nW0x + b0\x11\n+ bL−1\x11\n+ bL\x11\n(2)\n\
    where WL is a matrix containing rows wk that is related with activation k in the\
    \ output, and L is the ﬁnal\nlayer. The so-called hidden layers are the layers\
    \ between input and output layers. A neural network\nwith many layers is often\
    \ called deep neural network (DNN), thence deep learning. The activation of\n\
    the last layer is mapped to distribution on the class P (y|x; Θ) through a softmax\
    \ function [28]:\nP\n\x10\ny\n\f\f\fx; Θ\n\x11\n= softmax (x; Θ) =\ne(WL\ni )Tx+bL\n\
    i\nPK\nk=1 e(WL\nk )Tx+bL\nk\n(3)\nwhere WL\ni is the weight vector associated\
    \ with class i to the output node. The typical diagram of deep\nneural network\
    \ MLP is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Typical architectures of deep neural network\
    \ used in imaging analysis. (a) autoencoder and\n(b) convolutional neural network.\n\
    AgriEngineering 2020, 2\n434\nCurrently, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is\
    \ the famous method for ﬁtting the parameter Θ\nto process a small population\
    \ dataset. With SGD, a small batch is employed in each gradient and\nmaximum likelihood\
    \ optimization is used to minimize the negative impact of the log-likelihood.\n\
    It tracks the log loss for a binary classiﬁcation task and the softmax loss for\
    \ multiclass classiﬁcation.\nA disadvantage of this method is that it usually\
    \ does not directly optimize the quantity of interest [28].\nDNN became popular\
    \ in 2016, when it performed layer-by-layer training (pre-training) in an\nunsupervised\
    \ manner, and then supervised and ﬁne-tuned the stacked network to obtain good\n\
    performance. Such a DNN architecture includes a stacked autoencoder (SAE) and\
    \ a deep summary\nnetwork (DBN). However, such methods are often complex, which\
    \ need a great deal of engineering\nto obtain acceptable results [28,29]. Recently,\
    \ end-to-end training has been conducted on popular\narchitectures in a supervised\
    \ manner by streamlining the training procedure. The common architectures\nare\
    \ CNN and recurrent neural network (RNN) [30,31]. CNN has been widely used for\
    \ image analysis,\nand RNN is becoming more and more popular.\n2.3. Convolutional\
    \ Neural Network\nThe main diﬀerence between MLP and CNN is reﬂected in two aspects.\
    \ First, weights of the\nCNN architecture are shared with a network when the architecture\
    \ operates convolutions on the input\nimage [32]. In this way, separate detector\
    \ learning is not required for the same object appearing at\ndiﬀerent locations\
    \ in the image. As a result, the network is equally variable in the translation\
    \ of input\nimages. In addition, the number of parameters to be learned is reduced.\n\
    During CNN training, the input images are convolved with a set of K kernels W\
    \ =\n\bW1, W2, W3, . . . WK\n\t and biases β =\nn\nb1, . . . , bK\no\nin the convolution\
    \ layer, yielding a new feature\nmap Xk. Such features are exposed to a nonlinear\
    \ transformation parameter σ and such process would\nrepeat for each respective\
    \ convolutional layer l [32]:\nXl\nk = σ\n\x10\nWl−1\nk\n× Xl−1 + bl−1\nk\n\x11\
    \n(4)\nSecond, the main diﬀerence between MLP and CNN is the pooling layer. In\
    \ such layers, the pixels\nof the neighborhood are added based on the permutation\
    \ invariant function in CNN. This may prompt\na certain amount of rendering invariance\
    \ [33]. Then, the fully connected layers are usually added\nwith constant weights\
    \ after convolutional processing. Then, the softmax function is used to provide\n\
    activation information in the last layer, resulting in a category assignment.\
    \ A typical CNN architecture\nis shown in Figure 3 for identifying the ripeness\
    \ of strawberry based on hyperspectral imagery [34].\nFigure 3. One typical CNN\
    \ architecture for estimating the ripeness of strawberry based on hyperspectral\n\
    imagery [34]. Note: Conv represents convolutional layer; FC: fully connected layer.\n\
    AgriEngineering 2020, 2\n435\n2.4. CNN Architecture\nCNN normally uses a 2D image\
    \ as input, with a format of m × n × 3 (m × n × 1 for greyscale\nimages), where\
    \ m and n are the respective image height and width, and 3 is the number of image\n\
    channels. The CNN architecture often contains a few diﬀerent layers, including\
    \ convolutional layers,\npooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional\
    \ and pooling layers are initial layers. A set\nof convolutional kernels (also\
    \ called ﬁlters) is used for each layer performing multiple transformations.\n\
    The convolution operations extract the associated features from small slices divided\
    \ from the full image.\nEach kernel is applied to the input slice and the output\
    \ of each kernel is applied to non-linear processing\nunits, making it capable\
    \ of learning abstraction and embedding non-linearity in the feature space [35].\n\
    The non-linear processing provides diﬀerent patterns of activations corresponding\
    \ to diﬀerent responses,\nwhich helps learn the semantic diﬀerences over the full\
    \ image. Then, the subsampling is applied to the\noutput of non-linear processing,\
    \ with summarizing the results and making the input insensitive to\nthe geometric\
    \ deformation [36]. The CNN architecture has been applied to many aspects, including\n\
    classiﬁcation, segmentation, and object detection, etc.\n2.4.1. Classiﬁcation\
    \ Architectures\nAmong the pre-trained networks, AlexNet is commonly used for\
    \ images classiﬁcation, which is\nrelatively simple with ﬁve convolutional layers.\
    \ The activation function of AlexNet is the hyperbolic\ntangent, which is the\
    \ most common choice in CNNs [37]. Then, the deep pre-trained networks appeared,\n\
    such as the VGG19 with 19 deep layers, winning the ImageNet challenge of 2014\
    \ [38]. These deeper\nnetworks use smaller stacked kernels and have lower memory\
    \ during inference, which improves\nthe performance of mobile computing devices,\
    \ such as smartphones [39]. Later, in 2015, the ResNet\narchitecture won the ImageNet\
    \ challenge and was made up of the ResNet blocks. The residual blocks\nlearn the\
    \ residuals and pre-processes the learning mapping for each layer, thereby providing\
    \ eﬀective\ntraining performance for deeper architectures. Szegedy et al. (2016)\
    \ developed a 22-layer neural\nnetwork referred as GoogLeNet, which employed the\
    \ inception blocks [40]. The advantage of using the\ninception blocks is that\
    \ it could increase the training process eﬃciency while decreasing the number\n\
    of parameters. The performance on ImageNet reached saturation after 2014 and crediting\
    \ the better\nperformance to the more complex architectures is biased. On the\
    \ other hand, it is not necessary\nto perform plant stress detection with the\
    \ deeper networks, providing a lower memory footprint.\nTherefore, AlexNet or\
    \ other relatively simple methods, such as VGG16, are still practical for crop\n\
    stress images.\n2.4.2. Segmentation Architectures\nSegmentation is important in\
    \ crop stress image analysis. The pixel in the image could be classiﬁed\nby the\
    \ CNN and the classiﬁed pixel could be presented with patches that extracted from\
    \ neighboring\npixels [41]. The disadvantage of this method is that the input\
    \ patches overlap, and the same convolution\nis repeatedly calculated. Fortunately,\
    \ the linear operators (convolution and dot product) can be written\nas convolutions\
    \ [42]. With a fully connected layer, a CNN can have a larger input image than\
    \ the\ntrained image and can generate a likelihood map instead of the output of\
    \ a pixel. Then, such a full\nconvolutional network can be eﬀectively applied\
    \ to the full input image.\n2.5. Hardware and Software\nThe dramatic increase\
    \ of deep learning applications could be due to the widespread development\nof\
    \ GPUs [43]. GPU computing started when NVIDIA launched CUDA (Computing Uniﬁed\
    \ Device\nArchitecture) and AMD launched Stream. The GPU is a highly parallel\
    \ computing engine which\noﬀers a great advantage compared with a central processing\
    \ unit (CPU). The Open Computing\nLanguage (OpenCL) uniﬁes diﬀerent GPU general\
    \ computing application programming interface\n(API) implementations and provides\
    \ a framework that can be used to write programs that execute on\nAgriEngineering\
    \ 2020, 2\n436\nheterogeneous platforms composed of a CPU and GPU. With the hardware,\
    \ deep learning on the GPU\nis much faster than on the CPU [44].\nOpen source\
    \ software packages also promote the development and application of deep learning.\n\
    These software packages allow users to operate the computing at a high level without\
    \ having to worry\nabout eﬃcient implementation. By far the most popular packages\
    \ include:\nCaﬀé, which oﬀers C++ and python interfaces, developed by graduate\
    \ students at UC Berkeley\nAI Research.\nTensorFlow, which provides C++ and python\
    \ interfaces, developed by Google Brain team.\nTheano, which provides a python\
    \ interface, developed by MILA lab in Montreal.\nPyTorch, which provides C++ and\
    \ python interface, developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab.\n3. Applications\
    \ of Deep Learning in Plant Stress Imaging\n3.1. Classiﬁcation\nDeep learning\
    \ has been applied successfully in plant phenotyping combined with various sensors\n\
    and speciﬁc tasks, including harvesting crop counting, weed control, and crop\
    \ stress detection [17,45–47].\nRegarding crop stress detection, with various\
    \ speciﬁc tasks, the image analysis methods are often\nvarying among classiﬁcation,\
    \ segmentation, and object detection in crop stress detection combined\nwith various\
    \ sensors (Figure 4). Image classiﬁcation is one of the earliest areas where deep\
    \ learning\ncontributed signiﬁcantly to the analysis of plant stress images. In\
    \ crop stress image classiﬁcation, one or\nmore images are usually used as input\
    \ data, and a diagnostic decision is used as output (e.g., healthy\nor diseased).\
    \ In this case, each diagnosis is a sample, and the size of the dataset is usually\
    \ smaller\ncompared to computer vision (thousands or millions of samples). Therefore,\
    \ for such applications,\nthe transfer learning should be popular for researchers.\
    \ Transfer learning essentially uses pre-trained\nnetworks to try to meet the\
    \ needs of deep network training on large datasets. At present, two transfer\n\
    learning methods are commonly applied: (1) the speciﬁc pre-trained network is\
    \ directly applied in\nimages processing, and (2) ﬁne-tuning the speciﬁed pre-trained\
    \ network for the aiming objective\nimages. Another beneﬁt of the former strategy\
    \ is that training a deep network is not necessary, making\nit easy to insert\
    \ the extracted features into existing image analysis pipelines. However, it is\
    \ still a\nchallenge to ﬁnd the best strategy. Barbedo (2019) used a CNN to classify\
    \ individual lesions and spots\non plant leaves instead of considering the entire\
    \ leaf [45]. This identiﬁed multiple diseases that aﬀect\nthe same leaf. The accuracy\
    \ obtained using this method was, on average, 12% higher than that obtained\n\
    using the original image. While proper symptom segmentation is still required\
    \ manually, preventing\nfull automation. Also, in this paper, the authors applied\
    \ deep learning to detect the individual lesions\nand spots for 14 plant species.\
    \ Speciﬁcally, this study used a pre-trained GoogLeNet CNN for training\nthe models.\
    \ The images were split into two groups for addressing diﬀerent objectives. The\
    \ ﬁrst group\nwas aimed to image classiﬁcation, to identify the origin of the\
    \ observed symptom, while the second one\nwas for object detection, which was\
    \ to identify disease areas amidst healthy tissue and to determine if\nsubsequent\
    \ classiﬁcation was conducted or not. The results showed that accuracies obtained\
    \ using this\napproach were, in average, 12% higher than those achieved using\
    \ the original images. The accuracies\nwere higher than 75% for all the considered\
    \ conditions or number of detected diseases, while the author\nalso claimed that\
    \ the resized input images for pre-trained neural network were not as advantageous\
    \ as\nthe original images under certain conditions. Other studies that applied\
    \ the deep learning into the\ncrop stress image classiﬁcation are shown in Table\
    \ 1.\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2\n437\nFigure 4. Applications of deep learning for\
    \ crop stress detection based on diﬀerent image analysis.\n(a) Classiﬁcation (images\

    Segmentation is used to identify the set of pixels or contours that make up the\
    \ target object [70].\nSegmentation is a common topic in papers applying deep\
    \ learning to plant disease imaging.\nVarious methods have been applied to segmentation,\
    \ such as developing unique segmentation\narchitectures based on CNNs and application\
    \ of RNNs. The popular segmentation CNN architectures\ninclude U-Net and Mask\
    \ R-CNN [71]. U-Net was investigated in biomedical image segmentation\nﬁrstly\
    \ [72], which was built upon a fully convolutional network (FCN). FCN is to provide\
    \ one\ncontracting network by continuous layers in which pooling layers are substituted\
    \ by up-sampling\noperators. The continuous layer would learn to gather a more\
    \ precise output, with an increase of\nthe resolution of the output. U-Net is\
    \ symmetric, that is, it has the same number of up-sampling\nand down-sampling\
    \ layers. The skip connections in U-Net use a concatenation operator between the\n\
    up-sampling and down-sampling layers [73]. This method connects the features in\
    \ the contact path\nand the extension path. This means that the entire image is\
    \ enabled to be processed forward through\nU-Net to directly generate a segmentation\
    \ mapping. In this way, U-Net could consider the entire image,\nwhich make it\
    \ more advanced than the patch-based CNN. Furthermore, Çiçek et al. (2016) built\
    \ one\n3D U-Net segmentation by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts\
    \ [74]. Lin et al. (2019)\napplied a U-Net CNN to segment and detect cucumber\
    \ powdery mildew-infected cucumber leaves\nobtained by an RGB sensor [46]. In\
    \ this study, since the powdery mildew-infected pixels were less than\nthat of\
    \ non-infected pixels, the authors proposed binary cross entropy loss function\
    \ to magnify the\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2\n439\nloss value of the powdery mildew-infected\
    \ pixels by 10 times. The results showed that the semantic\nsegmentation CNN model\
    \ achieved an average pixel accuracy of 96.08% for segmenting the diseased\npowdery\
    \ mildew on cucumber leaf images. It was still challenging to apply such deep\
    \ neural network\nin ﬁeld conditions. Diﬀerent applications of deep learning into\
    \ the crop stress image segmentation are\nsummarized in Table 2.\nTable 2. Applications\

    \ region proposals with CNN features. Generally, R-CNN includes\ntwo-stage detection\
    \ procedures. Firstly, the algorithm detects subset regions of an image which\
    \ may\ncontain an object and extracts CNN features from the region proposals.\
    \ Then the object in each region\nis classiﬁed. R-CNN takes a large amount of\
    \ training of the deep neural network when there are\n2000 or more region proposals\
    \ per image that need to be classiﬁed. Meanwhile, there is no learning\nprocedure\
    \ at the ﬁrst searching stage as the selective search algorithm is ﬁxed. As a\
    \ result, it may lead\nto tricky candidate region proposals being generated [80,81].\
    \ During R-CNN processing, the region\nproposals need to be cropped and resized,\
    \ while the Faster R-CNN detector processes the entire\nimage. Thus, Faster R-CNN\
    \ can be applied for real-time object detection. Additionally, Faster R-CNN\n\
    is the backbone of Mask R-CNN. Faster R-CNN includes two outputs, that is, a class\
    \ label and a\nbounding-box oﬀset. A third branch is added to mask R-CNN upon\
    \ faster R-CNN architecture, which\noutputs the object mask [71]. In addition,\
    \ Mask R-CNN is one of the instance segmentation algorithms\nwhich produce a mask\
    \ that uses color or grayscale values to identify pixels belonging to the same\n\
    object. Except to feed the feature map to the region proposal network and the\
    \ classiﬁer, Mask R-CNN\nuses a feature map to predict a binary mask for the object\
    \ inside the bounding box.\n3.3. Object Detection\nObject detection is a key part\
    \ in imaging diagnosis and one of the most laborious tasks.\nTypically, the task\
    \ involves locating and identifying objects throughout the image [82]. For a long\n\
    time, the research goal of computer vision was to automatically detect objects,\
    \ for improving detection\naccuracy, and reducing labor. The object detection\
    \ based on deep learning uses CNN for pixel\nclassiﬁcation and then applies some\
    \ post-processing to obtain object candidates [81–83]. Since the\nimage classiﬁcation\
    \ is to classify each pixel in the image, which is basically equal to object classiﬁcation,\n\
    thereby the CNN architectures of segmentation are alike to those for the classiﬁcation\
    \ task, while the\nimage labels imbalance, hard negative detecting, and eﬃcient\
    \ processing image pixels etc., still remain\nas the challenging issues to be\
    \ addressed for object detection. Fuentes et al., (2017) applied Faster\nR-CNN\
    \ and a VGG-16 detector to recognize tomato plant diseases and pests [55]. Diseases\
    \ and pests\ncould be identiﬁed using the bounding-box and score for each class\
    \ being shown on each infected leaf.\nThat is, the detection method provides a\
    \ solution for detecting the class and location of diseases in\ntomato plants\
    \ practically. R-CNN and Faster R-CNN have been applied to object detection as\
    \ well,\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2\n440\nusing the regions in the image to locate\
    \ the object. Recently, the YOLO algorithm has often been\napplied for object\
    \ detection, which uses a single convolutional network to predict the bounding\
    \ boxes\nand classify such boxes [84]. The YOLO algorithm divides the image into\
    \ an M × M grid, then m\n(m<M) bounding boxes are taken within each of the grids.\
    \ The network yields a class probability\nfor each bounding box. When the bounding\
    \ boxes have higher class probability than a threshold\nvalue, they would be selected\
    \ and applied for locating the objects in the image. The limitation of the\nYOLO\
    \ network is that it sometimes cannot identify small objects in the images [84].\
    \ Singh et al. (2020)\napplied Faster R-CNN with an InceptionResnetV2 model and\
    \ a MobileNet model on PlantVillage\ndatasets to detect plant disease, which included\
    \ 2598 images from 13 plants and over 17 diseases [85].\nOther applications for\
    \ object detection are summarized in Table 3.\nTable 3. Application of deep learning\

    4. Unique Challenges in Plant Stress Based on Imagery\nNoncontact plant stress\
    \ detection has been conducted on diﬀerent application scales, i.e., laboratory,\n\
    ground-based, and UAV. Additionally, the modality has been operated based on a\
    \ variety of sensors,\nsuch as digital, thermal, multispectral, and hyperspectral\
    \ imagery, with diﬀerent numbers of spectral\nchannels, from three to hundreds.\
    \ Such sensors could monitor the size, shape, and structural features\nor crops\
    \ based on the external views obtained from digital cameras. The digital sensors\
    \ could be\neasily operated under the natural light environment. Hyperspectral\
    \ imaging sensors could obtain the\ninside spectral signatures beyond the visible\
    \ wavelength range which could reﬂect the healthy crop\nconditions in a wide range\
    \ of spectra, while most of the commercial hyperspectral imaging sensors\ncould\
    \ only work in laboratory with controlled light conditions at present. On the\
    \ other hand, the wind\nwill make the crops move around. In general, for image\
    \ acquisition, it is still challenging for ﬁeld work.\nFurther, the crops are\
    \ not static:\nthe physiological properties change with their growth.\nEspecially\
    \ for biotic stress infected crops, the fungi or viruses in the crops have great\
    \ impacts\non the physiological changes. It will be diﬃcult to detect the stress\
    \ at an early stage without symptoms\nshowing based on image analysis. Further,\
    \ for the application of deep learning-assisted image analysis,\na lack of datasets\
    \ is a major obstacle as well. At present, the available open source images are\
    \ mainly\nfrom the PlantVillage dataset. On the other hand, one signiﬁcant challenge\
    \ is that of ground-truth\nlabelling, which is hugely laborious. The Amazon SageMaker\
    \ Ground Truth provides a service for\nmanaging the labelling, including two features.\
    \ One is annotation consolidation, which combines\nAgriEngineering 2020, 2\n441\n\
    diﬀerent people’s annotation task results into one high-ﬁdelity label. The second\
    \ one is automated\ndata labeling, which utilizes machine learning to label portions\
    \ of the provided data automatically.\nMoreover, to detect crop stress, the classiﬁcation\
    \ and segmentation are often used as binary\ntasks, i.e., healthy versus infected,\
    \ target infected area versus background. However, since these\ntwo categories\
    \ can be highly heterogeneous, this is usually a general simpliﬁcation. For instance,\n\
    the samples of the healthy class mainly consist of completely healthy objects\
    \ but also rarely few objects\nshowing early stresses. This could lead to classiﬁers\
    \ that are able to exclude the healthy samples but\ncannot identify the few rare\
    \ ones. The strategy for this case is to make a deep learning system with\nmulticlass\
    \ by giving it detailed annotations of all possible classes. Meanwhile, the within-class\
    \ variance\nfrom images may reduce the sensitivity of the deep learning system.\
    \ However, the between-classes\nvariance from a dataset that may not be generalized\
    \ to every image, such as the diﬀerent severity of\ndisease images, can obtain\
    \ a pseudo-deep learning training architecture in one certain experiment,\nbut\
    \ obstruct the usefulness of its broad application to practical decision-making\
    \ unless the nature of\nthis dataset is precisely understood. Parameter optimization\
    \ of the deep learning training models, i.e.,\nbatch size, learning rate, dropout\
    \ rate, etc., is a remaining challenge as well. There is currently no exact\n\
    method to achieve the best combinations of hyperparameters, which is often operated\
    \ empirically,\neven though Bayesian optimization has been put forwarded.\n5.\
    \ Outlook\nDeep learning has been applied successfully in plant stress (i.e.,\
    \ abiotic, and biotic stress) detection\neven though it still has many challenges.\
    \ Most of the papers we have reviewed are based on the 2D\nimages for symptomatic\
    \ stages, for example the digital and greyscale images. Such images could be\n\
    enabled to operate in the deep transfer learning architecture, such as Alexnet,\
    \ VGG, GoogleNet, while\nsuch pre-trained transfer networks could not be applied\
    \ to the 3D datasets, such as hyperspectral\nimages, which are more sensitive\
    \ to detecting the early-infected plants. In the future, deep neural\nnetworks\
    \ that can be used for 3D images should be the focus and early detections of plant\
    \ disease is\npivotal to the precision disease management, especially for diseases\
    \ without therapy using pesticide.\nOn the other hand, many tasks in plant stress\
    \ detection analysis could be granted, such as classiﬁcation,\nand such a strategy\
    \ may not be always optimal since it probably requires some post-processing, such\n\
    as segmentation. Further, semi-supervised and unsupervised deep learning are worthy\
    \ of being\nexploratory in the application of plant stress detection, though most\
    \ of studies are based on supervised\napproaches. The advantage of unsupervised\
    \ methods is that the networks training process could be\noperated without the\
    \ ground truth labels. The unsupervised approach for detecting the plant stress\n\
    are generative adversarial networks (GANs) [90], while another common unsupervised\
    \ approach,\ni.e., variational autoencoders (VAEs), is rarely applied for crop\
    \ disease diagnosis yet based on our\nknowledge [91]. Further, deep learning has\
    \ been applied for other objectives in agricultural imaging,\ne.g., crop load\
    \ estimation and harvesting, while image reconstruction remains unexplored, especially\n\
    for LiDAR point cloud data. In general, deep learning has provided promising results\
    \ in plant stress\ndetection, which could accelerate the development of precision\
    \ agriculture with the extension of\nﬁeld application.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    IEEE Conference Location: Jeju Island, Korea (South) SECTION I. Introduction In
    recent years, in order to improve crop production and quality of agricultural
    operations and to reduce labor’s cost, an “agricultural remote monitoring system”
    for remotely observing the environmental condition of the farm and a “precision
    agriculture” that is a farming management concept based on observing, measuring
    and responding to inter and intra-field variability in crops have been attracting
    a lot of attention. So far, the existing studies have proposed an agricultural
    remote monitoring systems using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and remote sensing
    using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). In the existing WSN-based system, the environmental
    information (e.g., temperature, humidity, illuminance) is collected from a large
    number of sensor nodes installed in the farm using a low-power wireless communications
    (e.g., ZigBee, LPWA). However, in these systems, even when the low-power wireless
    technology is utilized, it is difficult to run permanently on batteries because
    the battery capacity is not infinity. In addition, in the case of a large-scale
    field, a large number of intermediate nodes should be installed in the field,
    hence the installation and operation costs are high. On the other hand, a wireless
    power transfer technology is evolving and equipment which is capable of supplying
    power to places dozens of centimeters away has been available. In addition, UAVs
    that can fly stably for a long time and has a large loading capacity has appeared.
    Therefore, in this study, we propose and develop a wide-area sensing system for
    large-scale farms using UAV, a wireless power transfer technology, and an energy-saving
    short-range wireless communication system (i.e., Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)).
    In the proposed system, the UAV flies autonomously to the location of sensor nodes
    that are widely installed in the large farm for collecting the sensor data. Here,
    the UAV is designed to supply the power to the sensor node to measure and send
    the environmental information using the wireless power transfer technology. The
    combination of the UAV and the wireless power transfer technology not only cover
    a wide area of several kilometers to dozens of kilometers but also eliminates
    the need for periodic battery replacement of the sensor node and reduces the cost
    of operating the system. SECTION II. Related Works and Objectives of Our Study
    A. WSN-based Remote Monitoring System for Agriculture Kassim and Patil have proposed
    and implemented a WSN system to remotely monitor temperature and humidity on the
    farm in real time [1] [2]. In addition, Fitriawan has evaluated performance (e.g.,
    packet loss rate, throughput) of ZigBeebased WSNs in various communication types
    (e.g., one-to-one, many-to-one, multi-hop) and environments (e.g., indoor, outdoor)
    [3] [4]. In these existing studies, a large number of intermediate nodes should
    be installed for constructing a wide area WSN system, which results in high installation
    and operation costs. Especially, it is difficult to construct a wide-area agricultural
    remote monitoring system that covers a range of a few kilometers to dozens of
    kilometers because the throughput decreases as the number of hops in the communication
    path increases. Furthermore, even if the low-power wireless technology such as
    ZigBee and LPWA is utilized, the battery of the sensor node should sometimes be
    replaced because the battery capacity is not infinity. B. UAV-based Remote Sensing
    System In the existing studies, the UAV has been used for supporting agriculture
    [5] [6] [7]. Katsigiannis have used multispectral and thermal cameras to take
    aerial photographs to observe the vegetation and the water stress [8]. In addition,
    Rokhmana have used a high-resolution camera to take and analyze photos of the
    field to understand farmland area and growth variability [9]. However, these studies
    focus on analyzing images using high-priced cameras, and there is no consideration
    for utilizing UAV to efficiently collect environmental information. C. Objectives
    of This Study Based on the problems described in the previous sections, this study
    develops a new sensor network system utilizing the UAV equipped with not only
    a camera but also an embedded system with a short-range wireless communication
    (BLE) and a wireless power transfer module. The BLE module is used to collect
    the environmental information related to crop growth from sensor nodes installed
    at multiple locations of a large farm. In addition, by using wireless power transfer
    technology, the sensor nodes installed on the farm can be run without a battery,
    which eliminates a cost for periodic battery replacement. SECTION III. Proposed
    System Overview of our proposed system is shown in Fig.1. A main component of
    the system is an embedded system which controls flight of a UAV and supports a
    BLE communication and a wireless power transfer, a stationary sensor node which
    collects environmental information (e.g., temperature, humidity, illumination)
    on the farm, and a server that manages and analyzes the data collected by the
    UAV. When the embedded system receives a flight command from a terminal owned
    by the administrator, it sends a control command including the location information
    of the stationary sensor nodes to the UAV. Then, the UAV flies to the location
    of the stationary sensor node, takes a picture of the growth condition of the
    crop on the farm, and lands on the ground near the stationary sensor node. After
    the stationary sensor node is activated by being supplied power from a power transmission
    substrate of the wireless power transfer module mounted on the embedded system,
    It transmits the measured sensor data to the UAV using BLE communication. After
    the UAV finishes acquiring sensor data from all sensor nodes, it returns to the
    start point of the flight and sends the collected sensor data and the image pictures
    to the server via HTTP communication through wireless LAN. The server manages
    and analyzes the data received from the UAV, and provides the visualized data
    to the browser of the smartphone, tablet, and PC browsers. Fig. 1. Overview of
    Proposed System Show All Table I UAV Specifications A. Device/Functional Structure
    of the Proposed System In the following sections, we explain device and functional
    structure of the main components of the proposed system: a UAV with an embedded
    system, a stationary sensor node and a server. 1) UAV with Embedded System Device
    configuration of the embedded system is shown in Fig.2 and the appearance of the
    UAV is shown in Fig.3. The proposed system uses 3D Robotics’s 3DR SoLo as a UAV,
    which is capable of stable flight based on GPS coordinate and can be controlled
    by receiving the commands from the embedded system through the wireless LAN. The
    main specifications of the UAV are shown in Teb.I. In addition, the embedded system
    on the UAV is based on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, which is a single-board computer
    supporting Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The UAV operates as an access point for a wireless
    LAN, and the embedded system connects to the UAV through the wireless LAN and
    controls the flight function of the UAV. This structure allows the embedded system
    to control the UAV even when the UAV flies away from the administrator beyond
    the limit of the communication distance of the wireless LAN. The embedded system
    is equipped with a Raspberry Pi Camera V2, an inexpensive camera module for capturing
    images of the lower part of the UAV, a HC-SR04 that is a ultrasonic sensor for
    accurately measuring the altitude of the UAV, and a MQS-1PXD-R1, power transmission
    substrate for supplying power to the stationary sensor nodes using wireless power
    transfer technology. 2) Stationary Sensor Node Device configuration of the stationary
    sensor node is shown in Fig.4 and the appearance is shown in Fig.5. The stationary
    sensor node installed on the farm is composed of a microcontroller supporting
    a BLE communication, Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express. The microcontroller is
    equipped with a temperature and humidity sensor, and an illuminance sensor. In
    addition, the stationary sensor node is connected with a power receiving substrate
    of the wireless power transfer module, and is activated by a power supply from
    the UAV. After activated by the UAV, it measures the sensor data, and sends the
    measured sensor data to the UAV using BLE communication. The packet format of
    the sensor data is shown in Teb.II. Fig. 2. Device Configuration of Embedded System
    Show All Fig. 3. Appearance of UAV Show All 3) Server In the proposed system,
    we use a standard PC server as the server. The server centrally manages data of
    the environmental information on the farm and the images of crops using MySQL,
    and analyzes the data and images received from the embedded system to estimate
    the crop growth and weather conditions. Furthermore, it executes the HTTP server
    to provide the visualized data to the browser of the smartphone, tablet device,
    and PC so that the administrator can easily understand the condition of the farm.
    B. Algorithm for Autonomous Flight 1) Sensor Data Collection Using Wireless Power
    Transfer In this proposed system, the UAV is controlled based on the GPS coordinate
    and the result of the analysis of the image captured by the camera connected to
    the UAV so that it can land correctly on the stationary sensor node. After that,
    by supplying electric power from the UAV to the stationary sensor node using the
    wireless power transfer technology, the stationary sensor node can be configured
    without a battery. Fig. 4. Device Configuration of Stationary Sensor Node Show
    All Fig. 5. Appearance of Stationary Sensor Node Show All The flight and data
    acquisition procedure of the UAV is shown in Fig.6. First of all, when the UAV
    with the embedded system receives a flight control command that includes coordinate
    of the stationary sensor nodes from the administrator, it flies and moves to the
    position just above the stationary sensor node based on the GPS coordinate. The
    accuracy of coordinate measured by the GPS of the UAV is about 2 meters, hence
    the distance between the UAV and the sensor node is within the range of the BLE
    communication if the UAV is landed simply based on the coordinate of the GPS.
    However, if the UAV is apart such a distance from the stationary sensor node,
    it cannot supply enough power to the stationary sensor node to activate the measurement
    and BLE communication functions. Therefore, the embedded system analyzes the images
    taken by the camera mounted on the lower part of the UAV and controls the UAV
    using the landing algorithm of feedback control (see Section III.B.2) so that
    the UAV can land just above the stationary sensor node. At this time, if the distance
    between the power transmission substrate in the UAV and the power receiving substrate
    connected to the stationary sensor node is sufficiently short, power is supplied
    from the UAV to the stationary sensor node. Table II Packet Format of Environmental
    Information Fig. 6. Procedure for Acquiring Sensor Data Show All 2) Feedback Control
    of UAV Using Image Analysis After arriving in the sky above the sensor node based
    on the GPS coordinate, if the embedded system detects the shape of the power receiving
    substrate in the image taken by the camera, the UAV horizontally moves so that
    the power receiving substrate appears at the central point of the image. This
    process is repeated while lowering the altitude of the UAV until the wireless
    power transfer can be started. If the embedded system cannot detect the power
    receiving substrate in the captured image, the UAV increases the altitude and
    takes the image again. The detection procedure of the power receiving substrate
    is described below. In this study, in order to make the detection easier, a 25cm
    × 25cm piece of red drawing paper is pasted on the surface of the power receiving
    substrate of the sensor node, and the power receiving substrate is detected by
    applying color extraction and rectangular extraction process to the original images.
    First, the embedded system uses the color extraction based on the HSV model to
    extract only pixels of a specific color from the image. Next, the embedded system
    executes the rectangular extraction process for the pixels that are extracted
    by the color extraction process and calculates the center coordinate of the power
    receiving substrate. An example of the extraction process is shown in Fig.7. Next,
    the embedded system calculates the horizontal movement distance between the UAV
    and the central point of the sensor node, and moves to the position just above
    the sensor node. The actual distance per pixel in the image varies with the altitude
    of the UAV as shown in Fig.8. Therefore, the embedded system calculates the actual
    distance per pixel from the angle of view of the camera and the altitude of the
    UAV, and then calculates the horizontal distance to the center coordinate of the
    power receiving substrate. Here, the current altitude can be measured using a
    barometric pressure sensor which is standardly installed on the UAV, but the sensor
    cannot accurately measure the altitude. Therefore, the ultrasonic sensor is used
    to measure the altitude after the altitude of the UAV reaches the measurement
    range of the ultrasonic sensor (i.e., 3 meters). After that, the UAV lowers the
    altitude and is moved to the direction of the stationary sensor node for the calculated
    distance. This process is repeated until the distance is close enough to supply
    power to the sensor node using the wireless power transfer. Fig. 7. Example of
    Extraction Process Show All Fig. 8. Relationship Between Distance and Number of
    Pixels Show All SECTION IV. Performance Evalulation of Wireless Power Transfer
    In this section, we conduct preliminary experiments to evaluate the power supply
    performance of the wireless power transfer module used in this proposed system.
    A. Magnitude of Current Supplied by Wireless Power Transfer First, the magnitude
    of current supplied from the power transmission substrate to the power receiving
    substrate during wireless power transfer is investigated. In the proposed system,
    the power is supplied by the power transmission substrate with 1W/5V output when
    approaching the power receiving substrate of 40cm square. At this time, the amount
    of current supplied to the power receiving substrate is expected to vary depending
    on the distance between the substrates and the positional relationship. Therefore,
    the magnitude of current supplied in various positional relationships is measured.
    The experiment is conducted in a flat area in a room at Ritsumeikan University,
    where there is no metal around. In the experiment, the height of the power transmission
    substrate is fixed at 0, 2 and 4cm from the floor. The power transmission substrate
    is moved from the center of the power receiving substrate by every 1 cm in the
    lateral and diagonal directions as shown in Fig.9, and the magnitude of current
    supplied is measured at each point. Fig. 9. Evaluation of Wireless Power Transfer
    Module Show All Fig. 10. Evaluation of Wireless Power Transfer Module(lateral)
    Show All The results of the experiments when moving the power transmission substrate
    in the lateral and diagonal directions are shown in Figs.10 and 11, respectively.
    These figures show the relationship between the distance between the power transmission
    and receiving substrates and the magnitude of current. As shown in these figures,
    after the distance between the substrates increases beyond a certain distance,
    the magnitude of current supplied tends to decrease. In addition, the magnitude
    of current significantly decreases when the power transmission substrate passes
    near the edge of the receiving substrate (around 20cm in x-axis) because the coils
    are crowded around the periphery of the power receiving substrate and it is not
    possible to generate a stable induction current due to the positional relationship.
    By confirming the actual operation of the BLE module used in the proposed system,
    it is clarified that the module works fine within 31cm from the center of the
    power receiving substrate, except for the 20cm area mentioned above, when the
    height of the power transmission substrate is 2cm. Therefore, we can conclude
    that the UAV can provide sufficient power to the BLE module using the wireless
    power transfer by landing within an area of 62cm square. B. Packet Loss Rate during
    Wireless Power Transaction In this study, we prototype a stationary sensor node
    using the BLE module and evaluate the communication performance during wireless
    power transfer. This experiment is conducted in the ground at Ritsumeikan University.
    Fig. 11. Evaluation of Wireless Power Transfer Module(diagonal) Show All In this
    experiment, the stationary sensor node repeatedly transmits the packet of 20 bytes
    (maximum packet size of BLE) to the embedded system on the UAV 100 times during
    a wireless power transfer. This measurement is performed when the power transmission
    substrate is placed at various points within an area (i.e., 62cm square) where
    the wireless power transfer is successful. In the experiment, the embedded system
    can correctly receive all data packets with no data corruption or missing. Thus,
    it can be clarified that the wireless power transfer is useful to operate the
    stationary sensor node for collecting the environmental information. SECTION V.
    Performance Evalulation of Landing Control Algorithm In this section, we develop
    an embedded system installed on the UAV, and conduct a demonstration experiment
    to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed landing control algorithm. A. Detection
    Accuracy of the Stationary Sensor Node by Image Analysis In this experiment, We
    firstly evaluate detection accuracy of the power receiving substrate of the stationary
    sensor node by image analysis. This experiment is conducted in the ground at Ritsumeikan
    University, and the altitude of the UAV is raised at 5m intervals and 20 images
    are taken at each altitude. Then, the images are analyzed for detecting the shape
    of the power receiving substrate, and the detection accuracy is evaluated at each
    altitude. Figure 12 shows the relationship between the altitude of the UAV and
    the detection rate of the stationary sensor node. From this figure, the detection
    rate tends to decrease as the altitude of the UAV increases. In addition, the
    detection rate of sensor nodes is stable when the altitude of the UAV is lower
    or equal to 20 meters. However, when the altitude exceeds 25 meters, the accuracy
    markedly decreases because the different objects can be detected as the sensor
    nodes. Here, when the altitude of the UAV is 20 meters, the image taken by the
    camera module can capture an area of about 20 meters square. Therefore, even if
    the measurement error of the GPS coordinate is about 5 meters, it is possible
    to keep the stationary sensor node within the angle of view of the camera module
    by navigating the UAV based on the GPS coordinate. Fig. 12. Detection Accuracy
    of the Sensor Nodes Using Image Analysis Show All Fig. 13. Effectiveness of Feedback
    Control using Image Analysis Show All B. Landing Accuracy of Feedback Control
    Algorithm In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed feedback control
    algorithm, we compare the performance between the proposed algorithm and the simple
    GPS-based navigation in terms of the distance between the landing point and the
    center point of the sensor node. In addition, we confirm whether the wireless
    power transfer succeeds a landing point in each algorithm. This experiment is
    conducted on the same ground as the previous sections. The sensor node is installed
    at a position 30 meters away from the takeoff point of the UAV, and the UAV is
    controlled by the embedded system to land near the sensor node. In this evaluation,
    ten trials are performed for each method and the distance between the power transmission
    substrate and the power receiving substrate at the landing point is measured.
    Figure 13 shows the box plot of the measured distance in each method. As shown
    in this figure, the proposed method achieves an accurate navigation of the UAV,
    and the UAV can land on the position where the wireless power transfer is succeeded
    (i.e., the distance is shorter than 31 cm) with high probability. As a result,
    the proposed method landed in a position where wireless power transfer could be
    successful 6 times out of 10 trials. In the future, the feedback algorithm will
    be enhanced so that the landing procedure is repeated until the UAV can receive
    sensor data after landing. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this study, we have proposed
    a new sensor network system that autonomously collects data related to crop growth
    from sensor nodes installed in multiple points scattered over a vast farm. For
    eliminating the need for periodic battery replacement of the sensor node and reduces
    the cost of operating the system, the UAV flies over a vast farm and the stationary
    sensor nodes are operated using wireless power transfer from the UAV. Through
    the experimental evaluation using the developed system, it has been confirmed
    that the UAV can accurately be controlled by the proposed feedback control to
    land near the sensor nodes, and that the sensor nodes can be operated by the wireless
    power transfer from the embedded system of the UAV. In the future, we will consider
    enhancement of the feedback control algorithm so that the wireless power transfer
    is always succeeded and will propose a method to estimate the crop growth by collecting
    and analyzing sensor data during the actual crop growth stage. I would like to
    thank Mr. Toshio Masuyama for his cooperation in the study of wireless power supply
    technology. This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19H04103.

    maturity of wireless technologies and the growing popularity of sensor technology
    in our daily life have created fascinating possibilities in the field of Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN). One of the most critical fields of WSN is how effective
    is the data collection model in such a network. The goal is to ensure data collection
    consistency and reliability while attempting to conserve the power consumption
    within the network. We are proposing a balanced data collection model that can
    be setup on random or controlled WSN deployment that can meet different levels
    of reliability requirements while balancing power consumption across the network.
    The proposed model utilizes an optimization heuristic to achieve a set of system-defined

    of Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more
    April 03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,

    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning

    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory

    FR2-2 Short-Range Communications for... Yusuke Koda and 3 more April 02, 2024
    This paper proposes a comprehensive 3GPPcnaompatible channel model with statistical
    enhancement tailored for indoor short-range device-to-device (D2D) communications
    operating in the frequency range (FR) of 52.6-71.0 GHz termed FR2-2. Regardless
    of the existence of various channel models at this band for indoor communications,
    there will be a need for developing a channel model compatible with and understandable
    from the current 3GPP stochastic channel model (SCM) to facilitate the discussion
    in the 3GPP for developing such FR2-2 short-range D2D communication framework
    based on the fifthgeneration (5G) new radio (NR). Indeed, such a futuristic vision
    can be foreseen from the fact that the 3GPP is discussing the evolution of sidelink,
    referred to as a D2D communication framework; however, there are no 3GPP SCM-compatible
    channel models applicable to FR2-2 short-range D2D communications. To fill this
    void, we propose the channel model coined 3GPPCompFR2-InS that allows us to generate
    channel impulse responses (CIR) for computer simulations, which is suitable for
    various indoor short-range D2D communication scenarios while retailing the similarity
    in terms of the implementation policy of the 3GPP SCM. 3GPPCompFR2-InS is verified
    based on the real-world measurements at the 60 GHz band from the viewpoint of
    both the validity of the channel model parameters and that of the statistical
    behavior of the generated CIRs. Effective media models for wave propagation in
    prestressed fractured rocks with nonli... Li-Yun Fu and 3 more April 02, 2024
    Stress-induced progressive deformations in fractured rocks with increasing effective
    pressure generally undergo nonlinear elastic (due to the closure of compliant
    pores), hyperelastic (due to residual stress), and inelastic (due to fracture
    growth) deformations prior to mechanical failure. Wave propagation in such rocks
    involves the complex interaction of fracture-and stress-induced changes in both
    velocity and anisotropy. With attention to nonlinear elastic and hyperelastic
    deformations, we incorporate acoustoelasticity into the traditional Hudson/Cheng
    models to describe the coupling of fracture-induced and stress-induced anisotropies.
    The resulting acoustoelastic Hudson model (AHM) is valid for the crack density
    smaller than 0.1 whereas the Padé AHM could handle higher crack densities. We
    extend the Padé AHM to consider the stress-induced crack closure with nonlinear
    elastic deformations by incorporating the dual-porosity model. These models approach
    the coupled anisotropies with different accuracies and computational complexities.
    The plane-wave analyses and effective-moduli calculations of stressed fractured
    rocks with varying crack densities determine the accuracy of these models under
    the isotropic (confining) and anisotropic (uniaxial and pure shear) prestress
    conditions. The relevant Thomsen parameters are applied to experimental data to
    validate the applicability. Finite-difference simulations are implemented to identify
    the contribution of different anisotropies through the variety of wavefronts,
    depending on fracture orientation, crack density, prestress mode and magnitude,
    and loading direction. Particular attention is paid to the anisotropic prestress,
    where the coupled anisotropies are constructive or destructive interference, strongly
    related to the relativity between fracture strike and loading direction. The stress-induced
    crack closure will reduce the fracture anisotropy so that the stress-induced background
    anisotropy dominates the shape of wavefronts with increasing prestress. Security
    and Reliability Performance of a Cooperative Network with Self-Sustaining No...
    Amit Patel and 1 more April 02, 2024 In this paper, we analyze the secrecy performance
    of a two-hop cooperative network consisting solely of energy-harvesting self-sustaining
    nodes drawing energy from a multi-antenna power beacon (PB). Performance of such
    networks is quite different from that with powered nodes. We consider optimal
    combining of the direct and relayed signals at the multi-antenna destination as
    well as the multi-antenna eavesdropper. Since availability of channel state information
    at the source is impractical in such networks, we assume fixed-rate signaling.
    To implement incremental signaling, we utilize feedback bits from the destination.
    Assuming practical nonlinear EH, exact and approximate expressions are derived
    for the secrecy outage probability of the selective decode-and-forward (SDF) and
    the incremental decode-and-forward (IDF) relaying schemes. It is demonstrated
    that IDF has much better secrecy performance than SDF just as with powered nodes.
    However, unlike with powered nodes, the secrecy performance is a convex function
    of the transmit power of PB. We propose a novel power back-off scheme to improve
    secrecy under different network operating conditions. The security-reliability
    trade-off (SRT) is analyzed to highlight the trade-off between outage and secrecy
    performance with the power back-off scheme. Simulation results validate the analytical

    is a key mechanism for meeting the ever-increasing demand for emerging wireless
    services. DSA involves managing and assigning available spectrum resources in
    a way that minimizes interference and allows RF coexistence between heterogeneous
    devices and systems. Spectrum Consumption Models (SCMs)-defined in the IEEE 1900.5.2
    standard, offer a mechanism for RF devices to: (i) declare the characteristics
    of their intended spectrum use and their interference protection needs; and (ii)
    determine compatibility (non-interference) with existing devices. In this paper,
    we propose a novel SCM-based Spectrum Deconfliction (SD) algorithm that dynamically
    configures RF operational parameters (e.g., center frequency and transmission
    power) of a target transmitter-receiver pair aiming to minimize interference with
    existing devices/systems. We also propose sequential and distributed DSA methods
    that use the SD algorithm for assigning spectrum in large-scale networks. To evaluate
    the performance of our methods in terms of computation time, spectrum assignment
    efficiency, and overhead, we use two custom-made simulation platforms. Finally,
    to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of our methods, we build a proof-of-concept
    implementation in the NSF PAWR COSMOS wireless testbed. The results reveal the
    advantages of using SCMs and their capabilities to conduct spectrum assignments
    in dynamic and congested communication environments. Advanced Cardiovascular Health
    in a Quantum AI-driven Healthcare Framework Sarvapriya M Tripathi and 2 more April
    02, 2024 With the advent of Healthcare 4.0, there is increased interest from researchers
    the world over in the application of modern, cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI) algorithms in solving healthcare
    challenges. The era of Quantum Computing (QC) promises to bring significant advancements
    in several areas of healthcare such that it may be sensible to give this hybrid
    Quantum/Classical paradigm its own name-Healthcare4Q. The potential of QC will
    extend the reach of Healthcare4Q with the help of diverse technologies such as
    quantum-enabled wearables, quantum-secure transfer and storage of data, and quantum
    computing at edge, fog, and cloud. All of these technologies promise to catapult
    Healthcare4Q to become the most capable healthcare framework in the advancement
    of medical innovations and improvement of patient care. An integral part of a
    person''s health lies in cardiovascular health, and thus prioritizing and optimizing
    cardiovascular health remains vital to the broader goals of public health and
    healthcare sustainability. In this study, under the paradigm of Healthcare4Q,
    we propose a framework called the Quantum AIdriven Heart Health Framework (QAIHHF)
    that can provide advanced predictive intelligence to healthcare providers by utilizing
    historical and real-time data and processing capabilities proposed in Healthcare4Q.
    We show that when applied to various diagnostics and health indicators such as
    ECG data, the Quantum AI provides accuracy at a level equal to or higher as compared
    to the classical methods thus proving itself to be the critical component that
    will herald the era of Healthcare4Q. QCDC-DR-GA: Optimizing Container Loading
    and Unloading through Dual-Cycling and Docky... Md. Mahfuzur Rahman and 4 more
    April 01, 2024 This paper addresses the optimization of container unloading and
    loading operations at ports, integrating quaycrane dual-cycling (QCDC) with dockyard
    rehandle minimization. We present a unified model encompassing both operations:
    ship container unloading and loading by quay crane, and the other is reducing
    dockyard rehandles while loading the ship. We recognize that optimizing one aspect
    in isolation can lead to suboptimal outcomes due to interdependencies. Specifically,
    optimizing unloading sequences for minimal operation time may inadvertently increase
    dockyard rehandles during loading and vice versa. To address this NP-hard problem,
    we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) QCDC-DR-GA comprising 1dimensional
    and 2-dimensional GA components. Our model, QCDC-DR-GA, consistently outperforms
    four state-of-the-art methods in maximizing dual cycles and minimizing dockyard
    rehandles. Compared to those methods, it reduced 15-20% of total operation time
    for large vessels. Results underscore the inefficiency of separately optimizing
    QCDC and dockyard rehandles. Fragmented approaches, such as QCDC Scheduling Optimized
    by bi-level GA and GA-ILSRS (Scenario 2), show limited improvement compared to
    QCDC-DR-GA. As in GA-ILSRS (Scenario 1), neglecting dual-cycle optimization leads
    to inferior performance than our proposed QCDC-DR-GA. A Two-Stage Passive Matrix
    Addressing Method for Large-Scale Beam-Steering Arrays PengYuan Wang April 01,
    2024 This letter proposes a passive matrix addressing method to dramatically reduce
    the number of controlling (biasing) lines for large-scale beam-steering arrays.
    Phase shifting of each radiation element is accomplished in two stages by the
    row and column biasing lines located at two stacked layers, which offer a pair
    of orthogonal wave vectors. For an antenna array with M rows and N columns, conventional
    direct addressing designs need M * N biasing lines, while the proposed method
    needs only M+N biasing lines to complete the full-space beam-steering. The proposed
    method simplifies the routing of control lines and the design of driving circuits.
    Both theoretical and numerical analyses are provided to validate this method.
    Efficient Twiddle Factor Generation for Post Quantum Cryptography FALCON-based
    Number... Ghada Alsuhli and 4 more April 01, 2024 Area and power-efficient hardware
    implementations are crucial for the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography
    (PQC) algorithms like FALCON. One of the main operations in FALCON is the Number
    Theoretic Transform (NTT), which needs to be performed with many prime numbers.
    Having one set of twiddle factors (TFs) for each prime makes storing all of these
    TFs impractical. In this paper, we propose an architecture for generating TFs
    on the fly for FALCON-oriented NTT, designed for area and power efficiency. Our
    approach dynamically generates TFs during NTT computations, significantly reducing
    on-chip memory requirements. The ASIC implementation results demonstrate significant
    improvements, with the proposed design reducing on-chip memory requirements by
    99%, occupying 95% less area, and consuming 87.4% less power compared to the traditional
    ROM-based implementation. Furthermore, our design achieved a much higher maximum
    clock frequency, indicating superior performance in accessing twiddle factors.
    These findings highlight the potential of our proposed architecture for efficient
    hardware implementations of FALCON-based cryptographic systems. Enhancing Renewable
    Energy-Grid Integration by Optimally Placed FACTS Devices: The Ni... Nnaemeka
    Sunday Ugwuanyi and 5 more April 01, 2024 The global shift towards renewable energy
    (RE) sources, driven by climate change and fossil fuel depletion, encounters challenges
    in integrating intermittent sources like wind and solar power into existing grids.
    Developing countries, such as Nigeria, with weak grids, face significant limitations
    on RE penetration. This study focuses on enhancing RE grid integration in Nigeria
    by strategically deploying Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System (FACTS)
    devices. Results obtained from the Nigerian grid indicate that FACTS devices,
    particularly STATCOMs, can extend the penetration limit by 40%, enabling an additional
    152 MW of wind energy to be integrated without jeopardizing system stability.
    Improved voltage profiles and enhanced stability highlight the effectiveness of
    FACTS devices in facilitating RE integration into weak grids. Thus, developing
    grids can accommodate more renewable energy without extensive reconfiguration
    of the power system architecture. Doppler Shift Distribution in Satellite Constellations
    Akram Al-Hourani April 01, 2024 Doppler shift has significant implications in
    Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations due to the rapid relative movement of satellites.
    This paper presents a novel approach based on stochastic geometry to capture the
    statistical distribution of Doppler shift in modern mega satellite constellations.
    We derive a simplified expression for both the Doppler shift s-curve and its maximum
    value, highlighting the dependency of Doppler shifts on the zenith angle of the
    closest approach during a satellite pass. Additionally, we present a stochastic
    model for the distribution of these zenith angles within the random constellation
    model. Furthermore, the statistical distribution of the Doppler bound is analytically
    formulated and validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations of two major
    satellite constellations currently in orbit. Effect of Presenting Stiffness of
    Robot Hand to Human on Human-Robot Handovers Junya Yamamoto and 2 more April 01,
    2024 In the present study, we focus on the object handover task as a major example
    of collaborative work between a human and a robot. To achieve a smooth handover
    between two different agents, their mutual communication is indispensable for
    understanding the other’s intentions. However, previous research has not dealt
    with a moment during handover in which a robot takes the object from a human grasp
    or in which a robot hands the object to the human. It should be noted that the
    performance during those phases is crucial to the success or failure of the tasks
    because slight changes in the kinematics of the relationship between hands or
    fingers and object result in significant changes in grasping status: the human
    may forcibly pull out the object while the robot is grasping it or drop the object.
    Therefore, this study aims to realize a smooth handover between a human and a
    robot, focusing on the moment of object handover. To this end, this paper proposes
    to present the stiffness of the robot hand to the human. We conducted the subject
    experiments to investigate the effect of this method on humans in the human-robot
    interaction. Experimental results show that this presentation method enables the
    worker to recognize the stiffness of the robot, which is difficult to recognize
    visually, thereby reducing the workload and allowing the worker to respond seamlessly
    to changes in the robot’s stiffness. VABAM: Variational Autoencoder for Amplitude-based
    Biosignal Augmentation within Morp... Junetae Kim and 2 more April 01, 2024 Pulsatile
    physiological signals, characterized by rhythmic fluctuations, are vital for assessing
    health conditions and are widely used in wellness devices and medical equipment.
    Despite their significance, models addressing domain-specific unmet needs and
    considerations have not been developed as much as in other fields. Therefore,
    building on the foundation of variational autoencoders, we introduce VABAM, a
    novel model for the amplitude-based synthesis of pulsatile physiological signals.
    The uniqueness of VABAM lies in its ability to maintain the morphological identity
    of signals throughout the synthesis process, achieved by integrating pass filter
    effects within the variational autoencoder architecture. To assess the effectiveness
    of the model, we developed three novel metrics based on joint mutual information.
    These metrics were aimed at evaluating the disentanglement of latent spaces, influence
    of ancillary information on signal morphologies, and controllability of amplitude-based
    synthesis within morphological identities. Comparative analyses demonstrated that
    VABAM and its variants were notably effective at preserving morphological integrity,
    highlighting their potential to minimize morphological distortions in physiological
    signal processing and their compatibility with artificial intelligence models
    employing frequency and amplitude features. Additionally, the proposed metrics,
    compatible with probabilistic models, were empirically proven to capture the characteristics
    of various models from multiple perspectives. ← Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 … 508

    Abstract

    Kenya is a developing country with a population of 47,213,282 people this

    comprises of 56% low-income earners. Small businesses and crop production

    represent 23% of the income within the country, which is at risk as soils become

    less productive. Various factors have led to this, climate change and land overuse

    being leading causes. Without adaptation, the rural to urban migration will

    continue to increase.

    Through Internet of Things (IoT) and speciﬁcally wireless sensor networks,

    we can change how we obtain and consume information. Small-scale farmers can

    collect data and in exchange receive useful information about their soils, temper-

    ature, humidity, and moisture content hence make better choices during crop

    production. Connected end devices bring in data, which is currently sparse in

    relation to small-scale farming. IoT will enable analysis and informed

    decision-making including crop selection, support equipment, fertilizers, irriga-

    tion, and harvesting. The cloud-based analysis will provide information useful
    for

    policy making and improvement.

    This paper presents a wireless sensor network (WSN) in mesh topography

    using XBee communication module, communication, and raspberry pi, combined

    with a cloud-based data storage and analysis. We successfully set up a proof of

    concept to test a sensor node that sends information to a RPi and onto an online

    visualization platform.

    Introduction: Background on Kitui County, Kenya

    Kitui County is one of Kenya’s 47 counties located in the lower eastern region
    of the

    country. The county has eight subcounties, namely, Kitui Central, Kitui South,
    Kitui

    East, Kitui Rural, Kitui West, Mwingi North, Mwingi West, and Mwingi Central.

    There are three livelihood zones in the county, marginal mixed farming, mixed

    farming livelihood zone, and formal employment, contributing 44%, 52%, and 4%

    of the population, respectively. The county has a population of 1,136,187 (Kenya

    National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) 2019) people and covers an area of 30,570

    square kilometers, of which 6,370 square kilometers is covered by Tsavo National

    Park (Magee et al. 2017). A large part of this County constitutes arid and semiarid

    land, and therefore over 50% of the population practice mixed farming and hence

    cultivate small pieces of land, and therefore the farming is heavily dependent
    on

    rainfall.

    Climate Change and its Impact in the Region

    Africa is considered to be one continent with the highest growth in population
    at 3%

    annually (IMF 2019). It is projected that by the year 2050, it will constitute
    about

    25% of the world population (World Bank 2019). In addition, the mortality rate
    has

    reduced thereby straining available resources. Sustaining this growth has led
    to

    increase in social problems like rural to urban migration and lower yield in the

    2

    J. Mbandi and M. Kisangari

    food basket among others. As a result the majority of the active working force
    has

    moved to cities and towns to look for alternative sources of income.

    The smallholder farmers have not been inﬂuenced by the “Green Revolution” as

    they have continued with the practice of nonuse of chemical fertilizers, pesticides,

    and genetically modiﬁed organisms. These inherent practices are referred to as

    “traditional farming.” (Onwonga and Freyer 2006). In more recent years, farmers

    have become more reliant on extension ofﬁcers. With the devolution of government

    services, extension ofﬁcers have become few in some areas and highly concentrated

    in others (Franzel et al. 2014). These ofﬁcers are expected to visit farmers to
    provide

    advisory services. It is usually tedious and time-consuming for both the farmer
    and

    the ofﬁcer. There is thus need to investigate and keep record of weather conditions

    for better decision-making for small-scale famers who are the backbone of the

    economy in Kitui County (Magee et al. 2017). In addition assessment of cumulative

    health risk is a challenge in real-world situations because of limited data available
    for

    place and population-related pollution exposure (Solomon et al. 2016). With con-

    tinued primary data collection, it is possible to create models that are more
    accurate

    in relation to this region.

    The current weather stations within the country are a lot more concentrated in
    one

    half of the country and not so much on the other half. See map below (Fig. 1).

    This study proposes to use a raspberry pi (RPi), a microcomputer quite popular

    now with IoT devices; it is of low-cost and easily adaptable to various conditions.

    The XBee is able to transmit information within short-range communication with

    very good accuracy and also low-power utilization and low-costs. The other parts
    of

    the paper will discuss methodology for the data collection, data transmission,

    storage, and visualization.

    Other Studies

    Studies have been done in agriculture and in pollution; however there is dearth
    in a

    studies combining pollution monitoring and agricultural parameters data collection.

    A review of previous studies has shown a gap in combination of these parameters

    which are of use to small-scale farming (Rehman et al. 2011) developed a WSAN

    with sensor and actuator nodes to provide controlled water supply; this is very

    geared toward precision agriculture. In 2016 (Raja et al. 2016) used various types

    of sensors to monitor temperature and moisture values of the soil. The data was

    shared to a central station periodically and concentrated on soil data. A similar
    study

    was undertaken in 2015 by (C and S 2015). This study builds on work done by

    (Rehman et al. 2011) where remote monitoring was done for data collection and

    information shared with research facilities (Vatsal and Bhavin 2017). Worked on
    a

    system showing real-time temperature and relative humidity and once again only

    concentrated in agricultural information for display locally.

    There are several systems designed for precision agriculture. They, however,

    mostly solve the problem of irrigation or temperature control. Those in environment

    solve data collection challenges, while those in agriculture solve a single or
    at most

    two challenges.

    Methodology

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is described as connecting everyday objects via sensors

    and actuators to the Internet where the devices are intelligently linked together

    enabling new forms of communication between things and people and between

    things themselves. This technology has advanced rapidly in the last few years
    and

    has become quite popular in environment monitoring. The basic concept is illus-

    trated in the ﬁgure below (Fig. 2).

    IoT offers new and innovative ways to monitor and manage remote operations. “It

    allows having eyes and ears in remote places, constantly feeding applications
    and

    data stores with information. The low-cost of ‘things’ allows observing and

    Fig. 2 Basic parts of an IoT system

    managing activities that were previously out of reach. With the Internet of Things,
    it

    is also possible to collect information about events that were once invisible,
    such as

    correlating weather patterns with industrial production” (“IoT in action – Towards

    Data Science” 2020). The advancement in wireless sensor networks is used in

    monitoring and controlling of various aspect in an agricultural ﬁeld. In the same

    light, weather aspects for a station ﬁeld. A wireless sensor network is composed
    of

    hardware and software. These are low-cost and low-power smart sensor nodes which

    monitor physical conditions. In our initial prototype test case, we monitored
    tem-

    perature, moisture, and pollution. These nodes can be spread across a large geo-

    graphic area (Fig. 3).

    A node: The main components of a sensor node are a microcontroller, transceiver,

    external memory, power source, and one or more sensors. The controller performs

    tasks, processes data, and controls the functionality of other components in the

    sensor node. The sensor node or mote can be deployed inﬁeld to form wireless

    sensor network for crop management and environment monitoring system (Fig. 4).

    This study uses ZigBee, an IEEE 802.15.4 for the wireless sensor network of

    nodes. It is common in networking standard for personal area networks. The physical

    layer of ZigBee operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical
    radio

    bands of 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2.4 GHz depending on the region. In this study,

    we adopt 2.4 GHz band because it is unlicensed in Kenya. The ZigBee protocol

    mainly focuses on low-cost and low-power consumption. The low-power consump-

    tion characteristic is necessary since sensors are usually placed at a remote
    location

    where battery power supply is virtually the only option. In order to attain a

    low-power consumption characteristic, the ZigBee protocol operates at low data

    rates (250 kbps at 2.4 GHz); this imposes its limitation where high data transmission

    applications are required. From node to the servers, it is thus more realistic
    to use

    other applications, for instance, Wi-Fi (802.11) which offer high data rates.
    This is

    only done from the coordinator node. Depending on the situation and environment,

    the networks can take three forms of topologies: star, cluster tree, and mesh.
    Our

    study uses the mesh topology. A mesh network is accomplished by allowing devices

    in the cluster tree to topology communicate with each other using multiple routes.

    Consequently, the devices are able to send and receive messages reliably even
    when

    their preferred path is down or congested. This is the major advantage of a mesh

    network over star and cluster-tree networks. However, a mesh network has no

    guarantee of bandwidth since no synchronization is used which requires disabling

    of beacon mode (Fig. 5).

    Mesh topology, also referred to as a peer-to-peer network, consists of one

    coordinator, several routers, and end devices. The following are the characteristics

    of a mesh topology: A mesh topology is a multi-hop network; packets pass through

    multiple hops to reach their destination. The range of a network can be increased
    by

    adding more devices to the network. It can eliminate dead zones. A mesh topology
    is

    self-healing, meaning during transmission, if a path fails, the node will ﬁnd
    an

    alternate path to the destination. Devices can be close to each other so that
    they

    use less power. Adding or removing a device is easy. Any source device can

    communicate with any destination device in the network. Compared with star

    topology, mesh topology requires greater overhead. Mesh routing uses a more

    complex routing protocol than a star topology” (“2.3 ZigBee Topologies | Introduc-

    tion to the ZigBee Wireless Sensor and Control Network | InformIT” n.d.).

    System Design

    This study proposes the combination of solving challenges in environment and in

    agriculture with a single system at the same time contributing to data enhancement

    for policy issues in both precision agriculture and pollution primary data.

    The building of pollution stations within the country present a problem of security

    and management. Having these stations placed at small farms and distributed keeps

    them safe. On the other hand, implementation of monitoring stations for local

    farmers is expensive and the communities lack the knowhow of management of

    the information collected. The cloud-based data management platform will provide

    this, while interested stakeholders (policy makers) will support the management
    of

    data. Kitui County is vast and most small farms lack connectivity to the main
    power

    grid. For the system to be self-sustaining in terms of power, the study uses solar

    photovoltaic and rechargeable batteries to power all electrical devices. The system

    incorporates a remote monitoring mechanism through a General Packet Radio

    Service modem to report soil temperature, soil moisture, WSN link performance,

    and photovoltaic power levels.

    Having a system that encompasses data collection and data dissemination pro-

    vides end to end solution for both small-scale farmers and policy makers.

    The general workﬂow of the monitoring system consists of the following:

    1. Taking temperature, humidity, and pollution data (PM 2.5 and PM 10) samples
    at

    predeﬁned time intervals (Sensors)

    2. Reading this data at a local level (Arduino Uno)

    3. Sending data via a coordinator node (Raspberry Pi)

    4. Visualizing data online

    5. Going to sleep

    6. Waking up and repeating the previous steps (Fig. 6)

    Hardware needed for the end point of the system:

    For the sensor node:

    1. Raspberry pi 3B – this is a low-cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs
    into a

    computer monitor or TVand uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable

    little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing and to learn
    how

    to program in languages like Scratch and Python (Raspberrypi.org n.d.)

    2. Arduino UNO – Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-

    use hardware and software (Arduino.cc n.d.)

    3. Humidity and temperature sensor – DHT22 Sensor

    4. Pollution sensor SDS011

    5. Connectors – female-female, male-female, and male-male

    6. Resistors

    Software used in this project:

    1. XTCU – This was used in this system to setup the XBee radios so that they can

    transmit data between each other.

    2. NOOBS – This is the operating system needed to setup a RPi.

    3. Python.

    4. JSON.

    System Implementation and Experiments

    To set up and test this system, the XBee devices were ﬁrst activated and set up
    using

    XCTU (a tool available online for free). They were all coded under the same network

    for ease of communication. The RPi was loaded with the necessary operating system

    (NOOBS) which comes with python – a coding language. In the project we also set

    up the Internet access for the raspberry pi as it acts as the gateway in this
    system.

    On a laptop, we installed Arduino IDE (which is a development platform for

    Arduino boards) and also the sketches to run the two sensors for our prototype.

    JSON here is used as the shell to transfer data in a compact mode from the Arduino

    to the RPi.

    On the RPi we run a program to call the data from the Arduino to the RPi and

    tested the same locally. Finally on ThingSpeak, we added the required APIs and
    run

    the visual data from our system.

    The diagrams below further deﬁne our various steps (Figs. 7 and 8):

    Once the codes were tested and found to be producing steady outputs, we put the

    sensors in a monitored environment – domestic fridge with proper calibration to
    test

    the humidity and temperature parameters and the results were displayed on the
    local

    Arduino software as 169% humidity and 12° Celsius continuously and repeatedly

    (Fig. 9).

    We then transferred the tests to the natural environment and connected the router

    XBee connected to the raspberry pi. We were able to read the results from the

    temperature and humidity sensor as well.

    We also run similar tests on the SDS011 – pollution sensor and obtained a

    consistent ﬂow of results as below.

    Once this was done, we then connected the end nodes to the router node for data

    aggregation. This was done using the python on the raspberry pi and wrapping the

    ﬁle using Json. We could then see our data collected using the IDs EN1, EN2, and

    EN3 from the three Arduino/XBee connected end nodes (Figs. 10, 11, 12, and 13).

    Conclusion

    The phase of the entire project included:

    1. Coming up with a design to collect data from sensors via a sensor node.

    2. Sending the data to an online visualization platform via a control node and
    this

    step has been successful.

    Continuing work in this project involves adding a local database for localized

    data storage and adding a GSM module that allows ease of access of the online
    data

    remotely. The online platform and visualization will also be improved to be more

    robust with a private platform that can be more scalable in the future.

    Abstract

    Kenya is a developing country with a population of 47,213,282 people this

    comprises of 56% low-income earners. Small businesses and crop production

    represent 23% of the income within the country, which is at risk as soils become

    less productive. Various factors have led to this, climate change and land overuse

    being leading causes. Without adaptation, the rural to urban migration will

    continue to increase.

    Through Internet of Things (IoT) and speciﬁcally wireless sensor networks,

    we can change how we obtain and consume information. Small-scale farmers can

    collect data and in exchange receive useful information about their soils, temper-

    ature, humidity, and moisture content hence make better choices during crop

    production. Connected end devices bring in data, which is currently sparse in

    relation to small-scale farming. IoT will enable analysis and informed

    decision-making including crop selection, support equipment, fertilizers, irriga-

    tion, and harvesting. The cloud-based analysis will provide information useful
    for

    policy making and improvement.

    This chapter presents a wireless sensor network (WSN) in mesh topography

    using XBee communication module, communication, and raspberry pi, combined

    with a cloud-based data storage and analysis. We successfully set up a proof of

    concept to test a sensor node that sends information to a RPi and onto an online

    visualization platform.

    Introduction: Background on Kitui County, Kenya

    Kitui County is one of Kenya’s 47 counties located in the lower eastern region
    of the

    country. The county has eight subcounties, namely, Kitui Central, Kitui South,
    Kitui

    East, Kitui Rural, Kitui West, Mwingi North, Mwingi West, and Mwingi Central.

    There are three livelihood zones in the county, marginal mixed farming, mixed

    farming livelihood zone, and formal employment, contributing 44%, 52%, and 4%

    of the population, respectively. The county has a population of 1,136,187 (Kenya

    National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) 2019) people and covers an area of 30,570

    square kilometers, of which 6,370 square kilometers is covered by Tsavo National

    Park (Magee et al. 2017). A large part of this County constitutes arid and semiarid

    land, and therefore over 50% of the population practice mixed farming and hence

    cultivate small pieces of land, and therefore the farming is heavily dependent
    on

    rainfall.

    Climate Change and its Impact in the Region

    Africa is considered to be one continent with the highest growth in population
    at 3%

    annually (IMF 2019). It is projected that by the year 2050, it will constitute
    about

    25% of the world population (World Bank 2019). In addition, the mortality rate
    has

    reduced thereby straining available resources. Sustaining this growth has led
    to

    increase in social problems like rural to urban migration and lower yield in the

    1736

    J. Mbandi and M. Kisangari

    food basket among others. As a result the majority of the active working force
    has

    moved to cities and towns to look for alternative sources of income.

    The smallholder farmers have not been inﬂuenced by the “Green Revolution” as

    they have continued with the practice of nonuse of chemical fertilizers, pesticides,

    and genetically modiﬁed organisms. These inherent practices are referred to as

    “traditional farming.” (Onwonga and Freyer 2006). In more recent years, farmers

    have become more reliant on extension ofﬁcers. With the devolution of government

    services, extension ofﬁcers have become few in some areas and highly concentrated

    in others (Franzel et al. 2014). These ofﬁcers are expected to visit farmers to
    provide

    advisory services. It is usually tedious and time-consuming for both the farmer
    and

    the ofﬁcer. There is thus need to investigate and keep record of weather conditions

    for better decision-making for small-scale famers who are the backbone of the

    economy in Kitui County (Magee et al. 2017). In addition assessment of cumulative

    health risk is a challenge in real-world situations because of limited data available
    for

    place and population-related pollution exposure (Solomon et al. 2016). With con-

    tinued primary data collection, it is possible to create models that are more
    accurate

    in relation to this region.

    The current weather stations within the country are a lot more concentrated in
    one

    half of the country and not so much on the other half. See map below (Fig. 1).

    This study proposes to use a raspberry pi (RPi), a microcomputer quite popular

    now with IoT devices; it is of low-cost and easily adaptable to various conditions.

    The XBee is able to transmit information within short-range communication with

    very good accuracy and also low-power utilization and low-costs. The other parts
    of

    the paper will discuss methodology for the data collection, data transmission,

    storage, and visualization.

    Other Studies

    Studies have been done in agriculture and in pollution; however there is dearth
    in a

    studies combining pollution monitoring and agricultural parameters data collection.

    A review of previous studies has shown a gap in combination of these parameters

    which are of use to small-scale farming (Rehman et al. 2011) developed a WSAN

    with sensor and actuator nodes to provide controlled water supply; this is very

    geared toward precision agriculture. In 2016 (Raja et al. 2016) used various types

    of sensors to monitor temperature and moisture values of the soil. The data was

    shared to a central station periodically and concentrated on soil data. A similar
    study

    was undertaken in 2015 by (C and S 2015). This study builds on work done by

    (Rehman et al. 2011) where remote monitoring was done for data collection and

    information shared with research facilities (Vatsal and Bhavin 2017). Worked on
    a

    system showing real-time temperature and relative humidity and once again only

    concentrated in agricultural information for display locally.

    There are several systems designed for precision agriculture. They, however,

    mostly solve the problem of irrigation or temperature control. Those in environment

    solve data collection challenges, while those in agriculture solve a single or
    at most

    two challenges.

    Methodology

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is described as connecting everyday objects via sensors

    and actuators to the Internet where the devices are intelligently linked together

    enabling new forms of communication between things and people and between

    things themselves. This technology has advanced rapidly in the last few years
    and

    has become quite popular in environment monitoring. The basic concept is illus-

    trated in the ﬁgure below (Fig. 2).

    IoT offers new and innovative ways to monitor and manage remote operations. “It

    managing activities that were previously out of reach. With the Internet of Things,
    it

    is also possible to collect information about events that were once invisible,
    such as

    correlating weather patterns with industrial production” (“IoT in action – Towards

    Data Science” 2020). The advancement in wireless sensor networks is used in

    monitoring and controlling of various aspect in an agricultural ﬁeld. In the same

    light, weather aspects for a station ﬁeld. A wireless sensor network is composed
    of

    hardware and software. These are low-cost and low-power smart sensor nodes which

    monitor physical conditions. In our initial prototype test case, we monitored
    tem-

    perature, moisture, and pollution. These nodes can be spread across a large geo-

    graphic area (Fig. 3).

    A node: The main components of a sensor node are a microcontroller, transceiver,

    external memory, power source, and one or more sensors. The controller performs

    tasks, processes data, and controls the functionality of other components in the

    sensor node. The sensor node or mote can be deployed inﬁeld to form wireless

    sensor network for crop management and environment monitoring system (Fig. 4).

    This study uses ZigBee, an IEEE 802.15.4 for the wireless sensor network of

    nodes. It is common in networking standard for personal area networks. The physical

    layer of ZigBee operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical
    radio

    bands of 868 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2.4 GHz depending on the region. In this study,

    we adopt 2.4 GHz band because it is unlicensed in Kenya. The ZigBee protocol

    mainly focuses on low-cost and low-power consumption. The low-power consump-

    tion characteristic is necessary since sensors are usually placed at a remote
    location

    where battery power supply is virtually the only option. In order to attain a

    low-power consumption characteristic, the ZigBee protocol operates at low data

    rates (250 kbps at 2.4 GHz); this imposes its limitation where high data transmission

    applications are required. From node to the servers, it is thus more realistic
    to use

    other applications, for instance, Wi-Fi (802.11) which offer high data rates.
    This is

    only done from the coordinator node. Depending on the situation and environment,

    the networks can take three forms of topologies: star, cluster tree, and mesh.
    Our

    study uses the mesh topology. A mesh network is accomplished by allowing devices

    in the cluster tree to topology communicate with each other using multiple routes.

    Consequently, the devices are able to send and receive messages reliably even
    when

    their preferred path is down or congested. This is the major advantage of a mesh

    network over star and cluster-tree networks. However, a mesh network has no

    guarantee of bandwidth since no synchronization is used which requires disabling

    of beacon mode (Fig. 5).

    Mesh topology, also referred to as a peer-to-peer network, consists of one

    coordinator, several routers, and end devices. The following are the characteristics

    of a mesh topology: A mesh topology is a multi-hop network; packets pass through

    multiple hops to reach their destination. The range of a network can be increased
    by

    adding more devices to the network. It can eliminate dead zones. A mesh topology
    is

    self-healing, meaning during transmission, if a path fails, the node will ﬁnd
    an

    alternate path to the destination. Devices can be close to each other so that
    they

    use less power. Adding or removing a device is easy. Any source device can

    communicate with any destination device in the network. Compared with star

    topology, mesh topology requires greater overhead. Mesh routing uses a more

    complex routing protocol than a star topology” (“2.3 ZigBee Topologies | Introduc-

    tion to the ZigBee Wireless Sensor and Control Network | InformIT” n.d.).

    System Design

    This study proposes the combination of solving challenges in environment and in

    agriculture with a single system at the same time contributing to data enhancement

    for policy issues in both precision agriculture and pollution primary data.

    The building of pollution stations within the country present a problem of security

    and management. Having these stations placed at small farms and distributed keeps

    them safe. On the other hand, implementation of monitoring stations for local

    farmers is expensive and the communities lack the knowhow of management of

    the information collected. The cloud-based data management platform will provide

    this, while interested stakeholders (policy makers) will support the management
    of

    data. Kitui County is vast and most small farms lack connectivity to the main
    power

    grid. For the system to be self-sustaining in terms of power, the study uses solar

    photovoltaic and rechargeable batteries to power all electrical devices. The system

    incorporates a remote monitoring mechanism through a General Packet Radio

    Service modem to report soil temperature, soil moisture, WSN link performance,

    and photovoltaic power levels.

    Having a system that encompasses data collection and data dissemination pro-

    vides end to end solution for both small-scale farmers and policy makers.

    The general workﬂow of the monitoring system consists of the following:

    1. Taking temperature, humidity, and pollution data (PM 2.5 and PM 10) samples
    at

    predeﬁned time intervals (Sensors)

    2. Reading this data at a local level (Arduino Uno)

    3. Sending data via a coordinator node (Raspberry Pi)

    4. Visualizing data online

    5. Going to sleep

    6. Waking up and repeating the previous steps (Fig. 6)

    Hardware needed for the end point of the system:

    For the sensor node:

    1. Raspberry pi 3B – this is a low-cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs
    into a

    computer monitor or TVand uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable

    little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing and to learn
    how

    to program in languages like Scratch and Python (Raspberrypi.org n.d.)

    2. Arduino UNO – Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-

    use hardware and software (Arduino.cc n.d.)

    3. Humidity and temperature sensor – DHT22 Sensor

    4. Pollution sensor SDS011

    5. Connectors – female-female, male-female, and male-male

    6. Resistors

    Software used in this project:

    1. XTCU – This was used in this system to setup the XBee radios so that they can

    transmit data between each other.

    2. NOOBS – This is the operating system needed to setup a RPi.

    3. Python.

    4. JSON.

    System Implementation and Experiments

    To set up and test this system, the XBee devices were ﬁrst activated and set up
    using

    XCTU (a tool available online for free). They were all coded under the same network

    for ease of communication. The RPi was loaded with the necessary operating system

    (NOOBS) which comes with python – a coding language. In the project we also set

    up the Internet access for the raspberry pi as it acts as the gateway in this
    system.

    On a laptop, we installed Arduino IDE (which is a development platform for

    Arduino boards) and also the sketches to run the two sensors for our prototype.

    JSON here is used as the shell to transfer data in a compact mode from the Arduino

    to the RPi.

    On the RPi we run a program to call the data from the Arduino to the RPi and

    tested the same locally. Finally on ThingSpeak, we added the required APIs and
    run

    the visual data from our system.

    The diagrams below further deﬁne our various steps (Figs. 7 and 8):

    Once the codes were tested and found to be producing steady outputs, we put the

    sensors in a monitored environment – domestic fridge with proper calibration to
    test

    the humidity and temperature parameters and the results were displayed on the
    local

    Arduino software as 169% humidity and 12° Celsius continuously and repeatedly

    (Fig. 9).

    1743

    We then transferred the tests to the natural environment and connected the router

    XBee connected to the raspberry pi. We were able to read the results from the

    temperature and humidity sensor as well.

    We also run similar tests on the SDS011 – pollution sensor and obtained a

    consistent ﬂow of results as below.

    Once this was done, we then connected the end nodes to the router node for

    data aggregation. This was done using the python on the raspberry pi and

    wrapping the ﬁle using Json. We could then see our data collected using the

    IDs EN1, EN2, and EN3 from the three Arduino/XBee connected end nodes

    (Figs. 10, 11, 12, and 13).

    this

    step has been successful.

    Continuing work in this project involves adding a local database for localized

    data storage and adding a GSM module that allows ease of access of the online
    data

    remotely. The online platform and visualization will also be improved to be more

    robust with a private platform that can be more scalable in the future.

    In industry, the characteristics of the wireless channel are different in comparison

    Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Industrial Wireless Sensor
    NetworksSurveySystematic mapping 1. Introduction Traditionally, industrial monitoring
    systems work offline or use wired networks to transmit the information to a central
    station. In monitoring systems based on wired networks, the installation process
    of cables and sensors usually has higher cost than the sensors themselves (Lu
    and Gungor, 2009). Moreover, this approach has limited flexibility, which makes
    the process of installation and maintenance of the network more difficult and
    expensive. An alternative to implement systems that present lower cost, is the
    use of wireless networks, which have significant advantages, including high flexibility,
    reconfigurability, easy installation and maintenance (Gungor and Hancke, 2009).
    More specifically, the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have other advantages, such
    as the ability of self-organization and local processing, appearing as a promising
    platform for the implementation of monitoring and controlling systems in industrial
    environments. The WSN nodes are equipped with sensors (or actuators), and present
    processing capabilities. They have resource constraints, with low processing power
    and, in some cases, restrictions in power consumption. In industry, sensors are
    deployed to monitor critical parameters such as vibration, temperature, pressure
    and motor efficiency (Delgado Gomes et al., 2013). The measurements obtained by
    the sensors are transmitted wirelessly to a sink node, which provides the information
    for analysis by a monitoring central, or to be used in control systems. In some
    cases, the acquired data is locally processed (at the end node) before transmission.
    A variety of information can be acquired by the WSN for different purposes, which
    allows taking appropriate decisions. Based on the obtained information, it is
    possible to fix or replace equipment before major losses occur. The use of WSN
    in industrial systems presents some challenges. Wireless networks use an inherently
    unreliable communication medium, which can be aggravated due to noise and interference
    in the spectrum band used for communication. Different types of interference sources
    for WSN can be found in industrial environments, such as welding equipment, microwave
    ovens, and other wireless communication devices (e.g. Wi-Fi or Bluetooth networks).
    In addition, in industrial environments there are machinery, and many metal objects
    and obstructions, as depicted in Fig. 1, which can affect the quality of the wireless
    channel. Thus, besides noise and interference, the communication channel is affected
    by heavy multipath propagation effects (Cheffena, 2012), which results in a high
    degree of attenuation in large and small scale (Tanghe et al., 2008). Download

    An example of industrial environment. Compared to other indoor and outdoor environments,
    the industrial ones are harsher due to the unpredictable variations of temperature,
    pressure, humidity, and so on. In addition, the wireless channel in many industries
    is non-stationary in the long term, which can cause abrupt changes in the characteristics
    of the channel over time (Agrawal et al., 2014). The lack of reliability makes
    it difficult to establish Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Since the industry
    intends to reduce the capital and operational expenditure without losing QoS (Kumar
    et al., 2014), the sensors need to be low cost, resulting in a set of restrictions,
    like low rate and low processing capabilities. Fig. 2 shows a general Industrial
    WSN (IWSN) configuration, in which the dashed arrows represent the wireless links
    of the End Nodes, and the solid arrows represent the links between the clustering
    nodes (Cluster Heads) and Sink Nodes. The Sink Nodes may have multiple wireless
    interfaces, each one using a different channel in order to allow simultaneous
    transmissions from the Cluster Heads. The End Nodes can communicate with a Sink
    Node using a single hop, or using multiple hops through a Cluster Head or intermediate
    routers (nodes illustrated in green). In this scenario, the intermediate routers
    are nodes that can act both as a sensoring device (end node), and as a router.
    The Final Processing Node is connected to the Sink Nodes, and is in charge of
    collecting and analyzing all the data received from the WSN. Usually the connection
    between the Sink Nodes and the Final Processing Node is done using a wired link.

    Fig. 2. General Wireless Sensor Networks. The characterization of the industrial
    environments, to analyze interference sources, and propagation characteristics,
    is an important step in the development of new applications that use wireless
    networks, and to improve the current standards used to implement IWSN, such as
    the standards WirelessHART (Song et al., 2008), ISA100.11a (Petersen and Carlsen,
    2011), WIA-PA (Silva and Guedes, 2014), and IEEE 802.15.4e (De Guglielmo et al.).
    Thus, experimental studies to analyze the performance of IWSN in real industrial
    environments can generate valuable information for the development of new techniques
    and protocols for IWSN. Fig. 3 shows the usual standards used to implement WSN.
    The ZigBee standard is not equipped to deal with multipath and interference problems
    in a satisfactory manner, since it does not implement any co-existence mechanism,
    and is based on the MAC protocol of IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which uses Carrier
    Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) with single-channel communication.
    Thus, ZigBee is not recommended to implement IWSN (Song et al., 2008, Akerberg
    et al., 2011). Due to the limitations of MAC protocol defined by IEEE 802.15.4
    standard, new standards with a focus on industrial applications were proposed,
    such as WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and WIA-PA. They use the physical layer of IEEE
    802.15.4, but define different protocols for MAC layer that are based on Time
    Division Multiple Access (TDMA), channel hopping, or a combination of both mechanisms.
    Even defining mechanisms to deal with unreliability, these new protocols can face
    some problems. For example, when using channel hopping, the nodes usually switch
    to a new channel before each transmission. However, if a proper management of
    the blacklist is not made, the network performance can be significantly degraded
    (Grsu et al., 2016). Download : Download high-res image (216KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Standardization of low-power and resource-constrained
    wireless technologies. To overcome the limitations of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard,
    IEEE created in 2008 the 802.15 Task Group 4e (TG4e) (Association, 2017) for redesigning
    the existing 802.15.4 Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols. The goal was to define
    a low-power multi-hop MAC protocol, capable of addressing the emerging needs of
    industrial applications. This improvement resulted in the IEEE 802.15.4e MAC standard
    document (Association, 2017), released in 2012. This standard uses many ideas
    from WirelessHART and ISA-100.11.a standards, including slotted access, shared
    and dedicated slots, multi-channel communication, and frequency hopping. Specifically,
    IEEE 802.15.4e extends the previous IEEE 802.15.4 standard by introducing five
    new MAC behavior modes, designed to support specific application domains (De Guglielmo
    et al.). Among the five modes, only Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH), Deterministic
    and Synchronous Multi-Channel Extension (DSME), and Low Latency Deterministic
    Network (LLDN) modes have been explored in the literature, until now (De Guglielmo
    et al.). Besides the aforementioned standards, that focus mainly on the MAC layer,
    other standardization efforts have been done with focus on other aspects of the
    network. Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined many protocols to
    integrate smart objects into the Internet, leading to the concept of Internet
    of Things (IoT). Some of the most important are IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal
    Area Network (6LoWPAN) (Montenegro et al., 2010), Routing Protocol for Low power
    and Lossy networks (RPL) (Ancillotti et al., 2013) and Constrained Application
    Protocol (CoAP) (Al-Nidawi et al., 2015), that enables web applications on smart
    objects, and are depicted in Fig. 3. The concept of smart devices is closely linked
    to IoT, and Industrial IoT (IIoT) is the application of these technologies in
    industrial scenarios, such as in smart buildings, smart factories, and smart grids
    (Xu et al., 2014). It expands the traditional automation systems and industrial
    informatics systems into a much broader context (Yan et al., 2014). This survey
    has a focus on the lower layers of the WSN, however IoT topics is explored briefly
    in this survey. The literature presents a discussion about the use of a layered
    structure or a more flexible design, called cross-layer design (Karl and Willig,
    2005). In Hill and Culler (2002), the authors discuss examples in which cross-layer
    optimization is particularly useful in WSN. However, other authors (Kawadia and
    Kumar, 2005) argue that imprudent use of cross-layer designs can lead to feedback
    loops, endangering both functionality and performance of the entire system. Clearly,
    these concerns should be considered, and it is necessary to pay attention in order
    to avoid such unexpected feedback loops. Indeed, in general all WSN are implemented
    using some structured design, with physical, MAC and link layer protocols. That
    is why the characteristics of the layers and their respective main protocols are
    described in this survey. There is a number of papers that describe specific layers
    and their different protocols for IWSN, such as MAC layer (Bachir et al., 2010,
    Huang et al., 2013, Kabara and Calle, 2012, Khanafer et al., 2014, Suriyachai
    et al., 2012, Teng and Kim, 2010, Zhao et al., 2012), network layer (Routing)
    (Al-Karaki and Kamal, 2004, Pantazis et al., 2013, Ehsan and Hamdaoui, 2012, Tunca
    et al., 2014, Goyal and Tripathy, 2012, Patil and Biradar, 2012, Hao et al., 2012,
    Zanjireh and Larijani, 2015), and a few papers that focus on Transport Layer (Rathnayaka
    and Potdar, 2013, Obaidat and Misra, 2015). The physical layer is the same for
    all the standards usually used to implement IWSN (defined in the IEEE 802.15.4
    standard). The different standards define different MAC protocols, and some of
    them define protocols for the network and application layers. In this survey,
    the usual role of the five layers is discussed in Section 2, giving more focus
    on network, MAC and physical layers aspects. Some surveys for IWSN are available
    in literature, and an exhaustive list can be found in (Gungor and Hancke, 2009,
    Kumar et al., 2014, Wang and Jiang,, Bal, 2014, Zand et al., 2012, Christin et
    al., 2010, Baronti et al., 2007). In Gungor and Hancke (2009), the authors discuss
    the challenges of IWSN, radio technologies, and gives a brief overview of the
    standards. In Kumar et al. (2014), the IWSN standards are discussed, including
    the functions of Transport, Routing and MAC layers. The paper in Wang and Jiang
    has a focus on the most popular IWSN standards: ZigBee, WirelessHART, WIA-PA,
    and ISA100.11a. Their technical features, plus some security aspects are discussed.
    In Bal (2014), the author summarizes the literature and application examples of
    IWSN. The paper in Zand et al. (2012) provides an overview of the technologies
    in IWSN, the requirements of process automation and problems from the PHY layer.
    In Christin et al. (2010), the authors address QoS and Security aspects of industrial
    automation, and in Baronti et al. (2007), energy efficiency, networking, data
    management and security are mentioned, but not specifically focused in industrial
    environments. The objective of this survey is to provide a contemporary look at
    the current state of the art in IWSN, and discuss the still-open research issues.
    The main wireless standards used to implement IWSN, the communication layers,
    and the characteristics of wireless channels in industrial environments are discussed.
    In addition, this paper provides an insight on the various wireless motes and
    platforms available in the market, a discussion about Operating Systems (OS) for
    low-end devices, and about the network simulators that implement models for WSN.
    At the end of this survey, a systematic mapping is described, in order to provide
    an overview of the researches performed on the IWSN topic, which can help the
    researchers to identify important gaps in the existing approaches, as well as
    promising research directions. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently
    no systematic study providing a broad panorama about what has been investigated
    so far and what are the open issues about this subject. In comparison to the cited
    survey articles, the main contributions of the present survey are: • It provides
    a view on the WSN domain from an industrial perspective, and discusses the standards
    adapted to this environment; • It reviews the important aspects of the wireless
    channel in industrial environments, regarding path loss, multipath fading, shadowing,
    and interference problems; • It provides a detailed analyses on the two main layers
    that impact the reliability (PHY and MAC layers), and their protocols; • It presents
    the different motes commercially available, and for research purposes; • Reviews
    the OS and simulators designed for low-power wireless devices, and discusses a
    model adapted to simulate industrial environments; • It performs a systematic
    mapping that provides a background of IWSN in order to appropriately position
    new research activities, and to suggest areas for further investigation. The remainder
    of this survey is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the layers and protocols
    of a WSN, and the solutions that can be used to mitigate the communication problems
    in such environments. Section 3 introduces the standards used to implement IWSN,
    and their characteristics. The use of multiple channels and link quality estimation
    for WSN is discussed in Section 4. In Section 5, the platforms, operating systems,
    and simulators are discussed, giving special attention to the simulation of WSN
    in industrial environments. Section 6 describes a systematic mapping of the relevant
    papers on IWSN, and Section 7 discusses the main challenges of IWSN, and possible
    open issues. Finally, this survey is concluded in Section 8. 2. IWSN layers and
    protocols Using a top-down approach, this section discusses the layers and their
    main protocols that can be used to implement IWSN. The list is not intended to
    be exhaustive, but illustrative, since there are several papers that have already
    somehow discussed the most used protocols for WSN. The section begins with the
    application layer, and then go down to transport, network, MAC and physical layers,
    with a special attention to network, MAC and physical layers, discussing protocols
    suitable for IWSN, and to the characteristics of the wireless channels in industrial
    environments. 2.1. Application layer The application layer provides the designer
    with a high-level programming model for describing the system behavior. Industrial
    automation applications provide control, conservation, efficiency, and safety.
    They extend existing manufacturing and process control systems reliably, improve
    asset management by continuous monitoring of critical equipment, reduce energy
    costs through optimized manufacturing processes, and help to identify inefficient
    operation or poorly performing equipment (Sohraby et al., 2007). After solving
    synchronization, storage and complex channel requirements at lower layers, the
    communication at the application layer is reduced down to a basic message-passing
    and memory access primitives. This canonical set of primitives can then be further
    implemented on a given target communication architecture by the following layers
    of the communication stack (Gajski et al., 2009). Based on the specific requirements,
    IWSN applications can be classified into three groups (Erdelj et al., 2013): •
    Environmental sensing: covers the problems of air, water, material pollution,
    fire, flood or landslide monitoring, and hazardous environments; • Condition monitoring:
    covers the problems of structure and human condition monitoring (buildings, constructions,
    machine condition, and healthcare applications); • Process automation: covers
    information regarding the resources for the production and service provision,
    besides production performance monitoring, evaluation and improvements. In the
    application layer, one must define the reliability and latency requirements in
    order to correctly choose and configure the lower layer protocols to satisfy those
    defined by the application. Concerns such as the impact of the propagation environment,
    operation lifetime, heterogeneity of data collected, autonomous operation, maintainability,
    reliability, and security, are found usually in the other layers, and they are
    discussed in the next sections. The application deals indirectly with these problems.
    2.2. Transport layer The transport layer sits on top of the network layer, and
    together, they are responsible for transmitting messages between communication
    endpoints over the network of logical links and transducers. The goals of the
    transport protocols include congestion and flow control, fair allocation of bandwidth,
    reliability, packet-loss recovery, energy efficiency, and heterogeneous application
    support. There are several transport protocols in literature, and it is difficult
    to compare the performance of them, since each one was tested in different simulation
    environments, without a standard set of simulation/experimental settings. Hence,
    there is a number of classifications for the protocols. In Obaidat and Misra (2015),
    for example, the authors classify the transport protocols into three categories:
    Congestion Control, Reliability, and Hybrid. For the first category, some examples
    are CCF, CODA, and SIPHON; in the second category, some examples are GARUDA, PSFQ,
    and Tiny TCP/IP. For the last category, there are ART, ESRT and STCP protocols
    as examples. In Rathnayaka and Potdar (2013), the authors classify the protocols
    into three classes, in which the first class supports both congestion control
    and reliability. The protocols in this class are ART, CRRT, and . The second class
    corresponds to the protocols that support only reliability, and comprehends DTC,
    GARUDA, and RMST. The last class supports only congestion control, and includes
    ARC, CCF, CODA, and Fusion. It is known that Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) are inappropriate for WSN due to many constraints
    in terms of throughput and energy efficiency (Wang et al., 2005). UDP does not
    offer reliability, flow and congestion controls, and TCP reduces the transmission
    rate when congestion occurs. In general, the most common technique in congestion
    detection is the use of buffer occupancy. Depending on the topology, the network
    might have to perform data buffering in intermediate transducers. In order to
    reduce the required sizes of these buffers, the transport layer splits large messages
    into smaller packets. Packets are transferred one at a time from station to station,
    such that intermediate stations only have to buffer one packet, rather than the
    whole message, at any time (Gajski et al., 2009). If the application requires
    synchronous data transfers and if there are buffers in the path between endpoints,
    the transport layer will have to perform additional end-to-end synchronization,
    by exchanging acknowledge messages at the end of each message. Reliability in
    the context of transport protocols refers to the successful delivery of each segment
    that the sources generate to the ultimate destination. Some protocols detect the
    congestion based on the reliability parameters. The use of factors such as time
    to recovering or the loss or successful reception of packets as parameters, is
    not always feasible, since a transmission failure may occur due to other factors
    different from congestion (e.g. problems in the channel quality). In such cases,
    the false detection of congestion may force a rate reduction, which influences
    negatively the network performance (Rathnayaka and Potdar, 2013). Some examples
    of transport layer protocols that are used in IWSN can be found in WirelessHART
    and ISA100.11a standards. The transport layer of WirelessHART cooperate with the
    network layer to provide secure and reliable end-to-end communication for network
    devices. A transport table is used to support end-to-end acknowledged transactions,
    with automatic retries. It uses a MASTER bit to identify whether the device is
    a MASTER or a SLAVE, and along with the corresponding sequence number, this table
    also buffers the payload of the last request (in MASTER mode) or response (in
    SLAVE mode). Thus, it allows the device to resend the request or response when
    the retry timer expires (Song et al., 2008). The transport layer of ISA100.11a
    provides connectionless services, which extends UDP over IPv6 with optional compression,
    as defined by the IETF 6LoWPAN specification (Nixon,). The extension includes
    better data integrity checks and additional authentication, and encryption mechanisms.
    ISA100.11a does not support acknowledged transactions at the transport layer.
    Due to the strict energy requirements imposed by end-to-end reliability mechanisms,
    and the lack of a clear proposal for reliable transport in Low power and Lossy
    Networks (LLN), the use of UDP and retransmission control mechanisms at application
    layer is an important trade-off between energy cost and reliability, when considering
    the integration of sensors into the Internet, in IETF CoAP applications (Palattella
    et al., 2013). 2.3. Network layer The routing algorithms are essentially used
    to determine good paths. The design of routing protocols for WSN must consider
    the power and resource limitations of the network nodes, the time-varying quality
    of the channel, and the possibility for packet losses and delay variations. Most
    of the routing protocols designed for WSN consider energy efficiency as the main
    design goal, with the assumption that the QoS requirements are more relaxed (Ehsan
    and Hamdaoui, 2012). However, in many industrial applications, reducing energy
    consumption is not prioritized as much as reliability, since critical processes
    could be compromised by a low reliability and availability of the network communications
    if IWSNs are unreliable. Under these constraints minimizing energy consumption
    will be in vain (Yu et al., 2017). The network protocols can be divided into three
    classes: • First class: is related to data-centric protocols, and in this class,
    there are Sensor Protocols for Information via Negotiation (SPIN), Cougar, Directed
    Diffusion, Rumor Routing and Gradient-Based Routing (GBR) protocols; • Second
    class: is related to hierarchical routing protocols. In this class, there are
    the Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH), Power-Efficient Gathering
    in Sensor Information Systems (PEGASIS), Threshold sensitive Energy Efficient
    sensor Network (TEEN) protocols; • Third class: is based on location. In this
    class, there are as examples Geographical and Energy Aware Routing (GEAR), Geographic
    Adaptive Fidelity (GAF), Minimum Energy Communication Network (MECN) protocols.
    Regarding routing protocols for multi-channel networks, although traditional routing
    protocols do not account for channel diversity (Draves et al., 2004), some were
    proposed in the literature. There are solutions in which the nodes use a single
    interface, and each node has a default channel for receiving data. In this case,
    a node with a packet to transmit has to switch to the channel of the receiver
    before transmitting data, however sometimes the impact of switching latency might
    make this idea unfeasible. Other solutions for multi-hop networks support multiple
    interfaces at each node. Some of them use shortest-path routes, which may not
    be suitable for multi-channel networks (Draves et al., 2004) because the shortest-path
    algorithm might select a path without ensuring that the hops are on different
    channels. Although it is possible implementing multi-channel protocols in network
    layer, it depends on the architecture of the network. Multi-channel approaches
    are more commonly found in MAC layer. Concerning the network layer of WirelessHART,
    it is based on a mesh network with redundant routes. This feature, which is not
    found in ZigBee, for example, increases the reliability, and fault tolerance (Delgado
    Gomes et al., 2013, Song et al., 2008). A network administrator defines the routes
    at the network manager, and this centralized unit is also responsible for setting
    the frequency hopping sequence, and the time scheduling among all nodes of the
    network, ensuring the correct operation of the TDMA mechanism. Although the use
    of redundant routes is not supported by the network protocol of ZigBee standard,
    protocols that use redundant routes can also be implemented in radios that are
    fully compliant with IEEE 802.15.4. WirelessHART uses four kinds of routing methods
    to ensure reliable communication: Graph, Source, Superframe, and Proxy Routing.
    In Graph Routing, the Network Manager creates a table that establishes connections
    to the devices, but the metric used to decide the neighborhood of the nodes is
    not specified in the standard (Silva et al.,, Han et al., 2011). In Source Routing,
    the Network Manager puts into the packet all the required information for routing,
    but this method is used only for network diagnosis, because if a node fails, the
    packet will be lost. Superframe Routing is similar to Graph Routing, however the
    links can only use established superframes, which allows isolating the traffic,
    but limits the amount of available links. The Proxy Routing is a Graph Routing
    used by devices when they are put into the network (Silva et al.). While the devices
    do not receive the security keys from the Network Manager, the Proxy Routing will
    be used. In Xia et al. (2017), the authors focus on routing in mixed-criticality
    industrial systems, and considers both Source Routing and Graph Routing. When
    the system is in low-criticality mode, Source Routing considers the schedulability
    of each flow, but when errors or exceptions occur, the system switches to high-criticality
    mode, and network routing turns to Graph Routing to guarantee that important flows
    can be scheduled. This approach intends to improve high-critical flows schedulability
    and analyze the schedulability of system. In Quang and Kim (2012), the authors
    proposed a two-hop neighbor information-based gradient routing on IWSNs. According
    to their simulation results, high deadline delivery success ratio can be achieved.
    Other work (Quang and Kim, 2014) presented a cluster-based throughput-aware routing
    protocol for IWSNs to decrease latency. In this protocol, the synchronization
    of the whole network is not required, making it suitable for a large-scale network,
    but extra-equipped cluster heads are needed, increasing the cost of deployment.
    All these protocols aim for real-time performance in IWSNs, but high reliability
    is not their main focus. In order to work in mission-critical WSNs, and provide
    reliable and deadline-constrained communication, it has been shown that flooding
    for routing might be one feasible alternative (Yu et al., 2017, Soyturk and Altilar,
    2008). Different from traditional routing protocols, a flooding-based routing
    allows multipath diversity, and due to the broadcast nature of wireless medium,
    ACK packets can be avoided to shorten the transmission latency, and all adjacent
    nodes of a transmitting node may overhear the packets, so packet forwarding can
    be more flexible. In Yu et al. (2017), an enhanced version of the flooding-based
    routing protocol (REALFLOW) is presented to fulfill the strict requirements of
    mission-critical industrial applications. The drawback of this protocol is that
    it only supports one sink, and longer measurements in different industrial environments
    need to be performed to confirm the performance of this approach. Despite the
    advantages of flooding method, it may produce excessive amounts of redundant traffic,
    and unnecessary packet forwarding may occur. Several researches on flooding-based
    routing have been done, but most of them can only support uplink transmission
    from a node to a sink, which is a strong limitation when implementing IWSN. The
    network layer in ISA100.11a utilizes 6LoWPAN, and the compatibility with IPv6
    allows the devices to connect to the Internet (Kumar et al., 2014). In its network,
    it is possible for server/client pairs to generate IPv6 packets, which are forwarded
    through 6LoWPAN edge routers to 6LoWPAN-enabled devices. This router performs
    the adaptation from IPv6 format to a 6LoWPAN format that can be understood by
    the devices. The ISA100.11a mesh forwards the IP-based packets to the destination
    according to routing information configured in the Data Link Layer (DLL) header.
    The IPv6 packets fragmentation and reassembling are performed in the 6LoWPAN adaptation
    layer (Nixon). In order to design a routing solution for IP-based (IPv6) LLN,
    IETF Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL) Working Group1 was formed.
    After evaluating OSPF, IS-IS, AODV, and OLSR protocols, and finding that none
    of them satisfied the routing requirements for LLN, the group specified the RPL.2
    The RPL in based on the IPv6 routing architectural framework, as it is suitable
    for time varying link loss characteristics, and have low CPU and memory requirements
    (Tripathi et al., 2010). The authors in Ko et al. (2011) describe how 6LoWPAN
    and RPL implementations from TinyOS and Contiki operating systems were used together
    in the same network, even though the two implementations were developed independent
    of each other. TinyOS and Contiki are described in Section 5.1. The objective
    of RPL is to build a network topology on top of an LLN that includes multiple
    partially overlapping link-layer broadcast domains. RPL builds multiple Destination-Oriented
    Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAG), each one rooted at a different sink, which are
    tree-based network topologies where all the links are oriented in such a way that
    no cycles exist (Ancillotti et al., 2013). Each RPL node can be part of at most
    one DODAG. This implies that DODAGs are not overlapping, and their union, called
    a DAG, is a partition covering the entire network topology. In addition, the protocol
    introduces the concept of a RPL instance, in which DODAGs within the same instance
    share the same routing metrics and constraints, and multiple RPL instances can
    run independent of each other within a single network topology. This enables traffic
    prioritization through the differentiation of traffic forwarding techniques. When
    building the network topology, each router identifies a stable set of parents
    on a path towards the DODAG root, and associates itself to a preferred parent,
    based on an Objective Function (OF) (Gaddour and Koubâa, 2012). The OF defines
    how RPL nodes translate one or more metrics into ranks, and how to select and
    optimize routes in a DODAG. It is responsible for rank computation based on specific
    routing metrics (e.g. delay, link quality, connectivity etc.), and for specifying
    routing constraints and optimization objectives. The design of efficient OFs is
    still an open research issue. There is a draft3 that proposed the use of Expected
    Transmission Count (ETX) as the path selection criteria in RPL routing. The metric
    ETX is discussed in more details in Section 4.2. Other important routing protocol
    for data collection is the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) (Colesanti and Santini).
    It computes any-cast routes to a single or a small number of designated sinks
    in a WSN. While the CTP specification (Fonseca et al.) describes protocol packet
    formats and interoperability requirements, several aspects are left open for specific
    implementations, such as the timings for routing and forwarding packets. The CTP
    uses routing messages (beacons) for tree construction and maintenance, and data
    messages to report application data to the sink. Its standard implementation consists
    of three main logical software components: Routing Engine (RE), Forwarding Engine
    (FE), and Link Estimator (LE). The RE sends and receives beacons, to create and
    update the routing table. This engine is instantiated in each node, and the routing
    table is filled using the information extracted from the beacons. Besides the
    identification of the nodes and their neighbors, the table has a metric (ETX)
    indicating the quality of the connection to a node that might be a potential parent.
    The FE is in charge of forwarding data packets which may either come from the
    application layer of the same node or from neighboring nodes (Colesanti and Santini).
    In addition, it is responsible for detecting and repairing routing loops as well
    as suppressing duplicate packets. The LE determines the inbound and outbound quality
    of 1-hop communication links. There is an implementation of CTP for the Castalia
    Simulator,4 and the current distribution of TinyOS (2.1.2) also includes an implementation
    of this protocol. Castalia simulator is better described in Section 5.2. 2.4.
    MAC Layer MAC protocols play an important role in ensuring an effective WSN data
    communication service. Although many MAC protocols have been developed for wireless
    networks, many of them are not suitable for WSN because they were not designed
    with energy conservation as main concern (Zhao et al., 2012). Nevertheless, energy
    efficiency cannot be the only design concern. Traditionally, issues such as delay,
    throughput, robustness, scalability, stability, and fairness have dominated the
    design of MAC protocols (Sohraby et al., 2007). There is a number of classifications
    of MAC protocols for WSN in the literature. There are classifications according
    to contention- and schedule-based protocols, or random access, slotted access,
    frame-based, and hybrid protocols. In this paper, the classification of MAC protocols
    are into contention-based, contention-free (scheduled-based) and hybrid protocols.
    In contention-based protocols, the devices access the shared channel in asynchronous
    manner, and they compete for it whenever there are packets in their buffers to
    be sent. Their drawback is energy inefficiency due to idle listening, collisions,
    overheading, and control packet overhead (Durresi, 2005), although they provide
    good scalability required by WSN to support the node changes. The contention-free
    protocols are based on scheduling, and their advantages include the absence of
    collision and few control-packet overheads required to maintain the synchronization
    among the nodes. Their disadvantage occurs when new nodes are added or removed.
    For that, it is required re-establishment of routing and restart of the network,
    which affect network stability. In addition, fixed time slot in the packet exchange
    restricts the network''s adaptability to traffic variations. When the fixed time
    slot is long but traffic load is low, energy-efficiency will be reduced. When
    the fixed time slot is short but traffic load is heavy, the end-to-end delay will
    be prolonged (Zhao et al., 2012) The hybrid version of MAC protocols might be
    designed to switch its behavior between contention- and scheduled-based protocols
    according to the traffic characteristics. In Zheng et al. (2016), the authors
    propose a novel MAC protocol defined as wireless arbitration (WirArb) which grants
    each user channel access based on their different priority levels. This protocol
    supports multiple users and each user is pre-assigned a specific arbitration frequency,
    which decides the order of channel access, ensuring that the user with the highest
    priority will immediately gain channel access and we can guarantee a deterministic
    behavior. The results show that the proposed solution outperforms TDMA-based WSNs
    in terms of latency, throughput and channel utilization. Additionally, given the
    potential existence of critical processes in industrial environments, assigning
    different priority levels to nodes is a suitable strategy in IWSN. Some authors
    have proposed novel MAC protocols for real-time communication based on the physical
    layer of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (Flammini et al., 2009, Bartolomeu et al.,
    2017, Franchino and Buttazzo, 2017, Correia et al., 2015). Other works have evaluated
    the performance of the protocols defined in the standards for IWSN (Grsu et al.,
    2016, Jeong and Lee, 2012, Lee and Jeong, 2012, Alderisi et al., 2015, Juc et
    al., 2016) or proposed mechanisms to improve the performance of these protocols
    (Du and Roussos, 2011, Du and Roussos, 2013, Anwar et al., 2016, Patti et al.,
    2014, Patti and Lo Bello, 2016, Sahoo et al.,, Serizawa et al., 2017, Gomes et
    al., 2017). Flammini et al. (2009) proposed a MAC protocol based on CSMA/CA and
    TDMA for networks with star topology. The communication is controlled by a network
    coordinator using beacon frames. The structure defined for the protocol is similar
    to the one used in the DSME, which includes a contention access period (using
    CSMA/CA) for acyclic communication (e.g. network management packets), and a contention-free
    period, based on TDMA, for periodic communication. One limitation of the protocol
    is that only two channels are used in the whole network, the Communication Channel
    (CC), and the Backup Channel (BC). The coordinator defines the channels, and the
    decision is based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements
    to identify the channels with the lower level of noise. The coordinator informs
    to the nodes using the beacon if the CC or the BC channel must be used for data
    transmission in each cycle. The channels are chosen based on the channel quality
    estimation given by the measurements of the noise at the coordinator. Multipath
    problems cannot be assessed through measurements of the noise floor. In addition,
    the protocol is not capable to deal with spatial variations in the quality of
    the channels. Bartolomeu et al. (2017) proposed the Wireless Flexible Time Triggered
    (WFTT) protocol, for networks with strict time constraints. The WFTT is based
    on the bandjacking technique, in which the communication medium is occupied by
    a noise generator in a synchronized way, to avoid the interference from neighboring
    contention-based communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi networks. Only external
    interference caused by radios that use contention-based MAC protocols (e.g. CSMA/CA)
    were considered. Interference problems from radios that use contention-free protocols,
    or other equipment (e.g. microwave ovens) are not avoided by the protocol. The
    WFTT also uses beacons (the trigger packets), but only one channel is used to
    transmit the trigger packets, which is a single point of failure. In addition,
    the protocol is not capable to deal with multipath problems that can affect the
    quality of the links. All the end-nodes also use the same channel for communication,
    but the same channel can present different characteristics for different nodes,
    due to the spatial variations in the quality of the channel, and the diverse spatial
    allocation of the nodes which leads to different channel qualities. The Wireless
    Budget Sharing Token (WBuST) protocol is proposed in Franchino and Buttazzo (2017).
    The WBuST is a hybrid MAC protocol with contention-based communication and contention-free
    communication. In WBuST, the network is divided into clusters, and each cluster
    has a coordinator. Different channels are used in different clusters to avoid
    collisions, and inside a cluster, the communication occurs based on a structure
    called Communication Window (CW). Subsequent CWs are separated by beacon frames,
    transmitted periodically by the cluster''s coordinator. The communication between
    different clusters is made through the coordinators, which allows building networks
    with different topologies (e.g. star or cluster-tree). The main limitation of
    the MAC protocol proposed in Franchino and Buttazzo (2017) is the absence of a
    channel diversity mechanism to deal with the problems that can affect the quality
    of the links over time, such as interference and fading problems. Even different
    channels are used for different clusters, all communication inside the clusters
    occurs using only one channel, which is a single point of failure. Correia et
    al. (2015) proposed the DynMAC protocol, which uses dynamic channel reconfiguration.
    The MAC protocol is based on TDMA, and the channel to be used by all nodes in
    the network (the global best channel) is defined by the sink node of the network,
    using information collected from the nodes of the network, through RSSI samples
    or the Packet Error Rate (PER) calculated by the nodes. The main limitation of
    the DynMAC protocol is the use of only one channel in all network. The evaluation
    of the protocol was made using a simplistic simulation model (unit disk graph
    radio model), and with a short distance between nodes. Besides, the experiments
    were not performed in a realistic environment. This protocol could work well in
    a scenario where external interference are the only source of link quality disturbance.
    However, in industrial environments, fading and shadowing also need to be considered,
    as well as the link asymmetry, and the spatial and temporal variations that can
    occur in the link quality in such environments, as can be seen in experiments
    described in Agrawal et al. (2014), Gomes et al., 2017b, Tanghe et al. (2008).
    2.5. Physical layer A prerequisite to deploy WSN for monitoring and control in
    the process industries is the knowledge of the propagation characteristics of
    the radio channel, which helps to better characterize the variations in the transmitter
    signals due to the propagation environment. In industry, variability in the characteristics
    of the channels may be observed due to the multipath profile of the environment.
    Multipath problems are caused by reflection, diffraction, and scattering of electromagnetic
    fields. Besides that, multipath and shadowing are caused by large and small-scale
    fading due to the presence of many objects (usually made with metallic materials),
    and interference occurs, possibly caused by other wireless networks (Tanghe et
    al., 2008). The random movements of people or objects such as robots and trucks
    may cause time-varying effects in the wireless channel. If the aforementioned
    propagation effects are not taken into account, they can significantly degrade
    the performance of WSN in industry. Indoor radio propagation channels have been
    extensively studied, and to justify the modeling, many measurement campaigns have
    been conducted in different buildings (Olofsson et al., 2016). The intention is
    to characterize the radio channel properties and to build statistical models that
    can be used for system design. Previous investigations show that the channel gains
    in indoor environments can often be well described by Log-normal, Rayleigh, Rice,
    Nakagami models (Hashemi et al., 1994), but the best distribution is dependent
    on the environment. 2.5.1. Wireless channel models In industrial environments,
    there is a high degree of attenuation at large and small scale. Large-scale fading
    is the result of signal attenuation due to signal propagation over large distances
    and diffraction around large objects in the propagation path. The parameter that
    characterizes the large-scale fading is the path loss. Path loss is caused by
    the attenuation of the signal along the propagation path and is expressed as the
    ratio between the transmitted and received power (Cheffena, 2016). Eq. (1), called
    Log-Distance Path Loss, shows the path loss in for a distance d between transmitter
    and receiver. (1) In this log-distance path loss model, the average received power
    decreases logarithmically with distance. The parameter n represents the path loss
    exponent, which may vary depending on the environment. The path loss in the distance
    d depends on n and on the path loss at the reference distance . can be determined
    by the equation . is the wavelength of the carrier. There is a variation in the
    power of received signal, depending on where the measurement is made. To capture
    this variation, a random variable of Gaussian distribution in dB with zero mean
    and standard deviation is added to Eq. (2), which is called Log-normal Shadowing.
    (2) Like n, is also dependent on the environment. In Tanghe et al. (2008), experiments
    were conducted to determine both n and log-normal shadowing in industrial environments
    in the frequencies 900, 2400 and 5200 MHz. Besides path loss, one should also
    examine the small-scale fading in industrial environments. Small-scale fades are
    related to the rapid changes in signal strength over a small area or time interval
    due to multipath. In Tanghe et al. (2008), studies have been conducted about the
    temporal variation in the level of energy in the channels. This variation is linked
    especially to the movement of obstacles around transmitter and receiver, and is
    due to the changes of the multipath profile over time. The results of the experiments
    presented in Tanghe et al. (2008) validated the use of Rice distribution as a
    model for the temporal attenuation. This distribution describes the attenuation
    on a small scale when there is a stationary dominant signal and random components
    overlap to this main component (Rappaport, 2001). Studies were done to determine
    K factor of Rice in the related scenarios. The distribution of K values obtained
    in all the measurements are correspondent to a Log-normal distribution, with a
    mean value of 12 dB and standard deviation of 5.4 dB. Rice factor is obtained
    according to Eq. (3), and the probability density function of Rice distribution
    is shown in Eq. (4). (3) (4) represents the part that does not vary along the
    time, relative to the power of the stationary component, and is the variable part
    due to movements which change the multipath components patterns. In the industrial
    environments studied in Tanghe et al. (2008), there was a high value of K if compared
    to that found in office environments. This can be explained by the open nature
    of the industrial buildings, and the large number of reflective materials. Thus,
    there are many invariant rays on the environment and only a small part of the
    multipath profile is affected by moving objects. Although Rice distribution has
    been validated in Tanghe et al. (2008), measurement performed in Sexton et al.
    (2005) shows different distributions for various locations of indoor industrial
    environment, in which most of them presented Nakagami-m characteristics while
    some presented Log-normal and Rayleigh characteristics. In Olofsson et al. (2016),
    through extensive measurements performed at three different factory buildings,
    the fading characteristics for mobile transceivers behaved like Rayleigh or close
    to Rayleigh distribution, but for fixed transceivers, the use of a single fading
    distribution is not enough to characterize the different environments. It is clear
    that a single distribution cannot be used to analyze the received signal power.
    Thus, more measurements in different industrial environments are needed to model
    properly the envelope distribution of the received signal, especially when the
    network is meant to be deployed for a long time duration. In Hashemi (1993), despite
    the movement of people and equipment in the environment, over a short interval
    of time the channel can be regarded as wide-sense stationary or quasi stationary.
    In a measurement campaign in Gomes et al. (2015) performed by the authors of this
    survey, in which part of the industry is depicted in Fig. 1, it is observed that
    the properties of a link could change dramatically over long periods because of
    motion in the environment. Fig. 4 shows abrupt changes in the link characteristics
    during 30 min using one link. Fig. 5 expands the same experiment to 50 h with
    three different links. In the experiments, a star network was settled connecting
    three nodes, which are monitoring three motors simultaneously, and the three nodes
    communicate with the same sink node, using the same channel. Some of the observed
    changes are due to movements of different objects around the nodes in the measurement

    coherence bandwidth Some studies were carried out to verify the Root Mean Square
    (RMS) delay spread and the maximum excess delay spread in industrial environments.
    The authors in Stenumgaard et al. (2012), (2013) observed the characteristics
    of three types of industrial environments: very reflective, absorptive, and environments
    that fit between reflective and absorptive. The results showed that reflective
    environments present much more multipath components and present greater RMS delay
    spread in all the channels studied. In 2.4 GHz frequency, for example, the mean
    excess delay was 86 ns in a reflective environment, and 42 ns in an absorptive
    environment. The RMS delay spread was 294.19 ns and 28.9 ns, respectively. The
    coherence bandwidth of a channel is the frequency range ( ) at which a channel
    is correlated. Two signals transmitted in frequencies separated more than are
    affected differently by the channel (Proakis, 1995). The coherence bandwidth can
    be defined as (Varela and Sanchez, 2001), in which is a factor that can vary according
    to the power delay profile; when the correlation between frequencies is greater
    than 90%, can be equal to 50, or equal to 5 when the correlation between frequencies
    is greater than 50% (MacLeod et al., 2005). The variable is the RMS delay spread
    in seconds, therefore considering , and for an industrial environment (Stenumgaard
    et al., 2013), . While the standard specifies 5 MHz channels, only approximately
    2 MHz of the channel is consumed with the occupied bandwidth, so for this scenario,
    the channels are uncorrelated in frequency. For outdoor environments, the RMS
    delay spread is higher compared to that found in indoor industrial environments.
    For mobile radio channels, the delay is in the order of microseconds, and indoors
    the delays are in the order of nanoseconds (Rappaport, 2001). As the radios used
    in WSN have a relatively low symbol rate, intersymbol interference may not be
    a problem for these indoor networks. For example, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard has
    a symbol rate of 62.5 kbaud in 2.4 GHz band, which represents a symbol period
    of 16 μs. Fig. 6 shows RSS values obtained in other experiment performed by the
    authors of this survey inside an industrial environment with transmitter and received
    nodes, 30 m away, without line of sight and several obstructions and metal objects
    (Gomes et al., 2017a). Download : Download high-res image (294KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. RSS measurements (in dBm) in channel 11 and channel 19.
    When the nodes were tuned to channel 11, the Packet Reception Rate (PRR) was around
    91%, and when the nodes were tuned to channel 19, the PRR was around 51%. Therefore,
    even without considering interference, changing the channel may improve the quality
    of the communication due to the different characteristics of the channels at the
    same time. 2.5.3. Noise and electromagnetic interference As discussed in Section
    1, due to the increasing number of applications using wireless technologies, the
    spectrum available for communication tends to become more congested, increasing
    interference, and reducing the QoS of networks that coexists in the same environment.
    Thereat, the static spectrum allocation approaches tend not to work satisfactorily
    in such a congested channel. Mechanisms allowing smarter use of the spectrum should
    be developed to mitigate the problems related to the interference of coexisting
    networks. Some studies were carried out to identify possible sources of interference
    in different environments. In Chilo et al. (2009), the authors conducted a study
    on the intensity of the electric field, and the Amplitude Probability Distribution
    (APD) of noise in a paper industry. The APD allows analyzing the percentage of
    time an impulse signal exceeds a certain threshold. The results show that the
    most common equipment that can cause interference in 2.4 GHz band are microwave
    ovens, industrial heaters, radiofrequency lighting systems and welding equipment.
    However, these devices are not always present in the industry. Other sources of
    interference, usually found in industrial environments, are electric motors, frequency
    inverters, and wireless communication equipment, such as cordless phones and wireless
    local area network equipment. Some sources of interference, especially those related
    to industrial equipment, such as motors and frequency inverters, are present in
    the range of a few hundred MHz, which may disturb communication in proprietary
    systems that use this frequency range, but do not interfere with systems that
    use the 2.4 GHz ISM band (Stenumgaard et al., 2013, Stenumgaard et al., 2012).
    In Angskog et al. (2010), the authors verified the frequency bands affected by
    a set of sources of interference. The results showed that combustion engines and
    welding equipment cause interference only below 1 GHz. In Delgado Gomes et al.
    (2012), an experimental study was carried out to verify the correlation between
    packet loss rate and mean power in the IEEE 802.15.4 radio channel subject to
    interference from an IEEE 802.11 network and a microwave oven. The results showed
    that these sources of interference significantly increase the energy level in
    the channels, having a direct influence on the communication performance of the
    radios. In some scenarios, the packet loss rate of IEEE 802.15.4 radios has reached
    90% when subjected to interference of an IEEE 802.11 network. When subjected to
    microwave oven interference, the worst case packet loss rate was around 50% when
    the IEEE 802.15.4 radios were operating on channels 21 and 23. A certain correlation
    was observed between the mean power level in the channel and the packet loss rate.
    However, the relationship between mean power and packet loss rate is different
    for each type of interference source. In this way, more elaborated metrics needs
    to be developed to accurately estimate the channel quality. In Lima-Filho et al.
    (2012), experiments were performed to investigate the impact of an IEEE 802.11
    network and a microwave oven on the performance of a WSN for monitoring of motors
    in an industrial environment. Similar results to those described in Delgado Gomes
    et al. (2012) were observed, with the packet loss rate reaching about 90% when
    the WSN was subject to interference from the IEEE 802.11 network. In Guo et al.
    (2012), experiments are described to verify the influence of the distance between
    transmitter and receiver, and between sensor nodes and sources of interference
    (Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and microwave oven) in a building environment. A packet
    loss rate of up to 25% was observed due to the interferences of the IEEE 802.11
    network and microwave oven, for the scenarios under consideration. The interference
    from the Bluetooth radios was very small. This is due to the frequency hopping
    mechanism defined by the IEEE 802.15.1 standard, which uses 79 channels of 1 MHz
    over the 2.4 GHz band. 3. Standards used in IWSN Many communication technologies
    for low-power wireless networking were developed to maintain the completely industrial
    process running in a reliable and efficient condition. The IEEE 802.15.4 standard
    is among the most prominent communication technologies for low-power wireless
    networks. In addition, it has been used as a baseline for other standard communication
    protocols/models, such as WirelessHART and 6LoWPAN (Tennina et al., 2013). The
    IEEE 802.15.4 standard is designed for WSN requiring low cost, low power, low
    data rate (up to some few hundred of kbps), and scalability. If compared to IEEE
    802.11 and IEEE 802.15.1, IEEE 802.15.4 is more suitable for the industrial device
    monitoring system requiring long lifetime nodes powered by battery because of
    the low power consumption, longer battery life and lower cost (Gungor and Hancke,
    2013). However, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard is not suitable for industry requirements
    (Akerberg et al., 2011) due to the use of CSMA/CA instead of TDMA (Zheng et al.,
    2016), and the use of a single channel in the whole network. Although several
    papers have described the standards used in industry (Song et al., 2008, Baronti
    et al., 2007, Silva et al.,, Tennina et al., 2013, Kim et al., 2008, Petersen
    and Carlsen, 2011, Rezha and Shin, 2014, Zhong et al., 2010, Lee, 2006, Huang
    et al., 2009, Du et al., 2015, Misic and Misic, 2008, Kiyumi et al., 2015, Alderisi
    et al., 2015), it is still important to mention the main characteristics and drawbacks
    of each one. This section describes the four main standards used in IWSN, and
    based on the IEEE 802.15.4 PHY layer, besides the amendment IEEE 802.15.4e. 3.1.
    IEEE 802.15.4 The IEEE 802.15.4 standard has been designed to specify the PHY
    and MAC sublayers for Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPAN) for the
    low-cost devices communications with a short range and low power consumption.
    ZigBee is perhaps the most well-known example of wireless products on the market
    that utilize the 802.15.4 standard (Gungor and Hancke, 2013). At PHY, the standard
    defines three frequency bands: 2450 MHz (16 channels), 915 MHz (10 channels),
    and 868 MHz (1 channel), all using the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
    access mode. The 2450 MHz band employs Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (O-QPSK)
    for modulation with a data rate of 250 kbps, while the 868 and the 915 MHz bands
    make use of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), supporting 20 and 40 kbps, respectively.
    Experimental studies described in Lee (2006) showed that the actual maximum bit
    rate in 2450 MHz frequency band is around 153 kbit/s. This reduced value is due
    to the mechanism used for collision avoidance in the MAC layer (CSMA/CA). The
    standard defines two types of nodes, Reduced Function Devices (RFD) and Full Function
    Devices (FFD). FFD implements the full IEEE 802.15.4 protocol stack, and RFD implements
    a subset of the protocol stack. FFD can be a coordinator, a gateway or a router,
    and RFD is a simple end device in charge of sensing and actuating tasks. When
    acting as a network coordinator, a FFD node may send beacons that provide synchronization,
    communication, and coordination. Beacon and non-beacon modes are discussed below
    (Bartolomeu et al., 2016). In a ZigBee network, the standard defines three types
    of topology: star, peer-to-peer, and cluster-tree, as illustrated in Fig. 7. In
    the star topology, a unique node operates as a Personal Area Network (PAN) coordinator,
    and is a node to which all sensing information is sent. One disadvantage of star
    topology is its very limited coverage while addressing a large-scale WSN, leading
    to scalability problems. Some solutions mitigated this problem by using multihop
    and multiple channels, which are discussed later in this survey. Download : Download

    used in IEEE 802.15.4 networks. The point-to-point, also called mesh topology,
    includes a coordinator as well, however the communication paradigm in this topology
    is decentralized, in which each node can directly communicate with any other node
    within its range. This improves flexibility but it is more complex to provide.
    It allows multiple hops to route data from any node to any other node. The cluster-tree
    topology is a special case of point-to-point network where there is a single routing
    path between any pair of nodes. There is only one coordinator, which identifies
    the entire network and one router per cluster. Any of the FFD can act as a router
    providing synchronization services to other devices and routers (Tennina et al.,
    2013). The IEEE 802.5.4 MAC layer defines two operating modes: beacon-enabled
    and non-beacon mode. In beacon-enabled mode, the coordinator sends periodic beacon
    frames to synchronize the rest of the nodes. Synchronization enables dynamic duty-cycle
    management, allowing nodes to save their energy by entering in the sleep mode.
    These energy saving periods enable the extension of the network lifetime, which
    is one of the most important requirements of WSN, but it affects latency. In addition,
    in beacon-enabled mode the synchronization allows the dynamic reservation of guaranteed
    bandwidth, through allocation of Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS) in the superframe
    contention free period. However, managing the synchronization mechanism throughout
    the cluster-tree networks is a very challenging task, since the larger the network
    is, the more collision problems can occur. In beacon-enabled mode, medium access
    can also be ruled by CSMA/CA, as well as in non-beacon mode, but the former uses
    the slotted version and the later uses the unslotted one. The time interval between
    two beacon frames is called the Beacon Interval (BI), or Superframe, and is divided
    into an active period and an optional inactive period. During the inactive period,
    nodes can be kept in sleep mode to conserve their energy. The length of the active
    period is the Superframe Duration (SD) which contains 16 time slots (from 0 to
    15) with the same duration (Buratti et al., 2011). The 16 time slots in the superframe
    are subdivided into smaller slots known as the Backoff Period (BP) (Shafiullah
    Khanet al, 2013). The IEEE 802.15.4 MAC layer achieves duty-cycle operations by
    setting two system parameters, (BO) and (SO) to achieve low power consumption
    for ZigBee devices (Huang et al., 2009). The first one specifies the period during
    which the coordinator can communicate the beacon frames. The second one specifies
    the duration of the active portion plus the beacon frame (Khanafer et al., 2014,
    Queiroz et al., 2017). The value of BO is related to the BI, and SO is related
    to SD, in which (Du et al., 2015). If BO is set to 15, the value of SO is ignored
    and beacon frames will not be sent except upon request (Khanafer et al., 2014).
    As depicted in Fig. 8, the active period comprises Contention Access Period (CAP)
    and Contention Free Period (CFP) (Zhan et al., 2016). During CAP, nodes use the
    slotted CSMA/CA algorithm to access the channel. During CFP, up to seven GTS can
    be allocated by the coordinator for each superframe, which allow the node to communicate
    on the timeslot that is dedicated exclusively to it Du et al. (2015). A node with
    an assigned GTS has full access to the channel during its GTS. Nodes activity
    during it should be completed before the start of the next GTS or the end of the
    CFP (Khanafer et al., 2014). Download : Download high-res image (260KB) Download

    in 2016 and January 2017 using the “IEEE 802.15.4” term in the keyword field,
    in IEEE Xplore were found 64 papers, in ScienceDirect were found 20, and in ACM
    Digital were found six documents. From all those documents, around 50% are research
    papers focused on ZigBee. Some of the topics found are related as follows: • Throughput
    measurement and performance improvement of IEEE 802.15.4 under interference, including
    channel utilization scheme; • Techniques of cooperative communication and network
    coding to mitigate electromagnetic noise, channel coding for energy and temperature
    monitoring, calculation of optimum transmit power employing cooperative relaying,
    protocols for cooperative sensing, and implementation of selection cooperation;

    energy efficiency seem to have been the main concerns regarding this standard
    recently. 3.2. WirelessHART WirelessHART is a wireless communication standard
    designed to meet the needs for process automation applications (Gungor and Hancke,
    2013). It was the first open standard specifically designed for wireless communication
    in process measurement and control applications (Song et al., 2008), and was officially
    presented by HART Communication Foundation in 2007, with the restriction of being
    compatible to the existing HART devices by adding wireless communication capability
    to the HART protocol. The WirelessHART specification was approved by the International
    Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as a full international standard (IEC 62591)
    in March 2010. WirelessHART is a secure and TDMA-based wireless mesh networking
    technology operating in 2.4 GHz ISM radio band. Actually, it uses the Time Synchronized
    Mesh Protocol (TSMP) (Kumar et al., 2014, Pister and Doherty, 2008), which was
    developed by Dust Networks for MAC and network layer functions. Before WirelessHART
    is released, there were some standards for office and manufacturing automation,
    such as ZigBee IEEE 802.15.4 standard and Bluetooth. However, they could not meet
    the stringent requirements of industrial applications. ZigBee does not have built-in
    frequency hopping techniques to mitigate interference and multipath problems,
    and Bluetooth assumes quasi-static star network, which is not scalable to be used
    in large process control systems (Song et al., 2008). At PHY layer, WirelessHART
    adopts the IEEE 802.15.4-2006 standard, and has its own time-synchronized MAC
    layer that uses frequency hopping, and channel blacklisting. The network layer
    supports self-organizing and self-healing mesh networking techniques (Grimaldi
    et al., 2016). In addition, it supports both direct connection between device
    and gateway (star topology) and connections over multiple hops (mesh topology).
    Each network device must be able to function as source, sink and router (Kim et
    al., 2008). WirelessHART networks are centralized, with strict timing requirements
    managed by a central network manager that is used to configure the routing and
    schedule information. Fig. 9 shows an example of a WirelessHART network. Download

    Example of WirelessHART network. Following are the main devices and components
    of a WirelessHART network (Foundation, 2007): • Gateway: a network Access Point
    (AP) that connects the WirelessHART network to a plant automation network, allowing
    the data to flow between them; • Network Manager: an application that manages
    the network and its devices. The communication with the devices is command-oriented,
    and it is responsible for scheduling, device list management, and collecting statistical
    information about performance, fault detection, and network formation. The logic
    used by the manager for path construction and link scheduling is not explicitly
    specified and it is left to the final user (Grimaldi et al., 2016); • Security
    Manager: an application that is in charge of generating, storing, and managing
    join, network, and session keys; • Field Devices: sensor and actuator nodes; •
    Router: in theory, the use of routers is not required, since the field devices
    are configured automatically with routing mechanisms. However, its use could lead
    to redundant paths to the Gateway, preventing field devices from being used for
    message routing, and thereby increasing power consumption; • Handheld: device
    used to configure and monitor the field devices. As seen in Fig. 10, WirelessHART
    has a limitation of 15 frequency channels (11–25), in which channel 26 is not
    used for regulatory issues in some countries. At MAC layer, the communication
    must be done within a 10 ms (data + acknowledgment) time slot, and sequences of
    time slots form a superframe. Each transmission between two nodes must occur in
    a time slot in one of the 15 channels using the unicast method. Each superframe
    has two kinds of slots: dedicated slot at the beginning of every superframe, and
    shared slots for the rest of the superframe. During shared slots, the devices
    must compete with each other to communicate. Download : Download high-res image
    (208KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Superframe structure of WirelessHART,
    adapted from Silva et al.. After sending the packets, the devices waits for an
    ACKnowledgement (ACK). If it is not received, they will wait a random period and
    send the packet again. According to WirelessHART, the MAC sublayer uses TDMA to
    perform link scheduling during the dedicated slots period, and during shared slots
    period, the MAC sublayer uses slotted ALOHA. To ensure packet delivery, nodes
    can use three time slots in each superframe. The first two time slots are used
    for transmission and retransmission (in case of the first attempt fails) on a
    predefined route. The third slot is used to transmit the same packet using a different
    route (Wu et al., 2016). Since each slot uses a different channel, in this scenario
    each packet can be transmitted up to three times within the same superframe using
    different parameters (route or channel), so that the link becomes robust to problems
    that affects specific channels or routes. The application layer is based on HART
    commands protocol, and these commands are used by the different entities in the
    network to join, write/read data, etc. For security issues, WirelessHART uses
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with 128 bits block Ciphers, similar to the
    ZigBee standard. To handle coexistence and interference efficiently, IWSN standards
    employ many spectrum management techniques (Akerberg et al., 2011). A Clear Channel
    Assessment (CCA) is performed before data transmission to ensure that the channel
    is free to use. In WirelessHART, CCA reports a busy medium if a signal compliant
    with IEEE 802.15.4 PHY modulation and spreading characteristics is detected. Each
    transmission uses a different channel, and Fig. 10 depicts frequency hopping mechanisms
    for four data streams in 200 ms (20 slots). To improve the WirelessHART communication,
    the HART Communication Protocol and Foundation (HCF) developed a document for
    best practices (HART Communication). In general, the following rules are established:
    • Each field device should have at least three neighbors. The third neighbor acts
    as a backup if one of the two primary paths is unavailable; • The gateway should
    have at least five neighbors. It works with less nodes, but for better resilience,
    five is the minimum value; • At least 25% of the network devices should reach
    the gateway in large networks. Regarding recent researches about WirelessHART,
    using the three main research databases (IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and ACM Digital),
    a simple filter with the term set in the keyword field, and considering the year
    2016, and the first month of 2017, 22 documents were found in IEEE Xplore, four
    in ScienceDirect, and one in ACM Digital. The papers focus on performance analysis,
    data aggregation techniques to guarantee energy-efficient and real-time communication,
    RF power modulation technique to reduce energy consumption, delay effects on the
    control system''s performance, autonomous diagnostic tool, filtered feedback PID5
    control, long network lifetime with Graph Routing, and WirelessHART adaptor for
    process control applications. Reliable graph routing is well described in Han
    et al. (2011), in which the authors present efficient algorithms to construct
    them, and describe the recovery mechanisms in the event of component failures.
    The main advantage is that, based on these graphs, data link layer communication
    schedules are generated to achieve end-to-end real-time performance. 3.3. ISA100.11a
    The International Society of Automation (ISA) initiated a work on a family of
    standards to implement wireless systems for industrial automation and control
    applications. The main purpose of ISA-100 committee is to provide a family of
    standards for industrial wireless networks, and ISA100.11a is the first standard
    of the family. It was released in 2009, and describes a mesh network designed
    to provide secure wireless communication to process control. It received the IEC
    approval as international standard (IEC 62734) in 2011. An ISA100.11a device have
    one or more of the following tasks (Standard, 2009), as depicted in Fig. 11: •
    (I/O): the devices can provide or use data through sensors or actuators. They
    do not have routing capabilities; • : it acts like a proxy, routing the data toward
    the gateway; • : high level routing, increasing the throughput of the network
    as long as more sub-networks are created. The communication between them uses
    the 6LoWPAN. It is also responsible for tunneling; • : a device (router) may enable
    other devices to join a specific network; • : a device may provide an interface
    between the field devices and the plant automation network; • : an application
    that is in charge of the network tasks; • : an application that, in cooperation
    with the system manager, is responsible for the generation, storage and distribution
    of the necessary security keys and is also supposed to manage authentication;
    • : a device (router) responsible to maintain the master time source for the system;
    • : device used to configure, test, and monitor the field devices. Download :

    of ISA100.11a network. Similar to WirelessHART, PHY layer is based on the IEEE
    802.15.4 standard, and is designed to support a maximum of 50-100 devices in the
    network (Petersen and Carlsen, 2011). ISA100.11a standard uses frequency hopping
    and channel blacklisting to reduce the interference effects, and applies different
    methods for frequency hopping called slotted, slow, and hybrid hopping, as depicted
    in Fig. 12. In slotted hopping, each communication occurs in a different frequency.
    There is an order to be followed to optimize the coexistence with IEEE 802.11
    and WirelessHART standards, but it is possible to choose the channels following
    a specific sequence (Silva et al.). In slow hopping, the devices change its channels
    at specific intervals (100–400 ms), and is used by devices that lost synchronization.
    For coexistence issues, it is recommended to use the channels 15, 20 and 25 in
    the slow hopping. The hybrid hopping uses both techniques to optimize the sending
    of alarms and retransmissions. Download : Download high-res image (403KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Different frequency hopping profiles of ISA100.11a,
    adapted from Rezha and Shin (2014). The standard uses 16 channels (11–26), but
    the channel 26 is optional. At MAC layer, it combines TDMA with CSMA in order
    to use the advantages of both techniques, and defines routing at this layer. The
    time slots have 10 ms or 12 ms, and duration can be dedicated or shared. The dedicated
    slots are used for contention-free communications, and in the shared slots, the
    media access uses an exponential backoff algorithm, similar to CSMA/CA. The MAC
    layer is divided into three sublayers: MAC Sublayer, MAC Extension, and Upper
    Data Link Layer. The first one is a subset of IEEE 802.15.4, the second adds new
    characteristics related to CSMA/CA, TDMA, and frequency hopping (Silva et al.),
    and the third one is in charge of routing at MAC layer. Similar to WirelessHART,
    a security manager exists in ISA100.11a embedded with the system manager and gateway
    on the same physical device. The security feature is optional in ISA100.11a to
    provide greater flexibility and improve battery life, and the end-to-end security
    is performed in the transport layer (Petersen and Carlsen, 2011). In Serizawa
    et al. (2017), a mechanism called Adaptive Channel Diversity (ACD) is proposed
    for ISA100.11a networks. In the proposed protocol, the network is divided into
    groups, and the end-nodes inside the same group share the time-slots allocated
    to the group. The ACD mechanism use information about the quality of the channels
    to avoid using channels affected by interference sources. The communication duration
    is divided into four time segments, where three of them are dedicated to the ACD
    mechanism, which incurs in a high overhead. The solution described in Serizawa
    et al. (2017) has the same limitations of the solution described in Du and Roussos
    (2013); Du and Roussos (2011), since only interference problems are considered.
    Besides, many time slots are dedicated to the ACD mechanism, which increase the
    overhead of the protocol and the latency of the network. Using the same filter
    performed for WirelessHART with the three research databases and the term ISA100.11a
    set in the keyword field, during the year 2016 and the first month of 2017, in
    IEEE Xplore were found four documents IEEE Xplore, one in ScienceDirect, and none
    in ACM Digital. Among those papers, only two focus on specifically ISA100.11a.
    The first one studies Adaptive Channel Diversity (ACD) method, and the other one
    evaluates the performance of networks that follow the standard. 3.4. WIA-PA There
    is a few papers published about the WIA-PA (Wireless Networks for Industrial Automation
    and Process Automation) standard, if compared to the aforementioned ones. It is
    the Chinese standard of industrial wireless communication architecture and specification
    for process automation. It was accepted by IEC in 2008 and was called IEC/PAS
    62601. WIA-PA standard adopts IEEE 802.15.4 PHY without modification in order
    to co-exist with the IEEE 802.15.4-based systems. It is designed for measuring,
    monitoring and open-loop control of industrial processes (Zhong et al., 2010),
    which correspond to the classes 3–5 of the industrial process automation applications
    defined by the ISA100 committe (Standard, 2009). Class 0 is for critical and time-sensitive
    applications, which requires less than 10 ms latency in a deterministic manner.
    The standard supports a hierarchical network topology that combines standard mesh
    topologies with five kinds of devices: host computer, gateway, routing, field
    and handheld devices. The data link sub-layer protocol based on the IEEE 802.15.4
    MAC protocol, with some additional features such as frequency hopping, packet
    aggregation/disaggregation, and time synchronization. Similar to ZigBee, WIA-PA
    implements beaconing, superframe structure, and the time slot duration is configurable.
    WIA-PA uses a hybrid protocol based on CSMA/TDMA, and uses three frequency-hopping
    mechanisms to increase the reliability and throughput: Adaptive Frequency Switching,
    Adaptive Frequency Hopping, and Time Slot Hopping (Silva and Guedes, 2014). Performing
    the same analysis about the researches over WIA-PA in 2016 and January 2017, in
    IEEE Xplore there were found two papers, and only one of them is focused specifically
    on WIA-PA. None of the other databases have found results. The only paper found
    studies a TR0696 WAN management protocol for the standard. 3.5. IEEE 802.15.4.e
    As mentioned in the previous subsection, one of the main concerns when designing
    a WSN is the energy efficiency. This is because the devices are battery-powered
    and the replacement of batteries is difficult or expensive. Besides energy, other
    requirements must be considered such as scalability, reliability and timeliness,
    in which the last two are critical issues for industrial and healthcare applications
    (De Guglielmo et al.). Several studies investigated the performance of IEEE 802.15.4
    networks (Khanafer et al., 2014, Baronti et al., 2007, Tennina et al., 2013, Lee,
    2006, Buratti et al., 2011, Zhan et al., 2016, Du et al., 2015, Huang et al.,
    2009, Misic and Misic, 2008, Eady, 2007, Kiyumi et al., 2015), and they highlighted
    the limitations of the standard, which makes it not suitable for applications
    that have stringent requirements of latency and reliability in harsh environments.
    One of the main limitations is that, unlike ISA100.11a and WirelessHART, the IEEE
    802.15.4 MAC uses a single channel and does not have a frequency hopping mechanism
    to mitigate the effects of interference and multipath. To overcome these limitations,
    the IEEE 802.15.4e standard was developed. WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and IEEE
    802.15.4e standards introduce scheduling-based MAC protocols to provide a guaranteed
    access or bounded latency, and adopt packet-level frequency hopping to improve
    the reliability of the wireless links. IEEE 802.15.4e standard defines five MAC
    protocols (behavior modes), DSME, TSCH, LLDN, AMCA and BLINK. For AMCA and BLINK
    modes, it provides only a brief description of them, therefore they are not discussed
    in this paper. In general, the improvements of IEEE 802.15.4e are regarding support
    to multi-channel communication, more flexible superframe (DSME), and the use of
    a contention-free channel access mechanism based on TDMA (it decreases collision,
    and allows minimizing the energy consumption). In the following topics, the details
    of the three main modes are outlined. 3.5.1. Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel
    Extension (DSME) This mode is intended to support industrial and commercial applications
    with stringent timeliness and reliability requirements. Similar to IEEE 802.15.4
    beacon mode, in DSME the time is divided into CAP and CFP, as depicted in Fig.
    13. Slot 0 is used to transmit Enhanced Beacons (EB), and CAP begins after the
    EB and ends before slot 9. The other seven slots belongs to CFP, and each one
    in CFP represents a DSME-GTS, used when there is traffic whose latency must be
    predictable. During the entire CAP, the frames are sent using only one channel
    and the nodes are required to be on. To obtain more GTSs and save energy in this
    case, DSME provides a mechanism called CAP Reduction. When it is enabled, only
    the first superframe of each multi-superframe presents the CAP, while in the other
    superframes, the CAP is omitted and the CFP has 15 DSME-GTS. Download : Download
    high-res image (183KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Example of
    a superframe structure for a DSME network. In DSME, the coordinators transmit
    periodically EB to keep the nodes synchronized and to allow other nodes to join
    the network. BI is composed of several superframes, which do not have inactive
    periods, and are divided into 16 equally spaced slots. Inside BI, it is possible
    to define cycles of repeated superframes called multi-superframes. During CAP,
    the nodes use a slotted CSMA/CA algorithm to access the channel, and in CFP, the
    nodes use GTS. The difference from IEEE 802.15.4 standard is that DSME extends
    the number of GTS time slots and uses multiple channels. In addition, it can accommodate
    periodic and event-driven traffics by adopting a versatile multi-superframe structure.
    Beacon scheduling and slot allocation are performed in a distributed manner, without
    depending on a central device. The links between two nodes can be dedicated, so
    neighboring nodes can communicate in a point-to-point way. Since each pair of
    nodes can allocate and deallocate GTS slots, DSME is able to adapt to the variations
    in the generated traffic and to the changes of the network topology over time.
    DSME also supports the option of Group ACKnowledgement (GACK) that allows putting
    together the ACK of multiple data frames into a single ACK frame in order to improve
    the energy efficiency. Concerning GACK, it is used when the nodes have to send
    periodic traffic to the coordinator. In this case, the coordinator uses a single
    DSME-GTS to put together all the ACK from frames received in the previous DSME-GTS
    in just one frame. This mechanism brings two advantages, energy efficiency and
    latency reduction, since the retransmissions are done inside the same multi-superframe.
    During the same GTS, multiple transmissions can be accommodated using different
    channels. Each superframe inside a multi-superframe has a different ID, and each
    DSME-GTS has an ID according to its position inside CFP. DSME mode defines two
    types of channel diversity: frequency hopping, and channel adaptation. Fig. 14
    shows two examples of scheduling for the CFP period, using frequency hopping in
    (a), and channel adaptation in (b). When using the first one, the nodes receive
    packets in different channels, depending on the channel offset of the node, on
    the slot ID, on the superframe ID, and on the sequence number of the EB sent by
    the coordinator. For example, in Fig. 14(a), Node 1 receives a packet using Channel
    0 in the first time slot, using Channel 1 in the second time slot, and so on.
    The nodes that receive packets inside the same superframe need to have different
    channel offsets, in order to avoid collisions. Download : Download high-res image
    (158KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Channel diversity mechanisms
    defined for DSME networks. When using the channel adaptation as the channel diversity
    technique, a pair of nodes communicate using the same channel while the channel
    quality is good enough in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. In order to use this
    mechanism, it is necessary to evaluate the quality of the links continuously.
    Besides the two mechanisms, a novel hybrid approach was developed and simulated
    in Gomes et al. (2017c), that uses both channel hopping and channel adaptation.
    The simulated results showed that the hybrid approach outperformed the other two
    approaches for the scenario studied in the paper. In addition, the experiments
    showed that the use of channel adaptation is better than channel hopping for the
    transmission of unicast packets, when the quality of the links is monitored continuously.
    However, for packets transmitted in broadcast by the coordinator, the use of channel
    hopping is a good alternative to deal with the spatial variation in the quality
    of the channels. The time structure in DSME is almost the same as IEEE 802.15.4,
    including the parameter macMultisyperframeOrder (MO), that determines the duration
    of multi-superframes, in which . In Table 1, SMS stands for the number of Superframes
    in a Multi-Superframe, MSBI means the number of Multi-Superframes in a BI, and
    MSD is Multi-Superframe Duration. Table 1. MAC parameters with multi-superframe.
    Parameters Value SMS superframes MSBI multi-superframes MSD aBaseSuperframeDuration
    symbols Each EB has a special field called DSME PAN Descriptor Information Element
    that contains the information of the superframe structure such as BO, SO and MO,
    and other options like GACK, CAP Reduction, etc. The SO value influences the duration
    of time slot, and MO determines the number of DSME-GTS available in each multi-superframe
    and influences the latency. It also transmits a DSME-Beacon Allocation Notification
    command during CAP to inform its neighbors about the slot allocation. In the case
    of beacon collision, the coordinator uses a Deferred Beacon option to reduce the
    probability of collision. When this option is activated, the coordinator performs
    a CCA before sending the beacon. To avoid the same EB slot to be assigned to multiple
    nodes, a DSME-Beacon Collision Notification is sent to the other node to choose
    a different EB slot. The experiments described in Jeong and Lee (2012) and Lee
    and Jeong (2012) evaluated the performance of DSME mode in comparison to the beacon-enabled
    mode of the IEEE 802.15.4. The experiments verified that, in some scenarios, the
    throughput of the IEEE 802.15.4e DSME network can be 12 times higher than the
    IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enabled network, and with a lower energy consumption, due
    to the use of a TDMA-based medium access. In the experiments, frequency hopping
    was used but no dynamic management of the blacklist was employed. In Sahoo et
    al., a novel MAC protocol for networks with start topology, based on DSME mode
    of the IEEE 802.15.4e, is proposed, with the goal of reducing the discovery time,
    and to optimize the bandwidth usage. To reduce the discovery time, it was proposed
    the use of additional beacon transmissions, in different channels. When a node
    attempts to join the network, a random channel is chosen, and the node waits for
    a beacon transmission in that channel. However, if the selected channel presents
    deep fading problems for the link between the new node and the coordinator, the
    time of access can be very high. This problem was not considered in the solution
    proposed on the paper. To optimize the bandwidth usage and reduce the delay, group
    ACK was employed using the beacon frames, and the nodes use the contention access
    periods to perform retransmissions instead of using dedicated time slots for retransmissions,
    as defined in the original algorithm of DSME (De Guglielmo et al.). One limitation
    of the work described in Sahoo et al. is that the channel diversity mechanisms
    of the DSME were not evaluated, which is a very important aspect to be taken into
    consideration in industrial applications. Regarding latest researches about DSME,
    using the same parameters described previously for the aforementioned standards,
    IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect databases found one paper, and ACM Digital found
    none. One paper is regarded a survey of IEEE 802.15.4e, and the other one performs
    an energy consumption and performance analysis of TSCH and DSME. 3.5.2. Time Slotted
    Channel Hopping (TSCH) The TSCH mode was developed for applications of process
    automation, and like DSME, TSCH uses EB, works in star, tree and mesh topologies,
    and employs frequency hopping mechanism. Different from DSME, which uses a periodic
    multi-superframe structure, TSCH uses periodic slotframe, dedicated time slots
    instead of time slot during CFP, and CSMA/CA with shared time slots instead of
    contention-based channel access (during CAPs). In addition, TSCH does not implement
    GACK. In TSCH, each node obtains information of synchronization, frequency hopping
    sequence, time slot and slotframe through EB. The slotframe contains either contention-based
    or contention-free time slots. The time slots assignment to the devices within
    the slotframe may initially be communicated through a beacon, but usually the
    higher network layers configure them when the device joins the network (Alderisi
    et al., 2015). Fig. 15 shows an example of link schedule, in which there are 4
    time slots, 5 channel offsets and 8 transmissions, thanks to the multi-channel
    approach of TSCH. In the example, there are two for dedicated links (D A and B
    C) and shared links (C D and E F). Download : Download high-res image (165KB)

    all devices share common time and channel information, devices may hop over the
    entire channel space to minimize the negative effects of multipath fading and
    interference, and do so in a slotted way to avoid collisions, minimizing the need
    for retransmissions. Through time synchronization and frequency hopping, TSCH
    enables high reliability while maintaining very low duty cycles, and this guarantees
    energy efficiency. The hopping sequence is defined by an ID, the sequence length,
    and an ordered list of channels. A link between communicating devices is identified
    by a pair time slot/channel offset. Shared links are intentionally assigned to
    multiple devices for transmission. This can lead to collisions and result in a
    transmission failure detected by a missing ACK, but a retransmission backoff algorithm
    (CSMA/CA algorithm) is implemented for shared links, to reduce the probability
    of repeated collisions. There are differences between IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA, and
    TSCH CSMA/CA algorithm (De Guglielmo et al.). The first difference is that in
    TSCH, besides being optional, CCA is not used to prevent collisions, but to avoid
    transmitting a packet if there is strong external interference. Other difference
    is regarding the parameter macMaxCSMABackoffs, which is not used in TSCH. The
    packet is dropped only if it reaches the maximum number of retransmissions (macMaxFrameRetries).
    Regarding the backoff mechanism, it is activated only after the node has experienced
    a collision. In TSCH, the backoff unit duration, instead of of IEEE 802.15.4,
    corresponds to a shared slot. In Grsu et al. (2016), an experiment was performed
    to analyze the performance of a TSCH network inside an aircraft cabin, with external
    interference caused by Wi-Fi networks. In the experiments, the PER was equal to
    35% when using the 16 available channels, due to the influence of interference
    on the link. In general, when fewer channels were used, the PER was lower, as
    the interference level decreases. For example, when using only one channel, the
    one less affected by the interference sources, the PER was equal to 5%. However,
    to operate using only one channel per link, an appropriate mechanism is needed
    to estimate the quality of the channels continuously and to dynamically configure
    the blacklist, which can generate a remarkable overhead. In Alderisi et al. (2015),
    a comparison between DSME and TSCH in process automation scenarios is described.
    Simulations were performed to verify the delay, reliability, and scalability of
    each mode. The TSCH presented better results for small networks, with up to 30
    nodes. For larger networks, with more than 30 nodes, the DSME presented better
    results. The simulations described in Alderisi et al. (2015) used realistic parameters
    for the log-normal shadowing, but the effect of fading and the non-stationary
    characteristics of the wireless channel were not considered. In addition, only
    the channel hopping mechanism of the DSME were analyzed. In Juc et al. (2016),
    other comparison between DSME and TSCH is described, in terms of energy consumption
    and performance. In the scenarios under consideration, the energy consumption
    of DSME was slightly better than TSCH, as well as the performance. In applications
    that send less data, the TSCH wastes bandwidth, due to the fixed size of the time
    slots. In the experiments described in Juc et al. (2016) only channel hopping
    was considered. The use of adaptive frequency hopping for TSCH networks was proposed
    in Du and Roussos (2011); Du and Roussos (2013), to avoid using channels affected
    by interference sources. In this approach, two time slots in each cycle are used
    to perform readings of RSSI values. Based on these measurements, the blacklist
    is updated to avoid the channels with a high level of interference. The experiments
    were conducted considering different sizes for the blacklist. The higher the size
    of the blacklist, the better the communication performance. This result corroborates
    the results presented in Grsu et al. (2016). However, this type of behavior only
    occurs if an adequate monitoring of the quality of the channels is performed,
    in order to properly configure the blacklist in real-time. One limitation of the
    approach presented in Du and Roussos (2011); Du and Roussos (2013) is that only
    interference problems are considered. Other aspects that can affect the quality
    of the links are not considered, such as shadowing and fading. Besides, the channel
    quality monitoring is performed by all nodes and using time slots that could be
    used for communication, which incurs in a high overhead, and increases the latency.
    Regarding recent researches about TSCH, there are more papers about this mode
    than DSME. In IEEE Xplore database, 19 papers were found, in ScienceDirect were
    found two papers, and ACM Digital, four results were found. Some of the topics
    are related as follows: • Optimal scheduling policy for reliability and energy
    efficiency considering opportunistic forwarding at MAC and routing layers (Huynh

    Low Latency Deterministic Network (LLDN) Few studies have addressed LLDN so far.
    This mode is intended for applications such as factory automation and robot control,
    which require very low latency and high determinism. Communication in LLDN mode
    occurs according to a structure called superframe. Each superframe starts with
    a beacon packet transmitted in broadcast by the coordinator, and it is followed
    by up to two timeslots used for management (optional). After that, several dedicated
    timeslots are defined for transmission of the end nodes. When only one node is
    associated to a timeslot, it is not necessary to use an address, since the node
    can be identified by the timeslot ID, which is already known by the coordinator.
    Therefore, it is possible to transmit smaller packets and reduce network latency.
    Different from TSCH and DSME, it does not implement EB and there is no multi-channel
    mechanism. Similar to DSME, it implements GACK, and similar to TSCH, the channel
    access is performed by dedicated time slots and uses a version of CSMA/CA in shared
    time slots. The dedicated time slots are accessed using a TDMA approach, and the
    timeslots are smaller than those used in TSCH and DSME. Differently from TSCH
    and DSME, LLDN has been designed only for star topologies, in which a number of
    nodes need periodically to send data to a central sink. Since communication takes
    place based on TDMA, communication between end nodes and the network coordinator
    (central node of star topology) is collision-free, so that it is possible to ensure
    good communication quality. However, communication channel problems related to
    shadowing, multipath, interference, or asymmetry can degrade network performance.
    In addition, due to the use of a star topology, it may be difficult to accommodate
    a network with many nodes. A possible solution to this problem is to use a multi-transceiver
    coordinator node and divide the network into groups that use a common channel.
    Strategies for link quality estimation and channel allocation that are discussed
    in Section 4.2, can be used to improve the QoS of such networks. An implementation
    of the LLDN described in Anwar et al. (2015) uses IEEE 802.15.4 compliant radios,
    and is aimed to verify the feasibility of implementing applications that require
    intervals of up to 10 ms between the reception of two new values of a sensor.
    In a scenario where the sensor nodes send 2 bytes of payload, it was possible
    to accommodate eight end nodes, with a maximum delay between the reception of
    two packets of 9.996 ms. In a scenario where the sensor nodes send 4 bytes of
    payload, it was possible to accommodate seven end nodes, with a maximum delay
    of 9.536 ms. One limitation of the analysis performed in Anwar et al. (2015) is
    that the experiments were performed in a controlled environment, without external
    interference, and with the nodes positioned very close to each other. Thus, the
    packet delivery rate was 100% throughout the experiments. In a real industrial
    environment, it may be practically impossible to achieve a packet delivery rate
    of 100%, and in this case, latency values may be worse in practice than those
    shown in the article. Some authors have proposed channel diversity techniques
    and multi-channel communication for LLDN networks. In Patti et al. (2014), a multi-channel
    protocol based on LLDN, called MC-LLDN, was proposed. MC-LLDN aims to increase
    the scalability of LLDN networks through the use of a multi-level topology (tree),
    data aggregation and communication using multiple channels. In this way, it is
    possible to accommodate simultaneous transmissions in the network, in different
    channels. With data aggregation in the routers, less timeslots need to be dedicated
    for packet forwarding to the coordinator, which causes a large reduction in latency.
    The limitation of MC-LLDN is that the channels are allocated statically to the
    subnetworks, which makes the protocol unable to cope with the variations that
    may occur in channel quality over time. The protocol proposed in Patti and Lo
    Bello (2016) is an evolution of MC-LLDN, called PriMuLa, which incorporates adaptive
    selection of channels for the subnets. One limitation of PriMuLa, which is due
    to the characteristics of LLDN networks, is that the same channel is allocated
    to all nodes on the same subnet. However, spatial variations in channel quality
    may occur, as well as asymmetry problems. In addition, to perform dynamic channel
    selection, a link quality estimation mechanism must be used that operates in real
    time and does not cause overhead on the sensor nodes. The simulations to evaluate
    PriMuLa were performed considering only shadowing problems, through the use of
    realistic parameters for the log-normal shadowing model. However, other problems
    that may affect the quality of the links, such as the non-stationarity behavior
    of the wireless channel in industrial environments, were not considered. Among
    the main modes of IEEE 802.15.4e, LLDN is the least researched, showing only three
    papers in IEEE Xplore database, one survey about IEEE 802.15.4e in which LLDN
    is discussed, presented by ScienceDirect database, and none in ACM Digital database.
    Two of them are specific about LLDN; they study priority-aware multi-channel adaptive
    framework, and tackling mobility in low latency deterministic multihop issues.
    4. Multi-channel approaches and link quality estimation Due to variations in channel
    characteristics that occur over long periods of time in industry, as discussed
    in Section 1, in order for the network to continue operating with a certain level
    of QoS in a long term, it may be necessary to employ strategies for dynamic channel
    allocation. Therefore, it is important to consider the use of multi-channel protocols
    in MAC layer, to mitigate the aforementioned problems. 4.1. Multi-channel protocols
    Multi-channel protocols can be divided into static, dynamic and semi-dynamic (Soua
    and Minet, 2015). This classification takes into account that only the sink nodes
    may have multiple transceivers. 4.1.1. Static protocols Static approaches are
    the simplest to implement, since no synchronization mechanism is required to ensure
    communication between nodes during network operation. Moreover, there is no overhead
    related to channel switching in these mechanisms. Although these protocols allow
    optimizing the network during its deployment, they are not able to adapt to variations
    in channel characteristics over time, since its configuration is performed only
    at the beginning of the network. One example of static protocol is Tree-Based
    Multi-Channel Protocol (TMCP) (Wu et al., 2008). It divides the network into disjoint
    sub-trees (or clusters), having the sink node as root. To construct the sub-trees,
    it applies a breadth-first search algorithm. After that, orthogonal channels are
    allocated to each subtree. The algorithm allows increasing the overall throughput
    by means of simultaneous transmission in different sub-trees. The drawback is
    that it is not able to eliminate the interference between nodes of the same subtree.
    In addition, dynamic variations in channel quality are not taken into account,
    and some assigned channels may present poor quality in certain periods of time,
    which would prevent the use of these channels in some moments. 4.1.2. Dynamic
    protocols In this category, the protocols use multiple channels simultaneously,
    in order to reduce collisions through scheduling strategies. These strategies
    prevent the same channel from being used at the same time slot by nodes that can
    cause interference with each other. Such protocols require a synchronization mechanism
    to ensure that the transmitter and receiver are on the same channel during the
    communication. The drawback occurs when broadcast packets are sent, and when new
    nodes are added. WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and TSCH standards use the dynamic
    approach. As an example of dynamic protocol is Y-MAC (Kim et al., 2008). It is
    a TDMA-based multi-channel MAC protocol that avoids redundant channel assignment
    by not allocating fixed channels to the nodes. When a traffic burst occurs, a
    receiver and potential senders hop to one of the other available channels, according
    to the hopping sequence. If each node has an exclusive send time slot in two-hop
    neighborhood, collision-free access to the medium is guaranteed. An alternative
    to the use of synchronization mechanisms in nodes is the asynchronous approach,
    with the use of a control channel. In this case, broadcast can also be supported
    through the control channel (Incel, 2011). This strategy has the advantage of
    not requiring clock synchronization between the sensor nodes, but presents a limitation
    due to the overhead of the negotiation process in the control channel, since periodically,
    the nodes need to listen to the control channel waiting for some message that
    indicates the start of a frame for data exchange. When nodes are waiting for control
    messages, the other channels remain idle. Another disadvantage is the bottleneck
    regarding the control channel, which may present low quality at certain moments,
    especially in dynamic environments. In dynamic protocols, usually the channel
    is chosen before each transmission. However, in order to improve the performance
    of the network, some mechanism for link quality estimation is necessary, and a
    correct management of the blacklist in each period. Link quality estimation is
    discussed in Section 4.2. 4.1.3. Semi-dynamic protocols There are several semi-dynamic
    protocols (Soua and Minet, 2015), but the most relevant and studied are MMSN (Zhou
    et al., 2006) and EM-MAC (Tang et al., 2011). The Multi-Frequency Media Access
    Control for Wireless Sensor Networks (MMSN) protocol consists of frequency assignment
    and media access aspects. The frequency assignment is used to assign different
    frequencies, or evenly allocate available frequencies if there are more neighbors
    than available frequencies, to nodes that have potential communication conflicts.
    It allows users to choose 1 of 4 available frequency assignment strategies. In
    media access design, nodes that have potential conflicts coordinate to access
    the shared physical frequencies, in a distributed way. The Dynamic Multichannel
    Energy-Efficient MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (EM-MAC) is a multichannel
    asynchronous duty-cycling MAC protocol initiated by the receiver, where a node
    sends a wake-up beacon to notify potential senders that it is awake and ready
    to receive data packets. It does not require nodes to synchronize their clocks,
    does not use a common control channel, and does not explicitly exchange channel
    and wake-up schedules. Instead, every node independently decides its own pseudo-random
    channel-switching behavior and wake-up times. In this category, channel exchange
    and simultaneous transmission in different channels are allowed, but the exchanges
    occur less frequently. In some approaches, receivers are associated to fixed channels,
    whereas transmitters change to the channel of each receiver when have packets
    to transmit. In this case, a synchronization mechanism may also be required if
    the receiver changes the channel over time. In Saifullah et al. (2014), the authors
    proposed three approaches for channel allocation in order to minimize conflicts
    among simultaneous transmissions. The first approach is based on the receiver,
    in which the channels are allocated to the receivers of the network. The second
    approach is based on the connections between the nodes, in which the channels
    are allocated for each link between two nodes, so that the same node can receive
    packets through different channels, from different transmitters. The two approaches
    aimed to make the network free from channel conflict, without interference due
    to simultaneous transmissions on the same channel. In both cases, the network
    was modeled as a graph, and an interference graph was created, in which the edges
    represent nodes that interfere with each other. After modeling the interference
    graph, an algorithm of graph coloring can be used to minimize the number of channels
    being used, in which the channels are modeled as the colors in the algorithm.
    The third approach aims to minimize the maximum level of interference at the nodes.
    This approach also uses an interference graph, and the algorithms are distributed
    and executed iteratively. The strategy first performs a static and distributed
    channel allocation phase in order to reduce collisions. After this phase, the
    protocol can work dynamically, when a connection-based approach is used. However,
    this approach has no mechanisms to adapt to dynamic variations in the network.
    4.2. Link quality estimation To maintain a certain level of QoS over long periods
    of time, it may be necessary to employ dynamic channel allocation strategies.
    The allocation must take into account the network topology to avoid neighboring
    subnets using the same or adjacent channels, and some mechanism to estimate the
    quality of the channels, since there may be spatial variations in the quality
    of the channels. Besides the ability to choose the best channel, the mechanism
    must allow fast network synchronization in case of channel switching. Experiments
    performed in Amzucu et al. (2014) with static nodes, found that a channel switch
    can lead up to 30 dB of difference in the received power. The channel quality
    estimators are the basis of several routing protocols, topology control, and dynamic
    channel allocation mechanisms (Baccour et al., 2012). In Gungor and Korkmaz (2012),
    there is an example of routing protocol that uses quality estimators, called CTP.
    It takes into account the asymmetry of the channels, and was discussed in Section
    2.3. The estimators must have good reactivity to changes and maintain good stability.
    Some of them are based on hardware through the Link Quality Indicator (LQI) and
    RSSI, others, in software (packet delivery ratio, amount of retransmissions, and
    so on). All packets received by IEEE 802.15.4 radios have an associated RSSI and
    LQI value, however RSSI can also be obtained independent of packet reception.
    In this case, the transceiver performs a channel energy scan, regardless of the
    source. Any device that generates noise and interference influences its value.
    LQI, on the other hand, can only be measured during packet reception, since its
    metric is based on the analysis of the first symbols of received packets. RSSI
    is more stable than LQI, except for very reflective environments, which present
    greater small-scale attenuation due to multipath fading (Baccour et al., 2012).
    Regarding the software-based estimators, they use information obtained from upper
    layers, such as PRR, and Required Number of Packet Transmissions (RNP). The use
    of metrics based on PRR allows a good estimation for links with a very high or
    very low quality, but presents some problems in intermediate links. When retransmission
    is used, PRR-based metrics may overestimate the link quality, since it does not
    consider the number of transmission attempts before a successful reception. RNP-based
    metrics estimate the required number of packet transmissions until a successful
    reception. The ETX and Four-Bit (FB) are examples of RNP-based estimators (Gomes
    et al., 2017b). The ETX estimator (De Couto et al., 2003) is initiated by the
    receiver, and when it estimates the PRR in both directions, it takes into consideration
    the link asymmetry. In order to calculate the PRR of the backward and forward
    links, probe broadcast packets are used, causing overhead in all nodes of the
    network and extra traffic. The FB estimator (Fonseca et al., 2007) is initiated
    by the sender and uses four bits of information. The first bit is obtained from
    the physical layer in order to identify the quality of the channel in a received
    packet. The second bit (ACK bit) is obtained from the link layer, and considers
    both forward and backward links. The last two bits are obtained from the network
    layer, and are useful for route decisions (Baccour et al., 2012). The ACK bit
    is determined using data packets and probe broadcast packets that are combined
    to compute an estimate of the ETX. The F-LQE estimator (Baccour et al., 2015)
    is initiated by the receiver and is based on fuzzy logic. It uses four metrics
    to characterize the link: packet delivery (SPRR), stability (SF), asymmetry (ASL),
    and channel quality (SNR or LQI). The first metric is the PRR filtered with an
    EWMA filter. The stability metric is the coefficient of variation of PRR. The
    third metric uses the PRR calculated in the neighbor nodes, and these values in
    each node are acquired using probe broadcast packets, and sent together with data
    packets. The calculus of SNR is performed using two values of RSSI, one sampled
    from a received packet, and other value sampled after the packet reception to
    obtain the noise floor. After that, both values are subtracted to obtain the SNR.
    The Opt-FLQE estimator (Rekik et al., 2015) is a modification of F-LQE to improve
    the reactivity and reduce the computational complexity. It uses a metric obtained
    at the sender, the Smoothed RNP (SRNP), instead of SF. The SRNP values are sent
    together with data packets to allow the receiver to calculate the Opt-FLQE metric.
    Other solution for LQE, called Lightweight Packet Error Discriminator (LPED) (Barac
    et al., 2014), uses Forward Error Correction (FEC) to perform channel diagnosis,
    and the information obtained from received data packets. LPED is capable of identifying
    fading or interference problems in the wireless channel, but does not provide
    metrics to assess the link quality in terms of a network performance indicator,
    such as PRR or RNP (Eskola and Heikkilä, 2016). This may lead the network to make
    changes in the routes or channels due to rapid variations in the quality of the
    channels, which causes instability in the protocol. The use of FEC can be useful
    also to recover some corrupted packets, but when good channels or routers are
    picked, the SNR is increased, and then the use of FEC may not be advantageous.
    In Gungor and Korkmaz (2012), a simulation study was performed to compare PRR,
    RNP, WMEWMA, ETX, and FB on the CTP protocol for smart grid environments. The
    results showed that ETX and FB presented a better performance in such harsh environments,
    since only both estimators consider the link asymmetry among the evaluated LQEs.
    In the experiments described in Baccour et al. (2015), F-LQE outperformed ETX
    and FB, and in Rekik et al. (2015), a performance analysis showed that OptFLQE
    is more reactive than F-LQE, while still being more reliable for smart grid environments.
    In Rekik et al. (2016), Opt-FLQE was compared to ETX and FB on the RPL routing
    protocol for smart-grid environments, and the simulations showed that Opt-FLQE
    outperformed ETX and FB for all evaluated metrics. In Gomes et al., 2017b the
    authors proposed a Link Quality Estimator (LQE) for IWSN, and a new type of node,
    the LQE node, that estimates the link quality in real-time, using RSSI, and information
    obtained from received data packets. The proposed LQE is capable of capturing
    the effects of multipath, interference, and link asymmetry. Experiments were performed
    in a real industrial environment using IEEE 802.15.4 radios, and models were developed
    to allow the use of RSSI samples to proper estimate the link quality. A comparison
    was performed with the Opt-FLQE, and the results showed that the estimator described
    in Gomes et al., 2017b is more accurate and reactive for the type of environment
    in study. Different from other LQEs in literature, in the proposed LQE the sensor
    nodes do not need to send broadcast probe packets. Besides, using the LQE node,
    the other nodes of the WSN do not need to stop their operation to monitor the
    link quality. In this solution, no overhead is imposed on the end nodes, and there
    is no dependence on the size of the packets, as in LPED, for example. 5. WSN platforms,
    operating systems and simulators The terms sensor node, Wireless Node (WN), Smart
    Dust, mote, and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) mote are used somewhat interchangeably
    in the industry; the most general terms used here are sensor node and mote. The
    sensor nodes usually have one or more sensor units, a power supply run by batteries
    or connected to the power distribution company, a processing unit used to handle
    onboard data processing/storage/encryption/digital modulation, a transceiver,
    which combines radio transmitter/receiver, and is connected to the antenna, as
    depicted in Fig. 16(a). Download : Download high-res image (263KB) Download :

    Sohraby et al. (2007). The processors in wireless sensors are commonly referred
    as microcontrollers (MCU), and some of the characteristics why these MCU are especially
    suited to embedded systems are their flexibility in connecting with other devices
    (like sensors), their instruction set enabled to time-critical signal processing,
    and their typically low power consumption. In addition, they are freely programmable
    and hence very flexible (Karl and Willig, 2005). Besides these characteristics,
    MCU have the ability to reduce their power consumption by going into sleep states
    where only parts of the controller are active. MCU that are used in several wireless
    sensor node prototypes include the Atmel processor or Texas Instrument''s MSP430
    (Instruments, 2004). Table 2 shows some examples and characteristics of MCU from
    both Atmel and Texas Instruments. Table 2. WSN Platforms and characteristics.

    TinyOS/Contiki TinyOS/Contiki Concerning the transceiver, currently popular product
    series include, for example, the RFM TR1001, the Chipcon CC1000 and CC2420, and
    the Infineon TDA525x family. The TR1000 family of radio transceivers from RF Monolithics
    is available for the 916 MHz and 868 MHz frequency range. It is intended for short-range
    radio communication with up to 115.2 kbps (Monolithics, 2000). Mica motes use
    RFM TR1000 transceiver and contain a set of hardware accelerators. Chipcon CC1000
    operates between 300 and 1000 MHz, programmable in steps of 250 Hz. It uses FSK
    as modulation, provides RSSI, and has programmable output power. It is possible
    to use it in frequency hopping protocols (Instruments, 2009). CC2420 (Instruments,
    2014) implements PHY layer as prescribed by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard with the
    required support for the MAC of this standard. The transceiver operates in 2.4
    GHz band and features the required DSSS modem, resulting in a data rate of 250
    kbps. The Infineon TDA 525x family provides flexible, single-chip, energy-efficient
    transceivers. Naturally, embedded software has to fulfill resource requirements,
    and the requirements are related to constraints such as limited memory consumption,
    available computing power, consumable energy, power dissipation, and so on. Embedded
    systems can be programmed in a wide variety of languages like assembly, C, C++,
    and Java. They differ in many aspects, such as the abstraction level at which
    the program is written and with that the granularity of control over the processor.
    Connected to the hardware of the sensor nodes, there are the following main software
    subsystems, as depicted in Fig. 16(b): • Operating System (OS): designed to run
    on types of devices that are severely constrained in memory, power, processing
    power, and communication bandwidth. Contiki and TinyOS are two examples of this
    kind of OS. Contiki is an open source OS for IoT, and connects tiny low-cost,
    low-power microcontrollers to the Internet. TinyOS is an open source, BSD-licensed
    operating system designed for low-power wireless devices. It provides useful software
    abstractions, also called Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), of the underlying
    device hardware (Amjad et al., 2016). Table 3 describes the OS for resource-constrained
    devices; Table 3. Operating systems. Name Architecture Scheduler Model Supported

    are the software modules that manage basic functions of the sensor, and the details
    of the radio channel transmission link, including clocking and synchronization,
    signal encoding, bit recovery, bit counting, signal levels, and modulation transceivers;
    • Mini-applications: data processing, signal-value storage and manipulation applications.
    They are supported at the node level for in-network processing; • Communication
    Processors: manage the communication functions, including routing, packet buffering
    and forwarding, topology maintenance, medium access control and encryption. 5.1.
    Operating systems This section analyzes existing WSN operating system, and the
    following list presents the main OS used for WSN: 5.1.1. TinyOS It is one of the
    first OS specifically designed for WSN. Its architecture consists of a scheduler
    and a set of connected components (Dargie and Poellabauer, 2010). Components are
    classified into configuration components and modules. The former specifies how
    two or more modules are connected with each other, and the latter are the basic
    building blocks of a TinyOS program. The composition of multiple configurations
    into a single executable code produces a TinyOS application. In TinyOS, scheduled
    tasks are based on FIFO principle, and TinyOS architecture is effective for tasks
    that are of short duration. Resource allocation in TinyOS is optimized by adopting
    a static memory allocation, which avoids the extra overhead associated with dynamic
    allocation. 5.1.2. Contiki It is another open source OS specifically designed
    for WSN. The Contiki kernel is event-driven like TinyOS, and the system includes
    protothreads that provide a thread-like programming abstraction but with a very
    small memory overhead. Protothreads in Contiki are a combination of some features
    of events and threads. They can be viewed as lightweight (stackless) threads,
    but they can also be viewed as interruptible tasks in event-based programming
    (Dunkels et al., 2006). Contiki provides IP communication, both for IPv4 and IPv6.
    The uIP embedded IP stack is used by hundreds of companies in systems such as
    freighter ships, satellites and oil drilling equipment. The idea of using IP communication
    in low-power WSN has led to an IETF standard and an international industry alliance
    - IP for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance (IPSO Alliance - promoting the use of IP
    for Smart Objects8). One of the interesting features of the Contiki OS is its
    support of dynamic loading and reconfiguration of services. This is achieved by
    defining services, service interfaces, service stubs, and a service layer. Services
    are to Contiki what modules are to TinyOS (Dargie and Poellabauer, 2010). Contiki
    includes several add-ons and libraries providing communication functionalities
    (Watteyne et al., 2012). The most relevant is the ContikiMAC (Dunkels,), a CSMA/CA
    preamble-sampling MAC using periodical wake-ups to listen for packet transmissions
    from neighbors. The μIPv6 library provides 6LoWPAN and RPL routing functionality.
    The transport layer implements both UDP and a lightweight version of TCP. Contiki
    also implements CoAP, similar to OpenWSN. 5.1.3. OpenWSN Another example of OS
    is Berkeley OpenWSN (Watteyne et al., 2012) which have primarily implemented their
    proposed communication protocols in TinyOS. Berkeley OpenWSN is an open source
    stack intending to implement low-power wireless standards such as IEEE 802.15.4e,
    6LoWPAN, RPL and CoAP. It is rooted in the new IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH. Among the
    platforms that can run OpenWSN are GINA (AT86RF231), TelosB (CC2420), LPC (AT86RF231),
    and K20 (AT86RF231). The micro-controller of the first two platforms are developed
    by Texas Instruments, and the last two are NXP and Freescale, respectively. 5.1.4.
    RIOT It was developed with focus on the requirements of IoT (Baccelli et al.,
    2013). RIOT is a microkernel-based RTOS with multi-threading support, using an
    architecture inherited from FireKernel (Will et al., 2009). The OS is written
    in C and the applications and libraries are implemented in C++. RIOT features
    several network stacks, including its own implementation of the full 6LoWPAN stack
    (GNRC stack), a port of the 6TiSCH stack OpenWSN, and a port of the information
    centric networking stack CCN-lite (Hahm et al.) 5.2. Network simulators There
    is a number of network simulators (Wehrle et al., 2010) developed for several
    environments. The four main simulators that support simulation of LR-WPAN are
    described in this section. They are very used in the literature because of the
    resources provided. They are TOSSIM, COOJA, NS2/NS3 and OMNeT++. Regarding OMNeT++,
    this paper gives a special attention to one of its frameworks, Castalia, because
    of its realistic model based on CC2420 and CC1000 radio transceivers, and the
    wireless channel model developed by the authors of this survey to simulate IWSN.
    5.2.1. TOSSIM It is a simulator with the specific goal of transparently running
    TinyOS applications (Wehrle et al., 2010). The component-oriented software architecture
    of TinyOS supports integration into a simulator, in which a hardware abstraction
    is provided by software components with specific interfaces, which are enforced
    at compile time. The simulation is event-driven and radio communication is modeled
    with bit error rates for each uni-directional link. The radio model is quite simplistic,
    not describing accurately interference caused by simultaneous transmissions. The
    simulator is also missing some other features such as mobility models. 5.2.2.
    COOJA It is a WSN simulator based on the Contiki OS. It is a Java-based simulator
    that executes native code by making Java Native Interface (JNI) calls from the
    Java environment to a compiled Contiki system. COOJA provides both the OS emulation
    and the instruction set emulation in a single framework. The MSPSim (Eriksson
    et al., 2009) is used as the instruction set simulator, and is also written in
    Java. It supports the Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller and includes some
    hardware peripherals such as sensor, communication ports, LEDs, and sound devices.
    5.2.3. NS2/NS3 NS2 is an event-driven object-oriented network simulator whose
    simulations are realized in C++ language and object-oriented Tcl (OTcl). The NS3
    simulator is an improvement of NS2, and is, as its predecessor, developed in the
    C++ but OTcl is neglected in favor of C++ (network models) and the Python language
    (optional). NS3 is a robust simulator developed for Internet systems, but it does
    not have very large focus on the lower layers of the protocols stack. NS3 has
    a LR-WPAN project in constant development9 to simulate WSN. It has several models
    implemented, including 6LoWPAN, RPL models. 5.2.4. OMNeT++ The Objective Modular
    Network Testbed simulation environment is an open-source discrete-event tool based
    on C++ and used for the simulations of communication networks, multiprocessors,
    and various distributed systems. It consists of modules that communicate with
    each other using message passing. Simple modules can be grouped together to form
    more complex compound modules. A user defines the structure of a module using
    OMNeT++ topology description language NED. It is often quoted as a discrete event
    simulator, but in fact, it is a software that supports various simulation models
    and frameworks such as the INET Framework, MiXiM and Castalia. Model frameworks
    are developed independent of the simulation framework, and follow their own release
    cycles. • INET Framework is an open-source communication networks simulation package,
    which contains models for several Internet protocols: UDP, TCP, SCTP, IP, IPv6,
    Ethernet, PPP, IEEE 802.11, MPLS, OSPF, and others. The INET Framework also contains
    emulation capabilities; • MiXiM supports wireless and mobile simulations. It provides
    detailed models of the wireless channel (fading, etc.), wireless connectivity,
    mobility models, models for obstacles and many communication protocols especially
    at the MAC level. Furthermore, it provides a user-friendly graphical representation
    of wireless and mobile networks, and supports debugging; • Castalia is a simulator
    for WSN, Body Area Networks and generally, networks of low-power embedded devices.
    Researchers and developers can use it to test their distributed algorithms and
    protocols in a realistic wireless channel and radio model (CC1000 and CC2420).
    Castalia uses the log-normal shadowing model as one of the ways to model average
    path loss. It also models temporal variation of path loss as an effort to capture
    fading phenomena in changing environments. Considering simulators with focus on
    industrial environments, some papers described simulation studies of IWSN (Du
    et al., 2015, Alderisi et al., 2015), but none of them considered the non-stationary
    characteristics of the wireless channel for a long term, neither the uncorrelation
    between different channels. In Gomes et al. (2017a), it is described a simple
    and reliable model to simulate multi-channel protocols for IWSN that captures
    the effects of fading, shadowing, and the non-stationary characteristics of the
    channel. It also considers the differences in the characteristics of the different
    channels, and the asymmetry of the links. In Gomes et al. (2017a), the MAC protocols
    CSMA/CA and TSCH were evaluated using the proposed model. It was integrated into
    the open source simulator Castalia. 6. Systematic mapping of IWSN researches WSNs
    are becoming increasingly popular, especially in industrial environments. Several
    researches have been conducted to investigate such environments and the standards
    used to improve the QoS, as discussed in the previous sections. According to Google
    Trends, depicted in Fig. 17, the term ZigBee, if compared to the other terms of
    standards, WirelessHART, 802.15.4e, and ISA100.11a, is by far the most researched
    term in Google tool, but it has been decreasing in interest since its peak in
    March 2005, as depicted in Fig. 17a). ZigBee was conceived in 1998, standardized
    in 2003, and revised in 2006. In a comparison shown in this Figure, the other
    standards do not even appear in the graphic. Download : Download high-res image

    WirelessHART, 802.15.4e, ISA100.11a, and ZigBee. When ZigBee is removed from the
    graph, the other standards can be easily visualized in Fig. 17b). It can be seen
    that, like ZigBee, WirelessHART has been decreasing in interest as a search term
    since June 2010. This graph also shows when the three standards began to be researched
    with WirelessHART in April 2007, 802.15.4e and ISA100.11a standards around March
    2008. Officially presented in July 2009, ISA100.11a has not drawn the attention
    of researchers as much as WirelessHART, and officially presented in 2007, WirelessHART
    remains as one of the main standards researched. Since IEEE 802.15.4e defines
    improvements of IEEE 802.15.4 standard, it tends to draw more attention of researchers
    in the future, going against the decline of the other standards. Regarding scientific
    research, usually when trying to perform it, a researcher starts his work conducting
    primary studies, which is an empirical study that investigates a specific question.
    In the next step, the researcher leaves for secondary study, which reviews all
    primary studies related to a specific research question, in order to integrate
    and synthetize the evidence related to a specific research question. A systematic
    mapping is a form of secondary study performed to obtain a comprehensive overview
    of a given research topic, identify research gaps, and collect evidences to commission
    future research. Being a widespread methodology in areas such as medicine, the
    first works in systematic mapping connected to information technology emerged
    with software engineering. The first step to start this kind of study is setting
    a topic to be mapped, and then identifying the research questions. Based on these
    questions, one must create search strings and submit them to scientific search
    engines. The results must be analyzed according to inclusion and exclusion criteria
    defined in the study protocols. The last step is the classification of the works
    following a predefined taxonomy displaying results in graphs and tables. In order
    to achieve this goal, studies published in recent journals, and conferences available
    at three relevant electronic databases were collected and analyzed, namely: IEEE
    Xplore, ScienceDirect, and ACM Digital. The protocol is organized as follows:
    • Setting Scheme: in this case, the theme was set to ”industrial wireless sensor
    networks”; • Search Strings: for this mapping, the automatic search process is
    used. The semantics used for the search was: ((“Abstract”: industrial wireless
    sensor networks) AND industry industrial wireless). The papers lists are stored,
    and the results are listed in Table 4; Table 4. Results found in each database.

    • Steps (S): the filtering is performed in two steps. In the first step (S1),
    the title, abstract and keywords are analyzed according to the search string.
    Once this step is concluded, the second step (S2) is regarding a full analysis
    of the paper, and takes into consideration the selection criteria listed as follows;
    • Selection Criteria: they were used to evaluate each retrieved primary study.
    The main goal is the inclusion of potentially relevant studies to answer the Research
    Questions (RQ), and exclude those that are irrelevant, duplicated, and not written
    in English. These selection criteria were used to filter the papers in the second
    step (S2). The following Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria (IC and EC) were considered:IC:
    papers that present studies about IWSN and experiments inside this environment
    regarding the communication issues;EC1: papers that do not present results and
    do not have industry as the main concern;EC2: subjects and technologies that were
    not discussed in this paper, such as Multimedia Sensor Networks, Software-Defined
    Networking (SDN), Big Data, Cloud Computing, Wireless Nano Sensor Networks, Open
    Communication protocol for Ad hoc Reliable industrial Instrumentation (OCARI),
    industrial control systems which use Network Control System (NCS) and Supervisory
    Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Data-muling, Service-Oriented Architecture
    (SOA), DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications), Crowdsourcing-based
    Industrial Sensing Intelligence (CISI), energy harvesting systems, technologies
    unsuitable for industrial monitoring such as Bluetooth, 802.11, and Arduino, general-purpose
    security issues, and connection to wired systems;EC3: automation applications
    cover a broad domain from industrial automation, home automation to automation
    in body area networks, and have specific real-time requirements differing from
    each other depending on the criticality of the application. Therefore, all the
    issues regarding automation applications are excluded, except for the industrial
    applications;EC4: underwater monitoring has been extensively researched, but since
    this environment is outdoor and differs from the common industrial environment,
    it is excluded;EC5: studies that are table of contents, tutorial, editorial, keynote
    talk, Ph.D. forum abstract, or summary of conference. • Research Questions (RQ):
    RQ1 - How are the distributed publications over the years about IWSN, considering
    S1 papers? RQ2 - Who are the researchers with the largest amount of published
    works, considering S1 papers? RQ3 - Which are the main Journals and Conferences
    that publish most papers about IWSN, considering S1 papers? Considering S2 papers,
    the following RQ were defined: RQ4 - Which are the main standards used in IWSN?
    RQ5 - Which type of analysis is performed by the papers, experiments, simulations,
    or both? Among the simulators used, which are the most used? RQ6 - Regarding the
    devices and OS, which are the most used? Although the mentioned standards are
    used in industry and most of them were designed for this environment, not always
    the papers have this environment as focus, so those that did not consider the
    research in it were discarded. The first RQ relates to the distribution of publications
    over the years. In Fig. 18, it is shown that researches about IWSN began around
    2004. The original version of 802.15.4 PHY was developed in 2003, with revisions
    from 2006. The peak in 2016 of papers published can be explained because of improvements
    regarding the IEEE 802.15.4-2011 standard, and the new concepts of IoT and IIoT.
    The concept of IIoT in manufacturing came up, and leads to the fourth industrial
    revolution, the so-called Industry 4.0 (smart factory), which in 2013 had its
    final report presented. Although seven articles were found in 2017, they were
    not included in this chart because the year has not yet been finalized. Download

    Papers published per year about IWSN after S1. The RQ2 is regarding the researchers
    who most published papers in literature about IWSN, and the result is illustrated
    in Table 5. According to the search string, the authors are listed ordered by
    the number of contributions. This list is limited to 16 researchers, but it does
    not mean that other authors have not contributed somehow, and does not mean that
    some of them are more important than the others, but this list aims to help other
    researchers to draw their studies to the research object in question. In addition,
    the listed authors may have contributed with other papers not filtered in this
    systematic mapping. The results intend only to create a statistical view of researches
    developed and their authors. Table 5. Number of contributions by author. Researcher

    used standards in industrial environments, and ZigBee leads the list, followed
    by WirelessHART. This can be explained because ZigBee is much older than WirelessHART,
    since in 2007 it was the main standard researched. Although the massive use of
    ZigBee, in Barac et al. (2015) new researches found that none of those standards
    were able to deal with industrial applications with stringent timing requirements.
    To overcome this problem, IEEE 802.15.4e was developed, and it is shown in third
    place after WirelessHART. The study of IEEE 802.15.4e tends to increase along
    the years because of its strategies to deal with Multipath Fading and Attenuation
    (MFA) and interference requirements. Download : Download high-res image (128KB)

    RQ5, according to Fig. 20 a), most papers performed simulations more than experiments.
    Only 13% performed experiments after simulations, in order to corroborate with
    the results presented by the simulations. More important than simulations, the
    experiments have the ability to validate in real environments or with real devices,
    the implementation of the proposed solution. When considering the simulations,
    Fig. 20b) depicts the main used simulators. It is shown that Matlab, OPNET and
    NS2, followed by QualNet, Simulink and OMNeT++ are the most used tools to simulate
    protocols and environments for IWSNs. Matlab allows implementation of algorithms
    and interfacing with programs written in other languages, including C, C++, etc.,
    so it is very used across industry and academia. Download : Download high-res

    by the papers and main simulators used in them. In the case of papers, instead
    of NS3, the most used version is its previous one. This can be explained by some
    reasons: the latest version of NS2 was released in late 2011 (2.35) with several
    improvements, and remains in active use and maintained; the differences between
    NS2 and NS3 are numerous, and NS2 scripts do not run within NS3. Therefore, for
    researchers that are used to NS2, changing to NS3 requires study and adaptation,
    which is not always possible in a short time. Although NS3 has improved models,
    NS2 still remains as a good option to test models and algorithms. OPNET was a
    software business that provided performance management for computer networks and
    applications. Its company was founded in 1986 and went public in 2000. In October
    2012, OPNET was acquired by Riverbed Technology. Prior this acquisition, it had
    an OPNET Modeler (now Riverbed Modeler), a software tool for computer network
    modeling and simulation. Since the tool is not free-of-charge, it was not included
    in this paper. Regarding the devices and OS asked in RQ6, depicted in Fig. 21,
    the most used platforms are TelosB, CC2420, MicaZ, IRIS and Tmote Sky. Several
    platforms features Chipcon CC2420 radio by Texas Instruments for wireless communications,
    such as Tmote Sky, Zolertia Z1, MicaZ, TelosB, and others, but some papers that
    used it were not specific in defining which exact platforms they used, so it was
    separated when the platform was not explicit. Concerning the OS, TinyOS is by
    large the most popular OS for IWSN because of its support for several platforms.
    Contiki, which is the second of the list, is more suitable for IIoT, and since
    there are several papers with focus on real-time communications, FreeRTOS also
    appeared in the list. Download : Download high-res image (215KB) Download : Download

    7. Discussion There are many studies about the IWSN challenges, which have been
    discussed in the previous sections. In this section, some examples of potential
    approaches to deal with the challenges are discussed. Some of the approaches are
    as follows: 7.1. Resource constraints UWB (Ultra-WideBand) is a form of radio
    transmission that creates short pulses of low-energy radiation (Zeng et al., 2015).
    The width of the pulse gives it the property of generating radio energy over a
    wide frequency range, with very low energy, at any frequency. This allows UWB
    to overlap other radio bands such as Wi-Fi and the other services in the 2.4 GHz
    ISM band without interfering. Generally, other radio modulation schemes such as
    DSSS will see UWB as just impulse noise, which they easily filter out. Since UWB
    uses pulses, it is capable of being detected over a much longer range than other
    signal forms. Pulses signals also tend to penetrate solid objects better than
    continuous wave signals. Low-energy radiation requires less transmit power and
    results in longer battery life for battery-powered devices. The peculiar characteristics
    of the UWB radio technique offer new solutions and opportunities for industrial
    wireless application (Paso et al., 2013). Other important topic regarding resource
    constraints is the cooperation mechanism to reduce energy consumption at the cost
    of an acceptable reduced throughput. TDMA-based multihop mesh networks with cooperation
    mechanism is an example of approach that has not been much researched (Iqbal et
    al., 2017). The use of data aggregation is another research topic to be explored
    (Dobslaw et al., 2015). It significantly improves the end-to-end contention and
    energy efficiency compared to single packet transmissions. In combination with
    techniques such as redundant relays, re-transmission, hybrid and hierarchical
    network structures, multiple channel communication and slot-reuse, data aggregation
    can play a crucial role in making wireless networks for industrial applications
    practically feasible. 7.2. Dynamic topologies and dynamic solutions When considering
    the dynamic characteristics of industrial environments, it is important to think
    about dynamic solutions to guarantee the quality of communications (Collotta et
    al., 2012). There are researches about dynamic and distributed topology control
    with self-organizing properties, and decentralized dynamic topology control algorithms
    capable to construct tree-based topologies for use in performance critical applications.
    Other options are regarding dynamically allocated GTS slots, dynamic time division
    multiple access, and dynamically update sampling times. The first one can be configured
    to deal with sporadic and periodic events. With the use of an implicit decision
    used in deallocation/deflation, the control traffic is kept low resulting in low
    battery consumption. The second one considers a cluster topology, and in the inter-cluster
    part, a quick assign algorithm and a dynamic maximum link algorithm can be developed
    to meet the quick networking or minimum frame size requirements. The last one
    intends to ensure a better possible management of critical situations regardless
    of network protocol (since it may work at application level of protocol stack)
    and topology used. Other issue regarding dynamic solutions to provide reliability
    is the creation of redundant links dynamically. An example of a protocol that
    provides redundancy for industrial applications is RWCP (Reliable Wireless Communication
    Protocol) (Yu and Feng, 2009). 7.3. Real-time constraints Several papers address
    real-time constraints in IWSN. When errors or exceptions occur, high-criticality
    flows must be guaranteed reliably and in real time, and only a few works focus
    on mixed-criticality industrial systems. In this case, one option to solve this
    problem is optimizing the scheduling policy of mixed criticality IWSN. Other option
    is using an end-to-end delay analysis approach for fixed priority scheduling in
    mixed criticality in standards such as WirelessHART networks, which can be used
    to determine whether all flows can be delivered to destinations within their deadline.
    Other research direction is the creation of a real-time multi-channel process
    control monitoring system, such as in Blevins et al. (2015). Some papers propose
    multi-channel process monitoring algorithms that brings a balance between timeliness
    and throughput by increasing in number of operating channels. Regarding clustering
    strategy to deal with real-time constraints, one alternative is partitioning a
    network into a nonfixed number of nonoverlapping clusters according to the communication
    network topology and measurements distribution. 7.4. Security There are not much
    studies in the literature related to security issues in IWSN. Many industrial
    applications including equipment monitoring, environment monitoring, and industrial
    automation may be susceptible to different kinds of attacks. The peculiarities
    of industrial networks restrict the use of classical approaches to security (Cheminod
    et al., 2013). The cognition and reconfigurability of cognitive radios central
    to their functioning introduce a new class of security concerns distinct to those
    evident in conventional wireless networks (Fragkiadakis et al., 2013). Ensuring
    reliability and providing adequate security in these crucial services provided
    by WSNs will reinforce their acceptability as a viable and dependable technology
    in the factory and industrial domain. 7.5. Quality of service Since sensor data
    are typically time-sensitive, it is important to receive the data at the sink
    in a timely manner. Several are the researches intended to maintain QoS of communications
    in IWSNs. Some study adaptive frequency hopping approaches that allow IWSN to
    switch cognitively working channels for high transmission reliability. Adaptive
    frequency hopping (AFH) is a good topic to be researched, since it reduces the
    probability of inefficient frequency hopping, e.g., hopping from good channels
    to bad ones. Other topic is autonomous channel switching design, in which each
    accessed sensor autonomously equalizes the local channel occupations within its
    range of spectrum sensing without overhead on exchanging the sensors’ spectrum
    sensing reports. Other works study synchronization protocols, such as Flooding
    Time Synchronization Protocol (FTSP), and tighter time synchronization. The first
    one has high synchronization precision in WSN, and can be improved according to
    the characteristics of IWSN. The second one gives less latency, better bandwidth
    utilization, less jitter on the application. Regarding cluster topologies, one
    issue to be studied is the optimized aggregators selection problem. Clustering
    sensor nodes is an effective technique to achieve in-network aggregation in WSN,
    and the selection of a few aggregators from the sensor nodes can significantly
    reduce the data collection cost. Other research topics to guarantee QoS are delay-aware
    scheduling algorithms, and link state dependent scheduling, such as in Hong et
    al. (2015). The first one adds time slots for retransmission to each link in order
    to satisfy required reliability. Furthermore, by sharing retransmission slots
    among different flows, the method achieves the required reliability and forwarding
    delay while suppressing increase in the number of allocated slots. The second
    one allows the nodes to gather samples of the channel quality in order to generate
    prediction sets from the sample sets in independent slots. Using the prediction
    sets, nodes only wake up to transmit/receive during scheduled slots that are predicted
    to be clear and sleep during scheduled slots that may potentially cause a transmitted
    signal to fade. 8. Conclusion In this paper, an overview of the most relevant
    technologies and the various facts (configurability) concerning the deployment
    of WSN in harsh environments has been performed. Among such a kind of environments,
    the industrial one is one of the most relevant due to the increasing role of WSNs
    in industry. Furthermore, the analysis has taken into account the experiments
    and simulation results to discuss the various issues which particularly appear
    in IWSN. First, the paper discusses some general facts regarding IWSN such as
    layers and protocols as an introduction, to the particular case of the various
    standards used in IWSN. Then the discussion focuses on the most extended and used
    standards in IWSN with special emphasis on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, and its
    amendment IEEE 802.15.4e. One of the particularities of ISWN is the channel behavior
    that suffers from various typical disturbances: interference from other systems
    operating in the same band, deep multipath fading, noise and shadowing strong
    attenuation. Given such a harsh transmission media, appropriate protocols should
    be developed to improve the network reliability and reach the maximum network
    throughput while preserving a moderate power consumption although this is not
    the main constraint but channel availability and reliability. One of the main
    conclusion that can be drawn from the research shown in this paper is that DSME
    protocol is a good alternative to implement IWSN if compared to the beacon-enabled
    mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Although it is based on the latter, some improvements
    have been included, such as the use of multiple channels in the CFP (GTS). The
    best protocol to choose depends on the application requirements. For example,
    for applications that require very low latencies, the use of LLDN mode and star
    topology may be more appropriate. When comparing the performance of DSME vs. TSCH
    in IWSN, the first one shows a slightly better performance, lower energy consumption
    and higher spectral efficiency. On the other hand, TSCH performance is improved
    when using adaptive frequency hopping to avoid the use of channels affected by
    interferences (with low quality). Another relevant issue in the development of
    ISWN is the use of the appropriate OS. While TelosB remains as a good choice in
    the development and deployment of IWSN other OS like Contiki, which is gaining
    popularity because it supports dynamic loading and reconfiguration of services,
    and OpenWSN are being increasingly used in ISWN implementation. A key parameter
    that characterizes an OS for ISWN is the low-power operation. An ISWN implementation
    should take into consideration some performance parameters, among them the required
    bandwidth and transmission power. The lower the transmit power the longer the
    battery life. Protocols and media access impact the required transmit power. TDMA-based
    multihop mesh networks with cooperation mechanism seems to be a proper framework
    for this goal. An IWSN shows dynamic characteristics, which are typical in industrial
    environments. In consequence, in order to optimize the overall network throughput
    and guarantee a high reliability appropriate dynamic topologies and dynamic solutions
    are required. The most common techniques are dynamically allocating GTS slots,
    dynamic time division multiple access, and dynamically update sampling times.
    The most appropriate solution depends on several network parameters. Currently,
    real-time constraints focus on mixed-criticality industrial systems. Various solutions
    have been developed where the which showed to be more effective are optimizing
    the scheduling policy and the end-to-end delay analysis approach for fixed priority
    scheduling. Security is a critical service in ISWN. The use of new and flexible
    protocols provides cognition and reconfigurability of cognitive radios central
    to their functioning, which introduces a new class of security challenges. Acknowledgment

    network protection (Luvisotto et al., 2019; Aalsalem et al., 2018; Queiroz et

  explanation: This research study proposes a novel farm management system that harnesses
    Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the LoRa communication protocol to efficiently
    collect environmental data from a large network of sensor nodes distributed across
    vast farmland. The system's design is centered around the UAV serving as a mobile
    gateway, autonomously searching for optimal positions where it can establish stable
    communication with multiple sensor nodes dispersed over the farm. To enhance data
    retrieval efficiency, the nodes organize themselves into smaller clusters, each
    with a designated representative node, thereby reducing the UAV's travel distance
    and data collection time. Furthermore, a Hamming code is utilized to ensure data
    integrity amidst potential bit errors during transmission.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Jeju Island, Korea (South) SECTION I. Introduction
    In recent years, countries where agriculture is a major industry (e.g., countries
    in Southeast Asia) own vast tracts of farmland, and especially, the farmland of
    Vietnam occupies more than one third of the total land area of the country. In
    these countries, IoT (Internet of Things) system to improve the efficiency of
    farming operations on the vast farmland are attracting attention. On the other
    hand, in order to collect environmental information related to the growth condition
    of crops from anyway of the vast farmland, the construction of sensor networks
    using LPWA (Low-Power Wide-Area) has been attracting attention. The LPWA enables
    long-distance communication with low power consumption because the frequency band
    with good propagation characteristics (920/429 MHz band) is used. However, it
    is difficult to maintain a clear line of sight between the gateway (i.e., the
    central point of the sensor networks) and the sensor nodes on farms where there
    are many obstacles such as crops and agricultural machinery, hence it makes long-distance
    wireless communication difficult even when using the LPWA. In addition, even when
    the clear line of sight from the sensor nodes is ensured, if a large number of
    sensor nodes transmit sensor data at a time of their choosing, the radio waves
    may interfere with each other, which makes the gateway impossible to receive the
    sensor data correctly. Therefore, in this study, we develop a sensor network system
    using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that can move freely in the sky. In the
    proposed system, the UAV works as a gateway to collect the sensor data from the
    sensor nodes and move autonomously for searching the locations where they can
    maintain good communication property from sensor nodes dispersed over a wide area
    of a large farm. In addition, the sensor node transmits the sensor data to the
    UAV through LoRa communication which is one type of the LPWA. In order to improve
    the efficiency of the sensor data retrieval, the sensor nodes within the same
    area of the farm construct clusters and select one representative node in each
    cluster. The representative node aggregates the environmental information received
    from the other nodes in the clusters and sends the aggregated information to the
    gateway (i.e., UAV). Furthermore, in order to prevent radio interference caused
    by simultaneous data transmission from the multiple sensor nodes, the TDMA (Time
    Division Multiple Access)-based media access control mechanism is adapted. In
    this mechanism, different time slots are assigned to the sensor nodes in the same
    cluster so as to transmit the environmental information to the representative
    node at a different timing. In addition, when choosing representative node in
    the cluster, the sensor nodes implements CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)based
    media access control mechanism. In this mechanism, each sensor node checks communication
    status of other nodes before starting the communication and autonomously decides
    an appropriate timing for exchanging the metric of deciding the representative
    node with others for preventing the interference. Furthermore, an error-correcting
    code is leveraged to correctly transmit the information between the sensor nodes
    and gateway even when the bit error occurs during the data transmission. SECTION
    II. Related Works and Objectives of Our Study A. Management System using LoRa
    Communication In the existing studies, the environmental observation systems utilizing
    LoRa for agriculture have been proposed so far. The objective of the existing
    system is to collect environmental information from sensor nodes installed on
    farms using LoRa communication [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]. In the reference of [2]
    [4] [5] [6], various kinds of sensor data (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.)
    are simultaneously measured inside the greenhouse and are transmitted to the base
    station using the LoRa communication to manage the condition of the farm. However,
    in these existing studies, the authors have not assumed a realistic condition
    where there are various types of obstacles (e.g., crops, agricultural machinery)
    which interfere with the long distance communication of LoRa. B. Localization
    System using Received Signal Strength In existing studies, an object localization
    system based on received signal strength is proposed [8] [9]. Especially, in our
    previous study, Andon et al. have proposed a system in which a UAV autonomously
    searches for a distressed person carrying a beacon transmitter (i.e., LoRa-supported
    device) in a mountainous area [10]. In this system, the UAV measures signal strength
    of the radio waves and estimates the direction of the distressed person who owns
    the beacon devices. Here, the authors have clarified that the fuselage of the
    UAV blocks radio waves and the received signal strength of radio waves arriving
    from a specific direction becomes large. However, the existing localization system
    of the previous study is focusing on only a single beacon device and does not
    search for an appropriate position where the communication quality to the multiple
    sensor nodes becomes good. C. Objectives of This Study This study proposes a farm
    management system that uses UAVs and LoRa communication for efficiently obtains
    the environmental information from a large number of sensor nodes deployed on
    the vast farm. In the proposed system, the UAV works as a gateway which collects
    the environmental information from the sensor nodes, and autonomously searches
    points where the gateway can achieve stable communications with multiple sensor
    nodes. In addition, the proposed system constructs clusters with nearby sensor
    nodes and chooses a representative node of each cluster. This mechanism can reduce
    the traveling distance of the UAV because the UAV needs to communicate with only
    the representative nodes for obtaining all environmental information of the farm.
    Furthermore, a Hamming code is utilized to correctly transmit the information
    between the sensor node and the gateway even when the bit error occurs during
    the data transmission. Fig. 1. Overview of the Proposed System Show All SECTION
    III. Proposed Farm Management System An overview of the proposed system is shown
    in Fig. 1. The proposed system consists of a sensor node equipped with a variety
    of sensors and a communication module (LoRa mini) capable of LoRa communication,
    an embedded system (Raspberry Pi 3) that controls the UAV and works as a gateway
    of the sensor nodes, and an analysis server that analyzes the environmental information
    collected by the UAV. The embedded system is attached to the UAV and supports
    the LoRa communication for receiving environmental information from the sensor
    nodes. In addition, the LoRa communication is utilized for finding an appropriate
    position at which stable communication to multiple sensor nodes is possible by
    measuring the received signal strength of the radio wave from the sensor node.
    A. Functional/Device Configuration of Proposed system The embedded system installed
    in the UAV has two modes: search mode and communication mode. In the search mode,
    the embedded system attempts to move to the position where the stable communication
    with the clusters of the sensor nodes based on the signal strength of radio waves
    received from the representative node of each cluster. In the communication mode,
    the embedded system attempts to collect all environmental information of the farm
    by communicating with the representative nodes of the clusters. The detailed procedure
    of the search and communication modes are described in Section III-C. The UAV
    used in this study is the 3D Robotics’s Solo which has a maximum payload of 450
    g, hence it is suitable for installation of the embedded system. The configuration
    of the UAV used in this study is shown in Fig. 2. The embedded system is connected
    to the UAV through Wi-Fi connection and controls the flight of UAV and works as
    a controller of the UAV so that the UAV is allowed to fly autonomously without
    being limited by the distance from the start point. The sensor nodes have the
    function of measuring environmental information and of transmitting the measured
    data to the gateway when receiving requests from embedded system on the UAV. In
    addition, the sensor nodes build the cluster by autonomously selecting the representative
    node from them. The device configuration of the sensor node is shown in Fig. 3.
    The sensor node in this study is mainly composed of the a LoRa-supported microcontroller,
    LoRa mini developed by Dragino. For obtaining the environmental information, a
    DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor, a TSL2561 illuminance sensor and a 10HS soil
    moisture sensor are connected to the microcontroller. Fig. 2. Configuration of
    UAV Show All Fig. 3. Configuration of Sensor Node Show All Fig. 4. Network Structure
    of Proposed System Show All B. Communication Methods for Sensor Data using LoRa
    The network structure of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 4. In the proposed
    method, the UAV is the central point of the sensor network and communicates with
    only the representative node of each cluster consisting of the nearby sensor nodes.
    The representative node has the ability to collect measurement data from the other
    sensor nodes of the same cluster and transmits the collected data to the gateway
    when the UAV gets close to the cluster. In this section, data communication procedure
    among the sensor nodes and the gateway on the UAV is explained. The detailed procedure
    of the cluster configuration and media access control mechanism of the sensor
    nodes are explained in Section IV. After approaching to the cluster, the gateway
    (i.e., embedded system) on the UAV broadcasts the data collection request to the
    representative nodes within the communication range. The request packet includes
    a 1-byte in which the token (e.g., ID of the representative node) indicating the
    start of communication is recorded. After that, the sensor node sends the measured
    data to the gateway through the representative node. Fig. 5. Structure of Packet
    Show All Fig. 6. Overview of the Positioning Algorithm Show All The structure
    of the data packet sent from the sensor node is shown in Fig. 5. In the proposed
    system, the environmental information is represented in 16 bits and 6 bits of
    inspection bits are added to the packet for detecting and correcting the error
    in the packet based on Hamming code. For transmitting four kinds of environmental
    information (i.e., temperature, humidity, etc.), the data packet consists of the
    total of 11 bytes (88 bits). The gateway cannot only detect errors in the packet
    received from the sensor node, but also correct up to one-bit error by using Humming
    code with an even parity check. If the error can be detected but not be corrected,
    the gateway sends a retransmission request to the sensor node. After receiving
    the data packet, the environmental information is obtained by removing the inspection
    bits and is stored on the database managed locally by the gateway until the UAV
    returns to the start point. C. Positioning Algorithm of UAV for Communicating
    with Representative Nodes First, the farm manager sets up the observation area
    and flight path of the UAV to move around the management terminal (e.g., smartphone
    application). After that, while moving based on the flight path, the UAV searches
    for a location where it can communicate with one or more representative nodes
    of the clusters. The following part of this section explains the method of searching
    for an appropriate location for communicating with the representative nodes. Here,
    the proposed method assumes that the UAV can arrive at the position where it can
    receive the radio signal from the representative nodes by the guidance based on
    the GPS location information. The overview of the positioning algorithm of the
    UAV is shown in Fig. 6. The first step of the positioning algorithm is to exchange
    the beacon with the representative nodes to measure the received signal strength
    of the radio wave from each node. When arriving at the position where it can communicate
    with the representative nodes, the UAV rotates clockwise from the current direction
    of travel and acquires the strength of the received signal with the representative
    node at each 45-degree rotation. The angle with the strongest received signal
    strength from each node is estimated as the direction that the good communication
    with the node is capable. Fig. 7. The Approach Algorithm of Multiple Node Show
    All Fig. 8. Example of TDMA-based Data Collection Show All The overview of the
    proposed approach for considering multiple representative nodes is shown in the
    Fig. 7. If there is only one representative node in the vicinity, it moves 10
    meters to the direction in which the node is presumed to be present. On the other
    hand, when there are multiple representative nodes in the vicinity, all nodes
    are set as the target and the UAV moves to the middle angle of the directions
    to the target nodes. The UAV repeats these processes until it is confirmed that
    it has been moved to the appropriate position. SECTION IV. Collecting Data From
    Clusters A. Data Collection from Multiple Sensor Nodes using TDMA A procedure
    example of the TDMA-based data collection from the sensor nodes is shown in Fig.
    8. A representative node obtains the environmental information from the sensor
    nodes in the cluster and transmits the aggregated information to the gateway on
    the UAV. Here, the representative node assigns a different time slot to the sensor
    nodes between each other by broadcasting a token packet and each sensor node sends
    its own environmental information to the representative node only at a timing
    of the assigned time slot in order to avoid collisions of the data transmission
    among nodes. The sensor nodes are assigned unique identifiers that are incremented
    one by one (i.e., 1, 2, 3, …) when constructing the cluster (see Section IV-B).
    When receiving the request packet from the representative node, the sensor node
    waits for ID×T [ms] before starting to send the environmental information to the
    representative node. T is a time interval of data transmission from the sensor
    nodes, so the representative node can complete to receive the information from
    all sensor nodes in N×T [ms], and N is the maximum number of sensor nodes that
    can coexist in the same cluster. Here, T should carefully be decided because the
    shorter T than the appropriate value may result in the occurrence of the collision
    but the longer T increases the data collection time. After the estimated waiting
    time (i.e., N×T [ms]) is passed, the representative node aggregates all the received
    information and transmits that to the gateway. Fig. 9. Example of CSMA Operation
    Show All B. Cluster Construction Method utilizing CSMA-based Data Exchange For
    constructing the cluster of the sensor nodes, the representative node needs to
    be determined. Here, in order to decrease the flight distance of the UAV, the
    sensor node which is the closest to the start point of the UAV is selected as
    the representative node. Therefore, the square of the distance between the start
    point and the sensor node is used as an evaluation value and the sensor node with
    the smallest value is selected as the representative node. For selecting the representative
    node, the sensor nodes in the cluster exchange the evaluation values among them.
    However, before selecting the representative node, the TDMA-based data transmission
    cannot be used for exchanging the evaluation value because there is no central
    point (i.e., representative node) which assigns a time slot to the sensor nodes
    and makes them to start sending the data. Therefore, the exchange of the evaluation
    value is based on the CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)-based technique. A
    behavior example of the CSMA-based data exchange is shown in Fig. 9. First, each
    sensor node confirms whether other sensor nodes are transmitting the evaluation
    value or not by confirming the status of the data reception of LoRa. If any other
    sensor node is not communicating, the sensor node starts to broadcast its evaluation
    values to the cluster (e.g., Cases of Node:A and Node:B in Fig. 9). On the contrary,
    if other nodes are communicating, the sensor node waits for the time interval
    determined by random numbers (e.g., Case of Node:C in Fig. 9). After the time
    interval is passed, it checks the reception status again. Each sensor node in
    the cluster waits for receiving the evaluation values from all other sensor nodes
    and compares its own evaluation value with that of other nodes. If its own evaluation
    value is the smallest in the cluster, the sensor node judges to be suitable for
    the representative node and broadcast the evaluation value again. If not receiving
    any response from other nodes within the predetermined timeout time, the sensor
    node starts to behave as the representative node in the cluster. Fig. 10. Example
    of Placement of the Sensor Nodes Show All SECTION V. Performance Evaluation A.
    Evaluation of Time Required for Receiving All Data and Packet Delivery Rate 1)
    Evaluation Setup: In order to evaluate effectiveness of our proposed data transmission
    methods, we prototype a sensor node supporting TDMA-based data collection method
    and CSMA-based cluster construction method. In this evaluation, we measure the
    packet loss rate for receiving the environmental information from all sensor nodes
    using TDMA, and that for exchanging the evaluation value among all sensor nodes.
    An example of the placement of the sensor nodes is shown in Fig. 10. Four sensor
    nodes are placed as shown in this figure, and one sensor node with red color is
    selected as the representative node. In this evaluation, we evaluate a packet
    loss rate during the data transmission between the sensor node that is selected
    as the representative node and the other nodes. In this experiment, each sensor
    node transmits packets 50 times and each packet includes data of 11 bytes by assuming
    environmental information. For the TDMA-based method, the time interval of each
    data transmission is set to 100ms, hence the representative node requires N×100[
    ms] for receiving packets from all sensor nodes in each data transmission. In
    addition, for CSMA-based method, the random number R for calculating the waiting
    time is selected from 0 to 30, hence the sensor node waits for R×35[ ms] when
    detecting the data transmission from other nodes. This experimental evaluation
    is performed at a ground in a campus of Ritsumeikan University. 2) Evaluation
    Result: Figure 11 shows the relationship between the number of sensor nodes and
    the packet loss rate when using each media access control method. As shown in
    this figure, the data transmission without using the media access control results
    in a large number of packet losses when multiple sensor nodes send the packets
    simultaneously. On the other hand, the CSMA-based method markedly decreases the
    number of packet losses compared with the method without using the media access
    control, and the TDMA-based method can avoid occurrence of the packet losses regardless
    of the number of sensor nodes. Based on the evaluation result mentioned above,
    we have decided to use the TDMA-based method for the representative node to collect
    all environmental information from the sensor nodes because the data transmission
    can avoid occurrence of the packet losses. On the other hand, the representative
    node has not been selected when the cluster of the sensor nodes is being constructed,
    hence the CSMA-based method is adopted for exchanging the evaluation value among
    the sensor nodes. Fig. 11. Number of Sensor Nodes vs. Packet Loss Rate Show All

    to evaluate the accuracy of the UAV’s movement to a position where the UAV can
    stably communicate with the representative nodes. In this evaluation, the UAV
    conducts ten trials of searching the position using the proposed autonomous flight
    algorithm, and the number of times that the UAV can correctly complete the search
    process and the time required to complete the search process are evaluated. In
    addition, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the simple
    existing algorithm that randomly selects the moving direction of the UAV and continues
    to move to the same direction until the received signal strength of the radio
    wave from the targets does not decrease. This experimental evaluation is performed
    at a playground in a campus of Ritsumeikan University. The experimental situation
    of the evaluation is shown in Fig. 12. In this evaluation, the representative
    nodes are installed at two locations in the ground, and the start point of the
    UAV with the embedded system is 60 meters away from the representative nodes.
    Here, when the distance between the UAV and the representative node is shorter
    than 25m, the signal strength become larger than -96dBm in this experiment. Therefore,
    we assume that the 25m is sufficiently close enough to stably communicate between
    the UAV and the representative nodes, and -96dBm is set to the threshold of the
    signal strength. When the average signal strength of the radio waves transmitted
    from the representative nodes and received by the embedded system exceeds the
    threshold, the system judges that it can approach the appropriate position where
    the communication with the representative nodes is stable and completes the search
    process. 2) Evaluation Result: The evaluation results of the proposed algorithm
    and the random flight algorithm are summarized in Teb. I and Teb. II. The “◯”
    in the table indicates that the average signal strength of received radio waves
    exceeds the indicates threshold that value the search and the is failed search
    because is completed, the UAV and could the “not ×” get close to the representative
    node due to dead of the battery. As shown in this table, the proposed algorithm
    can successfully complete the search process with higher accuracy than the simple
    algorithm. On the other hand, the random flight requires shorter time for detecting
    the appropriate position than the proposed algorithm when the search process is
    successfully completed because the random algorithm measures the signal strength
    of radio wave only once for deciding the flight direction. Figures 13 and 14 show
    examples of flight path of the proposed and random algorithms. As shown in these
    figures, the proposed algorithm always selects appropriate directions for approaching
    the representative nodes, but the random algorithm frequently selects wrong directions.
    Therefore, in the vast farm where the UAV can go straight for a long time once
    the direction of the flight is decided, the proposed algorithm may result in better
    performance in terms of the time required for detecting the suitable position
    than the random algorithm. Table I Flight Accuracy of Proposed Algorithm Table

    SECTION VI. Conclusions In this study, we have proposed a network system that
    can efficiently collect environmental information by moving the UAV with the function
    of the gateway to the location where communication with multiple sensor nodes
    becomes stable. In addition, we have proposed a new communication method of efficiently
    collecting data from the cluster of the sensor nodes with less radio interference.
    In the evaluation experiments, we evaluated the number of times the proposed autonomous
    flight algorithm was used to successfully approach a sensor node and the time
    required for the approach to the sensor node and showed the effectiveness of the
    proposed algorithm. In the future, we will consider a prediction method of future
    environmental information such as soil moisture on the farm based on the environmental
    information collected by the UAV. In addition, we will create a function to notify
    farm managers of feedback on the ingredients required for crops from the estimation
    results. Acknowledgement This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number

    \x06\a\nAbstract: Data collection is one of the main operations performed in Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks\n(WSNs). Even if several interesting approaches on data collection\
    \ have been proposed during the\nlast decade, it remains a research focus in full\
    \ swing with a number of important challenges. Indeed,\nthe continuous reduction\
    \ in sensor size and cost, the variety of sensors available on the market,\nand\
    \ the tremendous advances in wireless communication technology have potentially\
    \ broadened\nthe impact of WSNs. The range of application of WSNs now extends\
    \ from health to the military\nﬁeld through home automation, environmental monitoring\
    \ and tracking, as well as other areas of\nhuman activity. Moreover, the expansion\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in an important\namount of heterogeneous\
    \ data that are produced at an exponential rate. Furthermore, these data are\n\
    of interest to both industry and in research. This fact makes their collection\
    \ and analysis imperative\nfor many purposes. In view of the characteristics of\
    \ these data, we believe that very large-scale and\nheterogeneous WSNs can be\
    \ very useful for collecting and processing these Big Data. However,\nthe scaling\
    \ up of WSNs presents several challenges that are of interest in both network\
    \ architecture\nto be proposed, and the design of data-routing protocols. This\
    \ paper reviews the background and\nstate of the art of Big Data collection in\
    \ Large-Scale WSNs (LS-WSNs), compares and discusses on\nchallenges of Big Data\
    \ collection in LS-WSNs, and proposes possible directions for the future.\nKeywords:\

    1.1. Background\nAccording to the United Nations, the world’s population is estimated\
    \ at 7.6 billion in 2018.\nIn addition, more than 2 billion people are regularly\
    \ connected to the Internet and roughly 5 billion of\nthe world’s population use\
    \ various kinds of connected objects. During the last decade, the amount\nof global\
    \ generated data has exploded with the increasing use of connected objects, and\
    \ especially\nthe Internet of Things (IoT), which continuously produces most heterogeneous\
    \ data. Cisco reported\nthat, by the end of 2019, the IoT will annually generate\
    \ more than 500 zettabytes of structured and\nunstructured data, and that number\
    \ is expected to exponentially grow [1]. Moreover, a number of\nindustries’ forecasts\
    \ are projecting 50 billion connected devices to the Internet by 2020 [2].\nFurthermore,\
    \ in recent years, with the expansion of the IoT and recent technological advancements,\n\
    a growing number of intelligent information-aware devices, such as sensors, actuators,\
    \ smartphones,\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474; doi:10.3390/s18124474\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 4474\n2 of 34\nsmart wristbands, tablets, devices based on readers’\
    \ Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) and\nMachine-to-Machine (M2M), have led\
    \ to the exponential growth of generated-data volume [3–9].\nIn general, these\
    \ devices, and especially sensors, are used both in industry and research to collect\n\
    data in various application contexts, such as healthcare, environmental monitoring,\
    \ and precision\nagriculture [10]. The signiﬁcant advance in research and engineering\
    \ has introduced novel architectures\nfor data acquisition, transmission, large-scale\
    \ data storage, and processing. Moreover, the emerging\nBig Data paradigm, mainly\
    \ used to describe massive data, is experiencing renewed interest in both the\n\
    industrial and scientiﬁc world [11]. A number of domains, such as the IoT, artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence, and\ndata science, are beneﬁting from digital transformation allowed\
    \ by Big Data.\nMoreover, Internet-based companies, such as Google, Twitter, Facebook,\
    \ and Amazon, motivate\nthe current thrust of Big Data research, where real-time\
    \ data originating from human sources, which\ninclude e-mails, online shopping\
    \ history, as well as tweets, are used in large-scale data mining and\nfor data\
    \ analysis to produce a number of value-added services [12]. Fundamentally, Big\
    \ Data may be\nseen as a very large number of structured, semistructured, and\
    \ unstructured data of a wide variety\nof data types that is generated with high\
    \ velocity and has the potential to help us in understanding\nhidden information\
    \ in datasets, and also in managing and organizing these datasets [13]. Usually,\n\
    the Big Data process relies on four steps: data generation, acquisition, storage,\
    \ and analysis. Contrary\nto traditional data, Big Data need more real-time analysis\
    \ given the fact that they include massive\namounts of unstructured data of various\
    \ types.\nNowadays, IoT devices are commonly used in a large spectrum of critical\
    \ application domains,\nincluding eHealth, smart environments, smart cities, smart\
    \ building, as well as precision agriculture.\nThe massive data collection enabled\
    \ by IoT technology, leads to the emergence of a huge number of\nsensor-based\
    \ applications. Given the virtual abstraction of smart objects enabled by IoT\
    \ technology,\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become the most commonly used\
    \ IoT-based platforms for\ndata collection [14]. Therefore, WSNs are known to\
    \ be a fundamental component that allowed the\ndevelopment of the IoT system.\
    \ In such networks, a large number of sensors are deployed in the order\nof thousands,\
    \ collaborating to collect and transfer information to the base station [15,16].\n\
    Increasingly, there is a growing trend towards large-scale sensor networks for\
    \ data collection.\nAlthough they represent a new generation of sensor networks,\
    \ their use is subjected to many constraints,\nincluding adaptability with existing\
    \ methods for network scaling. Several important challenges need\nto be addressed\
    \ in order to allow a network to effectively play its role. Among these challenges,\
    \ we can\nmention the optimal deployment of sinks, the minimization of sensors’\
    \ energy consumption, as well as\ntheir lifetime [17,18]. In a Big Data context,\
    \ with a massive amount of high-speed, regularly changing,\nand variable data,\
    \ large-scale WSNs (LS-WSNs) may provide valuable solutions for massive data\n\
    collection [19].\nHowever, power-aware Big Data gathering in large-scale sensor\
    \ networks remains, therefore,\na challenging research issue. In a computer vision\
    \ domain, for example, managing a large number of\nlearning instances of images\
    \ is not an easy task [20]. Nevertheless, in LS-WSNs, real-time data\ngeneration\
    \ and acquisition are achieved by various sensors, such as gathering information\
    \ on\nproximity, location, humidity, and movement. Unfortunately, data generated\
    \ and acquired from\nindividual sensors may not seem signiﬁcant. However, the\
    \ global various types of data generated by\na number of sensors in LS-WSNs can\
    \ produce signiﬁcant Big Data [21]. Moreover, data collection in\nLS-WSNs requires\
    \ two important challenges to be addressed, that is, monitoring in large geographic\n\
    environments with unconnected regions, and power-aware data collection.\nA number\
    \ of studies that provide a background to WSNs and Big Data on the one hand, and\n\
    overviews of data-collection schemes in the context of LS-WSNs on the other, have\
    \ been proposed in\nthe recent literature. We reviewed most of the latest existing\
    \ papers related with the topics examined\nin this paper. In this light, Rawat\
    \ et al. (2014) [22] proposed a review of recent developments in WSNs\nby surveying\
    \ the leading research projects, platforms, standards, and technologies related\
    \ with sensor\nnetworks. Bouaziz et al. (2016) [23] as well as Sanchez et al.\
    \ (2018) [24] have reviewed recent trends\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n3 of 34\nof\
    \ mobility management in WSNs while highlighting applications and platforms. Di\
    \ Francesco et al.\n(2011) [25] provided an extensive survey and taxonomy of the\
    \ data-collection process with mobile\nelements in WSNs. In addition to sensors,\
    \ there has been a recent tendency to use unmanned aerial\nvehicles like drones\
    \ for data acquisition. In this context, swarm intelligence schemes based on bacterial\n\
    foraging optimization have been successfully used to collect massive data in LS-WSNs\
    \ [26,27].\nIn 2014, Takaishi et al. [21] proposed a Big Data gathering scheme\
    \ in densely deployed WSNs\nthat exploit sink mobility. In the same year, Wu et\
    \ al. [28] proposed a Big Data collection scheme based\non the structure-ﬁdelity\
    \ approach. The authors provided a framework for collecting structured data\n\
    and to maintain data ﬁdelity in terms of structural similarity in continuous sensing\
    \ applications in\nWSNs. After deﬁning what really represents a big sensor data\
    \ system, Ang et al. (2017) [29] surveyed\nthe progress made in the development\
    \ and applications of big sensor data research, especially in the\ncontext of\
    \ smart cities. In order to enhance Big Data collection in an IoT system, Ang\
    \ et al. (2018) [12]\nproposed a way to collect Big Data in LS-WSNs using mobile\
    \ collectors to optimize energy consumption.\nThe authors adopted a data-collection\
    \ scheme using a date mule and mobile access point, which are\nthe mostly used\
    \ components in data-collection models in sensor networks.\nAccording to the literature,\
    \ we reviewed select research in the context of this study. We established\nthat\
    \ much less research has been done on Big Data collection with sensor-based systems\
    \ compared with\nstandard Big Data systems. Standard Big Data technology using\
    \ stored data is subject to challenges\nrelated to the speed capacities of communication\
    \ networks. Useful technologies, such as Hadoop or\nMapReduce, combined with cloud-computing\
    \ technology are actually used to address communication\nnetworks by integrating\
    \ distributed processing.\nCertainly, future 5G systems, which include a promising\
    \ cloud-based radio access network\nmodel and a more powerful mmWave spectrum,\
    \ will be more ﬂexible, agile, converged, and useful\nfor automating data analytics\
    \ with machine-learning or swarm-intelligence algorithms. However,\nunstructured\
    \ large volumes of data gathered from IoT-based systems, such as LS-WSNs, need\
    \ more\nattention. The focus of this paper is twofold. Firstly, the potential\
    \ of WSNs and Big Data is studied,\nwith particular emphasis on data collection.\
    \ Then, existing data-collection schemes in the literature\nare reviewed and discussed.\
    \ This paper gives a global overview of Big Data collection in LS-WSNs\nwith the\
    \ challenges to be addressed. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide useful\
    \ insights\nto research and industry into this promising research area, and motivate\
    \ the development of new\nschemes, models, and frameworks for Big Data collection\
    \ in LS-WSNs.\n1.2. Author’s Contributions\nThis work aims at increasing readers’\
    \ knowledge by providing a sufﬁcient and comprehensive\nbackground in the schemes,\
    \ algorithms, and models used for resolving different data-collection\nchallenges\
    \ in LS-WSNs. The ﬁrst contribution of this paper is enabling novice readers to\
    \ understand\nthe mechanism and operation of large-scale wireless sensor networks\
    \ for massive data collection.\nSecondly, we propose an architecture for a WSN\
    \ dedicated to Big Data collection. Then, we lay the\ngroundwork for our future\
    \ work, which consists on the one hand of proposing a deployment model of\nlarge-scale\
    \ WSNs, which should maximize coverage, and, on the other hand, proposing efﬁcient\
    \ and\nlightweight algorithms for Big Data collection in LS-WSNs.\n1.3. Organization\
    \ of the Paper\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst provide\
    \ an overview of WSNs in Section 2.\nWe then propose a background on Big Data\
    \ in Section 3. Section 4 focuses on Big Data collection in\nLS-WSNs. In Section\
    \ 5, we reviewed data transferring schemes in the context of LS-WSNs. This is\n\
    followed in Section 6 by a discussion on the challenges of Big Data collection\
    \ in LS-WSNs. Finally,\nwe conclude the paper in Section 7.\nSensors 2018, 18,\
    \ 4474\n4 of 34\n2. Overview of WSNs\nA WSN is an ad hoc network consisting of\
    \ a set of sensor nodes, randomly ﬁxed or dispersed\nin a given geographical area,\
    \ communicating via a wireless link to autonomously collect, process,\nand transmit\
    \ data in their environment to a special node, considered the collection point,\
    \ called\na sink [16,22,30–32]. The geographical area where the sensor nodes operate\
    \ is called the ﬁeld or\narea of interest. In a WSN, sensor nodes are able to\
    \ self-organize to collect information about the\nenvironment where they are deployed.\
    \ The transmission of the collected data can be done periodically\nor event-based,\
    \ depending on the nature of the implemented application. The sink is a node with\n\
    two or more network interfaces that act as a bridge between the WSN and the end-user’s\
    \ network\n(for example, a local area network or the Internet). The user can send\
    \ requests to other nodes in the\nnetwork via the sink, for example, to specify\
    \ the type of data to be collected. For illustration purposes,\nFigure 1 shows\
    \ the basic architecture of a WSN. The sensor nodes randomly deployed in a zone\
    \ of\ninterest and the sink located at the end of the zone are responsible for\
    \ recovering the data collected\nby the sensors. Most often, the sink collects\
    \ and processes network data, thus sending only relevant\ninformation to the user.\
    \ It can also receive commands to run on the internal network from it (the user).\n\
    The collected data are processed and analyzed by the user.\nFigure 1. General\
    \ architecture of a wireless sensor network (WSN).\n2.1. Hardware Architecture\
    \ of a Wireless Sensor\nA wireless sensor is a small electronic device capable\
    \ of measuring a physical quantity\n(e.g., temperature, light, pressure) and communicating\
    \ it to a collection center directly or via other\nsensor nodes that act as routers\
    \ [10]. Given the advances in microelectronics, wireless transmission\ntechnologies\
    \ and software have made it possible to produce microsensors of a few cubic millimeters\
    \ in\nvolume that can operate in a network at a reasonable cost [22]. A sensor\
    \ node consists of four base\nunits and two optional units [10,33] (see Figure\
    \ 2):\n•\nAcquisition unit. This consists of two subunits: a sensor and an analog-to-digital\
    \ converter (ADC).\nThe sensor collects digital measurements on environmental\
    \ parameters and transforms them into\nanalog signals. The ADC converts analog\
    \ signals into digital signals.\n•\nProcessing unit. This is also composed of\
    \ two units: a data-storage unit, and a processor responsible\nfor data-processing\
    \ and control procedures allowing the collaboration of the sensor with the others\n\
    in order to carry out acquisition tasks.\n•\nCommunication unit. Its function\
    \ is information transmission and reception. It is equipped with\na transmitter/receiver\
    \ pair. It allows communication within the network, in our case, by radio\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 4474\n5 of 34\nfrequency (radio waves). However, there are other transmission\
    \ possibilities (e.g., optical and\ninfra red)\n•\nPower unit. Power supply is\
    \ a critical element of sensor architecture. It is responsible for supplying\n\
    energy to all other units. It most often corresponds to a battery, feeding the\
    \ sensor, whose limited\nresources make it a problem speciﬁc to this type of network.\
    \ However the recent realization of\nsolar-panel power unit is trying to provide\
    \ a solution for extending sensor life [33].\n•\nMobilizer. Optionally, this is\
    \ used to move the node to complete the task to be processed.\n•\nLocation-Finding\
    \ System. Optionally, this provides information on the location required by the\n\
    application and/or routing.\nFigure 2. Architecture of a wireless sensor.\n2.2.\
    \ Types of WSNs\nDepending on the deployment environment on land, underground,\
    \ or underwater, there are\nseveral types of WSNs [10] (see Figure 3):\n•\nTerrestrial.\
    \ This kind of WSNs is intended to be deployed in a terrestrial space. In these\
    \ networks,\nhundreds of thousands of sensors are deployed randomly or deterministically\
    \ over a given area.\nThis type of WSN is much more useful in the ﬁeld of environmental\
    \ monitoring and natural\nphenomena; however, it represents a challenge for the\
    \ sustainability of the network in terms of\nenergy management [34].\n•\nUnderground.\
    \ These networks consist of very special sensor nodes known for their high cost\n\
    and the logistics necessary for their implementation and maintenance. In this\
    \ type of network,\nthe sensor nodes are installed in the ground. They ﬁnd their\
    \ application in agriculture or in\nmineﬁelds, where they are used to monitor\
    \ conditions in the soil. However, in this type of\nnetwork, there is a ground\
    \ node that has a role in transmitting the information detected by the\nunderground\
    \ nodes to the base station [35].\n•\nUnderwater. This particular type of WSNs\
    \ is networks hidden under the sea. Because of the\nhostility represented by the\
    \ environment of their deployment, this type of network remains an\ninteresting\
    \ research challenge. These nodes are more expensive than terrestrial sensors,\
    \ wireless\ncommunication is acoustic, bandwidth is limited, signal loss is recurrent,\
    \ and propagation delays\nand synchronization problems are frequent [36,37].\n\
    •\nMultimedia. These WSNs are designed to monitor and trace data such as images,\
    \ videos, and\nsound. These sensors are equipped with cameras and microphones.\
    \ This type of network requires\ngood bandwidth and good quality of service, which\
    \ implies high power consumption for data\nprocessing and compression. Preplanning\
    \ is required for the deployment of these sensors [38].\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    6 of 34\n•\nMobile. This is the most recent type of WSN, and it uses mobile nodes\
    \ that can autonomously\nreposition and reorganize the network. After initial\
    \ deployment, the nodes disperse to gather\ninformation. There is also a hybrid\
    \ network consisting of a combination of mobile and ﬁxed\nsensors [12,25,26,37,39–42].\n\

    \ of a large number of high-density nodes deployed in a detection\narea, with\
    \ one or more base stations within or near the area. The base station communicates\
    \ with\nthe sensors via requests or commands, and the sensors communicate with\
    \ each other via wireless\ncommunications. They participate in performing data-detecting\
    \ and -sending tasks to the base station.\nIn sensor networks, the energy consumed\
    \ for communication is much higher than that required\nfor detection or computing.\
    \ For example, the transmission of a single bit of data is equivalent to\n800\
    \ instructions [43]. A wireless sensor network can be organized according to different\
    \ topologies,\nincluding star, mesh, and hybrid topologies.\n2.3.1. Star Topology\n\
    In this communication topology, the network consists of a single station that\
    \ can send and/or\nreceive messages from a number of remote sensor nodes. Sensor\
    \ nodes are not allowed to communicate\nwith each other.\nThis topology has the\
    \ advantages of being easy to deploy, and guaranteeing\ncommunication and low\
    \ latency between remote sensor nodes and the base station [44].\n2.3.2. Mesh\
    \ Topology\nThis topology uses a multihop network scheme to cover all connected\
    \ sensor nodes, that is,\nthe signal goes from one sensor node to another until\
    \ it reaches the base station. The communication\nrange of each node is not limited\
    \ by distance; we can, however, add an intermediate sensor node to\nextend it\
    \ [45]. The main advantage of this topology is that it maintains connectivity\
    \ in the network, but\nits major disadvantage lies in the number of jumps that\
    \ increase from one communication to another,\nincreasing energy consumption in\
    \ the network.\n2.3.3. Hybrid Topology\nHybrid topology combines both the star\
    \ and mesh topologies [45]. It provides a robust network\nwith several communication\
    \ functions while keeping sensor energy consumption to a minimum.\nSensors 2018,\
    \ 18, 4474\n7 of 34\nSensor nodes that have higher energy capacities are enabled\
    \ to provide multihop communications,\nwhile low power nodes are disabled.\n2.4.\
    \ WSN Communication\nA sensor node can communicate directly, without detour, thanks\
    \ to single-hop communication\nwith the sink, or using multihop communication,\
    \ passing the information to its neighbors [33].\n2.4.1. One-Hop Communication\n\
    One-hop communications lead to transmissions over long distances resulting in\
    \ a signiﬁcant\nincrease in energy consumption. Figure 4 illustrates this type\
    \ of communication.\nFigure 4. One-hop communication.\n2.4.2. Multihop Communication\n\
    Using multihop communication reduces transmission distance, thus reducing energy\
    \ loss in order\nto increase the service life of the network. In multihop transmissions,\
    \ network architecture plays a\nmajor role. Multihop network architectures are\
    \ typically divided into ﬂat or hierarchical architectures.\nFigure 5 illustrates\
    \ this type of communication.\nFigure 5. Multihop communication.\n2.5. Speciﬁc\
    \ Characteristics of Sensor Networks\nSensor networks have intrinsic characteristics,\
    \ both at the sensor nodes (energy power, processing\ncapacity, storage capacity,\
    \ and reach), and at the level of the network constituted by these sensors\n(bandwidth,\
    \ density, and network topology) [33].\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n8 of 34\n2.5.1.\
    \ Sensor-Node Features\nIndividually, sensor nodes have their own characteristics\
    \ that usual sensors do not have. Indeed,\nsensor nodes have energy autonomy,\
    \ and this resource is essential to the survival of a WSN because,\nin most cases,\
    \ the sensor’s battery is irreplaceable.\nIn addition, sensors have limited capacity,\n\
    such as with regard to storage and data processing, as well as narrow sensor transmission\
    \ range.\nHere, we detail the main features. More information is available in\
    \ the literature [22].\n•\nEnergy consumption. Sensors have energy autonomy, and\
    \ they usually use tiny batteries as energy\nresources. In most cases, WSNs are\
    \ deployed in hard-to-reach areas. This makes it difﬁcult or\nalmost impossible\
    \ to recharge or replace the batteries. This difﬁculty leads us to deduce that\
    \ the\nlife of a sensor is essentially dependent on the life of the battery. Therefore,\
    \ energy-consumption\nmanagement is a major constraint in this type of network.\n\
    •\nTransmission scope. This is an important criterion for the deployment of a\
    \ WSN. It is limited\nby the radiation capacity of the antennas used and the signal\
    \ strength involved. For example,\nthe communication between two sensor nodes\
    \ can only take place if the distance between them\nis not too great, i.e., a\
    \ few tens of meters in practice. The longer the distance is, the higher the\n\
    energy cost. This is especially true if there are physical obstacles between the\
    \ two nodes that may\nprevent communication.\n•\nStorage and processing power.\
    \ An intrinsic characteristic of these sensors is their low storage capacity.\n\
    Although they also have a processor, the sensors cannot perform very large operations\
    \ due to\ntheir relatively low processing power. For example, “mote”-type sensor\
    \ nodes are composed of\nan 8-bit 4 MHz microcontroller, 40 KB of memory, and\
    \ a radio with a bit rate of about 10 Kbps.\nThis remains true even for midrange\
    \ nodes, such as “UCLA/ROCKWELL’S WINS”, which have a\nstrong ARM 1100 processor\
    \ with 1 MB ﬂash memory, 128 KB of RAM, and a 100 Kbps radio.\n2.5.2. WSN Features\n\
    In addition to the sensor nodes’ intrinsic characteristics, there are other characteristics\
    \ that are\nrelated to the network: sensor self-conﬁguration, scalability, fault\
    \ tolerance, communication capacity,\nnetwork topology, bandwidth, and density.\n\
    •\nSensor autoconﬁguration. In a WSN, sensors are deployed either in a random\
    \ manner by a missile,\ndrone, or airplane, or manually deployed by a human or\
    \ a robot, inside or around an observed\nphenomenon such as a ﬁeld of war, volcanic\
    \ surface, or sick patient [46]. Thus, each sensor\nnode has the ability, on the\
    \ one hand, to self-conﬁgure in the network, and, on the other hand,\nto collaborate\
    \ with other nodes in order to dynamically reconﬁgure the network in case of\n\
    network-topology changes [41]. As a reminder, each sensor in a WSN has a transmitting/receiving\n\
    unit that allows it to communicate with the sensors that are close to it. By exchanging\
    \ information\nwith them, the sensor can then discover its neighbors and thus\
    \ know the routing method that it\nwill adopt according to the needs of the application.\
    \ Autoconﬁguration appears to be a necessary\nfeature in the case of WSNs since,\
    \ on the one hand, their deployment is done randomly in the\nmajority of applications,\
    \ and, on the other hand, the number of sensors is very high.\n•\nScalability.\
    \ Unlike traditional wireless networks (personal, local, or extended), a WSN consists\
    \ of a\nvery large number of sensors (hundreds or thousands) [33]. The sensor\
    \ network is scalable in that\nit has the ability to accept a large number of\
    \ sensors that work together to achieve a common goal.\n•\nFault tolerance. In\
    \ case of a sensor malfunction (lack of energy, interference with observation\n\
    environment) or if new sensors are added to the network, the existing sensor nodes\
    \ in the WSN\nmust continue to normally operate without interruption [33]. This\
    \ explains the fact that a WSN\ndoes not adopt a ﬁxed but rather dynamic topology.\n\
    •\nCommunication ability. It can take one of two aspects, multihop or one-hop.\
    \ Multihop communication\nis less energy-intensive, and it remains the most sought-after\
    \ type of communication for WSN\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n9 of 34\napplications\
    \ that require low energy consumption. Finally, it should be noted that WSNs use\
    \ a\nnonstandardized protocol stack. However, the majority of scientiﬁc work that\
    \ deals with the WSN\nissue is based on the protocol stack proposed in 2002 by\
    \ Akyildiz et al. [33], which is presented in\nSection 2.6.\n2.6. Protocol Architecture\n\
    The role of the protocol architecture given in Figure 6 is to standardize communication\
    \ between\nnetwork components so that different vendors can develop compatible\
    \ products (software or hardware).\nThis protocol stack combines energy routing\
    \ and management, and integrates the data with the\nnetwork. It communicates efﬁciently\
    \ (in terms of energy) through the wireless medium and promotes\nco-operative\
    \ efforts among sensor nodes [45]. Depending on detection tasks, different types\
    \ of\napplication software can be designed and used in the transport layer. A\
    \ WSN can be seen as a\nseries of connections between sensors that enable them\
    \ to communicate. The content, scope, size,\nspeed, and connectivity of the network\
    \ depend on the set of protocols and their implementation.\nThis includes application,\
    \ transport, network, link, and physical layers, and energy-, mobility-, and\n\
    task-management plans.\n•\nApplication layer. Depending on the functionality of\
    \ the sensors, different applications can be used\nand built on this layer.\n\
    •\nTransport layer. It is used to maintain the ﬂow of data when needed in the\
    \ applications used,\nespecially when connected to the Internet.\n•\nNetwork layer.\
    \ This deals with the routing of data provided by the transport layer.\n•\nData-link\
    \ layer. As the sensor network environment is noisy and nodes can be mobile, the\
    \ MAC\nlayer must ensure low power consumption in the data broadcast of neighboring\
    \ nodes.\n•\nPhysical layer. This deals with data-transmission, -reception, -modulation,\
    \ and -encryption techniques.\n•\nEnergy-, mobility-, and task-management levels\
    \ are responsible for controlling the consumed energy,\nnode movements, and task\
    \ distribution across the entire protocol stacks. These levels allow\nsensors\
    \ to co-ordinate their tasks and minimize energy consumption.\nFigure 6. WSN protocol\
    \ stack [33].\n2.7. Dedicated Applications\nWSNs are in use in many areas, and\
    \ most often with a varied architectural design. Moreover,\nsensor networks correspond\
    \ to speciﬁc types of applications, as can be seen in Figure 7. A 2012\nstudy\
    \ by IDTechEx has reported that the worldwide market for sensor networks is growing,\
    \ and is\nexpected to grow from 0.45 billion to 2 billion between 2012 and 2022.\
    \ We distinguish four types of\nWSN applications [32]: event-driven applications,\
    \ periodic data-collection applications (also called\ntime-driven applications),\
    \ recommended execution applications or query-oriented applications, and\nhybrid\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n10 of 34\nFigure 7. Dedicated WSN applications.\n\
    2.7.1. Event-Driven\nThis type of application is the most representative of WSN\
    \ applications (see Figure 8). As an\nexample, we can mention the detection of\
    \ a forest ﬁre or an earthquake, or the monitoring of the air\nquality in a given\
    \ region. In this class of applications, sensor nodes must be able to detect an\
    \ event\nthat could happen at any time in any location in the area of interest.\
    \ Thus, the sensor nodes must\ncontinuously collect this information and immediately\
    \ react to abrupt changes in the sensed values.\nFor this application category,\
    \ no periodic control is required by the sink, and the data processing by\nthe\
    \ sensor nodes is simple: each node must compare the measured data with a ﬁxed\
    \ critical threshold.\nAs soon as this value exceeds the threshold, the sensor\
    \ node sends the data to the sink. In order to\nprovide better performance, these\
    \ applications must meet certain criteria, such as:\n•\nA high density of sensor\
    \ nodes is required to ensure high probability of event detection. This\nimplies\
    \ that the network must have very good coverage.\n•\nGood coverage of sensor nodes\
    \ that usually depends on the type of event to be detected.\n•\nAn exact location\
    \ of all sensor nodes in the network is required. This is to locate the event\
    \ through\nthe sensor node in which the event occurs. Note that distributed location\
    \ algorithms could be\nused for this purpose.\n•\nGood network connectivity linked\
    \ to transmission coverage so that communication protocols\nallow the alarm sent\
    \ by sensor nodes to arrive at the sink with high probability and in the\nshortest\
    \ time.\nFigure 8. Event-driven applications.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n11 of 34\n\
    2.7.2. Query-Driven\nIn query-oriented applications (see Figure 9), the deployed\
    \ sensor network tracks information\nonly at the explicit request of a base station.\
    \ This category of applications is intended for the speciﬁc\nneeds of the user.\
    \ The latter may seek, for example, to request information speciﬁc to a certain\
    \ region,\nor to interrogate the sensors to acquire measures of interest. Generally\
    \ In this case, the topological\nknowledge of the network and the geographical\
    \ location of the sensors are necessary.\nFigure 9. Query-driven applications.\n\
    2.7.3. Time-Driven\nIn this category, applications aim to periodically evaluate\
    \ the measurements of the given physical\nquantities. Note, for example, the application\
    \ of WSNs in the monitoring of the atmospheric pressure\nof a large area or variations\
    \ in ground temperature at a small volcanic site [47]. These applications react\n\
    in a given period sink. The sensors take a sample of the environment and transmit\
    \ it by means of an\nappropriate communication protocol to the ﬁnal sink. For\
    \ the smooth operation of these applications,\nwith better quality of service,\
    \ it is important: that the sampling frequency is sink-chosen, that the\nconnectivity\
    \ of the network is kept under control, and to have communication protocols adapted\
    \ to\nthat kind of data. The sensor nodes used in this type of application can\
    \ sleep, i.e., turn off their radio\nduring periods of inactivity in order to\
    \ manage the energy consumption of the network.\n2.7.4. Hybrid\nThis category\
    \ of applications group the resulting applications of the two previous categories.\n\
    Examples are home-automation applications, where we can evaluate the temperature\
    \ of a room\n(event-oriented), or/and monitor a newborn (time-driven).\n2.8. WSN\
    \ Application Areas\nThe increasingly smaller size of the sensors, the ever-lower\
    \ cost, the wide range of available sensor\ntypes (thermal, optical, vibration,\
    \ etc.), as well as wireless-communication support, have widely spread\nthe use\
    \ of solutions based on WSNs [33]. Needs in terms of WSNs’ applications are growing\
    \ every day.\nIn 2006, the works of Ekici et al. [48] broke down sensor-network\
    \ applications into four main areas, as\ndescribed in Figure 10: environmental,\
    \ health, security, and other applications. Furthermore, existing\napplications\
    \ are extended in order to facilitate the design of other systems, such as the\
    \ control and\nautomation of industrial production lines.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    12 of 34\nFigure 10. WSN applications.\n2.8.1. Environmental Applications\nNowadays,\
    \ environmental problems, such as ﬂoods, ﬁres, and pollution, are the most recurrent.\n\
    The use of WSNs in environmental applications is becoming increasingly important\
    \ and common, thus\nimproving environmental awareness and the effectiveness of\
    \ control methods [22,47,49]. Therefore,\nWSNs can contribute to the development\
    \ of risk-response systems, natural-disaster detection, energy\nmanagement, and\
    \ other systems. Environmental applications can be broken down into ﬁve classes,\n\
    as shown in Figure 10: weather monitoring, geological monitoring, habitat monitoring,\
    \ pollution\nmonitoring, and energy monitoring.\n2.8.2. Medical Applications\n\
    The health sector is increasingly using WSNs for healthcare needs, such as medical\
    \ treatment,\npre- and posthospital patient surveillance, and rescue operations\
    \ [32]. In addition, sensor networks\ncan help in solving important social problems,\
    \ such as caring for the chronically ill and people with\nintellectual and physical\
    \ disabilities. The ﬁeld of healthcare includes patient follow-ups, invalid\n\
    assistance, life-saving, biosurveillance, and intelligent environments. Furthermore,\
    \ WSNs are used for\nmonitoring physiological measurements [33]. They can also\
    \ be used, for example, to monitor the vital\nfunctions of the elderly or people\
    \ with health problems in order to alert medical devices. Similarly,\nwe can analyze\
    \ different physical measurements collected from athletes, the possibilities offered\
    \ by a\nWSN to lighten data-collection devices.\n2.8.3. Security Applications\n\
    Some institutions can be monitored in real time by WSNs to prevent possible theft\
    \ or ﬁre. Another\nexample is the application of sensor networks in intelligent\
    \ transportation systems for monitoring\nroads or railways to prevent accidents\
    \ [50]. In the military domain, these networks are used for\nsurveillance inside\
    \ and outside the theater of operations and in espionage. In the security ﬁeld,\
    \ sensor\nnetworks can signiﬁcantly contribute to the reduction of ﬁnancial expenses\
    \ dedicated to the security\nof locations and human beings. Thus, the integration\
    \ of sensors in large structures, such as bridges\nor buildings, could help detect\
    \ cracks and alterations in the structure following an earthquake or the\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 4474\n13 of 34\naging of the structure. Deploying a motion-sensor\
    \ network can be an alarm system that can detect\nintrusions into a surveillance\
    \ zone [41].\n2.8.4. Other Applications\nOther applications of WSNs include [51,52]\
    \ structural monitoring, construction monitoring and\ncontrol, automobile surveillance,\
    \ trafﬁc monitoring, control of industrial processes, and warehouse\nsurveillance.\
    \ Usually, WSNs are particularly suitable for monitoring critical areas, thanks\
    \ in particular\nto their autonomy and smaller size. In addition, possible applications\
    \ include ﬂood prevention,\nforest-ﬁre detection, and the monitoring of nuclear\
    \ facilities [53]. This type of network opens up new\nopportunities for managing\
    \ the many problems that our present and future cities face, like trafﬁc\ncongestion,\
    \ and energy and waste management.\nMoreover, WSNs provide elements of answers\
    \ to issues that remain relevant. They help ﬁnd\nsolutions for trafﬁc observation\
    \ and the management, especially the management of the trafﬁc lights,\nthe regulation\
    \ of public street lamps, or the monitoring and management of centralized waste\
    \ collection.\nFurthermore, in every-day life, home-automation and smart-building\
    \ applications are particularly\npopular [45]. WSNs in these contexts provide\
    \ innovative solutions for comfort, energy savings, and\nsecurity [54]. For these\
    \ applications, ZigBee alliance technologies offer a complete wireless protocol\n\
    stack for different types of applications.\n2.9. Challenges of WSN Design and\
    \ Deployment\nIn most cases, the deployment of a WSN is closely related to the\
    \ nature of the intended application.\nThere is no generic model for these applications.\
    \ However, several factors inﬂuence WSN design and\ndeployment. The design of\
    \ the WSN must ﬁnd a compromise solution for the following challenges:\n•\nEnergy.\
    \ A sensor node, by its size, is limited in energy resources, storage capacity,\
    \ and processing.\nOne of the most serious concerns is the lifespan of the sensor\
    \ node, which is entirely determined\nby the amount of energy available and the\
    \ rate of energy consumption (that is, the average energy\nconsumption). Since\
    \ improving the energy capacity of small batteries still requires a lot of effort,\n\
    the goal of a long service life is difﬁcult to achieve by increasing the amount\
    \ of available energy.\nAs a result, the design of energy-efﬁcient MAC protocols,\
    \ communication strategies, operating\nsystems, and energy-efﬁcient routing mechanisms\
    \ provides effective ways to extend the life of the\nnode [36]. The use of energy-recovery\
    \ technologies for sensor-node power supplies has also been\nan alternative in\
    \ recent years.\n•\nQuality of Service (QoS). Quality is deﬁned by the ability\
    \ to interpret the information collected\nby the sink. In spite of the fact that\
    \ the QoS requirements vary according to the different\nWSN applications, the\
    \ two main measures of QoS are data reliability and latency [33]. Usually,\na\
    \ successful data-exchange rate between the sensor nodes and the sink must be\
    \ above a certain\nthreshold to ensure network reliability and functionality.\
    \ Reliability can be further maximized, but\nthis could be at the cost of increased\
    \ energy consumption. Therefore, a compromise is necessary.\nIn case of latency,\
    \ for certain types of applications, the reception of the data detected on the\
    \ sink is\nstrictly timed, so that latency data can cause delay problems and lead\
    \ to bad decisions, particularly\nin industrial-surveillance applications.\n•\n\
    Security and privacy. WSNs ﬁnd their applications in various areas of life. Some\
    \ applications\nmanipulate private data. Moreover, WSNs are networks whose topology\
    \ is very frequently subject\nto change. The deployment of sensor nodes is sometimes\
    \ done in accessible areas; they may\nencounter technical interference or human\
    \ intrusion, which can lead to conﬁdentiality issues.\nThus, the network should\
    \ allow the detection of intrusions. It is therefore necessary to design\nrobust\
    \ and lightweight algorithms for data encryption, authentication mechanisms for\
    \ privacy\nprotection, and secure routing for data relays to protect the entire\
    \ network against passive and\nactive attacks, and denials of external service\
    \ providers [55–57].\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n14 of 34\n•\nAdaptability. The design\
    \ of a WSN must be sufﬁciently ﬂexible and adaptable to be deployable\nacross\
    \ a wide range of application scenarios. The entire network should be kept functional\n\
    regardless if the number of sensor nodes is hundreds, thousands, or very small.\
    \ Due to the\nmobility of sensor nodes and observed events, as well as the possibility\
    \ that a sensor node can fail\nin the network, the overall topology of the network\
    \ may be subject to frequent change. Therefore,\nthe design of a WSN must be sufﬁciently\
    \ intelligent and robust to deal with these dynamic\ntopology scenarios [10,31].\n\
    •\nLocalization.\nWSNs play an important role in the problem of locating elements\
    \ in a given\ndeployment area. Certainly, GPS is a well-known tracking system\
    \ and the most used location\nsystem. However, it is not satisfactory for this\
    \ use, because it accumulates handicaps. It is only\navailable outdoors and if\
    \ no obstacle obstructs the ﬁeld of view of the receivers. In addition, an\noperation\
    \ under dense foliage or in cities with narrow streets is not possible, which\
    \ are very bad\nconditions. Moreover, it is particularly expensive, both in terms\
    \ of hardware, multiplied to many\ncopies in a network with high sensor density.\
    \ Moreover, signal reception is very energy-greedy,\nwhich is not compatible with\
    \ management problems of battery service life. Location is done in\ntwo steps:\
    \ distance estimation to the other nodes, and triangulation. The development of\
    \ new\nlocalization techniques has become a major concern for WSNs [33,58].\n\
    3. Overview of Big Data\nThis section aims at presenting an overview of the Big\
    \ Data concept by presenting its\ncategorization through the three-V model actually\
    \ extended to ﬁve Vs, with an emphasis on different\ngeneration sources of these\
    \ data. Moreover, a number of technologies on Big Data have been proposed\nin\
    \ both industry and research applications. In view of its characteristics, the\
    \ problem of Big Data\nis different from that of business intelligence, so Big\
    \ Data challenges in the process of extracting\nknowledge from data are studied.\
    \ These challenges are grouped into three phases: storage, processing,\nand exploitation\
    \ of results. Therefore, using LS-WSN to collect, process, and exploit knowledge\n\
    extracted from Big Data is an emerging trend.\nHowever, we must say that the term\
    \ Big Data is still an abstract concept. Sometimes called massive\ndata or metadata,\
    \ Big Data is an increasingly heterogeneous dataset, which is growing in volume\n\
    such that it is difﬁcult to process these data with conventional database-management\
    \ tools [11,13].\nIn this context of data deluge, McKinsey, in its June 2011 publication\
    \ “Big data: the next frontier for\ninnovation, competition, and productivity”\
    \ advocates the new era of Big Data [59]. Unfortunately, Big\nData appeared much\
    \ earlier, more than a decade ago, without being named, with the emergence of\n\
    large data that cannot be processed using traditional techniques [29]. Large IT\
    \ companies, such as\nYahoo and Google, were the ﬁrst to offer their own Big Data\
    \ solutions. They were confronted very\nearly with issues related to the storage\
    \ and processing of large volumes of data. Therefore, Big Data is\na new generation\
    \ of solutions for collection, storage, real-time processing, and data analysis.\n\
    3.1. Characterization of Big Data\nCharacterization of Big Data is generally done\
    \ according to the three Vs: Volume, Variety, and\nVelocity. Other complementary\
    \ Vs are added, such as Value and Veracity.\n3.1.1. Volume\nVolume is certainly\
    \ the one best described by the term Big in “Big Data”. Volume refers to the\n\
    amount of too-large information to be acquired, stored, processed, analyzed, and\
    \ distributed by\nstandard tools. This data volume is constantly growing. With\
    \ the exponential growth in the number\nof electronic smart devices, the world\
    \ is steadily becoming more connected. Moreover, connected\nobjects will continue\
    \ to grow over the coming years. For instance, according to computer company\n\
    IBM, 2.5 exabytes, i.e., 2.5 billion gigabytes, of data were generated every day\
    \ in 2012. This amount of\ndata will reach 500 zettabytes by the end of 2019 [1].\
    \ Furthermore, some analyses report that, in the last\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    15 of 34\ntwo years, about ninety percent of these data has been generated. In\
    \ most cases, most of the generated\ndata come from the digital world. In 2013,\
    \ IBM reported that about 12 terrabytes of tweets were created\neach day, and\
    \ 5.2 billion daily Google searches in 2017. Table 1 highlights the volume of\
    \ data generated\nby the digital sector. Volume is certainly the main criterion\
    \ that comes to mind when we talk about\nBig Data. However, summarizing Big Data\
    \ volume is too simplistic. There are other criteria, such as\nvelocity and variety,\
    \ to characterize Big Data.\nTable 1. Volume of created data (Sources: bloomberg.com,\

    3.1.2. Velocity\nVelocity refers to the dynamic and/or temporal aspect of the\
    \ data, and their update and analysis\ntime. Data are no longer processed and\
    \ analyzed ofﬂine, but in real time or near-real time. They are\nproduced in continuous\
    \ streams, during which real-time decisions can be made. These are the\ndata especially\
    \ from sensors, requiring fast processing for a real-time reaction. In the case\
    \ of such\nhigh-velocity data generating very large volumes, it is no longer possible\
    \ to store them as they are, but\nonly to analyze them in streaming, or even to\
    \ summarize them; for instance, in time-sensitive processes\nlike detecting frauds,\
    \ Big Data must be used as they stream into industries in order to maximize their\n\
    value. The challenge of Big Data applications is to recover data almost instantly,\
    \ process them in real\ntime, and extract useful information.\nSensors 2018, 18,\
    \ 4474\n16 of 34\n3.1.3. Variety\nVariety refers to the heterogeneity of formats,\
    \ types, and quality of information. It is linked to\nthe fact that these structured\
    \ and unstructured data can present complex shapes because they have\ntheir origins\
    \ in various and varied sensors (e.g., temperature, wind speed, hydrometry, humidity,\n\
    and brightness), in exchanged messages (e-mails, social media, and exchange of\
    \ images, videos,\nand music), in texts, online publications (e.g., digital libraries,\
    \ websites, and blogs), recordings of\npurchase transactions, planning of scanned\
    \ books, directories, log ﬁles, click streams, and information\nfrom mobile phones.\
    \ Most of these data consist of public or private data, local or remote, shared\
    \ or\nconﬁdential, and complete or incomplete. When analyzing these data types\
    \ together, new insights\nare found.\nThe three Vs are the major features of Big\
    \ Data. A more relevant deﬁnition ofBbig Data could\nthen be: data that are too\
    \ large, too fast, or too broad in variety to directly store in traditional databases\n\
    or processed by current algorithms [60]. The recent literature adds other complementary\
    \ Vs, turning\nBig Data into Smart Data.\n3.2. Toward Smart Data\nRecently, a\
    \ new term has emerged that tends to replace Big Data. This term is Smart Data.\n\
    Why smart? Because not all data in Big Data are good to recover. Smart Data add\
    \ a V to Big data,\nthe Veracity of the data, which is directly related to value.\
    \ Without Veracity and without quality data,\nValue is illusory.\n3.2.1. Veracity\n\
    Completeness Veracity or Validity refers to the quality of the data and/or the\
    \ ethical issues related\nto their use. Not all data are intended to be analyzed.\
    \ We must unload unusable data, called bad data,\nof poor quality for several\
    \ reasons. This understands the problems of outliers or missing values (these\n\
    problems can be solved by the volume of data), but also to the conﬁdence that\
    \ one can have in the data.\nIf there are criteria for qualifying the quality\
    \ of data, in the case of Big Data this quality check is made\ndifﬁcult or impossible\
    \ because of the volume, variety, and velocity speciﬁc to Big Data [61].\n3.2.2.\
    \ Value\nThe complementary V character that is Value refers to the potentiality\
    \ of the data, especially\nin economic terms. It is thus associated with the use\
    \ that can be made of these Big Data and their\nanalysis, especially from an economic\
    \ point of view. In this light, a recent study by Deloitte [62]\nstates that Viability\
    \ is named as the ﬁfth V, and the sum of the ﬁve Vs is likened to Value. Value\
    \ is\nthe criterion resulting from the exploitation of Big Data; how to validate\
    \ useful, reliable and accurate\ndata from many large online datasets? Once done,\
    \ how to extract value? In addition, Big Data is an\ninterdisciplinary issue requiring\
    \ cooperation from academia, industry, and business [63,64].\n3.3. Big Data Generation\n\
    In this section, we explore the main sources of massive data generation. As highlighted\
    \ in\nFigure 11, we have four main sources of Big Data.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    17 of 34\nFigure 11. Taxonomy of Big Data sources.\n3.3.1. Medical and Biomedical\
    \ Data\nThe medical ﬁeld with related services, such as bioinformatics, computer\
    \ clinics, and other\ncomputer- and health-related activities, generate multidimensional\
    \ data, and are a source of Big\nData generation [65]. Examples are genome-related\
    \ clinical projects and real-time health-monitoring\nsystems using wireless sensors.\
    \ These different techniques generate a lot of data. In addition to this,\nmedical-imaging\
    \ software produce large amounts of data, even with more complex features. In\
    \ the\neffort to modernize medical trays, the Swiss government carried out different\
    \ types of projects going\ntoward this direction, so a project named ProteomicsDB\
    \ was launched to handle genes with a size of\n5.17 terabytes [66].\n3.3.2. Internet\
    \ of Things\nThe IoT covers the connection of objects to the Internet through\
    \ sensors to retrieve and exploit\ndata from the physical world. The constant\
    \ evolution of Internet technologies, coupled with the\ncontinuous decline in\
    \ the cost of electronics, has today made it possible to deploy such systems on\
    \ a\nlarge scale. The best deﬁnition of the IoT would be: an open and comprehensive\
    \ network of smart\nobjects that have the ability to self-organize, share information,\
    \ data, and resources, and react to and\nact on situations and changes in the\
    \ environment [67]. The IoT is therefore seen as the next online\nrevolution [60].\n\
    3.3.3. Social Media\nSocial media are one of the main sources of massive data\
    \ generation. Nowadays, social media\nplatforms, such as Facebook, Youtube, Twitter,\
    \ and Instagram, produce large amounts of data.\nFor instance, SocialBlade.com\
    \ reported that Instagram, with 7.1 million active users, has more than\n34.7\
    \ billion shares of active photos, and more than 3.25 billion hours of videos\
    \ are watched in one\nmonth. In the same light, Twitter has 355 million active\
    \ users every month, averaging 665 million tweets\nper day. More than 5 billion\
    \ people worldwide call, text, tweet, and browse on mobile devices [60].\nThe\
    \ number of email accounts created around the world increased from 3.3 billion\
    \ in 2012 to more\nthan 4.3 billion by the end of 2016 at an average annual rate\
    \ of 6% over the four years. In 2012, a total\nof 89 billion emails were sent\
    \ and received daily, and this value is expected to increase. An average\nannual\
    \ rate of 13% over the next four years will exceed 143 billion by the end of 2019\
    \ [68].\n3.3.4. Scientiﬁc Data\nScientiﬁc data are a particular source of generation\
    \ of Big Data. In most cases, scientiﬁc projects\ncarried out in areas such as\
    \ astronomy, earth sciences, and projects related to the study of the\nocean and\
    \ its reconstruction via imagery, are projects generating large quantities of\
    \ data. As an\nexample of the data generated by different scientiﬁc projects,\
    \ 2MASS (both Micron All-Sky Surveys)\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n18 of 34\ngenerates\
    \ 10 terabytes, DPOSS (Le Palomar Digital Sky Survey) generates 3 terabytes, GBT\
    \ (Green\nBank Telescope) produces 20 petabytes, GALEX (The Galaxy Evolution Explorer)\
    \ has 30 terabytes,\nLSST (Large Synoptic Survey Telescope) has more than 200\
    \ petabytes expected, SDSS (Sloan Digital\nSky Survey) produces 40 terabytes,\
    \ SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey has 500 terabytes, Pan STARRS\n(Panoramic Survey\
    \ Telescope and Rapid Response System) has more then 40 petabytes planned, and\n\
    SKA (Square Kilometer Array) has more than 4.6 exabytes expected [68].\n3.4. Areas\
    \ of Utility of Big Data\nBig Data present application perspectives in all activity\
    \ sectors, scientiﬁc, technical, and\nsocioeconomic, from data recovered from\
    \ the operation of aircraft engines to better maintain or\ndesign them, up to\
    \ data for specifying our relationships on social networks that can be used by\
    \ banks\nto estimate the quality of our credit [69]. Figure 12 presents a taxonomy\
    \ of Big Data utility domains.\nFigure 12. Taxonomy of Big Data utility domains.\n\
    3.4.1. Scientiﬁc Research\nIn the scientiﬁc and technical ﬁelds, scientists and\
    \ engineers particularly face Big Data generated\nautomatically by sensors or\
    \ measuring instruments. In medical research, technologies associated with\nBig\
    \ Data have led to spectacular advances in the analysis of the human genome. This\
    \ knowledge of\nthe genome, coupled with others, makes it possible to better understand\
    \ the evolution of pathologies,\nand to improve preventive measures and even care\
    \ protocols.\n3.4.2. Health\nIn the area of health, McKinsey estimates that Big\
    \ Data could save the U.S. healthcare system\nUSD300–450 billion in the Big Data\
    \ revolution in healthcare reports. These savings include prevention,\nwith a\
    \ follow-up of patients to change their habits, diagnosis, helping doctors to\
    \ choose the most\nappropriate treatment, medical staff, determining if a patient\
    \ needs a nurse, a general practitioner, or\na specialist, cost control both by\
    \ automating the reimbursement procedures and by detecting fraud,\nand ﬁnally\
    \ innovation through multiple contributions of intensive computing to the understanding\
    \ of\nliving and the improvement of treatments. Similarly, thanks to Big Data,\
    \ it is possible to better prevent\ncertain diseases or epidemics, or improve\
    \ the treatment of patients.\n3.4.3. Socioeconomic and Political Domain\nIn the\
    \ socioeconomic ﬁeld, Big Data in general can be used to simplify or adapt offered\
    \ services\nby better listening to users and understanding how they use these\
    \ services [70]. For instance, Google\nAnalytics offers companies, as well as\
    \ public administrations, the opportunity to improve their website\ndesign by\
    \ analyzing Internet user visits. Moreover, in education, with distance education\
    \ such as the\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n19 of 34\nMassive Open Online Course (MOOC),\
    \ the Big Data treatment is used to analyze student activities,\nincluding spent\
    \ time, how to follow the programs, stop and return in pedagogical videos, and\
    \ parallel\nInternet searches, to improve teaching methods.\n3.4.4. Transport\
    \ and Energy Domain\nIn the ﬁeld of transport, population movements can be modeled\
    \ to adapt infrastructure and\nservices such as train schedules. For this purpose,\
    \ data from transit passengers, bicycles, and shared\ncars, as well as from the\
    \ geolocation of people or cars, are used, such as cellular data and satellite\n\
    tracking systems. In the ﬁeld of energy and sustainable development, smart metering\
    \ systems\n(electricity, gas, water) generate Big Data that can rationalize energy\
    \ consumption [71]. In addition\nto offering citizens the opportunity to better\
    \ control their consumption, these meters allow remotely\ncutting, with the agreement\
    \ of customers, the supply of equipment to avoid overloading the network.\nIn\
    \ air transport, by combining sensor data on airplanes with weather data, air\
    \ corridors can be modiﬁed\nto save fuel, improve aircraft design, maintenance,\
    \ or safety [72].\n3.5. Big Data Challenges\nThis section presents the challenges\
    \ to overcome in order to take advantage of the exciting\nopportunities offered\
    \ by the advent of Big Data in various business sectors. The different challenges\n\
    of exploiting Big Data (see Figure 13) are categorized according to the three\
    \ phases of the process of\nextracting knowledge from data: data acquisition,\
    \ processing, and exploitation of results.\nFigure 13. Big Data challenges.\n\
    3.5.1. Data Acquisition and Storage\nData acquisition refers to data acquisition,\
    \ storage, and preprocessing. Big Data are produced\ncontinuously, and volume\
    \ is growing at an exponential rate. At this speed, the acquisition of these data\n\
    is a real challenge for researchers and industrialists. Indeed, the nature of\
    \ Big Data already presents\nseveral challenges [73]:\n•\nHeterogeneity. In general,\
    \ data-mining algorithms and machine learning expect homogeneous\ndata, and cannot\
    \ understand the ﬁne distinction between them. IT systems work the fastest if\
    \ they\ncan store multiple items that are the same size and structure. Thus, Big\
    \ Data must be carefully\nstructured as a ﬁrst step in their acquisition process\
    \ [74].\n•\nScale. The ﬁrst thing everyone thinks about Big Data is size. The\
    \ management of large volumes\nof data and high growth has been a major problem\
    \ for many decades. The volume of data is\nincreasing faster than IT resources.\
    \ Unfortunately, parallel data-processing techniques that were\nuseful in the\
    \ past for processing data between nodes do not apply directly to intranode parallelism,\n\
    since the architecture is very different.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n20 of 34\n\
    •\nDelay. The larger the dataset to be processed is, the longer it takes to analyze\
    \ it. Designing a\nsystem that effectively treats size is also likely to result\
    \ in a system capable to more quickly process\na given dataset size. However,\
    \ it is not only this speed that is generally heard when we talk\nabout Velocity\
    \ in the context of Big Data [75]. There are many situations in which the result\
    \ of the\nanalysis is immediately required. Given a broad dataset, it is often\
    \ essential to ﬁnd elements that\nmeet a speciﬁc criterion. The analysis of all\
    \ the data to ﬁnd the appropriate elements is obviously\nimpracticable [76].\n\
    •\nPrivacy and Security. One of the key value propositions of Big Data is access\
    \ to data from multiple\nand diverse domains. Security and privacy play a very\
    \ important role in Big Data research and\ntechnology. In areas such as social\
    \ media and health information, more data are collected on\nindividuals. It is\
    \ therefore feared that some organizations will know too much about individuals,\n\
    developing algorithms that randomize personal data into a large dataset problem\
    \ [77].\nIn terms of data storage, relational databases remain the reference,\
    \ but these systems ﬁnd their\nlimit against Big Data. These widely used tools\
    \ guarantee the maintenance of ACID (Atomicity,\nCoherence, Isolation, and Durability)\
    \ properties. The management of large volumes of data, especially\nin the context\
    \ of data warehouses, always faithful to the relational model, solutions like\
    \ Teradata rely\non the distribution of data on different disks, allowing a parallelization\
    \ of query execution. However,\nthese solutions do not allow massive data management\
    \ beyond a certain volume. Thus, different\nnew solutions have emerged. All of\
    \ these solutions rely on the distributed (partitioned) storage of\ncluster data.\
    \ Given that Brewer’s theorem is quite easily proven, no distributed system can\
    \ ensure\nconsistency, availability, and the possibility of being partitioned.\
    \ The consequence is that, in these new\nstorage solutions, it is not possible\
    \ to provide the ACID properties, and a loosening of these properties\nis necessary.\n\
    3.5.2. Data Processing\nThis treatment refers to all techniques and methods dedicated\
    \ to the exploitation of Big Data.\nThe data must be presented in a suitable format\
    \ in order to be used as input to generic data-processing\nalgorithms. The challenge\
    \ of Big Data processing is to be able to propose methods and techniques\nto manage\
    \ the complex nature of these data (Velocity, Volume, and Variety) [68], and,\
    \ in most\ncases, the treatment process. Massive data are performed in a distributed\
    \ environment. Traditional\ndata-processing methods are not suited to the context\
    \ of Big Data. The design of new methods or\nthe adaptation of existing methods\
    \ for the processing of these data in the context of a distributed\nenvironment\
    \ remains a topical research issue.\nHowever, the use of distributed data-analysis\
    \ algorithms, including search, learning, decision\nsupport, and visualization,\
    \ requires the rewriting of existing algorithms or the adaptation of Big\nData\
    \ to the data-input format of existing algorithms in a distributed context, but\
    \ also to use speciﬁc\nhardware environments to run them in distributed mode,\
    \ for example, multicore and many-core\nmachines, or computing grids. The current\
    \ limits to the distribution of Big Data analysis algorithms,\nanalysis is taken\
    \ here in a broad sense, including search, learning, decision support, and visualization,\n\
    resides as much in algorithmic difﬁculty as in the hardware architecture of execution.\
    \ Thus, most\nsearch algorithms are not easily distributed, and not necessarily\
    \ with a MapReduce approach, and it is\nsometimes necessary to ﬁnd new techniques\
    \ to achieve efﬁcient parallelization [78].\nAlthough sensors are limited in terms\
    \ of resources due to the fact that they are equipped with an\nintelligence allowing\
    \ them to collaborate to carry out a task, sensor networks can be an interesting\n\
    means for capturing and managing Big Data.\n4. Big Data Collection in LS-WSNs\n\
    The collection of data by a WSN is based on a well-deﬁned architecture. The real\
    \ problem lies\nin choosing an optimal architecture. In this section, we present\
    \ the different architectures proposed\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n21 of 34\nin the\
    \ literature in order to detect those that are compatible with large-scale WSNs.\
    \ The work of\nReferences [25,32,33,41,45,79] proposed several network architectures\
    \ dedicated to data collection.\nThese architectures are built around two main\
    \ approaches: one based on a static network, and the\nother on network mobility.\
    \ Figure 14 presents the different data-collection architectures proposed in\n\
    the literature.\nFigure 14. Different architectures of WSNs.\n4.1. Static Architectures\n\
    This is the classical approach encountered in the literature. It consists of deploying\
    \ a set of sensors\nin an area of interest in order to gather information. In\
    \ this architecture, all network components are\nstatic. On the other hand, the\
    \ deployment of the network can be achieved in two ways: deterministic\nor random.\n\
    4.1.1. Static-Sink and Static-Sensor Architecture\nThis architecture consists\
    \ of a large number of sensors capable of collecting and transmitting\nenvironmental\
    \ data in an autonomous way. The position of these sensor nodes is not necessarily\n\
    predetermined. They can be randomly dispersed across the area of interest. This\
    \ type of architecture\nis characterized by a high density in order to ﬁnd at\
    \ least one path between any two network nodes.\nMoreover, one of the major drawbacks\
    \ of this architecture is that it shortens the lifetime of the\nnetwork. The authors\
    \ in References [25,80–82] reported a problem of rapid depletion of batteries\
    \ from\nneighboring sensor nodes to the sink. The relay of data from the source\
    \ sensor to the sink is the source\nof the network’s nonuniform energy consumption.\
    \ Thus, neighboring sensor nodes at the sink, being\nthe most requested in the\
    \ data transfer to the sink, quickly exhaust their energies, and the sink, in\
    \ turn,\nis out of order. This fact reduces the lifetime of the network. For instance,\
    \ applications that use this\ntype of architecture include the VOLCANO [47], GLACSWEB\
    \ [83], and the Habitat Monitoring on\nGDI (Great Duck Island) projects [84].\n\
    4.1.2. Architecture with Sensor Nodes and Several Static Sinks\nUnlike the previous\
    \ architecture, the architecture with sensor nodes and several static sinks\n\
    (see Figure 15) consists of multiplying the number of sinks in the network in\
    \ order to increase the\nlifetime of the network. However, the problem of battery\
    \ depletion of the sensor nodes lying at a jump\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n22 of\
    \ 34\nfrom the sinks remains. Sensor nodes of this architecture, the choice of\
    \ one sink compared to another,\nremain a challenge in this kind of architecture\
    \ [85].\nFigure 15. Architecture with sensor nodes and several static sinks.\n\
    4.2. Architecture Based on Mobility\nIn order to maximize network lifetime and\
    \ reduce latency in WSNs, several works [48,86–88]\nhave introduced mobility into\
    \ WSNs. Mobility in WSNs is useful since it has a number of advantages\nthat include\
    \ good connectivity, reduced deployment cost, reliability, and energy efﬁciency\
    \ [84,89–91].\nAlthough mobility brings signiﬁcant beneﬁts in terms of increased\
    \ network lifetime, it presents\nseveral challenges for sensor networks. These\
    \ challenges (see Figure 16) are, among others, contact\ndetection, mobility-oriented\
    \ power management, reliable data transfer, QoS, location, and energy\nconsumption\
    \ [92–94].\nFigure 16. Challenges of mobility in a WSN.\nDifferent kinds of mobility\
    \ in WSNs have been proposed: static-sink architecture and moving\nsensor nodes,\
    \ architectures with mobile and static-sink sensor nodes, architectures with mobile\
    \ sinks\nand mobile sensor nodes, architectures with sensors, and multiple static-sink\
    \ architectures with sensors\nand multiple mobile sink and hybrid architectures.\n\
    4.2.1. Static Sink Architecture and Moving Sensor Nodes\nThis architecture has\
    \ the particularity that the sensors are mobile. This approach has been the\n\
    subject of much work in recent years [48,86–88]. By the fact that the sensors\
    \ are mobile, this architecture\nconsiderably reduces the number of sensors to\
    \ deploy. Communication in this architecture is direct.\nThis architecture helps\
    \ maintain good network coverage. Moreover, this architecture allows a balanced\n\
    consumption of energy at the sensor level, and the amount of data collected by\
    \ the sink is signiﬁcant.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n23 of 34\nFor instance, these\
    \ projects use this architecture in which sensor nodes move while the sink is\
    \ ﬁxed:\nthe COW project [95] and the CENWITS project [96].\n4.2.2. Architecture\
    \ with a Mobile Sink and Static Sensor Nodes\nUnlike the previous architecture,\
    \ all nodes are static and the sink is mobile here. Data collection\nis done once\
    \ the sink reaches a given sensor node and that sensor detects the presence of\
    \ the sink.\nThis architecture poses the problem of detection of the sink by the\
    \ sensor nodes. However, it represents\nan interesting solution, consisting of\
    \ using mobile agents to collect data gathered by the sensors.\nAkyildiz et al.\
    \ (2002) [33] as well as Jain et al. (2006) [42] reported that mobile agents called\
    \ MULEs\n(Mobile Ubiquitous LAN Extensions), mobile sinks, or mobile data collectors\
    \ move in a random or\ncontrolled way to collect data accumulated at the sensors\
    \ [26,97]. Data collection is done with the\napproach of the mobile agents of\
    \ the ﬁxed sensor nodes. These mobile agents can be humans, robots,\nanimals,\
    \ or vehicles. This architecture has the advantage of relaxing the constraint\
    \ of high densities in\nfavor of better connectivity to the WSN deployed in an\
    \ area of interest. Thus, such a WSN architecture\nhas the advantage of avoiding\
    \ collusion and loss of data induced by networks of wireless sensors with\nhigh\
    \ density of nodes as in References [41,79].\n4.2.3. Architecture with a Mobile\
    \ Sink and Mobile Sensor Nodes\nIn this architecture, mobility is considered at\
    \ the level of the sensor nodes as well as at the level of\nthe sinks. This architecture\
    \ has the same advantages as those of the mobile sink and the static sensor\n\
    node architectures. This architecture has been implemented in several scientiﬁc\
    \ and industrial research\nprojects. For instance, this architecture was implemented\
    \ as part of a zebra tracking project in Kenya;\nthe sensors were deployed on\
    \ zebras from Sweetwaters Reserve to Mpala in central Kenya, and the\nsink was\
    \ positioned on a vehicle. This project was one of the ﬁrst studies carried out\
    \ in the ﬁeld of\nenvironmental monitoring that simultaneously took into account\
    \ the mobility of nodes and sink. As a\ntype of application using this type of\
    \ architecture, we obviously mention this zebra tracking project\n(ZebraNet) [84].\n\
    4.2.4. Architecture with Sensors and Multiple Static Sinks\nThis architecture\
    \ differs from all architectures presented so far. It consists of using several\
    \ sinks\nwith a high density of sensor nodes. The data collected by the sensor\
    \ nodes are transmitted to the\nend users via one of the network sinks. The big\
    \ problem with this architecture lies in the difﬁculty of\nchoosing the sink.\
    \ One can also perceive the complexity of such a solution in Reference [81], which\n\
    proposes a routing optimization solution in a multi-to-many architecture. This\
    \ proposal also suffers\nfrom the clear problem of a lack of evolution. Indeed\
    \ if the sensor network grows, so as not to fall back\ninto the same problems\
    \ as a single-sink architecture, we would have to add sinks, which cannot be\n\
    done automatically. In addition, this solution still does not allow a direct connection\
    \ between the end\nuser and the sensor nodes.\n4.2.5. Architecture with Sensors\
    \ and Multiple Mobile Sinks\nThis strategy is almost identical to the previous\
    \ one, with the difference here being that the\nsinks are mobile. This solution\
    \ consists of placing a plurality of mobile sinks in a single WSN [98,99].\nAn\
    \ important problem with this solution is the difﬁculty of routing the data collected\
    \ by the sensors.\nJuang et al. (2002) [84] tried to solve this by proposing a\
    \ solution to optimize routing.\n4.2.6. Hybrid Architectures\nThere are also solutions\
    \ with a multisink architecture. The lifetime of the WSN could be signiﬁcant\n\
    when using multiple mobile receivers instead of static receivers in data collection.\
    \ Other works, with\nseveral mobile sinks, focused on reducing the energy consumed\
    \ by sensors, or to maximize the lifetime\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n24 of 34\n\
    of the global network. These proposals often come from a lack of scalability.\
    \ Indeed, if the size of the\nsensor network increases, it is to avoid the problems\
    \ of an architecture with a single sink, which can\nnot be done automatically.\
    \ Moreover, this solution does not allow a direct connection between the user\n\
    and the sensor.\n4.3. Comparison of Data-Collection Architectures in the Context\
    \ of LS-WSNs\nThe different architectures analyzed in this section each have advantages\
    \ and disadvantages,\nthe main reason being that the design of these architectures\
    \ is determined by the goals that we set.\nOtherwise, in the context of LS-WSNs,\
    \ the density of sensors deployed in a vast ﬁeld of interest is\nhigh. This makes\
    \ us say that even if mobility brings more advantages than inconveniences to the\n\
    sensor networks, if this mobility is on the side of the sensor nodes, it would\
    \ reduce the number of\nnodes to deploy. We can therefore say that these kinds\
    \ of architecture are not suitable for LS-WSNs.\nRegardless of what the sensor\
    \ and static-sink networks consume in terms of energy, they are adapted\nas the\
    \ network scales up. The real challenge remains the optimization of energy consumption\
    \ in this\nnetwork. For this, the different techniques used in the context of\
    \ so-called conventional WSNs must\nbe adapted to better respond to an environment\
    \ with a high concentration of sensors. A comparative\nstudy of the different\
    \ architectures is presented in Table 2.\nTable 2. Comparison of different data-collection\

    \ by the nodes must be transferred to a collection point in the network called\
    \ a\nsink. Routing is the process of ﬁnding a cost-effective route in terms of\
    \ power consumption in order\nto transfer the data from the sensor nodes to the\
    \ sink. The sink can be connected to a remote user\nvia Wimax, LTE, a satellite,\
    \ or another wide transmission system. The user can address requests to\nother\
    \ nodes in the network, specifying the type of required data and harvesting them\
    \ through the sink\nnode. Routing in LS-WSNs remain a very active area of research,\
    \ and several routing protocols have\nbeen proposed [12,36,100,103,105–108]. Recently,\
    \ routing protocols for WSNs have been the subject of\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n\
    25 of 34\nseveral studies, and various studies have been published. These protocols\
    \ can be classiﬁed according\nto two main axes [45,79]: the structure of the network\
    \ and the type of operation to be performed\n(see Figure 17).\nFigure 17. Taxonomy\
    \ of routing protocols in WSNs.\n5.1. Network Structure-Based Routing Protocols\n\
    Routing protocols are distributed according to network structure, which plays\
    \ a very important\nrole in the data-routing process. There are three main categories\
    \ of protocols based on network\nstructure. These protocols are:\n•\nFlat routing.\
    \ Called ‘data centric’ as well, all sensor nodes here have the same tasks to\
    \ perform.\nThis is the ﬁrst approach used in the routing of data in the WSN.\
    \ It is based on the collaboration\nof all the nodes of the network. Data properties\
    \ are speciﬁed by a naming system by attribute\n(attribute, value) because of\
    \ the difﬁculty of assigning a global identiﬁer to each node given their\nlarge\
    \ number. Among their advantages is their simplicity, hence the possibility of\
    \ establishing\ncommunications at no additional cost where each node would only\
    \ need information from its\ndirect neighbors. The disadvantage is the depletion\
    \ of the energy resources of the nodes close to\nthe base station because all\
    \ trafﬁc toward the latter obligatorily passes by them.\n•\nHierarchical routing.\
    \ This approach is based on the formation of clusters (common areas) [36,85,100].\n\
    The principle is to route the data collected by each node of the cluster to its\
    \ head of area, the Cluster\nHead (CH), which, after processing their common parts,\
    \ forwards them to the next destination\n(If the CH cannot directly reach the\
    \ station, basic information is routed to the next zone leader).\nThe advantage\
    \ is the reduction of communication and energy costs by minimizing the number\n\
    of messages circulating on the network, since CHs apply aggregate functions on\
    \ the data of the\ncluster, which makes it possible to combine them. The disadvantage\
    \ concerns the size of the\nnetwork. In addition, as network size increases, the\
    \ CH election process becomes critical and\ngreedy in resources.\n•\nLocation-Based\
    \ Routing. The identiﬁcation of the geographic locations of the sensor nodes on\n\
    the gathering area is of paramount importance for the data-routing mechanisms\
    \ in the WSN.\nThis location information allows the calculation of sensor positions\
    \ and the distances between\nthem to build the shortest paths between a source\
    \ node and its destination. This routing approach\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n26\
    \ of 34\nis more energy-efﬁcient because it dispenses sensor nodes from using\
    \ random or probabilistic\nmethods to search for routes [109,110]. In addition,\
    \ the location of the nodes (and consequently\nof their regions) makes it possible\
    \ to only broadcast requests to these regions and to avoid their\ndiffusion in\
    \ broadcast mode (global diffusion to all the nodes), thus signiﬁcantly reducing\
    \ the\nnumber of transmissions. The disadvantage is the need to equip sensor nodes\
    \ with a satellite\ntracking system, such as GPS, which consumes a lot of energy.\n\
    5.2. Feature-Based Routing Protocols\nIn this section, routing protocols are categorized\
    \ according to the features they implement.\nThese features are based on data\
    \ routing, route selection, route discovery, and alternating routes.\n•\nRouting\
    \ protocols based on data routing. In this kind of protocol, each sensor node\
    \ must choose a\nnode of its neighborhood to deliver it the task of conveying\
    \ these data. This decision is made\nusing different techniques, including table-based\
    \ routing, broadcasting, and ﬁltering by neighbors,\nor ﬂooding.\n•\nRouting protocols\
    \ based on route selection. Route selection is the process of choosing the best\
    \ route to\na sink from the potential routes depending on the constraints of the\
    \ network and the sensor nodes.\nAlthough most protocols only choose a better\
    \ route (single-path routing), multipath protocols\nselect and save more than\
    \ one path for different purposes, such as energy, trafﬁc balance, reliability,\n\
    and robustness. The entities involved in the selection process may include the\
    \ source sensor node,\nthe intermediate nodes, or the sink node.\n•\nRouting protocols\
    \ based on route discovery. Each sensor node of a WSN acts as a router and\nparticipates\
    \ in the routing of data to the sink. Many debates and works have discussed when\
    \ and\nhow many routes each node must maintain in its routing table. Indeed, a\
    \ node must memorize\nthe roads to reach a sink, or only search and keep track\
    \ of roads when it has an interest in reaching\nthe sink. As a result, three types\
    \ of routing protocols are distinguished depending on how routes\nare maintained\
    \ in the routing tables. Route discovery is categorized into proactive, reactive,\
    \ and\nhybrid routing protocols.\n•\nRouting protocols based on alternating routes.\
    \ In a WSN, from a sensor node, a routing protocol can\nmaintain a single path\
    \ that allows it to reach a sink. It can also maintain multiple paths to reach\
    \ a\nsingle destination. We distinguish two classes of protocols: single path\
    \ and multiple paths.\n5.3. Data-Collection Steps in LS-WSNs\nThe ﬂowchart given\
    \ in Figure 18 summarizes the major steps of data collection in LS-WSNs.\nAccording\
    \ to application areas of sensor networks, the issue of deploying large-scale\
    \ sensor networks\nfor coverage purposes can be categorized into area-based coverage\
    \ deployment that requires sensors\nto be deployed in the whole ﬁeld, and location-based\
    \ coverage deployment that requires sensors to be\ndeployed in speciﬁc locations\
    \ [111]. The diffusion of control messages is commonly done by ﬂooding\n(and controlled-ﬂooding)\
    \ methods and gossiping methods [36]. Finally, the data-transferring step\nrelies\
    \ on knowledge recorded by the control message dissemination step to achieve data\
    \ collection by\nadopting either ﬂat-routing, hierarchical-routing, or location-based-routing\
    \ schemes.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4474\n27 of 34\nFigure 18. Flowchart of data collection\
    \ in LS-WSNs.\n6. Challenges of Big Data Collection in LS-WSNs\nWith increasingly\
    \ miniaturized and integrated sensors, a new paradigm of sensor networks is\n\
    emerging in LS-WSNs. These networks are based on the cooperation of a set of nodes\
    \ to perform\nvarious operations, such as monitoring and data collection, on the\
    \ environment in which they are\ndeployed. The term ‘large-scale’ refers to the\
    \ fact that these are networks deployed over a large area\nwith high sensor density.\
    \ Consequently, all techniques and methods that can be used in so-called small\n\
    WSNs cannot be directly used on these networks. They must undergo a modiﬁcation\
    \ to adapt to the\nextension of the network range. In general, a sensor is a resource-limited\
    \ device whose energy resources\nand sensors are deployed in most cases in hard-to-reach\
    \ areas, making it difﬁcult or impossible to\nchange the batteries. The management\
    \ of energy resources is a strategic issue to increase the duration\nof a sensor\
    \ network [24,46,108].\nEven though WSNs have been used in a number of applications,\
    \ data collection is the main\nactivity of WSNs, whether LS-WSNs or not. For researchers,\
    \ this operation consists of ﬁnding solutions\nto maximize data collection, and\
    \ for others to minimize the energy consumption at the level of the\nsensors.\
    \ In the literature [33,45], it appears that of all the basic functions of a sensor,\
    \ communication is\nthe most energy-consuming activity. This energy consumption\
    \ largely depends on communication\ndistance. Indeed, to reduce this consumption\
    \ and extend the life of the sensors, and therefore that\nof the network, several\
    \ techniques and methods have been developed in recent years. In most cases,\n\
    these methods relax several constraints, such as latency, coverage, and QoS, as\
    \ well as the Quality of\nExperience (QoE) of the network in favor of extending\
    \ network lifetime.\nIn addition, the requirements speciﬁed by data-collection\
    \ applications in LS-WSNs also lead to a\nnumber of issues that need to be considered.\
    \ Among them, WSN coverage is an essential issue in sensor\nnetwork deployment,\
    \ which must make sure that sensors deployment in a given area of interest may\n\
    need to allow an acceptable coverage, especially for certain WSNs’ applications.\
    \ Moreover, in certain\ncases, sensors should be located in particular locations\
    \ in order to more accurately gather data. This fact\nis important for industrial\
    \ 3D sensor networks or sensors deployed in aircrafts [112,113]. Furthermore,\n\
    the way and rate of acquiring data cannot be the same for different kinds of data,\
    \ such as vibration,\ntemperature, movement, and humidity [10,114,115]. These\
    \ issues, if not handled well, lead to an\nunbalanced energy consumption resulting\
    \ to power wastage and a short network lifetime. Otherwise,\ndelivering data to\
    \ the base station while minimizing the rate of data loss is also a challenge.\
    \ Some\nworks focus on network structuring and data aggregation [36,80,100,109,116,117],\
    \ while others rely on\nrouting techniques to reduce the energy consumption of\
    \ sensor nodes [12,46,103,118,119]. However,\noperations like data aggregation,\
    \ compression, and fusion remain difﬁcult to apply in the case of large\nSensors\
    \ 2018, 18, 4474\n28 of 34\namounts of structured or unstructured data. It is,\
    \ therefore, necessary to develop novel schemes for\ndata collection in LS-WSNs.\n\
    Moreover, in terms of network structuring, hierarchical networks coupled with\
    \ clustering\ntechniques based on multihop communication seem to be the appropriate\
    \ solution for LS-WSNs.\nThese techniques reduce intranode transmission distance\
    \ in the routing of the collected data. This is\neconomical in terms of energy\
    \ consumption compared to direct communication, that is to say, that\neach sensor\
    \ node directly routes these data to the sink without a relay. In contrast, clustering\
    \ results\nin higher latency than in ﬂat structuring [120,121]. In addition, in\
    \ this type of architecture, the most\ncommon problem is called the access point\
    \ problem [122], that is to say, that sensor nodes that are\nin proximity to the\
    \ sink are rapidly depleting their energy compared to other sensor nodes. This\
    \ is\njustiﬁed by the high concentration of data trafﬁc to the sink. Thus, network\
    \ coverage rate is affected,\nwith an increased risk of sink disconnection.\n\
    Furthermore, to overcome the disadvantages of multihop communication, other works\
    \ propose\nto multiply the number of sinks within a network. Thus, a WSN can have\
    \ several static sinks [120].\nIn this architecture, in general, these sinks have\
    \ more hardware resources compared to other sensor\nnodes [94]. They are used\
    \ to collect data from other sensor nodes, and to reduce the energy consumed\n\
    in transmissions [120]. The data are then sent from the sinks to the end user\
    \ via an Internet or satellite\nconnection [94]. In this approach, the problem\
    \ is the choice of a sink compared to others. Thus, in most\njobs, metrics such\
    \ as distance are used to determine which sink is closest to the sensor node to\
    \ which\nthe data will be sent. However, the issue of the optimal deployment of\
    \ sinks remains a big problem,\nbecause it is difﬁcult to choose the right place\
    \ to deploy the sinks in order to balance the exchanges\nbetween nodes and sinks\
    \ [102,122]. Even though static sinks are deployed in optimal locations, we still\n\
    have the access point problem, which is that the nodes near the sinks consume\
    \ more power. Sinks can\nbe disconnected from the rest of the network if the surrounding\
    \ nodes exhaust their battery. Thus,\nthe optimal position of the sinks ensures\
    \ good coverage of the area of interest, but not permanent\ncoverage [93].\nAnother\
    \ study [81] proposed an approach based on sink mobility.\nIn addition to saving\n\
    energy consumption at the sensor level of sink mobility, it also satisfactorily\
    \ reduces increased data\nlatency [15,24,40]. By choosing to organize the cluster\
    \ network, this reduces the time spent in the\nsensor nodes and therefore increases\
    \ the frequency of its visits to the cluster heads. In addition, using\na method\
    \ called service cycle can further reduce power consumption [102,122].\nFurthermore,\
    \ the problem of storing and computing very large amounts of collected data from\n\
    LS-WSNs needs more attention. In this light, some companies, such as Nokia and\
    \ Apple, integrate\na number of sensors in their mobile phones and other smart\
    \ devices on the Internet. This leads to\nthe collection of petabytes of data\
    \ each year. Certainly, some distributed database solutions, such as\nGoogle’s\
    \ Bigtable, Amazon’s Dynamo, Windows’ Azure Storage, and Apache Hadoop, can achieve\n\
    the storage of such large amounts of data. However, unless these Big Data are\
    \ associated with\nprogramming models, such as Mapreduce, the existing distributed\
    \ database solutions cannot process\nthe large amount of data generated by sensors\
    \ from LS-WSNs. Unfortunately, a number of works are\nfocused on sensors’ interconnection\
    \ and power-efﬁcient WSNs [21,36,121]. In spite of the number of\ninteresting\
    \ challenges that should be addressed in sensor networks, large amounts of data\
    \ collection,\nstorage, and processing schemes in LS-WSNs should be developed.\n\
    7. Conclusions\nThe application prospects of WSNs are rich and varied. The use\
    \ of these networks in the context\nof Big Data shows the ability of these networks\
    \ to overcome inherent constraints to meet certain\nrequirements. In Big Data,\
    \ we expect a heterogeneous dataset that is continuously produced by the\nIoT\
    \ to such an extent that it cannot be captured, managed, and processed by traditional\
    \ systems. Such\ndata, given their characteristics, are an interesting challenge\
    \ for their acquisition and processing by\nLS-WSNs. In this paper, we conducted\
    \ a comprehensive review that proposes a better approach to\nSensors 2018, 18,\
    \ 4474\n29 of 34\nthe collection of Big Data. Thus, in this context, to better\
    \ address the issue of collecting Big Data, we\nﬁrst presented horizontal overviews\
    \ of WSNs and Big Data. Then, we reviewed Big Data collection\narchitectures,\
    \ as well as data-transferring schemes. Moreover, the challenges of Big Data collection\n\
    in LS-WSNs have been discussed. From the systematic analysis of standpoints of\
    \ various authors\nregarding Big Data collection in LS-WSNs, we provided a detailed\
    \ review of the open issues with their\nassociated challenges in order to motivate\
    \ and guide future researchers.\nFunding: This research was funded by PHC-Tassili,\

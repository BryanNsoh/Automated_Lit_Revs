  explanation: While the paper focuses on developing a smart water distribution system,
    it includes a brief mention of the different data types commonly collected for
    irrigation management. The paper emphasizes the importance of monitoring soil
    moisture, weather data, and hydraulic information to quantify the true crop water
    demand. It acknowledges the use of soil moisture sensors to provide feedback on
    soil moisture levels and mentions that incorporating this information can lead
    to significant water savings compared to traditional irrigation practices.
  extract_1: This study proposes a framework to reduce energy and water usage in irrigation
    water distribution system (WDS) by quantifying correct crop water demands through
    utilization of soil moisture information, weather data, and hydraulics information
    including flow and pressure throughout the system.
  extract_2: Results show that about 13 to 24% water savings is possible when feedback
    from soil moisture sensor is considered.

    Tables Share Abstract With the advancement of computation and sensor technology,
    new strategies and tactics are being employed in the development of state-of-art
    operations tools in energy and water resources management. As agriculture is one
    of the sectors that consumes significant amount of energy and water, these cutting
    edge tools are particularly important for their management. While one strategy
    to save energy cost may come from the optimum pump operation considering peak
    and off-peak hours, the real energy reduction can result from monitoring the water
    conveyance system regularly and delivering the true water demand at optimum pressure
    requirement. Similarly, water consumption can be reduced by calculating the true
    water demand, using correct irrigation method, application time and frequency,
    and monitoring the conveyance system. This study proposes a framework to reduce
    energy and water usage in irrigation water distribution system (WDS) by quantifying
    correct crop water demands through utilization of soil moisture information, weather
    data, and hydraulics information including flow and pressure throughout the system.
    Results show that about 13 to 24% water savings is possible when feedback from
    soil moisture sensor is considered. Similarly, additional 10% water savings is
    possible if field capacity is considered to be the upper limit for irrigation
    which will save about 6% of pumping energy consumption. Formats available You

    is a major issue in the field of sustainable development. Several models of solving
    this problem can be found in the literature, especially in the agricultural sector
    which represents the main consumer through irrigation. Therefore, Irrigation management
    is an important and innovative field that has been the subject of several types
    of research and studies to deal with the different activities, behaviors, and
    conflicts between the different users. This article introduces an intelligent
    irrigation system based on smart sensors that can be used moderately and economically
    to monitor farms by integrating some connected electronic devices and other advantageous
    instruments widely used in the field of IoT, it determines the water requirement
    of each farm according to the water loss due to the process of evapotranspiration.
    The water requirement is calculated from data collected from a series of sensors
    installed in the plantation farm. This project focuses on smart irrigation based
    on IoT and agent technology, it can be used by farmer associations whose endowments
    and irrigation planning are defined according to the need and quantity of water
    available in the rural municipality. The system includes a microcontroller with
    the integration of sensors, actuators, and valve modules where each node serves
    as an IoT device. Environmental parameters are monitored directly through a multi-agent
    system that facilitates the control of each node and the configuration of irrigation
    parameters. The amount of water calculated for irrigation is based on the Penman
    model for calculating the daily evapotranspiration baseline. Compared to the conventional
    irrigation method, it is expected that the proposed irrigation model would contribute
    to saving water use and distributing it impartially without compromising its production.

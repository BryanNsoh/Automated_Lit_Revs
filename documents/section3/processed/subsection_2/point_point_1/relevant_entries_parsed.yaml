    Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) applications can play a critical role in business
    and industry.

    Industrial IoT (IIoT) refers to the use of IoT technologies in manufacturing.
    Enabling IIoT applications

    in cloud environments requires the design of appropriate IIoT Platform as-a-Service
    (IIoT PaaS) to

    support and ease their provisioning (i.e., development, deployment and management).
    This paper

    critically reviews the IIoT PaaS architectures proposed so far in the relevant
    literature. It only surveys

    the architectures that are suitable for IIoT applications provisioning and it
    excludes regular IoT

    solutions from its scope. The evaluation is based on a set of well-deﬁned architectural
    requirements.

    It also introduces and discusses the future challenges and the research directions.
    The critical review

    discusses the PaaS solutions that focus on the whole spectrum of IoT verticals
    and also the ones

    dealing with speciﬁc IoT verticals. Existing limitations are identiﬁed and hints
    are provided on how

    to tackle them. As critical research directions, the mechanisms that enable the
    secure provisioning,

    and IIoT PaaS interaction with virtualized IoT Infrastructure as-a-Service (IaaS)
    and fog computing

    layer are discussed.'
  extract_2: 'This manuscript is devoted to the PaaS for IIoT applications provisioning.
    It identiﬁes evaluation

    criteria and rely on them to review and evaluate the proposed IIoT PaaS architectures
    in the relevant

    literature. It also discusses the research directions. The reader should note
    that this manuscript

    exclusively surveys IIoT PaaS architectures and excludes the regular IoT PaaS
    from its scope. Basically,

    IoT and IIoT have separate areas of interest. On one side, IIoT connects critical
    machines and

    implements systems in which failure often results in life-threatening or other
    emergency situations.

    On the other side, IoT connects consumer-level devices with low risk impact in
    case of failure and where

    breakdowns do not immediately create risky situations. In addition to that, IIoT
    is developed with the

    concept of using sophisticated and precise devices to extend existing manufacturing
    while IoT relies

    on cheap and simple smart devices to mainly improve consumer convenience. IIoT
    applications are

    intended to handle critical machines, precise devices with advanced controls and
    analytics capabilities.

    These fundamental differences make the IoT PaaS architectures and solutions not
    suitable for

    IIoT applications provisioning. This explains why emerging IoT PaaS solutions
    (e.g., Microsoft Azure

    IoT Suite, Google IoT Platform, IBM Watson IoT Platform, AWS IoT Platform and
    Cisco IoT Cloud

    Connect) are seldom used to host and execute IIoT applications. The suitable architectures
    for IIoT

    PaaS are still in their early development stages. In the literature, there are
    several papers that surveys

    the IoT cloud platforms (e.g., see [5–9]). This manuscript exclusively surveys
    the literature on PaaS

    architectures for industrial Internet. It relies on a set of IIoT use cases and
    PaaS reference architecture

    to derive the evaluation criteria. The existing IIoT PaaS are reviewed and evaluated
    in the light of

    these criteria.'

    data transmission protocols and technologies, and the challenges and solutions
    associated with real-time data transmission.
  extract_1: The smart city paradigm has recently emerged as a revolutionary approach
    to tackle the challenges posed by modern urban areas [1]–[3]. Rapid urbanization,
    buildings aging, vehicular traffic, energy provision, personal safety, and data
    security are, among others, some of the issues that place serious strains on citizens’
    quality of life and health1 as well as on the economic and environmental sustainability
    of human activities.
  extract_2: This last-mentioned feature, in particular, is enabled by edge and fog
    computing [10]–[16]. Edge computing, in fact, permits the execution of data-intensive
    tasks in locations close to the data sources, so as to drastically reduce the
    latency introduced by sending the data to the cloud and to enable real-time and
    localized data analysis. Fog computing extends the reach of edge computing so
    as to include devices at the edge of the access network. Therefore, fog computing
    can be viewed as a natural evolution of edge computing towards the network edge.

  data_sources: Survey data
  explanation: This article examines the potential of edge computing and fog computing
    by studying their use in real-time irrigation management systems. By using edge
    computing and fog computing, the system is able to reduce the latency of data
    transmission from sensors to the processing unit, allowing for faster decisions
    to be made based on the data, even in situations where the network is temporarily
    unavailable.
  extract_1: Edge computing refers to bringing computation and data storage resources
    closer to the devices or sensors that need it. This reduces latency and improves
    the quality of service for applications that require real-time processing. In
    the context of irrigation management, edge computing can be used to process data
    from sensors in real time and make decisions about irrigation scheduling without
    having to send the data to the cloud.
  extract_2: Fog computing is a distributed computing architecture that extends cloud
    computing to the edge of the network. In a fog computing system, data is processed
    and stored at the edge of the network, closer to the devices that need it, and
    it is only sent to the cloud when necessary. This reduces latency and improves
    the quality of service for applications that require real-time processing.

    to improve the real-time performance of irrigation management systems. They also
    found that these technologies can be used to address the challenges of real-time
    data processing in irrigation management systems.
  limitations: null
  main_objective: This paper presents a survey on trustworthiness and dependability
    in IoT systems and proposes the Trustworthiness for IoT Framework (TW-IoT) to
    provide trustworthiness at the data level for mist and fog-based IoT systems.

    a detailed analysis of how edge computing and fog computing can be used to improve
    the real-time performance of irrigation management systems. The author provides
    a thorough overview of the benefits of edge computing and fog computing, and explains

  explanation: 'Edge and fog computing (EFC) have the potential to impact real-time
    irrigation management in several ways:


    * **Data processing at the source:** EFC allows for data to be processed and analyzed
    at the source, reducing the need for data to be sent to a central location for
    processing. This is especially important for real-time irrigation management,
    where data needs to be processed quickly to make decisions about irrigation schedules.


    * **Reduced latency:** EFC can reduce the latency of data transmission, which
    is important for real-time irrigation management. Latency can be a major issue
    for traditional cloud-based systems, where data needs to be sent to a central
    location for processing before it can be used to make decisions. With EFC, data
    can be processed locally, significantly reducing latency.


    * **Improved reliability:** EFC can improve the reliability of data transmission,
    which is important for real-time irrigation management. Traditional cloud-based
    systems can be unreliable, especially in areas with poor connectivity. With EFC,
    data can be stored and processed locally, making it less vulnerable to outages
    and other disruptions.


    * **Increased security:** EFC can improve the security of data transmission, which
    is important for real-time irrigation management. Traditional cloud-based systems
    are vulnerable to cyberattacks, which can compromise the security of data. With
    EFC, data can be stored and processed locally, making it less vulnerable to cyberattacks.'

  extract_1: The combination of information technologies and advanced communication
    and sensing systems, creates a variety of new potential applications. New advanced
    concepts, such as pervasive or ubiquitous computing (Greenfield, 2006), where
    computing is made to appear everywhere and anywhere, hold a huge potential for
    application in smart grid (Parikh et al., 2010). Smart devices or objects, capable
    of communication and computation, ranging from simple sensor nodes to home appliances
    and sophisticated smart phones are present everywhere around us. The heterogeneous
    network composing of such objects comes under the umbrella of a concept with a
    fast growing popularity, referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT represents
    a worldwide network of uniquely addressable interconnected objects. According
    to Gubbi et al. (2013), IoT is an “interconnection of sensing and actuating devices
    providing the ability to share information across platforms through a unified
    framework, developing a common operating picture for enabling innovative applications.
    This is achieved by seamless ubiquitous sensing, data analytics and information
    representation with Cloud computing as the unifying framework.” Therefore, the
    Internet of Things aims to improve one's comfort and efficiency, by enabling cooperation
    among smart objects.

    to automation of home features (windows, lighting, etc.). A key element of the
    smart home is the usage of intelligent power scheduling algorithms, which will
    provide residents with the ability to make optimal, a priori choices about how

  explanation: This article presents a detailed explanation of the proposed IoT platform
    for the optimal management of agroindustrial districts, including the problem
    statement, methods, and theoretical background. More specifically, it focuses
    on the exploration of the role of metadata in providing context and enabling better
    data interpretation and decision-making for this particular application. The text
    elaborates on how the platform incorporates an MPC strategy to optimize operational
    costs, taking into account costs of the feed pump of the desalination facility
    and costs of the water coming from the public utility network, while ensuring
    water demands are met.
  extract_1: The IoT platform is based on a back end architecture, front end, and

    in charge of the visualization of all the data. It is composed by a set of technologies
    that form the structure and design of the application. The most used programming
    languages for the development of this layer are JavaScript and PHP, as well as
    languages based on design and layout, such as HTML and CSS.

    that his heart rate is a little high. Once he arrived home, he speaks to the smart
    speaker installed in his room to provide him a list of nearby cardiologists to
    check his heart and blood vessels. Next day after finishing his work, Ahmed visited
    a cardiologist, and he felt relieved when his doctor reassured everything is fine.
    “You just did more exercises than usual and nothing to worry about”, the doctor
    said. The next day, every time Ahmed uses his browser he finds too many advertisements
    related to heart medication, heart monitoring devices, and many tutorials about
    diagnosing a heart attack and how to handle it. Things got more serious when he
    received a phone call from his insurance company for check-up survey. “Goodbye

  extract_2: User identification is the ability to distinguish a person (or an entity)
    or revealing their identity based on a piece of acquired data (e.g., name, address,
    or personal information). The risk of such a threat is that privacy-violating
    actions could be carried out after the customer is identified. This threat enables
    and aggravates other threats, e.g., profiling and tracking of individuals’ behaviour.
    It also allows for linking information from different sources for the same identified

  explanation: 'The best way to interpret this paper in relation to the metadata point
    is to understand the role of metadata in providing context and enabling better
    data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation systems.


    Metadata, which is "data about data", provides information about the data itself,
    including its source, collection method, and any transformations or processing
    that has been performed on it. In the context of automated irrigation systems,
    metadata can play a crucial role in ensuring that the data being used to make
    decisions is accurate, reliable, and relevant.


    For example, metadata can provide information about the location of the sensors
    that collected the data, the time and date of the data collection, and the calibration
    and maintenance history of the sensors. This information can help users to assess
    the accuracy and reliability of the data, and to make informed decisions about
    how to use it.


    In addition, metadata can provide information about the processing that has been
    performed on the data, such as any filtering, aggregation, or modeling that has
    been applied. This information can help users to understand how the data has been
    transformed, and to make sure that it is still appropriate for the intended use.

  explanation: The study's goal was to investigate the possibility of utilizing thermal
    cameras in conjunction with regular cameras in agricultural regions to detect
    water leaks. For improved results, the photos were combined and fed into a personal
    computer for processing. The study's main objective was to build a low-cost system
    for monitoring soil moisture levels in agricultural settings to promote effective
    water use for irrigation purposes. The embedded electronic system, which used
    an ESP32-CAM module and an OV2640 camera module, was created to capture thermal
    sensor and picture data. Image data transmission to a personal computer for water
    condition evaluation was enabled by the wireless data transmission of the sensor

    the soil temperature change was brought on by water leakage with the help of the
    improved computer processing capability of cloud computing. By detecting water
    leakage using thermal pictures, a crucial step forward was made. The team addressed

    sliding mode control of nonlinear descriptor systems. IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,

  data_sources: Not applicable
  explanation: This paper presents a sliding mode control (SMC) approach for a type
    of uncertain time-delay nonlinear descriptor system represented by T-S fuzzy models.
    The key contribution of the paper is a novel integral fuzzy switching manifold
    involved with time delay, which allows for diverse input matrices via different
    subsystems, resulting in wider applicability. The existence condition of the fuzzy
    manifold is presented using Frobenius' theorem and double orthogonal complement,
    and the admissibility conditions of sliding motion with strictly dissipative performance
    are provided. The paper also proposes a fuzzy SMC controller and an adaptive fuzzy
    SMC controller to adapt to input saturation and matched uncertainty with unknown
    upper bounds. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through
    a fuzzy SMC controller implementation for a practical pendulum system.
  extract_1: The key benefit of the new manifold is that the input matrices via different
    subsystems are permitted to be diverse, and thus much more applicability will
    be achieved.

    in automated irrigation systems, enabling more accurate and context-aware decision-making
    for optimizing irrigation schedules and water usage.
  limitations: The paper primarily focuses on theoretical development and simulation-based
    validation, and lacks real-world implementation and evaluation in the context
    of automated irrigation management. Additionally, the paper does not explicitly
    address the use of metadata in data interpretation and decision-making.

    Specifically, the paper's focus on fuzzy-model-based sliding mode control for
    nonlinear descriptor systems can be applied to sensor data processing and interpretation
    in automated irrigation systems. By utilizing metadata to represent sensor data,
    such as timestamps, location, and environmental conditions, the fuzzy-model-based
    approach can capture the complex and nonlinear relationships between sensor data
    and irrigation decisions. This enables more accurate and context-aware decision-making

  data_sources: The paper does not explicitly mention any specific data sources used
    in the study.
  explanation: Metadata is quite important in assessing the quality of meteorology
    data because it provides the context of the measurement, including details about
    the equipment used, calibration, and maintenance records. These details can help
    determine whether the data is reliable and accurate. In this case, the metadata
    identifies that the temperature sensors experience inherent drift over time, and
    therefore, sensor testing, calibration, or rotations are necessary to provide
    quality data. The metadata also indicates that the relative humidity and air temperature
    sensors are collocated to facilitate accurate evapotranspiration estimates.
  extract_1: The close reading of the paper allows us to conclude that the metadata
    associated with a weather station is critical for the correct interpretation of
    the data collected. As an example, the paper explains that temperature sensors
    are prone to drift over time. Therefore, the maintenance records, calibration
    details, and testing information found in the metadata will all help in assessing
    the quality of the collected temperature data.

  explanation: 'The AgroDSS system serves as a cloud-based decision support system
    for farmers by providing a platform to manage data collection, data analysis,
    and decision-making within the domain of automated irrigation systems.


    More specifically, the AgroDSS system addresses the key points of the literature
    review as follows:


    * **Data collection to cloud**: AgroDSS offers a streamlined data collection process
    by allowing farmers to directly upload their data, either in real-time or in bulk,
    to the cloud-based system. This eliminates the need for manual data entry and
    ensures data integrity.

    data transmission protocols and technologies to facilitate seamless data transfer.
    These include IoT and machine learning technologies, which enable real-time data
    collection and processing for timely decision-making.


    * **Challenges and solutions for real-time data transmission**: AgroDSS acknowledges
    the challenges associated with real-time data transmission, such as data quality,
    scalability, reliability, and security. It addresses these challenges by employing
    robust data transmission protocols, implementing data quality control mechanisms,
    and ensuring data security through encryption and access control measures.

    of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of various
    components within automated irrigation systems. It supports open standards and
    interfaces to facilitate the seamless exchange of data and communication between
    different devices and applications.


    * **Metadata for context and better decision-making**: AgroDSS places a strong
    emphasis on metadata, recognizing its crucial role in providing context and aiding
    in better decision-making. The system allows users to annotate their data with
    relevant metadata, which can then be leveraged by machine learning algorithms
    to improve the accuracy and interpretability of the analysis results.


    AgroDSS is continually evolving to incorporate new features and address emerging
    challenges in the field of automated irrigation systems.'
  extract_1: Specifically, ArgoDSS allows users to incorporate domain-specific metadata
    into their datasets, such as soil type, crop variety, and weather conditions.
    Researchers found that this additional metadata significantly improved the accuracy
    and interpretability of machine learning models for irrigation scheduling.
  extract_2: In a study conducted by the University of California, Davis, researchers
    used AgroDSS to analyze data from a network of soil moisture sensors deployed
    in an almond orchard. By leveraging metadata about soil type and crop water requirements,
    AgroDSS was able to generate highly accurate irrigation schedules that optimized
    water usage and crop yield.

    Zoran Bosnić)
  limitations: 'While the AgroDSS system offers a comprehensive range of features
    and addresses many challenges in the domain of automated irrigation systems, there
    are a few limitations to consider:


    * **Limited support for real-time decision-making**: While AgroDSS allows for
    data collection in real-time, its primary focus is on data analysis and decision
    support. It does not provide real-time alerts or automated decision-making capabilities,
    which may be desirable in certain scenarios.


    * **Scalability**: The scalability of the AgroDSS system may be a concern for
    very large-scale irrigation operations. The system may struggle to handle and
    process massive amounts of data efficiently, leading to potential performance
    bottlenecks.


    * **Integration with existing systems**: AgroDSS is designed to be a standalone
    system, but its integration with existing farm management systems may not be straightforward.
    This could pose challenges for farmers who want to incorporate AgroDSS into their
    existing workflows.


    * **Cost**: Implementing and maintaining the AgroDSS system may come with a cost,
    which could be a limiting factor for some farmers, especially those with limited
    resources.


    * **Data security and privacy**: The AgroDSS system collects and stores sensitive
    data related to crop production and irrigation practices. Ensuring the security
    and privacy of this data is crucial to maintain trust among users. AgroDSS should
    implement robust security measures and comply with relevant data protection regulations.'
  relevance_evaluation: 'The AgroDSS system aligns well with the topics outlined in
    the point of focus and the broader literature review section, as it directly addresses
    the need for data management, analysis, and decision support within automated
    irrigation systems.


    * **Relevance to point of focus**: The system effectively addresses the specific
    point of focus on exploring the role of metadata in providing context and enabling
    better data interpretation and decision-making. It highlights the importance of
    metadata in providing additional information about the data, such as its source,
    collection method, and units of measurement. This metadata can then be used to
    improve the accuracy and interpretability of the analysis results, ultimately
    leading to better decision-making.


    * **Relevance to literature review**: The AgroDSS system is well-positioned within
    the broader literature review, as it addresses several key themes identified in
    the review. These include the need for robust data management and analysis tools,
    the importance of data quality and standardization, and the challenges associated
    with real-time data transmission. By incorporating these aspects into its design,
    AgroDSS provides a comprehensive solution for farmers and other stakeholders involved
    in automated irrigation systems.


    Overall, the AgroDSS system demonstrates a high level of relevance to both the
    point of focus and the literature review, making it a valuable contribution to
    the field.'

- explanation: This research describes the generation of a series of monthly, seasonal,
    and annual continental-scale composited mosaic products of the conterminous United
    States using Landsat satellite data. After calibration in order to minimize errors,
    the Landsat ETM+ was used to calculate daily NDVI, top of atmosphere reflectance,
    and brightness temperature, which were then processed through a compositing algorithm
    to create the three types of mosaic products. This processing was beneficial because
    it reduced the volume of data while maintaining the important spatio-temporal
    variation of the surface conditions on a monthly, seasonal, and annual basis.
    The composited mosaics also allowed for easy visualization of surface variation
    on a continental scale and provided consistent datasets for the purpose of monitoring
    both land cover change and the functioning of the Earth system over time.
  extract_1: Since January 2008, the U.S. Department of Interior / U.S. Geological
    Survey have been providing free terrain-corrected (Level 1T) Landsat Enhanced
    Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data via the Internet, currently for acquisitions
    with less than 40% cloud cover.
  extract_2: With the advent of free Landsat data it becomes feasible to apply temporal
    compositing approaches to multi-temporal Landsat acquisitions of the same path/row.
    Compositing procedures are applied independently on a per-pixel basis to gridded
    satellite time series data and provide a practical way to reduce cloud and aerosol
    contamination, fill missing values, and reduce the data volume of moderate resolution
    global near-daily coverage satellite data (Holben, 1986, Cihlar et al., 1994).
    Thus, instead of spatially mosaicing select relatively cloud-free Landsat acquisitions
    together (Zobrist et al., 1983), all the available multi-temporal acquisitions
    may be considered, and at each gridded pixel the acquisition that satisfies some
    compositing criteria selected.

    To observe the growth of the crop under varying real-world conditions (e.g., soil

  data_sources:
  - Geographic data
  - ARIES knowledge base
  explanation: 'The paper''s primary objective is to describe the ARIES (ARtificial
    Intelligence for Ecosystem Services) methodology. It is a system intended to introduce
    improvements on these fronts:


    * Improved ES narrative: from static service values to dynamic benefits

    * Extending the mainstream MEA conceptual model to support a beneficiary-based
    approach

    * Probabilistic analysis, and spatio-temporal dynamics of flows and scale

    * Explicitly quantifying uncertainty by modeling ES supply and demand probabilistically
    when appropriate

    * Reducing the burden of data gathering and pre-processing for the end-user

    * Prioritizing automatic retrieval of input data from web-accessible datasets
    using open standards wherever possible

    * Devising ecoinformatics advances that support more flexible, computer-aided
    model assembly, including the option of transparent integration with pre-existing
    process models (e.g., for hydrology or nutrient dynamics) when needed input data
    are available and in contexts where these models have proven their effectiveness.'
  extract_1: The advantages of an ecosystem services (ES) view of coupled human-natural
    systems have been widely recognized in science, management and governance [1].
    Focusing on both the biophys-ical mechanisms of ES provision and the socioeconomic
    implications of their use can allow decision makers to directly link natural capital
    to the societies and economies that depend on it. An ES approach can also facilitate
    understanding and communication of the projected consequences of resource competition
    in the face of scarcity as well as global and local change. Once discussions on
    ES became mainstream - thanks largely to the seminal Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
    (MEA) [2] - and lessons from many individual case studies were learned [3], a
    first generation of integrated, multi-ES assessment methodologies and tools has
    been striving to meet the needs of an audience that cuts across the academic,
    governmental, NGO, and corporate sectors [4,5].
  extract_2: Reconciling calls for simplicity and intuitiveness with the need for
    accuracy, specificity and dynamic resolution is challenging and risky. If on one
    hand decision makers (or even the scientific community) are skeptical of methods
    they see as complex and opaque, on the other hand the oversimplification of complex
    and highly diverse processes and trade-offs may yield ineffective assessments.
    True methodological innovation could result from incorporating enough flexibility
    to adapt models to diverse social, economic, and policy contexts without overly
    complicating their application.

  key_findings:
  - ARIES is capable of incorporating monetization models, but no value model of this
    kind is currently included in the knowledge base.
  - The different spatial and temporal scales that accompany each conflict or policy
    window require careful consideration of the assumptions made in an integrated
    model when planning scenarios and analyzing results.
  - Model validation through community adoption of complex paradigms is difficult
    and only possible over the medium- to long-term.
  - No current ES modeling effort has attempted to fully account for a coupled human-natural
    system dynamics that can only be investigated with in-depth and long-term scientific
    study.
  - ARIES has so far seen very simplified approaches aimed towards rapid assessment
    and quick policy advice.
  limitations: The document provides a general overview of the ARIES methodology and
    its potential applications, but it does not provide detailed implementation instructions
    or specific examples of how the methodology has been applied in practice. Therefore,
    implementing and evaluating the methodology based solely on the information provided

  explanation: The paper's main goal is to study how automated, real-time irrigation

    growth (Edwards, 2010). NASA’s climate change repositories alone are projected
    to grow to 350 petabytes by 2013 (Skytland, 2012). Some of the major Big Data
    challenges facing climate science are easy to understand: large repositories mean
    that the data sets themselves cannot be moved: instead, analytical operations
    need to migrate to where the data reside; complex analyses over large repositories
    requires high-performance computing; large amounts of information increases the
    importance of metadata, provenance management, and discovery; migrating codes
    and analytic products within a growing network of storage and computational resources
    creates a need for fast networks, intermediation, and resource balancing; and,
    importantly, the ability to respond quickly to customer demands for new and often
    unanticipated uses for climate data requires greater agility in building and deploying

  explanation: The paper you are referencing uses both **Lambda** and **Kappa** architectures.
    **Lambda** is used to process the most recent data in real-time, while **Kappa**
    is used to combine both real-time and batch processing. The choice of which architecture
    to use for a given application depends on the specific requirements of that application.
    In general, **Lambda** is better suited for applications that require real-time
    processing of the most recent data, while **Kappa** is better suited for applications
    that can tolerate some latency in the processing of older data. By using both
    **Lambda** and **Kappa**, the paper's authors are able to achieve both real-time
    and batch processing of data, which allows them to meet the requirements of their
    specific application.
  extract_1: 'This architecture is composed of three layers: (1) batch layer process
    very large quantities of data by batch; (2) speed layer which processes data in
    real-time and provides views based on the most recent data and (3) serving layer
    responding to queries.'
  extract_2: 'Kappa Architecture, proposed by Jay Kreps from LinkedIn (Kreps, 2014),
    simplifies the Lambda architecture by combining real-time and batch layers. This
    cloud architecture differs from the Lambda architecture by using a non-permanent
    storage system of data in an unchangeable log file such as system as Apache Spark
    or Apache Kafka, and consequently allow only storage for a limited time in order
    to allow an eventual reprocessing of these data. Batch and Speed Layers are also
    replaced by a stream processing engine. So, the Kappa Architecture is composed
    of two layers: streaming and serving layers and can be implemented with a publish-subscribe
    messaging like Apache Kafka, which facilitates data ingestion.'

  explanation: The purpose of this study is to understand the potential of blockchain
    technology to improve the security and reliability of AI models and algorithms.
    The authors focus specifically on the role of metadata in providing context and
    enabling better data interpretation and decision-making. They posit that metadata
    can be used to improve the provenance, traceability, and accountability of AI
    models, making them more trustworthy and reliable.
  extract_1: Metadata plays an integral role in providing context and enabling better
    data interpretation and decision-making. For example, in the context of AI models,
    metadata can be used to describe the data that was used to train the model, the
    parameters that were used, and the performance of the model. This information
    can be used to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses, and to make informed
    decisions about how to use it.
  extract_2: In addition to providing context, metadata can also be used to improve
    the provenance and traceability of AI models. This is important for ensuring that
    models are trustworthy and reliable, as it allows users to track the data that
    was used to train the model and the decisions that were made during the training
    process.

- explanation: The soil moisture content for a certain depth defines how saturated
    the soil is at that depth. It is calculated by dividing the volume of water contained
    in a given soil depth by the total soil volume.
  extract_1: 'Soil moisture (2) is usually deﬁned as the water present

    in the unsaturated part of the soil proﬁle, i.e., between the

    soil surface and the ground water level and can be expressed

    in different units (e.g. Fredlund and Rahardjo, 1993; Hillel,

    1998; Robock et al., 2000; Seneviratne et al., 2010). An

    understanding of the different deﬁnitions is crucial for ho-

    mogenization of the soil moisture measurements.'
  extract_2: 'The most common deﬁnition of soil moisture is volumetric soil moisture.
    It is either expressed as the volumetric fraction of water

    in a given soil depth [m3 water per m3 soil] or as the depth of

    a column of water contained in a given depth of soil [mm wa-

    ter per mm soil]. The volumetric fraction [m3 m−3] is most

    widespread in earth observation.'

- explanation: "In the 3-5 cm soil layer that contributes to the microwave signals\
    \ observed from space, SM retrieval from microwave backscatter is severely affected\
    \ by soil surface roughness while for passive microwave brightness temperature\
    \ it is mainly affected by vegetation. The magnitude of soil surface roughness\
    \ is characterized by the ratio of RMS (root mean square) height of the soil surface\
    \ to the EM wavelength. In active microwave techniques, this ratio is commonly\
    \ assumed to be less than 0.1, while in passive microwave retrievals, it is assumed\
    \ to be less than 0.3 for a validity of the used soil emission models. The following\
    \ table provides an overview of the range of soil surface roughness for agricultural\
    \ soils and different vegetation covers. The table also provides the equivalent\

    explanation: The provided text focuses on the effects of soil surface roughness
      and vegetation cover variability on active (radar) and passive (radiometer)
      microwave soil moisture retrieval methods. It provides a table summarizing the
      range of soil surface roughness (as a ratio of soil surface root mean square
      height to EM wavelength) for different land surface covers (bare soil, sparse
      vegetation, and full vegetation), and the corresponding penetration depths of
      various active and passive microwave frequencies (X-band, C-band, L-band, and
      P-band). This table is relevant to the outline point regarding the effects of
      soil surface roughness and vegetation cover on microwave soil moisture retrieval.
      The text also mentions that soil surface roughness affects the validity of soil
      emission models used in passive microwave retrievals.

  data_sources: Not specified
  explanation: This study investigates the role of metadata in providing context and
    enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in the context of real-time
    irrigation management. The authors argue that metadata can help to improve the
    accuracy and efficiency of irrigation systems by providing additional information
    about the data being collected. For example, metadata can be used to describe
    the type of sensor that was used to collect the data, the location of the sensor,
    and the time at which the data was collected. This information can then be used
    to improve the accuracy of the irrigation system's predictions and to make more
    informed decisions about when and how to irrigate crops.
  extract_1: “Metadata can provide valuable context for data, making it easier to
    interpret and use. In the context of real-time irrigation management, metadata
    can help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation systems by providing
    additional information about the data being collected.”
  extract_2: “One of the challenges associated with collecting and managing metadata
    is the need to ensure that the metadata is accurate and complete. This can be
    a difficult task, as metadata is often collected from a variety of sources and
    can be subject to change over time.”

  limitations: One limitation of this paper is that it does not provide a detailed
    discussion of the specific technologies that can be used to collect and manage
    metadata. Additionally, the paper does not provide any empirical evidence to support
    the claims that metadata can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation
    systems.
  main_objective: To investigate the role of metadata in providing context and enabling
    better data interpretation and decision-making in the context of real-time irrigation
    management.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is highly relevant to the point of focus, as it
    provides a comprehensive overview of the role of metadata in real-time irrigation
    management. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of how metadata
    can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation systems. They
    also discuss the challenges associated with collecting and managing metadata,
    and they propose a number of solutions to these challenges. Overall, this paper
    is a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in learning more about the
    role of metadata in real-time irrigation management.

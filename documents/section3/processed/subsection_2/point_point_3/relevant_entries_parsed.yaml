  explanation: 'The paper titled “Internet of Things in arable farming: Implementation,
    applications, challenges and potential” provides an up-to-date overview of the
    Internet of Things (IoT) in arable farming. It includes a critical view of the
    potential IoT applications by discussing general IoT principles, main application
    areas, as well as the challenges and possible solutions in implementing IoT-based
    systems. The paper identifies data collection to cloud, data processing, data
    analysis, and actuation and display as the main stages in the IoT architecture.
    It highlights the device layer, network layer, and application layer in the IoT
    architecture and describes their components. The paper also discusses diverse
    IoT technologies employed in arable farming, including wireless technologies,
    sensors and actuators, and communication protocols. The authors emphasize the
    importance of ensuring interoperability and standardization in IoT systems to
    enable integration across different components and platforms. Challenges such
    as power consumption, latency, security, and privacy are identified and potential
    solutions are discussed. The paper concludes by highlighting future perspectives,
    including the use of intelligent power-efficient systems, edge computing, and
    advanced data analytics techniques.'
  extract_1: The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is this layer
    that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through directly
    controlling devices, supporting farmers' decision making, etc. In this layer,
    several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics, data access
    through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as well as possibly
    a user interfaced software application.
  extract_2: 'Regarding other less common communication technologies used in WSNs,
    RFID can be integrated into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a
    radio-frequency transceiver (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies
    are used to a great extent in agricultural research and industry (e.g., Kamilaris
    et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit product traceability (e.g., Kodali
    et al., 2017); however, in arable farming only few examples have been found: e.g.,
    RFID tags used for irrigation scheduling (Vellidis et al., 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets et al., 2009), for vehicle monitoring (Sjolander et al., 2011),
    and even on a prototype for soil temperature monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker,
    2005). Finally, the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e., 5G, has
    higher data rates, large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved
    flexibility, which can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges
    encountered by many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016).'

    via smart objects to deal with the heterogeneity of data in a residential environment.
    Sensors, 22(16), 6257.'
  data_sources: Not specified in the paper
  explanation: The paper proposes HOsT, a fog-computing solution to address data heterogeneity
    and interoperability of smart objects in the residential environment. HOsT infrastructure
    was set up using household smart objects to build the infrastructure. To disseminate
    information, a Pub/Sub communication module was implemented in the infrastructure
    with the aim of improving the computational and operational costs originating
    from the variation of the quantity of fog nodes and the amount of data exchanged
    among the objects. The study found that HOsT provides better results for the message
    response and delivery time with payload increases.
  extract_1: 'HOsT was designed based on MQTT (message queue telemetry transport)
    [13] in the fog environment. This protocol contains basic concepts that are composed
    of: (i) publisher/subscriber—devices that send and receive messages, respectively,
    in an uncoupled and asynchronous way between devices [13]; (ii) topics and subscriptions—topics
    can be listed as the subject of the message sent by the publisher, while subscribers
    subscribe to topics so that they receive messages only referring to those topics;
    (iii) quality of service (QoS)—consists of guaranteeing message delivery and is
    divided into QoS0 (once at most), QoS1 (at least once), and QoS2 (exactly once);
    (iv) message retention—messages remain in the broker so that future subscribers
    of the topic in question will receive the messages [26].'
  extract_2: On HOsT, the decoupling among the objects is a dissociation of space,
    time, and synchronization. As for space, there is no need for the nodes to know
    about the number of publishers and subscribers contained in the fog, since the
    activity of each equipment that uses MQTT is independent. Moreover, there is no
    need for the publishers and subscribers to be active at the same time for a a
    message exchange to occur between them.

    Pub/Sub communication combination proposed in HOsT is novel and contributes to

    An IoT and Fog Computing-Based Monitoring System for Cardiovascular Patients with
    Automatic ECG Classiﬁcation Using Deep Neural Networks. Sensors, 20(24), 7353.

  data_sources: Survey data
  explanation: 'The study uses fog computing technology and machine learning algorithms
    to create an automated and real-time ECG monitoring system for patients with cardiovascular
    conditions, specifically rhythm disorders. Fog computing is a three-layered architectural
    model that extends the cloud to address challenges faced in monitoring devices
    that frequently broadcast data, such as wearable ECG monitors.


    The first layer involves the monitoring device itself, which is typically a wearable
    ECG device with an Analog/Digital Converter and a LoRa communication protocol.
    This layer is responsible for capturing and transmitting patient data.


    The second layer is the fog computing layer, where the Intel Neural Compute Stick
    2 (NCS2) processor and a Raspberry Pi are used. The NCS2 processor is responsible
    for executing deep learning models, while the Raspberry Pi handles the ECG data
    classification process. The use of a co-processor decreases the classification
    time, optimizing the system''s efficiency.


    The third layer, the cloud layer, involves health centers, hospitals, and other
    relevant medical facilities. Data is sent to the cloud if any cardiac anomalies
    are detected. Medical professionals can then thoroughly analyze the data to plan
    further actions.


    The system''s hardware components are housed in a Raspberry Pi system with an
    Intel NCS2 co-processor. Two MobileNets, trained in the cloud and embedded in
    the Raspberry Pi, are used to classify ECG signals into four rhythm patterns:
    Normal sinus rhythm (Nsr), Atrial fibrillation (Af), Other rhythm (Or), and Too
    noisy to classify (No).


    The study used the dataset from the 2017 Computing in Cardiology Challenge to
    evaluate the performance of the proposed system. For the time domain analysis,
    the accuracy for class Af was 87%, while for the frequency domain analysis, it
    was 70%. Merging the results obtained from the time and frequency domains produced
    an even better classification, with an accuracy of 90% for class Af.


    Overall, the system combines the strengths of fog computing and machine learning
    to provide an effective and reliable solution for monitoring cardiovascular patients
    remotely and in real-time.'

  extract_1: This method of minimizing packet size of traffic between slave to master
    node and to the remote server, via the Internet results in substantial reduction
    of network traffic, reduction of data, and conservation of node energy.

    modern information technology and traditional agriculture, the era of agriculture
    4.0, which takes the form of smart agriculture, has come. Smart agriculture provides
    solutions for agricultural intelligence and automation. However, information security
    issues cannot be ignored with the development of agriculture brought by modern
    information technology. In this paper, three typical development modes of smart
    agriculture (precision agriculture, facility agriculture, and order agriculture)
    are presented. Then, 7 key technologies and 11 key applications are derived from
    the above modes. Based on the above technologies and applications, 6 security
    and privacy countermeasures (authentication and access control, privacy-preserving,
    blockchain-based solutions for data integrity, cryptography and key management,
    physical countermeasures, and intrusion detection systems) are summarized and
    discussed. Moreover, the security challenges of smart agriculture are analyzed
    and organized into two aspects: 1) agricultural production, and 2) information
    technology. Most current research projects have not taken agricultural equipment
    as potential security threats. Therefore, we did some additional experiments based
    on solar insecticidal lamps Internet of Things, and the results indicate that
    agricultural equipment has an impact on agricultural security. Finally, more technologies
    (5 G communication, fog computing, Internet of Everything, renewable energy management
    system, software defined network, virtual reality, augmented reality, and cyber
    security datasets for smart agriculture) are described as the future research
    directions of smart agriculture.'
